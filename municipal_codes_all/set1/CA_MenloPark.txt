"Public Project" means any of the following: (1) construction, reconstruction, erection, alteration, renovation, improvement, demolition, and repair work involving any publicly owned, leased, or operated facility; or (2) painting or repainting of any publicly owned, leased, or operated facility. A Public Project does not include Maintenance Work.

"Purchasing Agent" means the City Manager and his/her designee. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.030 Purchasing policies, procedures, limits and functions.
The City Manager shall recommend and the City Council shall approve policies and procedures necessary to implement a purchasing system compliant with Section 2.42.010, which will include the necessary assignment of duties in order to carry out those policies and procedures. Those policies and procedures shall include dollar limits associated with the purchase of goods, supplies and services, professional services agreements, and Public Projects. Such dollar limits shall be reviewed and modified based upon City Council resolution on a periodic basis as determined by the City Manager. In accordance with the adopted policies and procedures, the purchasing agent is authorized pursuant to the authority granted by this Chapter to:

A.    Purchase or contract for supplies, services, equipment and public projects required by City departments;

B.    Negotiate and recommend execution of contracts for the purchase of supplies, services, equipment, and public projects;

C.    Comply with the requirements of the California Public Contracts Code, including the provisions of the Uniform Cost Accounting Act (California Public Contract Code Section 22000 et seq.) for competitive bidding of public projects;

D.    Prescribe and maintain forms required by this Chapter;

E.    Supervise the inspection of all supplies and equipment purchased to ensure conformance with contract documents;

Purchases of supplies, materials, equipment and services of any amount greater than the minimum amount established in the City’s purchasing policy shall be made only by purchase orders. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.050 Emergency purchases.
When repairs or replacements are necessary in an emergency, the City Council, by a four-fifths vote, declaring that the public interest and necessity demand the immediate expenditure of money to safeguard life, health or property, may proceed at once to replace or repair any public facility without adopting plans, specifications, or working details, or giving notice of bids to let contracts, and without otherwise complying with the requirements of this Chapter. For purposes of this Section the term "emergency" shall mean a sudden, unexpected occurrence that poses a clear and imminent danger, requiring immediate action to prevent or mitigate the loss or impairment of life, health, property, or essential public services. The work may be done by day labor, by contract, or by a combination of the two (2).

A.    Prior to taking such action, the City Council shall make a finding, based on substantial evidence in the minutes of its meeting, that the emergency will not permit a delay resulting from a competitive solicitation for bids, and that the action is necessary to respond to an emergency.

B.    If the City Council orders emergency action, it shall review the emergency action at its next regularly scheduled meeting and, except as specified below, at every regularly scheduled meeting thereafter until the action is terminated, to determine, by a four-fifths vote, that there is a need to continue the action.

C.    For the purposes of this Section, the City Manager is hereby delegated the authority to declare the public emergency in such circumstances when it is not feasible for the City Council to meet to do so, and take such actions as he or she deems necessary, consistent with the provisions of this Section. The City Manager’s actions shall be subject to prompt review by the City Council as to the need to continue the emergency action, in accordance with the provisions of Public Contract Code Section 22050.

D.    When the City Council reviews the emergency action, it shall terminate the action at the earliest possible date that conditions warrant so that the remainder of the action may be completed by giving notice for bids to let contracts. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.060 Purchases without bidding.
Purchases of supplies, services and equipment of an estimated value less than so stated in purchasing policy limits may be made by the purchasing authority by force account, negotiated contract or purchase order. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.070 Sole source procurement.
In those situations where the procurement of any product is obtainable only from a single or sole source, and not adaptable to competitive bidding, the purchasing agent shall negotiate with the purveyor of such equipment, product, supply or service, to the end that the City receives the desired equipment, product, supply, or service on fair and equitable terms, without observing the bidding procedures prescribed in this Chapter. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.080 Informal bidding procedure.
Purchases of supplies, services and equipment of a value less than so stated in purchasing policy limits, may be made by the purchasing agent by observing the informal bid procedure.

A.    Purchases shall, wherever possible, be based on at least three (3) bids, and shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder.

B.    The purchasing agent may solicit bids by written requests to prospective vendors, by telephone or email or by any other means deemed effective. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

All purchases of supplies, services, and equipment of an estimated value greater than the stated purchasing policy limits shall be based on competitive sealed written bids, with the lowest or highest responsible bidder as the case may be, pursuant to the procedure hereinafter prescribed. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.100 Notice inviting bids.
Notices inviting bids shall include a general description of the supplies, services, or equipment to be purchased and shall state where bid blanks and specifications may be secured and the time and place for opening bids.

A.    Notices inviting bids shall be published at least ten (10) days before the date of the opening of the bids. Notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation, published in the area of the City.

B.    The purchasing agent shall also solicit sealed bids from responsible prospective suppliers whose names are on the bidders’ list or who have made written request that their names be added thereto. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.110 Bid opening procedure.
Sealed bids shall be submitted to the City and shall be identified as "bids" on the envelope. Bids shall be opened in public at the time and place stated in the bid notice. A tabulation of all bids received shall be open for public inspection during regular business hours for a period of not less than thirty (30) calendar days after the bid opening. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.120 Bidder’s security.
When deemed necessary by purchasing agent, bidders’ security may be prescribed in the public notices inviting bids. Bidders shall be entitled to return of bid security; provided, however, that a successful bidder shall forfeit his or her bid security upon his or her refusal or failure to execute that contract within ten (10) days after the notice of award of contract has been mailed, unless in the latter event the city is solely responsible for the delay in executing the contract. The City Council, on refusal or failure of the successful bidder to execute the contract, may award it to the next lowest responsible bidder or reject all bids. If the City Council awards the contract to the next lowest responsible bidder, the amount of the lowest bidder’s security shall be applied by the City to the contract price differential between the lowest bid and the second lowest bid, and the surplus, if any, shall be returned to the lowest bidder. If the City Council rejects all bids presented and re-advertises, the amount of the lowest bidder’s security may be used to offset the cost of receiving new bids, and the surplus, if any shall be returned to the lowest bidder. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.130 Rejection of bids; award of contracts.
A.    At its discretion, the City Council or purchasing agent may reject any and all bids presented and re-advertise for bids.

B.    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, contracts shall be awarded by the City Council to the lowest responsible bidder. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.140 Tie bids.
If two (2) or more bids received are for the same total amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, and if the public interest will not permit the delay for readvertising for bids, the City Council or purchasing agent may, in its discretion, accept the bid it chooses or accept the lowest bid made after negotiation with the tie bidders. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.150 Performance bonds.
The City Council or the purchasing agent shall have authority to require a performance bond before entering a contract in such amount as it finds reasonably necessary to protect the best interest of the City. If the City Council or purchasing agent requires a performance bond, the form and the amount of the bond shall be described in the notice giving bids. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.160 Surplus supplies and equipment.
All departments shall submit to the purchasing agent, at such time and in such forms as prescribed, reports showing all supplies and equipment which are no longer used or which have become obsolete or worn out.

No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.170 Requirements for public projects.
Awarding contracts for public projects shall be in accordance with the Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act, Public Contract Code Sections 22000 et seq., or any successor provision thereto.

A.    Informal Bidding.

1.    Public projects of one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000.00) or less may be let to contract by informal procedures as set forth in this Section. This limit shall be automatically adjusted from time to time to reflect changes in the limits established by the State of California.

2.    Informal bidding shall be governed by the uniform construction cost accounting procedures set forth in Public Contract Code Section 22030 et seq., or any successor provision thereto.

3.    Contractors shall be selected to perform public projects in accordance with the provisions of Public Contract Code Section 22034(a) through (f).

a.    The City shall maintain a bidder’s list. Not less than ten (10) calendar days before bids will be due, the City will mail notices inviting informal bids to all contractors on the bidder’s list and/or all trade journals specified pursuant to Public Contract Code Section 22034(b). If there is no list of qualified contractors maintained by the city for the particular category of work to be performed, the notice inviting bids shall be sent only to the construction trade journals specified by the California Uniform Construction Cost Accounting Commission. If the product or service is proprietary in nature such that it can be obtained only from a certain contractor or contractors, the notice inviting informal bids may be sent exclusively to such contractor or contractors.

b.    Nothing herein shall prevent the city from rejecting any or all bids as permitted by law.

4.    The notice inviting informal bids shall describe the project in general terms, how to obtain more detailed information about the project, and shall state the time and place for the submission of bids.

5.    If all bids received are in excess of one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000.00), the City Council may, by adoption of a resolution by four-fifths vote, award the contract, at one hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred dollars ($137,500.00) or less, to the lowest responsible bidder, if it determines the cost estimate of the City was reasonable.

B.    Formal Bidding. Bidding on all other public projects not governed by the provisions of paragraph A. above, shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in Public Contract Code Section 22037 et seq.

1.    The purchasing agent shall authorize issuance of notices inviting formal bids which shall include a general description of the public project to be constructed, shall state where bid forms and specifications may be secured, and the time and place for opening bids.

2.    Notices inviting bids published and posted at least fourteen (14) calendar days before the date of opening the bids in a newspaper of general circulation as provided for in California Public Contract Code Section 22037.

3.    The purchasing agent may require a bid to include prices for items that may be added to, or deducted from, the scope of work in the contract for which the bid is being submitted. Whenever additive or deductive items are included in a bid, the bid solicitation shall specify which one of the following methods will be used to determine the lowest bid. In the absence of a specification, only the method provided by subsection A.3.a. of this section will be used.

a.    The lowest bid shall be the lowest bid price on the base contract without consideration of the prices on the additive or deductive items.

b.    The lowest bid shall be the lowest total of the bid prices on the base contract and those additive or deductive items that were specifically identified in the bid solicitation as being used for the purpose of determining the lowest bid price.

c.    The lowest bid shall be the lowest total of the bid prices on the base contract and those additive or deductive items that when taken in order from a specifically identified list of those items in the solicitation, and added to, or subtracted from, the base contract, are less than, or equal to, a funding amount publicly disclosed by the city before the first bid is opened.

d.    The lowest bid shall be determined in a manner that prevents any information that would identify any of the bidders or proposed subcontractors or suppliers from being revealed to the public entity before the ranking of all bidders from lowest to highest has been determined.

4.    A responsible bidder who submitted the lowest bid as determined by this section shall be awarded the contract, if it is awarded. This section does not preclude the City from adding to or deducting from the contract any of the additive or deductive items after the lowest responsible bidder has been determined.

5.    Nothing in this Section shall preclude the prequalification of general contractors or subcontractors.

6.    The purchasing agent shall also solicit sealed bids from all responsible prospective bidders whose names are on the bidders’ list or who have made written request that their names be added thereto.

7.    The purchasing agent I shall also advertise bids by a notice posted at a publicly accessible location at City offices. Such posting places can include, but shall not be limited to, electronically accessible locations such as the city’s web site or by other means that reasonably allow prospective bidders to be notified of pending purchases. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.180 Waiver of irregularity, rejection of bids, failure to receive bids, options on public projects.
A.    At its discretion, the purchasing agent may waive any irregularity in any bid received and award the contract.

B.    At its discretion, the purchasing agent may reject all bids presented. If the purchasing agent, prior to rejecting all bids, declares that the project can be more economically performed by City employees and furnishes a written notice to an apparent low bidder mailed at least two (2) business days prior to the hearing at which the City intends to reject the bid, the purchasing agent may:

1.    Abandon the project or readvertise for bids.

2.    Declare that the project can be performed more economically by City employees, and order the project done by force account.

C.    If no bids are received, the project may be performed by the city employees by force account or by negotiated contract entered into without need for further bidding. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.190 Lowest responsible bidder determination.
In determining the "lowest responsible bidder," the following factors may be considered in addition to price:

A.    The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required;

B.    The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency demonstrated in previous contracts or services for the City or other contracting parties;

C.    The quality of performance demonstrated in previous contracts or services for the City or other contracting parties;

D.    The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with the laws and ordinances relating to a contract or service;

E.    The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the services;

F.    The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.200 Change orders.
The purchasing agent is delegated authority to approve, without seeking new bids, contract change orders to public projects up to the combined amounts authorized in this ordinance so long as the combined amounts are within the approved project budget. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.210 Prohibition against splitting projects.
It shall be unlawful to split or separate any public project into smaller work orders or projects for the purpose of circumventing or evading the requirements of the Uniform Construction Cost Accounting Act or this Chapter. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

2.42.220 Affirmative action—Penalty for noncompliance.
Any contractor who is found by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a federal or state agency empowered to make such findings to be in substantial or material violation of the Fair Employment Practices Act of the state, or of similar federal law or executive order in the performance of a contract with the City, thereby shall be found in material breach of such contract; and thereupon the city shall have power to cancel or suspend the contract, in whole or in part, or to deduct from the amount payable to such contractor a sum as specified by purchasing policy for each person for each working day during which such person was discriminated against, as damages for such breach of contract, or both. (Ord. No. 962, § 2, 10-28-2008)

3.12.040 Purpose.
The City Council hereby declares that this chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other, purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:

(1)    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which complies with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code;

(2)    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code;

(3)    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State sales and use taxes;

(4)    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 550 § 1 (part), 1973).

3.12.050 Contract with state.
Prior to the operative date this city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this sales and use tax chapter; provided, that if this city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter following the adoption of the ordinance codified herein. (Ord. 550 § 1 (part), 1973).

3.12.060 Sales tax.
For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate stated in Section 3.12.020, of the gross receipts of the retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in this city on and after the operative date. (Ord. 550 § 1 (part), 1973).

For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization. (Ord. 550 § 1 (part), 1973).

(7)    Equipment leases (e.g., converters, remote devices); and

(8)    Service calls, service protection plans, name changes, changes of services, and special services.

(g)    To prevent actual multi-jurisdictional taxation of communication services subject to tax under this section, any service user, upon proof to the Tax Administrator that the service user has previously paid the same tax in another state or city on such communication services, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed to the extent of the amount of such tax legally imposed in such other state or city; provided, however, the amount of credit shall not exceed the tax owed to the city under this section.

(h)    The tax on communication services imposed by this section shall be collected from the service user by the service supplier. The amount of tax collected in one (1) month shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator, and must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the following month.

(i)    Upon a showing of hardship, the Tax Administrator may administratively delay the implementation of this section until no later than January 1, 2008. Prior to such time, the Tax Administrator may administratively permit the telecommunications tax to be applied to intrastate, interstate, and international telecommunication services in the same manner as the federal excise tax was applied to "communication services" as defined in Sections 4251 and 4252 of the Internal Revenue Code, and the IRS regulations and rulings pertaining thereto, prior to May 25, 2006, and regardless of whether charges for such services are based on time, distance, or on any other basis, and as such sections are limited by the exceptions of Sections 4252(d) and 4253.

The Tax Administrator, thereafter, may issue and disseminate to such electric service suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those components and items which are: i) necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of electric service; or, ii) currently are or historically have been included in a single or bundled rate for electric service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. Charges for such components and items shall be subject to the tax of subsection (a) of this section.

(b)    Any person that is exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall file an application with the Tax Administrator for an exemption; provided, however, this requirement shall not apply to a service user that is a state or federal agency or subdivision with a commonly recognized name. Said application shall be made upon a form approved by the Tax Administrator and shall state those facts, declared under penalty of perjury, which qualify the applicant for an exemption, and shall include the names of all utility service suppliers serving that service user. If deemed exempt by the Tax Administrator, such service user shall give the Tax Administrator timely written notice of any change in utility service suppliers so that the Tax Administrator can properly notify the new utility service supplier of the service user’s tax exempt status. A service user that fails to comply with this section shall not be entitled to a refund of utility users’ taxes collected and remitted to the Tax Administrator from such service user as a result of such non-compliance. Upon request of the Tax Administrator, a service supplier or non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent, shall provide a list of the names and addresses of those customers which, according to its billing records, are deemed exempt from the utility users’ tax.

(c)    The decision of the Tax Administrator may be appealed pursuant to Section 3.14.230 of this chapter. Filing an application with the Tax Administrator and appeal to the City Administrator pursuant to Section 3.14.230 of this chapter is a prerequisite to a suit thereon. (Ord. 950 § 1 (part), 2006).

3.14.100 Accurate jurisdictional boundaries.
The city shall make available, upon request, an accurate description of its jurisdictional boundaries based on street addresses and/or ZIP Plus Four, in an electronic format. If a service supplier relies upon such information provided by city, it shall not be responsible for any errors in taxation that may result. (Ord. 950 § 1 (part), 2006).

3.14.110 Substantial nexus/minimum contacts.
For purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax under this chapter, "substantial nexus" and "minimum contacts" shall be construed broadly in favor of the imposition, collection and/or remittance of the utility users tax to the fullest extent permitted by state and federal law, and as it may change from time to time by judicial interpretation or by statutory enactment. Any communication service (including VoIP) used by a person with a service address in the city, which service is capable of terminating a call to another person on the general telephone network, shall be subject to a rebuttable presumption that "substantial nexus/minimum contacts" exists for purposes of imposing a tax, or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax, under this chapter. (Ord. 950 § 1 (part), 2006).

3.14.120 Maximum tax.
(a)    The maximum cumulative tax payable by any service user pursuant to Sections 3.14.040, 3.14.050, 3.14.060 and 3.14.070, shall be twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) per fiscal year. A service user with more than one (1) meter or billing invoice per utility service at a single contiguous location may combine all billings for purposes of calculating the maximum tax amount.

(b)    A person may apply to the Tax Administrator to be qualified for the maximum tax by providing billing invoices, and other information as required by the Tax Administrator, for the prior fiscal year. Upon receipt of satisfactory proof of paying the maximum tax for the prior fiscal year, the Tax Administrator shall qualify the applicant for the maximum tax. The qualified person shall thereafter be entitled to a refund of any tax in excess of twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) that was paid by the qualified person during the prior fiscal year, provided that proof of such tax payments is received by the Tax Administrator within one (1) year following the end of the fiscal year for which the refund is sought.

(c)    At the request of the qualified person, and upon receipt of satisfactory information, Tax Administrator shall advise the service suppliers, in writing, of the qualified person to discontinue imposing a utility user tax on the billings of the qualified person, provided however, that the qualified person agrees to prepay the Tax Administrator twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) at the commencement of the fiscal year. The service supplier shall comply with the written notice from the Tax Administrator by no later than ninety (90) days from receipt of the written notice.

(d)    The qualified person shall have the duty to notify the Tax Administrator of any changes in service suppliers, or if the combined tax payments hereunder drops below the twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) maximum tax per fiscal year. If a qualified person fails to notify the Tax Administrator that the combined tax payments drops below the twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) maximum tax within ninety (90) days following such fiscal year, then the penalties and interest provisions of Section 3.14.160 shall apply. (Ord. 950 § 1 (part), 2006).

3.14.130 Temporary tax percentage reduction and reinstatement of tax percentage without election.
The City Council may, by resolution and upon a majority vote of the Council, temporarily reduce the tax percentage in Sections 3.14.040 through 3.14.070 for a period of no more than twelve (12) months. The Tax Administrator shall implement the temporary tax reduction by giving sixty (60) day written notice to all affected service suppliers as required by Public Utilities Code Section 799. At the end of the twelve (12) month period, the original tax percentage shall be automatically reinstated without further notice or action by the City Council.

In a resolution granting a temporary tax rebate or tax reduction, the City Council shall make the following finding: The temporary tax reduction shall not adversely affect the city’s ability to meet its financial obligations as contemplated in its current or its proposed budget.

Nothing herein shall prohibit the City Council from adopting consecutive temporary tax percentage reductions, as provided herein.

As stated in Government Code Section 9611, the enactment of a temporary tax percentage reduction by the City Council shall not constitute a repeal of one (1) or more of the original provisions of this chapter. Upon the expiration of the time of the temporary tax percentage reduction, the original provisions of this chapter shall have the same force and effect as if the temporary tax percentage reduction had not been enacted. Nothing herein is intended to constitute a decrease in a tax, or an increase in a tax requiring election approval under California Constitution Article XIIIC; and to the extent that any aspect of a temporary tax percentage reduction is found to invoke such a requirement, the entire temporary tax percentage reduction shall be deemed null and void ab initio, and there shall be no entitlement to such tax reduction for any service user. (Ord. 950 § 1 (part), 2006).

3.14.140 Duty to collect and remit—Procedures.
The duty of service suppliers to collect and remit the taxes imposed by the provisions of this chapter shall be performed as follows:

(a)    The tax shall be collected insofar as practicable at the same time as, and along with, the charges made in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier. Where the amount paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than the full amount of the charge and tax which was accrued for the billing period, a proportionate share of both the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been paid. In those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of refusal to pay the tax imposed on said charges, Section 3.14.180 shall apply.

(b)    The duty of a service supplier to collect the tax from a service user shall commence with the beginning of the first regular billing period applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such regular billing are subject to the provisions of this chapter. Where a person receives more than one (1) billing, one (1) or more being for different periods than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing period. (Ord. 950 § 1 (part), 2006).

3.14.150 Filing return and payment.
Each person required by this chapter to remit a tax shall file a return with the Tax Administrator or his or her designated agent, on forms approved by the Tax Administrator on or before the due date. The full amount of the tax owed shall be included with the return and filed with the Tax Administrator or his or her designated agent. The Tax Administrator is authorized to require such additional information as he or she deems necessary to determine if the tax is being levied, collected and remitted in accordance with this chapter. Returns are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. Pursuant to California Revenue and Tax Code Section 7284.6, the Tax Administrator, and its agents, shall maintain such filing returns as confidential information. (Ord. 950 § 1 (part), 2006).

3.14.160 Collection penalties—Service suppliers or self-collectors.
(a)    Taxes collected from a service user, or self-collected by a service user subject to Section 3.14.060 of this chapter, are delinquent if not received by the Tax Administrator on or before the due date. Should the due date occur on a weekend or legal holiday, the return must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the first regular working day following the weekend or legal holiday. A direct deposit, including electronic fund transfers and other similar methods of electronically exchanging monies between financial accounts, made by a service supplier in satisfaction of its obligations under this subsection shall be considered timely if the transfer is initiated on or before the due date, and the transfer settles into the city’s account on or before the following business day.

(b)    If a service supplier, or a service user subject to Section 3.14.060 of this chapter, fails to remit any tax collected, on or before the due date, said person shall pay a penalty for such delinquencies at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the total tax that is delinquent in the remittance, and shall pay interest at the rate of three-quarters of one percent ( 3/4%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent, until paid.

(c)    The Tax Administrator shall have the power to impose additional penalties upon persons required to collect and/or remit taxes pursuant to the provisions of this chapter for fraud or gross negligence in reporting or remitting at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of the tax collected and/or required to be remitted, or as recomputed by the Tax Administrator.

(d)    For collection purposes only, every penalty imposed and such interest that is accrued under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid.

(e)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tax Administrator may, in his or her discretion, modify the due dates and/or penalty and interest provisions of this chapter to be consistent with any uniform standards or procedures that are mutually agreed upon by UUT public agencies, or otherwise legally established, to create a UUT central payment location or mechanism. (Ord. 950 § 1 (part), 2006).

3.14.170 Deficiency determination and assessment—Tax application errors.
(a)    The Tax Administrator shall make a deficiency determination if he or she determines that any person required to collect or self-collect taxes pursuant to the provisions of this chapter has failed to collect and remit the proper amount of tax by improperly or failing to apply the tax to one (1) or more taxable services or charges.

(b)    The Tax Administrator shall mail a notice of such deficiency determination to the person required to pay or remit the tax, which notice shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes owed, plus interest at the rate of three-quarters of one percent ( 3/4%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax from the date on which the tax should have been received by the city. Within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of service of such notice, the person may request in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the matter. If the person fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time period, the amount of the deficiency determination shall become a final assessment, and shall immediately be due and owing to the city.

(c)    If the person requests a hearing, the Tax Administrator shall cause the matter to be set for hearing, which shall be held within thirty (30) days after receipt of the written request for hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed by the Tax Administrator to such person at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the hearing, and, if the Tax Administrator desires said person to produce specific records at such hearing, such notice may designate the records requested to be produced.

(d)    At the time fixed for the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall hear all relevant testimony and evidence, including that of any other interested parties. At the discretion of the Tax Administrator, the hearing may be continued from time to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of additional evidence. Within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall issue a final assessment (or non-assessment), thereafter, by confirming, modifying or rejecting the original deficiency determination, and shall mail a copy of such final assessment to person owing the tax. The decision of the Tax Administrator may be appealed pursuant to Section 3.14.230 of this chapter. Filing an application with the Tax Administrator and appeal to the City Manager pursuant to Section 3.14.230 of this chapter is a prerequisite to a suit thereon.

(e)    Payment of the final assessment shall become delinquent if not received by the Tax Administrator on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the date of receipt of the notice of final assessment. The penalty for delinquency shall be fifteen percent (15%) on the total amount of the assessment, along with interest at the rate of three-quarters of one percent ( 3/4%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date of delinquency, until paid. The applicable statute of limitations regarding a claim by the city seeking payment of a tax assessed under this section shall commence from the date of delinquency as provided in this subsection.

(f)    All notices under this section may be sent by regular mail, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the third calendar day following the date of mailing, as established by a proof of mailing. (Ord. 950 § 1 (part), 2006).

3.14.180 Administrative remedy—Nonpaying service users.
(a)    Whenever the Tax Administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or whenever the Tax Administrator deems it in the best interest of the city, he or she may relieve such person of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this chapter from certain named service users for specific billing periods. Whenever the service user has failed to pay the amount of tax owed for a period of two (2) or more billing periods, the service supplier shall be relieved of the obligation to collect taxes due. The service supplier shall provide the city with the names and addresses of such service users and the amounts of taxes owed under the provisions of this chapter.

(b)    In addition to the tax owed, the service user shall pay a delinquency penalty at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the total tax that is owed, and shall pay interest at the rate of three-quarters of one percent ( 3/4%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the due date, until paid.

(c)    The Tax Administrator shall notify the non-paying service user that the Tax Administrator has assumed the responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes, including penalties and interest. The notice shall be served on the service user by personal delivery or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have a change of address, to his or her last known address.

(d)    If the service user fails to remit the tax to the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days from the date of the service of the notice upon him or her, the Tax Administrator may impose an additional penalty of fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of the total tax that is owed. (Ord. 950 § 1 (part), 2006).

3.14.190 Actions to collect.
Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the city. Any such tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the Tax Administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the city by the person required to collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service user. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount, including penalties and interest as provided for in this chapter, along with any collection costs incurred by the city as a result of the person’s noncompliance with this chapter, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees. In the event that a service user or service supplier owing a tax under this chapter files bankruptcy, then such debt to the city shall be deemed an unsecured priority excise tax obligation under 11 U.S.C.A. Section 507(a)(8)(C). (Ord. 950 § 1 (part), 2006).

3.14.200 Additional powers and duties of the tax administrator.
(a)    The Tax Administrator shall have the power and duty, and is directed, to enforce each and all of the provisions of this chapter.

(b)    The Tax Administrator may adopt administrative rules and regulations not inconsistent with provisions of this chapter for the purpose of interpreting, clarifying, carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the taxes herein imposed. A copy of such administrative rules and regulations shall be on file in the Tax Administrator’s office.

(c)    Upon a proper showing of good cause, the Tax Administrator may make administrative agreements, with appropriate conditions, to vary from the strict requirements of this chapter and thereby: (1) conform to the billing procedures of a particular service supplier (or service user subject to Section 3.14.060 of this chapter) so long as said agreements result in the collection of the tax in conformance with the general purpose and scope of this chapter; or, (2) to avoid a hardship where the administrative costs of collection and remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy of each such agreement shall be on file in the Tax Administrator’s office, and are voidable by the Tax Administrator or the city at any time.

(d)    The Tax Administrator may conduct an audit, to ensure proper compliance with the requirements of this chapter, of any person required to collect and/or remit a tax pursuant to this chapter. The Tax Administrator shall notify said person of the initiation of an audit in writing. In the absence of fraud or other intentional misconduct, the audit period of review shall not exceed a period of three (3) years next preceding the date of receipt of the written notice by said person from the Tax Administrator. Upon completion of the audit, the Tax Administrator may make a deficiency determination pursuant to Section 3.14.170 of this chapter for all taxes, penalties and interest owed and not paid, as evidenced by information provided by such person to the Tax Administrator. If said person is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient records to enable the Tax Administrator to verify compliance with this chapter, the Tax Administrator is authorized to make a reasonable estimate of the deficiency and issue a deficiency determination assessment. Said deficiency determination assessment shall be entitled to a rebuttable presumption of correctness.

(e)    Upon receipt of a written request of a taxpayer, and for good cause, the Tax Administrator may extend the time for filing any statement required pursuant to this chapter for a period of not to exceed forty-five (45) days, provided that the time for filing the required statement has not already passed when the request is received. No penalty for delinquent payment shall accrue by reason of such extension. Interest shall accrue during said extension at the rate of three-quarters of one percent ( 3/4%) per month, prorated for any portion thereof.

(f)    The Tax Administrator shall determine the eligibility of any person who asserts a right to exemption from, or a refund of, the tax imposed by this chapter.

(g)    The Tax Administrator, with the written approval of the City Attorney, may compromise a claim pursuant to this chapter where the portion of the claim proposed to be released is less than the amount set by separate resolution of the City Council relating to the settlement of general liability claims against the city and, with the approval of the City Attorney and the City Council, may compromise such a claim where the portion proposed to be released is equal to or greater than the amount set by separate resolution of the City Council relating to the settlement of general liability claims against the city.

(h)    Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, the Tax Administrator may waive any penalty or interest imposed upon a person required to collect and/or remit for failure to collect the tax imposed by this chapter if the non-collection occurred in good faith. In determining whether the non-collection was in good faith, the Tax Administrator shall take into consideration industry practice or other precedence. (Ord. 950 § 1 (part), 2006).

3.14.210 Records.
(a)    It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and/or remit to the city any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of at least three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax that such person may have been liable for the collection of and remittance to the Tax Administrator, which records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect at a reasonable time.

(b)    The city, through its City Council, may issue an administrative subpoena to compel a person to deliver, to the Tax Administrator, copies of all records deemed necessary by the Tax Administrator to establish compliance with this chapter, including the delivery of records in a common electronic format on readily available media if such records are kept electronically by the person in the usual and ordinary course of business. As an alternative to delivering the subpoenaed records to the Tax Administrator on or before the due date provided in the administrative subpoena, such person may provide access to such records outside the city on or before the due date, provided that such person shall reimburse the city for all reasonable travel expenses incurred by the city to inspect those records, including travel, lodging, meals, and other similar expenses, but excluding the normal salary or hourly wages of those persons designated by the city to conduct the inspection.

(c)    The Tax Administrator is authorized to execute a non-disclosure agreement approved by the City Attorney to protect the confidentiality of customer information pursuant to California Revenue and Tax Code Sections 7284.6 and 7284.7. The Tax Administrator may request from a person providing transportation or distribution services of gas or electricity to service users within the city, a list of the names, billing and service addresses, quantities of gas or electricity delivered, and other pertinent information, of its transportation customers within the city pursuant to California Public Utilities Code Section 6354(e).

(d)    If a service supplier uses a billing agent or billing aggregator to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax, the service supplier shall: (1) provide to the Tax Administrator the name, address and telephone number of each billing agent and billing aggregator currently authorized by the service supplier to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax to the city; and, (2) upon request of the Tax Administrator, deliver, or effect the delivery of, any information or records in the possession of such billing agent or billing aggregator that, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, is necessary to verify the proper application, calculation, collection and/or remittance of such tax to the city.

(e)    If any person subject to record-keeping under this section unreasonably denies the Tax Administrator, or the Tax Administrator’s designated representative, access to such records, or fails to produce the information requested in an administrative subpoena within the time specified, the Tax Administrator may impose a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500) on such person for each day following: i) the initial date that the person refuses to provide such access; or, ii) the due date for production of records as set forth in the administrative subpoena. This penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed under this chapter. (Ord. 950 § 1 (part), 2006).

3.14.220 Refunds.
(a)    Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid, paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax Administrator under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in this section.

(b)    The Tax Administrator may refund any tax that has been overpaid, paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax Administrator under this chapter, provided that no refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant or his or her guardian, conservator, executor or administrator has submitted a written claim, under penalty of perjury, to the Tax Administrator within one (1) year of the overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection of said tax. Such claim must clearly establish claimant’s right to the refund by written records showing entitlement thereto. Nothing herein shall permit the filing of a refund claim on behalf of a class or group of taxpayers. Where the amount of any individual refund claim is in excess of the amount set by separate resolution of the City Council relating to the settlement of general liability claims against the city, City Council approval shall be required.

(c)    The Tax Administrator, or the City Council where the claim is in excess of the amount set by separate resolution of the City Council relating to the settlement of general liability claims against the city, shall act upon the refund claim within forty-five (45) days of the initial receipt of the refund claim. Said decision shall be final. If the Tax Administrator/City Council fails or refuses to act on a refund claim within the forty-five (45) day period, the claim shall be deemed to have been rejected by the Tax Administrator/City Council on the forty-fifth (45th) day. The Tax Administrator shall give notice of the action in a form which substantially complies with that set forth in Government Code Section 913.

(d)    The filing of a written claim is a prerequisite to any suit thereon. Any action brought against the city pursuant to this section shall be subject to the provisions of Government Code Sections 946.

(e)    Notwithstanding the notice provisions of subsection (a) of this section, in the event that a service supplier, or a service user subject to Section 3.14.060 hereof, remits a tax to city in excess of the amount of tax imposed by this chapter, said service supplier, or service user subject to Section 3.14.060 hereof, may claim credit for such overpayment against the amount of tax which is due upon any other monthly returns to the Tax Administrator, provided such credit is claimed in a return dated no later than one (1) year from the date of overpayment of said tax. The Tax Administrator shall first determine the validity of the service user’s claim of credit, and the underlying basis for such claim.

(f)    Notwithstanding the notice provisions of subsection (a) of this section, a service supplier that has collected any amount of tax in excess of the amount of tax imposed by this chapter and actually due from a service user (whether due to overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection of said tax), may refund such amount to the service user, or credit to charges subsequently payable by the service user to the service supplier, and claim credit for such overpayment against the amount of tax which is due upon any other monthly returns to the Tax Administrator, provided such credit is claimed in a return dated no later than one (1) year from the date of overpayment or erroneous or illegal collection of said tax. The Tax Administrator shall first determine the validity of the service user’s claim of credit, and the underlying basis for such claim. (Ord. 950 § 1 (part), 2006).

3.14.230 Appeals.
(a)    The provisions of this section apply to any decision (other than a decision relating to a refund pursuant to Section 3.14.220 of this chapter), deficiency determination, assessment, or administrative ruling of the Tax Administrator. Any person aggrieved by any decision (other than a decision relating to a refund pursuant to Section 3.14.220 of this chapter), deficiency determination, assessment, or administrative ruling of the Tax Administrator, shall be required to comply with the appeals procedure of this section. Compliance with this section shall be a prerequisite to a suit thereon.

The appellant shall be served with notice of the time and place of the hearing, as well as any relevant materials, at least five (5) calendar days prior to the hearing. The hearing may be continued from time to time upon mutual consent. At the time of the hearing, the appealing party, the Tax Administrator, the City Manager, and any other interested person may present such relevant evidence as he or she may have relating to the determination from which the appeal is taken.

(d)    Based upon the submission of such evidence and the review of the city’s files, the City Manager shall issue a written notice and order upholding, modifying or reversing the determination from which the appeal is taken. The notice shall be given within fourteen (14) days after the conclusion of the hearing and shall state the reasons for the decision. The notice shall specify that the decision is final and that any petition for judicial review shall be filed within ninety (90) days from the date of the decision in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6.

The city shall annually verify that the taxes owed under this chapter have been properly applied, exempted, collected, and remitted in accordance with this chapter, and properly expended according to applicable municipal law. The annual verification shall be performed by a qualified independent third party and the review shall employ reasonable, cost-effective steps to assure compliance, including the use of sampling audits. The verification shall not be required of tax remitters where the cost of the verification may exceed the tax revenues to be reviewed. (Ord. 950 § 1 (part), 2006).

3.14.250 No injunction/writ of mandate.
No injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process shall issue in any suit, action, or proceeding in any court against this city or against any officer of the city to prevent or enjoin the collection under this chapter of any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected and/or remitted.

(Ord. 950 § 1 (part), 2006).

3.14.280 Severability.
If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter or any part thereof is for any reason held to be invalid, unlawful or unconstitutional, such decision, and the decision not to enforce such, shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion of this chapter or any part thereof. The City Council declares that it would have passed each section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one (1) or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared invalid, unlawful or unconstitutional.

3.16.010 Short title.
This chapter shall be known as the "transient occupancy tax ordinance of the city of Menlo Park." (Prior code § 26.11).

3.16.020 Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section:

(1)    Hotel. "Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio, bachelor hotel, lodging house, roominghouse, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof;

(2)    Occupancy. "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes;

(3)    Operator. "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent is also deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both;

(4)    Person. "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit;

(5)    Rent. "Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor, or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever;

(6)    Tax administrator. "Tax administrator" means the city manager or his duly authorized representative. The City Council may delegate the responsibility of the "tax administrator" to a county official by resolution;

(7)    Transient. "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be considered. (Prior code § 26.12).

3.16.030 Imposition.
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of twelve percent (12%) of the rent charged by the operator beginning January 1, 2013. Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. (Ord. 983 § 2, 2012; Ord. 842 § 1, 1992; Ord. 686 § 1, 1983: Ord. 569 § 1, 1974: prior code § 26.13).

3.16.040 Exemptions.
No tax shall be imposed upon:

(1)    Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax herein provided;

(2)    Any federal or state officer or employee when on official business;

(3)    Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty.

No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the tax administrator. (Prior code § 26.14).

3.16.050 Operator’s duties.
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. (Prior code § 26.15).

3.16.060 Registration.
Within thirty days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register such hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from him a “transient occupancy registration certificate” to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Such certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

(1)    The name of the operator;

(2)    The address of the hotel;

(3)    The date upon which the certificate was issued;

(4)    “This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business, or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit.” (Prior code § 26.16).

3.16.070 Reporting and remitting.
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter period of reporting which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. (Prior code § 26.17).

3.16.080 Penalties—Interest.
(a)    Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.

(b)    Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed.

(c)    Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(d)    Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

(e)    Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. (Prior code § 26.18).

3.16.090 Failure to collect and report tax—Determination of tax.
If any operator fails or refuses to collect such tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of business. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days’ written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.16.100. (Prior code § 26.19).

3.16.100 Appeal.
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (Prior code § 26.20).

3.16.110 Records.
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. (Prior code § 26.21).

3.16.120 Refunds.
(a)    Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of this section; provided, a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator.

(b)    Any operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.

(c)    A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subparagraph (a) of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

(d)    No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. (Prior code § 26.22).

3.16.130 Collection of tax.
(a)    Actions to Collect. Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax collectible by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for recovery of such amount.

(b)    Recording Certificate—Lien. If any amount required to be paid to the city under this chapter is not paid when due, the officer charged with collection of the tax may within three years after the amount is due file for record in the office of the county recorder a certificate specifying the amount of tax, penalties and interest due, the name and address as it appears on the records of the city of the operator liable for the same and the fact that such officer has complied with all provisions of this chapter in the determination of the amount required to be paid. From the time of the filing for record, the amount required to be paid together with penalties and interest constitutes a lien upon all real property in the county owned by the operator or afterwards and before the lien expires acquired by him. The lien has the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue for ten years from the time of filing of the certificate unless sooner released or otherwise discharged.

(c)    Successor’s Liability—Withholding by Purchaser. If any operator liable for any amount under this chapter sells out his business or quits the business, his successor or assignee shall withhold sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the city showing that it has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due.

(d)    Liability of Purchaser—Release. If the purchaser of a hotel fails to withhold purchase price as required, he shall become personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. Within sixty (60) days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, or within sixty (60) days from the date the former owner’s records are made available for audit, whichever period expires the later, but in any event not later than ninety (90) days after receiving the request, the officer charged with the collection of the tax shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his address as it appears on the records of the city of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. Failure to mail the notice will release the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold purchase price as above provided. The time within which the obligation of the successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells his business or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever event occurs the later. (Prior code § 26.23).

3.16.140 Penalty for violations.
Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable therefor by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500) or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than six (6) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the tax administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and is punishable as aforesaid. Any person required to make, render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as aforesaid. (Prior code § 26.24).

If any person required to make such statement referred to in this chapter shall fail to do so, such person shall be required to pay a license tax at the maximum amount to be determined by the license collector for the profession, trade, calling, occupation or business carried on by such person and such person shall be guilty of a violation hereof, and be punishable therefor as provided by the Menlo Park Municipal Code.

(b)    In case such determination is made, the license collector shall give not less than five days’ written notice to the licensee to show cause, at a time and place fixed in said notice, why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such license. At such hearing the previous determination shall be presumed to be correct. The licensee may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax should not be fixed as the license tax. The presumption of correctness shall be rebuttable. After such hearing, the license collector shall determine the tax to be charged and shall forthwith give written notice to the licensee in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax.

5.04.210 Compliance with city ordinances.
The license collector shall determine if the operation of the business in question as proposed by the applicant conforms to all applicable city ordinances.

5.04.220 Stickers.
Upon the issuance of a license, the license collector may deliver to the licensee one sticker, emblem, device, sign or license facsimile for each vehicle used by the licensee in the conduct of his business.

(b)    In any case where a license tax is believed by a licensee or applicant for a license to place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of such constitutional clauses, he may apply to the license collector for an adjustment of the tax. Such application may be made before, at, or within six months after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show this method of business and the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the license collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden or violation. The license collector shall then conduct an investigation, and shall fix as the license tax for the applicant an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or if the license tax has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the license tax to be charged, the license collector shall have the power to base the license tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure which will assure that the license tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the license tax as prescribed by this chapter. (Ord. 590 § 1(m), 1975).

5.76.010 Purpose.
This ordinance codified in this chapter shall be known as the "Minimum Wage Ordinance." (Ord. 1058 § 2 (part), 2019).

5.76.020 Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings set forth in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

(a)    "City" shall mean city of Menlo Park or any agency designated by the city of Menlo Park to perform various investigative, enforcement and informal resolution functions pursuant to this chapter.

(b)    "Employee" shall mean any person who:

(1)    In a calendar week performs at least two (2) hours of work for an employer as defined below; and

(2)    Qualifies as an employee entitled to payment of a minimum wage from any employer under the California minimum wage law, as provided under Section 1197 of the California Labor Code and wage orders published by the California Industrial Welfare Commission.

(c)    "Employer" shall mean any person, including corporate officers or executives, as defined in Section 18 of the California Labor Code, who directly or indirectly through any other person, including through the services of a temporary employment agency, staffing agency, or similar entity, employs or exercises control over the wages, hours, or working conditions of any employee and who is either subject to the city’s business license requirements, conducts business in Menlo Park or maintains a business facility in the city.

(d)    "Minimum wage" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 5.76.030. (Ord. 1058 § 2 (part), 2019).

5.76.030 Minimum wage.
(a)    Employers shall pay employees no less than the minimum wage set forth in this section for each hour worked within the geographic boundaries of the city of Menlo Park.

(b)    Effective January 1, 2020, the minimum wage shall be an hourly rate of fifteen dollars ($15.00). To prevent inflation from eroding its value, beginning on January 1, 2021, and each first day of January thereafter, the minimum wage shall increase by an amount corresponding to the increase, if any, in the cost of living, not to exceed three percent (3%). The prior year’s increase in the cost of living shall be measured by the percentage increase, if any, as of August of the immediately preceding year of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for San Francisco – Oakland – Hayward, or its successor index, as published by the U.S. Department of Labor or its successor agency, with the amount of the minimum wage increase rounded to the nearest multiple of five cents ($0.05). If there is no net increase in the cost of living, the minimum wage shall remain unchanged for that year. The adjusted minimum wage shall be announced by the first day of October of each year, or as soon as practicable thereafter if the Consumer Price Index for August has not yet been published, and shall become effective as the new minimum wage on the first day of January of each year.

(c)    The city council may, by resolution and upon a majority vote of the city council, temporarily suspend the inflation adjustment in the upcoming calendar year for a period of no more than one (1) calendar year. At the end of the suspension period, the minimum wage shall be automatically adjusted by the change in Consumer Price Index in accordance with subsection (b) of this section and without further notice or action by the city council.

In a resolution granting a temporary suspension of the annual inflation adjustment, the city council shall make the following finding: local or other economic conditions justify temporarily suspending the inflation adjustment.

Nothing herein shall prohibit the city council from adopting consecutive temporary suspension periods, as provided herein.

(d)    A violation for unlawfully failing to pay the minimum wage shall be deemed to continue from the date immediately following the date that the wages were due and payable as provided in Part 1 (commencing with Section 200) of Division 2 of the California Labor Code, to the date immediately preceding the date the wages are paid in full.

This exemption shall only apply to the first one hundred sixty (160) hours of employment as specified in California Labor Code Section 1192. (Ord. 1058 § 2 (part), 2019).

5.76.050 Waiver through collective bargaining.
To the extent required by federal law, all or any portion of the applicable requirements of this chapter may be waived in a bona fide collective bargaining agreement; provided, that such waiver is explicitly set forth in such agreement in clear and unambiguous terms. (Ord. 1058 § 2 (part), 2019).

5.76.060 Notice, posting and payroll records.
(a)    By the first day of December of each year, the city shall publish and make available to employers a bulletin announcing the adjusted minimum wage rate for the upcoming year, which shall take effect on the first day of January of each year. In conjunction with this bulletin, the city shall, by the first day of December of each year, publish and make available to employers a notice suitable for posting by employers in the workplace informing employees of the current minimum wage rate and of their rights under this chapter. Such notice shall be in English and other languages as provided in any regulations promulgated under Section 5.76.080(a).

(b)    Every employer shall post in a conspicuous place at any workplace or job site where any employee works the notice published each year by the city informing employees of the current minimum wage rate and of their rights under this chapter. Every employer shall post such notices in any language spoken by at least five percent (5%) of the employees at the workplace or job site.

(b)    Taking adverse action against a person within ninety (90) days of the person’s exercise of rights protected under this chapter shall raise a rebuttable presumption of having done so in retaliation for the exercise of such rights. (Ord. 1058 § 2 (part), 2019).

5.76.080 Implementation.
(a)    Guidelines. The city manager or designee shall be authorized to coordinate implementation and enforcement of this chapter and may promulgate appropriate guidelines or rules for such purposes. Any guidelines or rules promulgated by the city shall have the force and effect of law and may be relied on by employers, employees and other parties to determine their rights and responsibilities under this chapter. Any guidelines or rules may establish procedures for ensuring fair, efficient and cost effective implementation of this chapter, including supplementary procedures for helping to inform employees of their rights under this chapter, for monitoring employer compliance with this chapter and for providing administrative hearings to determine whether an employer or other person has violated the requirements of this chapter.

(b)    Reporting Violations. An employee or any other person may report to the city in writing any suspected violation of this chapter. The city shall encourage reporting pursuant to this subsection by keeping confidential, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, the name and other identifying information of the employee or person reporting the violation; provided, however, that with the authorization of such person, the city may disclose his or her name and identifying information as necessary to enforce this chapter or other employee protection laws.

This chapter shall be administered for the city by the city manager and his/her designees. (Ord. 859 (part), 1994).

7.42.050 Construction and application.
This chapter shall be construed to assure consistency with the requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act and acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, applicable implementing regulations, and NPDES Permit No. CA0029921 and any amendment, revision or reissuance thereof. (Ord. 859 (part), 1994).

7.42.060 Severability and validity.
If any portion of this chapter is declared invalid, the remaining portions of this chapter are to be considered valid. (Ord. 859 (part), 1994).

7.42.070 Waiver procedures.
(a)    It is the intent of this chapter to protect and enhance water quality while respecting the rights of private property owners to an economically viable use of land. It is not the intent of this chapter to prohibit all economically viable use of any private lands, nor to result in a confiscatory impact. Accordingly, the purpose of this section is to provide for an administrative procedure for a waiver or modification of a particular provision of this chapter in the event the strict application of this chapter would result in the denial of all economically viable use of real property.

(b)    An applicant for a waiver of a provision of this chapter shall file a waiver applicant with the director of the engineering division on a form provided by the director identifying the provision sought to be waived or modified. The applicant shall file a complete form and shall provide all documentation and information required by the director to determine whether application of the provision in question will prohibit any economically viable use of the land in question or otherwise have an impermissible confiscatory result.

(c)    The director may approve, deny or conditionally approve a waiver application upon making all of the following written findings:

(1)    That the strict application of the provision for which a waiver or modification is sought would result in the denial of all economically viable use of the real property in question;

(2)    To the maximum extent feasible, conditions have been placed upon such a waiver or modification in order to achieve the goals of this chapter as closely as possible while still allowing economically viable use of the real property in question;

(3)    Approval of such a waiver will not result in a public nuisance which would constitute a significant and direct threat to public health or safety. (Ord. 859 (part), 1994).

7.42.080 Discharge of pollutants.
(a)    Prohibition. The discharge of non-storm water discharges to the city storm sewer system and watercourses is prohibited. The discharge of rubbish, refuse, bark, sawdust, or other solid wastes into surface waters or at any place where they would contact or where they would be eventually transported to surface waters including floodplain areas is prohibited.

(b)    Implementation of NPDES Permit Conditions. The public works director, community development director or designees shall have authority to adopt policies to implement NPDES Permit No. CAS612008 and all subsequent permits or amendments. These policies may include best management practices (BMPs) to control and reduce non-storm water and polluted storm water discharges to storm drains and watercourses; including but not limited to conditions of approval, maintenance agreements, regular inspections and reporting requirements.

(c)    Permitted Discharges. All discharges of material other than storm water must be in compliance with a NPDES permit issued for the discharge (other than NPDES Permit No. CAS612008) and this chapter. (Ord. 1055 § 2, 2019: Ord. 859 (part), 1994).

7.42.090 Exceptions to discharge prohibition.
The following discharges are exempt from the prohibition set forth in Section 7.42.080.

(a)    The prohibition on discharges shall not apply to any discharge regulated under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit issued to the discharger and administered by the state of California under authority of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit and other applicable laws or regulations.

(b)    Discharges from the following activities will not be considered a source of pollutants to waters of the United States when properly managed: water line flushing and other discharges from potable water sources, municipal street cleaning, municipal park maintenance, landscape irrigation and lawn watering, irrigation water, diverted stream flows, rising ground waters, infiltration to separate storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation and footing drains, water from crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, individual residential car washings, flows from riparian habitats and wetlands, dechlorinated swimming pool discharge, or flows from fire fighting and other emergency response activity, and accordingly are not subject to the prohibition on discharges. (Ord. 859 (part), 1994).

7.42.100 Discharge in violation of permit.
Any discharge that would result in or contribute to a violation of NPDES Permit No. CA0029921, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference, and which is on file in the office of the city clerk, and any amendment, revision or reissuance thereof, either separately considered or when combined with other discharges, is prohibited. Liability for any such discharge shall be the responsibility of the person(s) causing or responsible for the discharge, and such persons shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the city in any administrative or judicial enforcement action relating to such discharge.

Whenever it appears to the officer whose duty it is to abate a nuisance that there is imminent and immediate danger to the general public, or to a large portion thereof, in the existence or continuance of any public nuisance amounting to a nuisance per se, such officer may give such reasonable notice to the owner, occupant, agent or other person having control of the property, as the exigencies of the case may allow and thereupon summarily abate the nuisance. Any notice given pursuant to this section may be oral, but if the owner, occupant or other person in control, is absent or unknown, written notice of the abatement shall be posted on the property as soon as practicable. (Prior code § 17.4).

8.04.050 Posting—Service of notice to abate.
Whenever the existence of any public nuisance within the city comes to the attention of the officer whose duty it is to abate the same, such officer shall except in those cases herein otherwise provided, forthwith serve or cause to be served upon the owner, reputed owner, occupant or person having control of the property for the owner, a notice in writing requiring that the nuisance be abated within a reasonable time which shall be specified in the notice, but which shall not be less than three days after service thereof, except in cases of summary abatement, and briefly stating what measures shall be taken to abate the same. Service of the notice may be made by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the last known address of the owner or reputed owner and the address of the property, provided, that if the return receipt is not returned with the signature of the owner or reputed owner, service may be made upon the owner, reputed owner, occupant or person in charge of the property in the same manner as service of summons in a civil action, and if, after diligent search, neither the owner, reputed owner, occupant or other person in charge of the premises can be served, service may be completed by posting of the notice in a conspicuous place on the property. Failure to receive notice mailed by certified mail and/or the posted notice shall not affect the validity of any proceedings hereunder. Service, posting, and mailing of notice pursuant to this section is required only if the nuisance is abated by an officer of the city without a court order requiring or authorizing such abatement. (Ord. 777 § 1, 1988; Ord. 743 § 1, 1987; Prior code § 17.5).

If, upon the expiration of the time specified in the notice provided by the preceding section, the nuisance shall be found to remain unabated, the officer whose duty it is to abate such nuisance may forthwith proceed to remove, suppress or otherwise abate the same. (Prior code § 17.6).

8.04.070 Costs of abatement to become lien.
Any and all sums expended in the abatement of any public nuisance from the date of payment thereof by the city shall be and become a lien against the property on which the nuisance existed or was maintained, and in addition any and all such sums shall thereupon be and become a personal charge against the owner of the property and against the person creating, causing, committing or maintaining the nuisance, and each of them, and may be recovered by the city in any court of competent jurisdiction, and a reasonable attorney’s fee shall be fixed by the court and taxed as a part of the costs to be paid by the defendant in such action. (Prior code § 17.7).

8.04.080 Foreclosure of lien—Disposition of proceeds.
If within thirty days prior to the end of the fiscal year the expenditure provided in the preceding section shall not have been paid to the officer authorized to receive the same for payment into the city treasury, the city manager shall submit to the City Council for confirmation an itemized written report showing the cost of abatement of such public nuisance. A copy of the report shall be posted at the city hall at least three days prior to the submission of it to the City Council; a notice of the time and place of the hearing on the report before the City Council shall be mailed to the parcel of property upon which the nuisance was abated, addressed to the owner thereof if known. At the time fixed for receiving and considering the report, the City Council shall hear it with any objections of the property owner liable to be assessed for the cost of abatement. It may modify the report if it is deemed necessary. The City Council shall then confirm the report by motion or resolution. After the cost of abatement of such public nuisance is confirmed, it is a lien on the parcel on which the nuisance existed. After confirmation of the report, a copy thereof shall be given to the assessor and tax collector, who shall add the amount of the lien to the next regular tax bill levied against the parcel for municipal purposes. (Prior code § 17.8).

8.04.090 Order to vacate certain buildings.
Whenever it appears to the city manager or his designated representatives that any building or part thereof is unfit or unsafe for human habitation by reason of its being so contaminated with disease, or by reason of any prevailing unsanitary condition therein which is likely to cause sickness among the occupants, or that any such building or part thereof is dangerous to human life by reason of its want of repair, the officer may issue an order and cause the same to be posted in a conspicuous place on the building, or part thereof affected, and personally served upon the owner, reputed owner, or upon his agent or lessee, if either can with reasonable diligence be found within the city, requiring all persons to vacate such building or part thereof, for the reasons to be stated in the order. Such building, or the part thereof affected, shall be vacated within ten days thereafter, or within such shorter time as may be specified in the order, but if any time the city manager or his designated representatives shall be satisfied that the danger has ceased to exist, he may revoke the order and it shall be thenceforth inoperative. (Prior code § 17.9).

8.04.100 Procedure for destruction of all or part of building, structure.
In every case in which the abatement of a nuisance necessitates the destruction of any building or structure, or part thereof, or which necessitates the destruction of property having more than nominal value, excepting when summary abatement is authorized, and in such other cases as the City Council may require, the owner of the property shall first be given an opportunity to be heard on the matter before the City Council and for that purpose the council shall fix a time and place of hearing by order entered on its minutes, and cause reasonable notice thereof to be given to the owner or reputed owner, or occupant or person having control of the property for the owner. Service of the notice may be made in the manner provided in Section 8.04.050.

Upon the hearing, if the City Council finds that the act, condition, use or thing in question is in fact a public nuisance, whether it be herein so defined or not, the council may by order entered upon its minutes so find and declare the same to be and to constitute a public nuisance and order the abatement thereof, and for all purposes hereof the finding and determination shall be final.

In case the owner or his representative fails to offer any objections at such hearing, or if the objections offered are overruled, and he fails to abate the nuisance within five days thereafter, or within such further time as the council may allow, the council may then cause the nuisance to be abated. An opportunity to be heard before the City Council pursuant to this section is required only if the nuisance is abated by an officer of the city without a court order requiring or authorizing such abatement. (Ord. 743 § 2, 1987; Prior code § 17.10).

8.04.110 Maintenance of nuisance unlawful.
It is unlawful for any person whether as principal, agent or employee, for himself or for another, to commit, create or maintain, or permit or cause to be committed, created or maintained, any act, condition, use, thing, or occupation whatsoever which is by ordinance or otherwise lawfully declared to be or to constitute a public nuisance. (Prior code § 17.11).

(b)    A facility that has been issued a permit pursuant to this Section 8.06.065 shall operate its permitted facility in such a manner that all sources of noise on the facility do not exceed sixty (60) dBA as measured at residential property lines between the hours of six (6) a.m. and ten (10) p.m., or fifty-seven (57) dBA as measured at residential property lines between the hours of ten (10) p.m. and six (6) a.m.; provided, however, that mobile sources of noise on the facility (i.e., conventional over-the-road vehicles and powered industrial tractors or forklifts) may exceed the noise limits of this section for brief periods when vehicles are entering and exiting the site as part of shift changes.

(c)    Every facility that is issued a permit pursuant to this Section 8.06.065 shall:

(1)    Identify an individual with primary responsibility for noise monitoring and noise control at the facility;

(2)    Maintain a log of any noise complaints received by the facility and a log of actions taken to respond to such complaints;

(3)    Maintain a formal internal engineering review process that will ensure that any proposed changes at the facility that could significantly increase the noise from the facility are identified prior to the change and appropriately engineered so that the facility does not exceed the noise limitations specified in Section 8.06.065(b);

(4)    For equipment located outside of buildings or on rooftops that is a significant noise source, at the time of replacement because of equipment breakdown, inefficiency, inadequate capacity or obsolescence, put forth a good-faith effort to replace such existing equipment with equipment that is designed and installed so as to reduce the noise level from the facility;

(5)    Establish a formal inspection and preventive maintenance program for all pieces of equipment located outside of buildings or on rooftops that are significant noise sources at the facility (such a program should be designed to prevent noise problems from developing because of mechanical problems with the equipment and to detect significant changes in equipment noise levels during inspections so as to prevent nuisance noise complaints);

(6)    Undertake an annual program of noise monitoring. The annual program of monitoring shall include, at a minimum, monitoring for three (3) consecutive weekdays and two (2) consecutive weekend days during which noise monitoring measurements occur for ten (10) minute periods, four (4) times per day during: mid-morning (nine (9) to ten (10) a.m.); mid-afternoon (three (3) to four (4) p.m.); late evening (ten (10) to eleven (11) p.m.); and early morning (five (5) to six (6) a.m.).

The annual program shall be a self-monitoring program at the option of the facility; provided, however, the director of community development shall have discretion to periodically request independent verification of such monitoring data by an independent noise consultant chosen and paid for by the facility and subject to the approval of the director;

(7)    Prepare and submit to the director of community development a report on the efforts to monitor and reduce the noise associated with the operation of the facility and to respond to any noise complaints (the noise monitoring and abatement report). The operator shall submit the noise monitoring and abatement report annually on February 1st following the issuance or renewal of a permit pursuant to this section. The noise monitoring and abatement report shall include a summary list of any noise complaints received during the reporting period and the actions taken, and describe: the results of the annual program of noise monitoring as set forth above; ongoing monitoring and maintenance of existing equipment in order to control noise; any specific noise reduction efforts during the reporting period, including specific projects and capital outlays, to reduce the amount of noise from the permitted facility; and any future plans to attempt to further reduce the noise generated from the operation of the facility.

(d)    A permit issued pursuant to this Section 8.06.065 may be revoked by the director of community development if the director establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that sources of noise from the facility consistently exceeded the limits as specified above in Section 8.06.065(b) for eight (8) days within any twenty-eight (28) day period, except for construction work undertaken by the facility under a city building permit and conducted between the hours of eight (8) a.m. and six (6) p.m. Monday through Friday.

(e)    A permit issued pursuant to this Section 8.06.065 shall be valid for an initial term of ten (10) years. A facility may apply for the renewal of a permit at any time prior to the expiration of the prior permit. The term of any renewed permit shall be five (5) years.

The following principles shall govern use of recreation facilities:

(1)    Recreation facilities primarily are intended for the use and enjoyment by citizens of Menlo Park;

(2)    Public recreation services should be available to all Menlo Park residents without discrimination as to race, religion, sex or economic status;

(3)    The public recreation program should include a wide variety of activities, including passive enjoyment, to appeal to different interests, ages and abilities, and should not merely be limited to physical activities, outdoor activities, daytime activities, or to the interests of children or others of special categories;

(4)    Recreation facilities are intended to be used:

(A)    Informally by residents,

(B)    For programs sponsored by the city,

(C)    For joint city-school programs,

(D)    For organized group activities, when not required for the above. (Ord. 483 (part), 1969: Prior code § 18A.2).

8.28.030 Group activities—Permit required.
Because of limitations of size and open areas, activities involving the exclusive use of a park or for a group of more than fifty persons shall be subject to the obtaining of a permit therefor, and subject to the standards and regulations contained in this chapter. Activities involving the use of a park which is less than one acre in size, other than Camp Fremont Memorial Park, by or for a group of more than twenty persons shall also require a permit.

8.28.040 Limit on size of group.
Except for Burgess and Kelly Parks, none of the outdoor recreation facilities in the city, by virtue of small size, proximity to residential uses or intense landscaping, is suitable for gathering of groups of more than one hundred fifty persons; such gatherings are therefor prohibited except in Burgess and Kelly Parks. (Ord. 483 (part), 1969: Prior code § 18A.302).

8.28.050 Occupancy standard.
Based on the availability of vehicular parking facilities, the preservation of turf and other planted materials, the availability of sanitary facilities and the safety and comfort of persons using parks and recreation facilities, maximum occupancy standards are hereby established for group activities which shall be one person per two hundred square feet of usable open area. According to the above standard, the size of any group permitted to use Burgess Park (two hundred eighty thousand square feet) shall not exceed one thousand four hundred persons; the size of any group permitted to use Kelly Park (one hundred eighty thousand square feet) shall not exceed nine hundred persons.

*    Prior ordinance history: Ord. 810.

8.44.010 Purpose and findings.
The purpose of this chapter in regulating signs is to preserve and protect the public health, welfare and safety. It is intended to facilitate movement and ensure safety in public areas and on public rights-of-way. It is also intended to enhance the physical appearance of the city, make the city a more enjoyable and pleasing community, and to create a more attractive economic and business climate.

Therefore, the city finds that it is in the public interest to enact restrictions on the placement or display of signs in the public right-of-way and on public property. Notwithstanding the above, in enacting the ordinance codified in this chapter the city finds that it has a compelling and substantial interest permitting certain signs in the public right-of-way, as follows:

(a)    The city finds that house or building numbers painted onto curbs are necessary to facilitate the location of property addresses by police, ambulance and fire emergency personnel.

(b)    The city finds that signs not permanently affixed to the exterior of vehicles pose a safety hazard to pedestrian and vehicular traffic, are not necessary for intra- or inter-state commerce, and are contrary to the preservation of the attractive physical appearance of the city and to the preservation of an aesthetic and an attractive business and economic climate, and therefore should be prohibited.

(c)    The city finds that safety, traffic, or other public information signals, signs, banners or notices erected or maintained by a public officer or employee in the performance of a public duty, are necessary in order to ensure the safety of the public, to inform the public about the location of public buildings, parks, schools, shopping districts, streets and highways, and community events.

(d)    The city finds that temporary emergency or safety pedestrian and vehicular warning signs are necessary to protect the public from temporary and unanticipated dangers and public emergencies.

(e)    The city finds that in order to promote freedom of expression, this chapter shall exempt signs carried by an otherwise lawfully present person; provided however, that a person located upon a public street, sidewalk or walkway may only carry a single sign which does not exceed three (3) square feet in area.

(f)    The city finds that in order to promote the use of its public buildings and parks, that licensed users or lessees of such public property be permitted to erect temporary signs, provided that those signs do not deface, damage or destroy public property, and are maintained only during the duration of the license or lease. (Ord. 890 § 1 (part), 1999: Ord. 877 § 1 (part), 1996).

8.44.020 Scope.
(a)    This chapter governs:

(1)    Signs installed, maintained, erected, displayed or placed within the public right-of-way or on public property;

(2)    Signs pertaining to general or special elections; and

(3)    Any other signs not governed by Chapter 16.92 of this code.

(b)    As used in this chapter, "sign" and "signs" include, but are not limited to, any sign, poster, banner, placard or handbill not governed by Chapter 16.92, including, but not limited to:

(1)    Commercial signs; or

(2)    Signs pertaining to general or special elections; or

(3)    Signs regarding political, sociological, religious, ethical or economic beliefs or opinions; or

(4)    Signs conveying any other information not addressed in subsection (b)(1), (2) or (3) of this section.

(c)    Nothing in this chapter shall apply to:

(1)    House or building numbers painted onto curbs;

(2)    Signs on vehicles of any kind, provided:

(B)    Any sign affixed to the exterior of the vehicle is attached in such a manner so as not to interfere with the vehicle being legally operated;

(3)    Safety, traffic, or other public information signals, signs, banners or notices erected or maintained by a public officer or employee in the performance of a public duty;

(4)    Temporary pedestrian and vehicular emergency or safety warning signs;

(5)    Signs carried by an otherwise lawfully present person; provided however, that a person located upon a public street, sidewalk or walkway may only carry a single sign which does not exceed three (3) square feet in area;

(6)    Signs posted, displayed or carried by licensed users or lessees of public property which do not deface, damage or destroy public property and which are maintained only during the duration of the license or lease. (Ord. 890 § 1 (part), 1999: Ord. 877 § 1 (part), 1996).

8.44.030 Restrictions.
(a)    Except as otherwise permitted by this chapter, no sign may be posted, attached, painted, marked, or written on, or otherwise affixed to or placed upon public property or displayed in the public right-of-way.

Public right-of-way does not include unimproved right-of-way adjacent to residential property. For purposes of this chapter, the owners and occupants of residential property are considered the owners and occupants of adjacent unimproved right-of-way.

(b)    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no sign may be posted without the consent of the owner or lawful occupant of the property on which the sign is posted.

(c)    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no sign shall be posted, displayed or carried at a location or in such a manner so as to obstruct or interfere with, or pose the threat of obstructing or interfering with, vehicular or pedestrian travel, or pose a danger to any person.

(c)    The owner or lawful occupant of property, or the owner’s designees, may remove signs from his or her property.

(d)    The owner of a sign, or person(s) responsible for posting a sign, posted in violation of this chapter may remove his or her sign, provided nothing herein shall give such person the right to enter private property without the consent of the owner or lawful occupant of such property.

(e)    Special Removal Rules for Election Signs.

(1)    Candidates, political organizations, and others may remove signs pertaining to a specific election posted by them or on their behalf.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a program for removal of graffiti from walls and structures on both public and private property and to provide regulations designed to prevent and control the further spread of graffiti in the city. The increase of graffiti on both public and private buildings, structures, and places is creating a condition of blight within the city which results in a deterioration of property and business values for adjacent and surrounding properties all to the detriment of the city. The City Council finds and determines that graffiti is obnoxious and a public nuisance which must be abated so as to avoid the detrimental impact of such graffiti on the city and to prevent the further spread of graffiti. (Ord. 856 § 2 (part), 1994).

8.50.020 Graffiti definition.
For the purpose of this chapter, "graffiti" shall mean the unauthorized spraying of paint or marking of ink, dye, or other similar indelible substances on public and/or private buildings, structures, and places. (Ord. 856 § 2 (part), 1994).

8.50.030 Graffiti prohibition.
(a)    No person shall place graffiti upon any publicly or privately owned permanent structure located on publicly or privately owned real property within the city. Violation of this subsection shall be a misdemeanor.

(b)    No person owning or otherwise in control of any real property within the city shall permit or allow any graffiti to be placed upon or remain on any permanent structure located on such property when the graffiti is visible from the street or other public or private property, for a period in excess of that described in this chapter for notice and removal of graffiti. Violation of this subsection shall be an infraction. (Ord. 856 § 2 (part), 1994).

8.50.040 Notice.
Whenever the chief of police or his designee determines that graffiti exists on any permanent structure in the city, which graffiti is visible from the street or other public or private property, he shall cause a notice to be issued to abate such nuisance. The property owner shall have ten (10) days after the date of the notice to remove the graffiti or the property will be subject to abatement by the city. (Ord. 856 § 2 (part), 1994).

8.50.050 Service of notice.
The notice to abate graffiti shall be served upon the owner(s) of the affected premises, as such owner’s name and address appears on the last equalized property tax assessment rolls of the county of San Mateo. In addition, if there is a commercial tenant using the premises, the notice shall also be served on said tenant. If there is no known address for the owner, the notice shall be sent in care of the property address. The notice required by this chapter may be served in any one of the following manners:

(a)    By personal service on the owner, occupant, or person in charge or control of the property;

(b)    By registered or certified mail addressed to the owner at the last known address of said owner. If this address is unknown, the notice will be sent to the property address. In addition, where the property is occupied, a copy of the notice shall be delivered to the occupant. (Ord. 856 § 2 (part), 1994).

8.50.060 Reimbursement of cost of labor and material.
In the event the property owner complies with the notice by the designated date or such continued date, as the chief of police or his designated representative approves, then the city shall reimburse the property owner his, her, or its cost of labor and materials up to a maximum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each incident of graffiti on the property. Receipts for labor and materials used must accompany the claim. The city shall not reimburse the property owner where the chief of police finds that the owner has persuaded, allowed, or encouraged the graffiti problem. Evidence thereof shall include such things as: the owner has permitted the property to remain unoccupied, has allowed uses conducive to the graffiti problem, or has failed to take reasonable security measures. (Ord. 856 § 2 (part), 1994).

8.50.070 Removal by city.
Upon failure of persons to comply with the notice to abate by the designated date, or such continued date thereafter as the chief of police or his designated representative approves, then the chief of police is authorized and directed to cause the graffiti to be abated by city forces or private contract, and the city or its private contractor is expressly authorized to enter upon the premises for such purposes. All reasonable efforts to minimize damage from such entry shall be taken by the city, and any paint used to obliterate graffiti shall be as close as practicable to background color(s). (Ord. 856 § 2 (part), 1994).

8.50.080 Liability for city’s cost of abatement.
Where the graffiti has been abated by the city due to the refusal or failure of the owner to do so, the owner shall reimburse the city for the actual cost of the removal of the graffiti. The costs to be reimbursed include labor, material, preparation of specifications and contracts, and inspection. (Ord. 856 § 2 (part), 1994).

8.50.090 Abatement of graffiti as a public nuisance.
As an alternate to summary abatement, the city may cause the graffiti to be abated pursuant to Chapter 8.04 of the Menlo Park Municipal Code relating to abatement of nuisances. (Ord. 845 § 2 (part), 1994).

8.53.010 Purpose.
It is found and declared that an inadequate supply of rental housing exists in the city and an increasing demand continues to grow for such housing based on the significant number of renters in the city. The increasing rents combined with a housing shortage places substantial pressure on the city residents who rent housing. The council finds that tenants have a right to a written lease and that a contractual relationship with a landlord may offer some needed assurances of stability and minimize displacement of tenants in a rental housing market affording tenants few and increasingly expensive options. (Ord. 1023 § 2 (part), 2016).

For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions apply:

8.56.010 Short title, authority and applicability.
(a)    This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "relocation assistance ordinance."

(b)    The requirements established pursuant to this chapter are adopted under the authority of California Constitution Article XI, Section 7, which provides: "A county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws," and in accordance with the purpose set forth in the ordinance codified in this chapter.

(c)    This chapter shall apply to the extent permitted by the statutes and laws of the state of California. (Ord. 1053 § 2 (part), 2019).

8.56.020 Purpose.
The primary purpose for relocation assistance is to minimize disruption to tenants and their families caused by a need for relocation by addressing financial impacts. Securing replacement housing generally requires a significant amount of money for expenses related to a physical move, such as first and last month’s rent and security deposits. Projects assisted with federal and state funds are subject to requirements to provide relocation assistance to households displaced by those projects. There is currently no state mandate for landlords to assist displaced tenants by compensating for relocation costs. While an unanticipated move may be challenging for any tenant, it is especially difficult for extremely low, very low and low income households. (Ord. 1053 § 2 (part), 2019).

8.56.030 Definitions.
The following words and terms as used in this chapter shall have the meaning respectively ascribed thereto:

8.56.050 Relocation assistance.
(a)    The landlord shall provide relocation assistance, where required by Section 8.56.040, to eligible residential households in accordance with the following requirements, unless an alternative mitigation strategy as defined in Section 8.56.090 has been approved by the city:

(1)    A full refund of a tenant’s security deposit, except for funds that may be necessary to repair tenant’s damage to property in rental units that will be reoccupied before undergoing renovation or demolition.

(2)    A sixty (60) day subscription to a rental agency service. The costs of a rental agency shall be fair and reasonable based on current market pricing.

(3)    The cash equivalent of three (3) months’ rent shall be paid to the residential household renting a unit. The amount to be paid shall be calculated at the time the relocation application is approved by the city based on the most recent Department of Housing and Urban Development’s fair market rent calculation for San Mateo County for a similar-sized unit with the same number of bedrooms.

(4)    Special-circumstances households will be paid one (1) additional month of rent for a maximum of four (4) months’ rent.

(5)    An administrative fee as set forth in Section 8.56.060(f). (Ord. 1053 § 2 (part), 2019).

8.56.060 Relocation assistance payments.
(a)    Third-Party Processing. The city shall hire a third-party agency to provide tenant relocation assistance. Landlord shall pay the fees for the third-party agency and shall deposit sufficient funds with the third-party agency and/or city (as determined by the city) when an application is filed to cover the estimated cost of the relocation assistance services. The third-party agency shall provide bilingual assistance, as necessary, and hold an informational meeting with tenants, respond to questions, verify current household incomes, disburse checks to eligible households and provide an accounting of disbursed funds to the landlord and city.

(b)    Payments Escrow Account. The landlord shall open an escrow account with an entity qualified to provide escrow services within the state of California and deposit relocation assistance funds into that account no later than thirty (30) days after filing an application that will be used by the third-party agency for relocation assistance payments to eligible residential households. The amount of the deposit shall be determined by the community development director or his/her designee and unused funds shall be returned to the landlord after all relocation assistance has been paid as verified by the third-party agency.

(c)    Relocation Assistance Claims. Tenants requesting relocation assistance must provide the necessary information to the third-party agency who will determine their eligibility for relocation assistance and eligible residential households must complete a claim form.

(d)    Payments to Eligible Residential Households. Relocation assistance is paid per rental unit, not per tenant. If multiple households or individuals occupy a rental unit, relocation assistance shall be paid to the household or individual entitled to occupy a rental unit under a valid lease or rental agreement (written or oral) with the landlord.

(e)    Verification of Payment. Before issuance of demolition permits, building permits or other city permits that would result in the removal of a rental unit subject to this chapter, the city must receive verification from the third-party agency that all eligible residential households who applied and qualified for assistance have received relocation assistance. This verification shall be submitted in a form acceptable to the city.

(f)    Administrative Costs. The city shall collect the administrative fee in an amount to be set by resolution of the city council. (Ord. 1053 § 2 (part), 2019).

(2)    A description of the application(s) being filed and a general time frame to complete the work described in the application;

(6)    Other information deemed necessary or desirable by the community development department.

(d)    Notice of Termination. Landlord shall provide a written notice of termination to all tenants subject to displacement pursuant to Civil Code Sections 1946 and 1946.1. (Ord. 1053 § 2 (part), 2019).

8.56.080 Landlord submittal requirements.
Concurrent with the filing of an application, the landlord shall provide the community development department with the address number of each unit in the rental development, the monthly rents for those units and the names of every member of the residential household who is a signatory on a written lease or rental agreement for that unit, the household income as shown on the lease or rental agreement and the number of household members included on the lease or rental agreement. Where there is no written lease or rental agreement, the landlord shall provide the name of every person the landlord considers to be a resident under an oral lease or rental agreement. (Ord. 1053 § 2 (part), 2019).

8.56.090 Alternative mitigation.
(a)    All applications governed by this section shall be required to submit the required information; however, the landlord may also submit an alternative mitigation strategy that meets the goals of this section. An alternative strategy may include, but shall not be limited to, providing other mitigation and concessions to tenants such as permanent relocation of displaced tenants into similar apartments on site or nearby, ongoing rent concessions or suitable notice and other elements of mitigation that would serve the goals and purposes of this chapter. Prior to submitting any alternative mitigation strategy, a landlord shall discuss the strategy with existing tenants and make good faith efforts to arrive at an alternative mitigation strategy that is acceptable to existing tenants. Evidence of tenant agreement with an alternative mitigation strategy may be submitted to the city for review. With each such alternative submission, the landlord shall provide complete information as determined necessary by the community development director.

After an alternative mitigation strategy is submitted, the landlord shall provide notice of the submission by regular and certified mail and posted on the door of each rental unit. Tenants shall have fourteen (14) days from the date notice is posted or mailed, whichever is later, to submit comments on the alternatives to the community development director.

Alternative mitigation proposals shall be approved or denied by the community development director. Within seven (7) days of the decision, the city shall provide notice of the decision to the landlord and all tenants. The landlord or tenants may appeal any decision of the community development director to the city manager or designee within fourteen (14) days after notice is provided.

(b)    Landlord’s temporary withdrawal of residential rental units from the market shall not be subject to this chapter for any units where, in the opinion of the community development director, the landlord has provided suitable alternative temporary replacement housing accommodations on site or nearby. (Ord. 1053 § 2 (part), 2019).

8.56.100 Administrative regulations.
The community development director may, from time to time, promulgate regulations implementing the provisions of this chapter, violations of which shall be considered a violation of this section. (Ord. 1053 § 2 (part), 2019).

8.56.110 Mitigation not exclusive.
Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to interfere with the city’s ability and/or obligation to require relocation assistance for displaced tenants who are not covered by this chapter. (Ord. 1053 § 2 (part), 2019).

8.56.120 Retaliation prohibited.
Commencement of eviction proceedings against a tenant for exercising his or her rights under this chapter shall be considered a retaliatory eviction. Under Civil Code Section 1942.5, it is illegal for a landlord to retaliate against a tenant for lawfully and peaceably exercising his or her legal rights. (Ord. 1053 § 2 (part), 2019).

8.56.130 Failure to comply.
A landlord’s failure to comply with any requirement of this chapter may be asserted by a tenant as an affirmative defense in an action brought by the landlord to recover possession of the rental unit. Additionally, any attempt to recover possession of a rental unit in violation of this chapter shall render the landlord liable to the tenant for damages permitted by law in a civil action for wrongful eviction. The tenant may also seek injunctive relief and money damages for wrongful eviction and/or failure to pay relocation assistance. A landlord may seek money damages for a tenant’s failure to reimburse relocation assistance if the tenant ultimately fails to vacate the rental unit after receipt of a notice of termination. The prevailing party in an action for wrongful eviction and/or failure to pay relocation assistance or reimburse relocation assistance shall recover costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. (Ord. 1053 § 2 (part), 2019).

9.14.010 Dangerous animal permit required.
(a)    No person shall knowingly keep, have, maintain, sell, trade, or let for hire an animal designated under the provisions of this chapter as dangerous without obtaining a dangerous animal permit from the animal control officer. The animal owner shall comply with all conditions of the dangerous animal permit including but not limited to all requirements of Section 9.14.040 of this chapter. Any animal which is finally determined to be dangerous under this chapter and for which a permit has not been issued shall be surrendered to an animal control officer for appropriate disposition including humane destruction.

(b)    If an animal control officer or peace officer has investigated and determined an animal is dangerous, the animal control officer and/or peace officer shall deliver written notice of such determination to the owner of the animal. Should the animal pose a threat to the public health and safety, an animal control officer may immediately impound the animal.

(c)    If, after investigation by an animal control officer or peace officer, that officer determines that probable cause does not exist to believe the animal is dangerous, any interested person may appeal that determination by submitting within five (5) calendar days of the decision a written request to the animal control officer or peace officer for a hearing and paying the required fee. The hearing shall be conducted according to the procedures set forth in Chapter 9.05 of this title.

(d)    In determining whether or not an animal shall be declared dangerous, the animal control officer, peace officer or hearing officer appointed pursuant to Chapter 9.05 of this title may consider whether any of the following mitigating factors are present in the particular case. At the time of the injury, attack or molestation, the person or animal suffering the injury, attack or molestation:

(1)    Provoked, tormented, teased, abused or assaulted the animal into the alleged behavior;

(2)    Committed a wilful trespass or other tort upon the private property of the owner or caretaker of the animal;

(3)    Threatened or committed an unjustified attack or assault against the owner, caretaker or person in control of the animal.

(e)    Upon receipt of written or oral notification by the animal control officer and/or peace officer that an animal is dangerous as defined by this chapter, the owner and/or possessor shall submit an application for a dangerous animal permit to the animal control officer within five (5) calendar days. The application for a permit shall contain the name of the applicant, applicant’s address, the applicant’s home and business phone numbers, the address and description of the proposed location of where the animal will be kept, if different from applicant’s, a complete description and a photograph of the animal. The permit shall contain all of the requirements of Section 9.14.040 of this chapter and any additional conditions or requirements deemed necessary by the animal control officer or peace officer to protect the public health or safety.

(f)    Should the owner of the animal wish to contest the dangerous animal designation, the owner may request a hearing to be conducted according to the procedures set forth in Chapter 9.05 of this title. The owner shall submit a written request for a dangerous animal hearing to the animal control officer and/or peace officer within five (5) calendar days of written notification by the animal control officer and/or peace officer that the animal has been declared dangerous. Should the owner not submit a request for a hearing within given five (5) calendar days of notification, the hearing process shall be deemed waived by the owner, and the dangerous animal declaration will be considered final by the county director of environmental services agency, or the city having jurisdiction. In that event, the county director of the environmental services agency or the city having jurisdiction may allow the dangerous animal permit to be issued without a hearing. Unless a dangerous animal permit is immediately obtained, the animal shall be impounded at the owner’s expense pending appropriate disposition as determined by the animal control officer and/or peace officer.

(a)    No person shall keep, have, maintain, sell, trade or let for hire an animal designated as vicious, pursuant to this chapter.

(b)    If an animal control officer and/or peace officer has investigated and determined that an animal is vicious, the animal control officer and/or peace officer shall deliver to the owner of the animal written notice of that determination. The animal control officer and/or peace officer shall immediately impound or cause to be impounded the animal, and shall cause the animal to be humanely destroyed unless the owner requests a hearing under subsection (c) of this section.

(c)    If the owner of the animal disputes the designation of an animal as a vicious animal by the animal control officer and/or peace officer (s)he may submit a written request for a hearing to the animal control officer and/or peace officer within five (5) calendar days of notification. Such hearing shall be conducted according to the procedures set forth in Chapter 9.05 of this title. Failure of the owner to request a hearing shall result in the animal being declared vicious and humanely destroyed. The vicious animal declaration will be considered final by the county director of the environmental services agency, or the city having jurisdiction.

(d)    If, after investigation by an animal control officer or peace officer, that officer determines that probable cause does not exist to believe that the animal is vicious, any interested person may appeal that determination by submitting within five (5) calendar days of the decision a written request to the animal control officer or peace officer for a hearing and paying the required fee.

(e)    In determining whether or not an animal shall be declared vicious, the animal control officer, peace officer or hearing officer may consider, as a mitigating factor, whether at the time of the injury, attack or behavior, the person or animal suffering the injury, attack or behavior for which the animal is being determined vicious:

The fee for such permit shall be as set forth in Chapter 9.20 of this title. This fee shall not be refundable.

(c)    If the owner or permittee has a history of multiple violations of this title or of the conditions of any previously issued dangerous animal permit, the animal control officer or hearing officer may deny and impound the animal for appropriate disposition as determined by the animal control officer or hearing officer. (Ord. 943 § 5 (part), 2006).

9.14.040 Mandatory dangerous animal permit requirements.

(1)    When the animal is off the property of its owner, the owner must ensure that the animal is restrained with a leash not to exceed four feet (4’) in length and having a minimum tensile strength of three hundred (300) pounds and shall be under the direct control and supervision of the owner or a person of such age, size and strength as can easily control such animal. Extraordinary care shall be taken by the owner to ensure that such restraint is sufficient to control the animal in a manner which it will not endanger other persons or animals.

(2)    The owner shall maintain the animal so that it is not a threat to any mail carrier, sanitation worker, meter person, or other person who has the lawful right to enter the property.

(3)    The owner shall ensure that the animal is not kept upon any unenclosed premises unless it is leashed and controlled by a person capable of controlling such animal. The owner shall ensure that the animal is not allowed to be tethered, tied or staked on any unenclosed premises. The owner shall ensure that the animal is not kept in a house or structure when the windows or doors are open or screen doors are the only obstacles preventing the animal from exiting the structure.

(4)    The owner shall ensure that the animal is kept in a fenced yard, kennel, run or enclosure approved by the animal control officer. The owner shall ensure that all structures used to confine the animals must be locked with a key or combination lock when such animals are within the structure. The owner shall regularly inspect the fenced yard, kennel, run or enclosure to ensure that it is secure to maintain the animal.

(5)    The owner shall open premises upon which an animal is maintained at any reasonable hour for inspection by the animal control officer or peace officer and such premises shall be surrendered for inspection by the permittee upon the request of the animal control officer or peace officer.

Payment of such fee is the responsibility of the animal owner(s), and shall be utilized by the animal control program to offset the cost of the chip and to maintain the registration program.

(10)    The owner shall have the animal spayed or neutered by a licensed veterinarian, at the owner’s expense, within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date the permit was issued. The owner shall present written proof to the animal control officer that the surgery was performed.

(3)    The owner has changed the location of his residence or his place of business or sells, assigns, transfers, donates, leases, or otherwise disposes of the animal for which the permit was issued.

12.42.11 Statutory authorization.
The legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560 and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

12.42.12 Finding of fact.
(a)    The flood hazard areas of the city of Menlo Park are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

(b)    These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

12.42.13 Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:

(1)    To protect human life and health;

(2)    To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

(3)    To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

(4)    To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

(5)    To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

(6)    To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

(7)    To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

(8)    To insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

12.42.14 Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

(1)    Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

(2)    Requiring that uses vulnerable to flood, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

(3)    Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

(4)    Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and,

(5)    Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

12.42.20 Definitions.

The base flood depths range from one (1) to three (3) feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

(4)    "Area of special flood hazard." See "Special flood hazard area."

(5)    "Base flood elevation (BFE)" means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map for zones AE, AH, A1-30, VE and V1-V30 that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent (1%) or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

(6)    "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

(7)    "Breakaway walls" are any type of walls, whether solid or lattice, and whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic or any other suitable building materials, which are not part of the structural support of the building and which are designed to break away under abnormally high tides or wave action without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by floodwaters. A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than ten (10) and no more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions:

(A)    Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

(B)    The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood.

(8)    "Building." See "structure."

(9)    "Coastal high hazard area" means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources.

(11)    "Encroachment" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.

(12)    "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.

(13)    "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

(14)    "Flood, flooding, or floodwater" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from (A) the overflow of floodwaters; (B) the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or (C) the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in this definition.

(15)    "Flood boundary and floodway map" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of flood hazard and the floodway.

(16)    "Flood hazard boundary map" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards.

(17)    "Flood insurance rate map" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

(18)    "Flood insurance study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the FIRM, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood and supporting technical data.

(19)    "Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of "flooding").

(20)    "Floodplain administrator" means the community official designated by title to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations.

(21)    "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations and open space plans.

(22)    "Floodplain management regulations" means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. This term describes such federal, state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.

(23)    "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to nonresidential structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.

(24)    "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway."

(25)    "Floodway fringe" means that area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted.

(26)    "Fraud and victimization," as related to Section 12.42.61, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

(27)    "Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

(28)    "Governing body" means the local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.

(29)    "Hardship," as related to Section 12.42.61, means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere, or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

(30)    "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

(31)    "Historic structure" means any structure that is:

(C)    Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or

(D)    Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

(32)    "Levee" means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.

(33)    "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices.

(34)    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "basement" definition).

(A)    An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable nonelevation design requirements, including, but not limited to:

(i)    The wet floodproofing standard in Section 12.42.51(3)(C);

(ii)    The anchoring standards in Section 12.42.51(1);

(iii)    The construction materials and methods standards in Section 12.42.51(2);

(iv)    The standards for utilities in Section 12.42.52.

(B)    For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements. This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas.

(Note: This definition allows attached garages to be built at grade. Below grade garages are not allowed as they are considered to be basements.)

(35)    "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days.

(36)    "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for sale or rent.

(37)    "Market value" is defined in the city of Menlo Park’s substantial damage/improvement procedures.

(38)    "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are referenced.

(39)    "New construction" means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by this community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structure.

(40)    "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community.

(41)    "Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.

(42)    "One-hundred-year flood" or "100-year flood" means a flood which has a one percent (1%) annual probability of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. It is identical to the "base flood," which will be the term used throughout this chapter.

(43)    "Person" means an individual or his agent, firm, partnership, association or corporation, or agent of the aforementioned groups, or this state or its agencies or political subdivisions.

(44)    "Primary frontal dune" means a continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and adjacent to the beach and subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during major coastal storms. The inland limit of the primary frontal dune occurs at the point where there is a distinct change from a relatively mild slope.

(45)    "Public safety and nuisance," as related to Section 12.42.62, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage of use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, river, bay, stream, canal or basin.

(46)    "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is:

(A)    Built on a single chassis;

(B)    Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

(C)    Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and

(D)    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

(47)    "Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot.

(48)    "Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.

(49)    "Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc.

(50)    "Sand dunes" mean naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach.

(51)    "Sheet flow area." See "area of shallow flooding."

(52)    "Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area having special flood or flood related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, AR, AO, AH, E, M, V1-V30, VO, VE or V.

(53)    "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development, and means the date the building permit was issued; provided, the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the state of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation of the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

(54)    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

(55)    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

(56)    "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure either:

(A)    Before the improvement or repair is started; or

(B)    If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed.

For the purpose of this definition "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either:

(A)    Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code violations identified by the building official and are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

12.42.31 Lands to which this chapter applies.
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city of Menlo Park. (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

12.42.32 Basis for establishing the areas of special flood concern.
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the flood insurance study (FIS) dated August 4, 1980, and accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) and flood boundary and floodway maps (FBFMs) dated February 4, 1981, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city by the floodplain administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at the City of Menlo Park Public Works Department, 701 Laurel Street, Menlo Park, CA 94025. (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

12.42.33 Compliance.
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

12.42.34 Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

12.42.35 Interpretation.

(3)    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

12.42.36 Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Large floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards, or uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of Menlo Park, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

12.42.37 Severability.
This chapter and the various parts thereof are declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

(e)    All appropriate certifications listed in Section 12.42.43(7). (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

12.42.42 Designation of the floodplain administrator.
The public works director/city engineer is appointed to administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions. (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

12.42.43 Duties and responsibilities of floodplain administrator.
The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to:

(1)    Permit Review.

(A)    Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this ordinance have been satisfied;

(B)    All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;

(C)    The site is reasonably safe from flooding;

(D)    The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point.

(E)    All letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition.

(2)    Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures.

(A)    Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "market value."

(B)    Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff.

(3)    Review, Use, and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 12.42.32, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer Sections 12.42.51 through 12.42.56. Any such information shall be submitted to the city council for adoption.

NOTE: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one (1) of two (2) methods from the FEMA publication FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas – A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995.

(4)    Whenever a watercourse is to be altered or relocated:

(A)    Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to such alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and

(B)    Require that the flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.

(5)    Base Flood Elevation Changes Due to Physical Alterations.

(A)    Within six (6) months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR).

(B)    All LOMR’s for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data.

(6)    Changes in Corporate Boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits.

(7)    Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed:

(A)    The certification required in Section 12.42.51(3)(B) (lowest floor elevations);

(B)    The certification required in Section 12.42.51(3)(C)(iii) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures);

(C)    The certification required in Section 12.42.51(3)(D)(i) or (3)(D)(ii) (wet floodproofing standard);

(D)    The certification required in Section 12.42.53(b) (subdivision standards);

(E)    The certification required in Section 12.42.55(1) (floodway encroachments);

(F)    Information required by Section 12.42.56 (coastal construction standards).

(8)    Make interpretations where needed, as to the location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards. Where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, grade and base flood elevations shall be used to determine the boundaries of the special flood hazard area. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Sections 12.42.61 and 12.42.62.

(9)    Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 12.42.33. (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

12.42.55 Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 12.42.32 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is in an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

(1)    Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

(2)    If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 12.42.51 through 12.42.56. (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

12.42.56 Coastal high hazard areas.
Within coastal high hazard areas, as established under Section 12.42.32, the following standards shall apply:

(1)    All new construction and substantial improvement shall be elevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns and securely anchored to such pilings or columns so that the lowest horizontal portion of the structural members of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level. The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or local building standards.

(2)    All new construction and other development shall be located on the landward side of the reach of mean high tide.

(3)    All new construction and substantial improvement shall have the space below the lowest floor free of obstructions or constructed with breakaway walls in accordance with FEMA Technical Bulletins 5-93 and 9-99 as amended or revised and as defined in Section 12.42.20. Such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation and will be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage.

(4)    Fill shall not be used for structural support of buildings.

(5)    Manmade alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage is prohibited.

(6)    The floodplain administrator shall obtain and maintain the following records:

(A)    Certification by a registered engineer or architect that a proposed structure complies with subsection (1) of this section.

(B)    The elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings or columns) of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether such structures contain a basement. (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

12.42.61 Appeals and variances.
(a)    The planning commission of the city of Menlo Park shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. Decisions of the planning commission may be appealed to the city council pursuant to Chapter 16.86.

(b)    The planning commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirements, decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. Decisions of the planning commission may be appealed to the city council pursuant to Chapter 16.86.

(c)    In passing upon requests for variances or appeals from decisions of the floodplain administrator, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

(1)    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

(2)    The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

(3)    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;

(4)    The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

(5)    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

(6)    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

(7)    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

(8)    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

(9)    The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

(10)    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and

(11)    The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.

(d)    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures below the base flood level, providing subsections (c)(1) through (11) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

(e)    Upon consideration of the factors designated in subsection (c) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the planning commission and city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

(f)    The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 1022 § 8 (part), 2016).

12.42.62 Variance conditions and requirements.
(a)    Variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation or restoration of historic structures, as defined in Section 12.42.20, listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair, rehabilitation or restoration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

(b)    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(c)    Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means that the planning commission need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the planning commission believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.

(d)    Variances shall only be issued upon:

(1)    A showing of good and sufficient cause;

(2)    A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

(3)    A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of, the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

12.44.080 Water budget calculations.
Project applicant may elect to complete a water budget calculation for the landscape project using the water-efficient landscape worksheet in Appendix B attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter.

Water budget calculations, if prepared, shall adhere to the following requirements:

(1)    The plant factor used shall be from WUCOLS or from horticultural researchers with academic institutions or professional associations as approved by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR). The plant factor ranges from 0 to 0.1 for very low water using plants, from 0.1 to 0.3 for low water use plants, from 0.4 to 0.6 for moderate water use plants, and from 0.7 to 1.0 for high water use plants.

(2)    All water features shall be included in the high water use hydrozone and temporarily irrigated areas shall be included in the low water use hydrozone.

(3)    All special landscape areas (SLA) shall be identified and their water use included in the water budget calculations.

(4)    The reference evapotranspiration adjustment factor (ETAF) for SLA shall not exceed 1.0. The ETAF for all other landscaped areas shall not exceed 0.55 for residential areas and 0.45 for nonresidential areas.

(5)    ETo values from the reference evapotranspiration table in Appendix A attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be used in calculating the maximum applied water allowance (MAWA) and estimated total water use (ETWU). For geographic areas not covered in Appendix A attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter, use data from other cities located nearby in the same reference evapotranspiration zone, as found in the CIMIS Reference Evapotranspiration Zones Map, Department of Water Resources, 1999. For the purpose of determining estimated total water use, average irrigation efficiency is assumed to be 0.75 for overhead spray devices and 0.81 for drip system devices.

(6)    MAWA shall be calculated using the equation below:

MAWA = (ETo) (0.62) [(0.55 x LA) + (0.45 x SLA)] for residential areas

MAWA = (ETo) (0.62) [(0.45 x LA) + (0.55 x SLA)] for nonresidential areas

Where:

MAWA = Maximum applied water allowance (gallons per year)

ETo = Reference evapotranspiration (inches per year)

0.62 = Conversion factor (to gallons)

0.55 = Reference evapotranspiration adjustment factor (ETAF) for residential areas

0.45 = Reference evapotranspiration adjustment factor (ETAF) for nonresidential areas

LA = Landscape area including SLA (square feet)

0.45 = Additional water allowance for SLA in residential areas

0.55 = Additional water allowance for SLA in nonresidential areas

SLA = Special landscape area (square feet)

(7)    A local agency or project applicant may consider effective precipitation (twenty-five percent (25%) of annual precipitation) in tracking water use and may use the following equation to calculate the MAWA:

(A)    MAWA = (ETo - Eppt) (0.62) [(0.55 x LA) + (0.45 x SLA)] for residential areas.

(B)    MAWA = (ETo - EPPT) (0.62) [(0.45 x LA) + (0.55 x SLA)] for nonresidential areas.

(8)    Estimated total water use (ETWU) will be calculated using the equation below. The sum of the ETWU calculated for all hydrozones will not exceed the MAWA.

Where:

ETWU = Estimated total water use per year (gallons)

ETo = Reference evapotranspiration (inches)

PF = Plant factor from WUCOLS (see Section 12.44.030, Definitions)

HA = Hydrozone area [high, medium, and low water use areas] (square feet)

0.75 = Irrigation efficiency (IE) for overhead spray devices

0.81 = Irrigation efficiency (IE) for drip system devices

SLA = Special landscape area (square feet)

0.62 = Conversion factor

(Ord. 1015 § 3 (part), 2016).

12.44.100 Irrigation design plan.
(a)    This section applies to landscaped areas requiring permanent irrigation, not areas that require temporary irrigation solely for the plant establishment period. For the efficient use of water, an irrigation system shall meet all the requirements listed in this section and the manufacturers’ recommendations. The irrigation system and its related components shall be planned and designed to allow for proper installation, management, and maintenance. An irrigation design plan meeting the following design criteria shall be submitted as part of the landscape documentation package.

A landscape water meter may be either:

(i)    A customer service meter dedicated to landscape use provided by the local water purveyor; or

(ii)    A privately owned meter or submeter.

(B)    Automatic irrigation controllers utilizing either evapotranspiration or soil moisture sensor data utilizing nonvolatile memory shall be required for irrigation scheduling in all irrigation systems.

(C)    If the water pressure is below or exceeds the recommended pressure of the specified irrigation devices, the installation of a pressure regulating device is required to ensure that the dynamic pressure at each emission device is within the manufacturer’s recommended pressure range for optimal performance.

(ii)    Static water pressure, dynamic or operating pressure, and flow reading of the water supply shall be measured at the point of connection. These pressure and flow measurements shall be conducted at the design stage. If the measurements are not available at the design stage, the measurements shall be conducted at installation.

(D)    Sensors (rain, freeze, wind, etc.), either integral or auxiliary, that suspend or alter irrigation operation during unfavorable weather conditions shall be required on all irrigation systems, as appropriate for local climatic conditions. Irrigation should be avoided during windy or freezing weather or during rain.

(E)    Manual shut-off valves (such as a gate valve, ball valve, or butterfly valve) shall be required, as close as possible to the point of connection of the water supply, to minimize water loss in case of an emergency (such as a main line break) or routine repair.

(F)    Backflow prevention devices shall be required to protect the water supply from contamination by the irrigation system. A project applicant shall refer to the applicable local agency code (i.e., public health) for additional backflow prevention requirements.

(G)    Flow sensors that detect high flow conditions created by system damage or malfunction are required for all on nonresidential landscapes and residential landscapes of five thousand (5,000) square feet or larger.

(H)    Master shut-off valves are required on all projects except landscapes that make use of technologies that allow for the individual control of sprinklers that are individually pressurized in a system equipped with low pressure shut down features.

(I)    The irrigation system shall be designed to prevent runoff, low head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where irrigation water flows onto nontargeted areas, such as adjacent property, nonirrigated areas, hardscapes, roadways, or structures.

All sprinkler heads installed in the landscape must document a distribution uniformity low quarter of 0.65 or higher using the protocol defined in ASABE/ICC 802-2014.

(N)    It is highly recommended that the project applicant or local agency inquire with the local water purveyor about peak water operating demands (on the water supply system) or water restrictions that may impact the effectiveness of the irrigation system.

(O)    In mulched planting areas, the use of low volume irrigation is required to maximize water infiltration into the root zone.

(P)    Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall have matched precipitation rates, unless otherwise directed by the manufacturer’s recommendations.

(Q)    Head to head coverage is recommended. However, sprinkler spacing shall be designed to achieve the highest possible distribution uniformity using the manufacturer’s recommendations.

(U)    Overhead irrigation shall not be permitted within twenty-four (24) inches of any nonpermeable surface. Allowable irrigation within the setback from nonpermeable surfaces may include drip, drip line, or other low flow nonspray technology. The setback area may be planted or unplanted. The surfacing of the setback may be mulch, gravel, or other porous material. These restrictions may be modified if:

(i)    The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no runoff occurs; or

(ii)    The adjacent nonpermeable surfaces are designed and constructed to drain entirely to landscaping; or

(iii)    The irrigation designer specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of the landscape documentation package, and clearly demonstrates strict adherence to irrigation system design criteria in subsection (a)(1) of this section. Prevention of overspray and runoff must be confirmed during the irrigation audit.

(V)    Slopes greater than twenty-five percent (25%) shall not be irrigated with an irrigation system with an application rate exceeding 0.75 inches per hour. This restriction may be modified if the landscape designer specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of the landscape documentation package, and clearly demonstrates no runoff or erosion will occur. Prevention of runoff and erosion must be confirmed during the irrigation audit.

(2)    Hydrozone.

(A)    Each valve shall irrigate a hydrozone with similar site, slope, sun exposure, soil conditions, and plant materials with similar water use.

(B)    Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall be selected based on what is appropriate for the plant type within that hydrozone.

(D)    Individual hydrozones that mix plants of moderate and low water use, or moderate and high water use, may be allowed if:

(i)    Plant factor calculation is based on the proportions of the respective plant water uses and their plant factor; or

(ii)    The plant factor of the higher water using plant is used for calculations.

(E)    Individual hydrozones that mix high and low water use plants shall not be permitted.

(F)    On the landscape design plan and irrigation design plan, hydrozone areas shall be designated by number, letter, or other designation. On the irrigation design plan, designate the areas irrigated by each valve, and assign a number to each valve. Use this valve number in the hydrozone information table (see Appendix B, Section A, attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter). This table can also assist with the irrigation audit and programming the controller.

(b)    The irrigation design plan, at a minimum, shall contain:

(1)    Location and size of separate water meters for landscape;

(2)    Location, type and size of all components of the irrigation system, including controllers, main and lateral lines, valves, sprinkler heads, moisture sensing devices, rain switches, quick couplers, pressure regulators, and backflow prevention devices;

13.04.070    Appeals.

13.04.080    Penalty for violation of chapter.

13.04.010 Purpose of chapter.
It is recognized that, generally, provisions must be made for vehicular access to private property from streets and alleys, but in so doing, due consideration must be given to pedestrian and vehicle safety, the need for on-street parking spaces and the resulting interference with the movement of vehicular traffic and interference with public improvements.

In establishing permissible curb cuts and sidewalk driveway crossings for access to private property, it shall be the policy of the city to authorize the same only where they are necessary and only where they would not unreasonably interfere with the rights of the public in the adjacent street or alley or unreasonably interfere with vehicular traffic or unreasonably eliminate on-street parking spaces. (Prior code § 23.1).

13.04.020 Curb cut defined.
"Curb cut" as used in this chapter shall include the making of an opening in or through any existing curb and the leaving of voids in curbs when the same are constructed in any street or alley. (Prior code § 23.2).

13.04.030 Major city thoroughfares.
Major city thoroughfares shall be designated by the City Council by ordinance or resolution. That portion of Sand Hill Road within the city limits lying westerly of Sharon Park Drive to the city limits is hereby designated as a major city thoroughfare. (Prior code § 23.3).

13.04.040 Permit required.
It is unlawful for any person (natural or corporate) to cut, break or remove any curbing or sidewalk or cause the same to be done or to install, construct, use or maintain any driveway or any means of access or ingress to or egress from any parcel of private property to any public street or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a permit to do so from the superintendent of streets.

If the public street referred to in this section is a "major city thoroughfare," as defined in Section 13.04.030, the permit required by this section shall be granted only by a majority vote of the City Council. The City Council may, in its discretion, refer any application for such permit to the traffic safety commission of the city for a report and recommendation; provided, however, that the City Council shall act upon any such application within forty-five days of the filing date thereof with the city clerk, unless the applicant consents to an extension of time to so act. (Prior code § 23.4).

13.04.050 Regulations.
No permit issued under Section 13.04.030shall be in conflict with the following regulations:

(1)    The maximum width of any driveway or curb cut shall not be more than thirty feet as measured at the top of the curbing;

(2)    The minimum distance between driveways or between curb cuts serving the same lot or parcel of land shall be not less than twenty-two feet as measured at the top of the curbing;

(3)    Not to exceed fifty percent of the frontage upon any street of the lot or lots or parcel of land to be served thereby shall be devoted to driveways or curb cuts;

(4)    No driveway shall be located so as to interfere with intersecting sidewalks, traffic signals, lampposts, fire hydrants or other public improvements;

(5)    No driveway or curb cut shall be located within twenty-eight feet of the nearest boundary of any intersection as such boundary is defined by the superintendent of streets or within any curb return;

(6)    No driveway or curb cut shall be located within two feet of the extensions of the prolonged property line as defined by the superintendent of streets;

(7)    No permit shall be issued to remove any curbing unless a concrete driveway between curbing and sidewalk is to be installed;

(8)    The necessary adjustments to utility facilities, light standards, fire hydrants, catch basins, street or railway signs, signals or other public improvements or installations shall be accomplished without cost to the city;

(9)    All work shall be done under the supervision of the superintendent of streets and in accordance with city specifications in effect at the time of such work. Forms shall be inspected by the city before any concrete is poured. All debris and surplus materials shall be promptly removed upon completion of all the work;

(10)    The applicant shall maintain the premises in a safe manner, and shall provide adequate barricades and lights at his own expense to protect the safety of the public using the adjacent streets or sidewalks and shall hold the city free from any damages incurred by his operations;

(11)    Before any permit shall be issued to remove curbs or install driveways, an inspection fee in an amount established by resolution of the City Council shall be paid to the city;

(12)    Whenever conditions at the site of a proposed driveway or curb cut are such that, in the opinion of the superintendent of streets, strict adherence to the latter of these regulations would be in conflict with Section 13.04.010, then the superintendent of streets may either issue or refuse to issue the requested permit as may be necessary to eliminate such conflict. Should the applicant wish to appeal the decision of the superintendent of streets, he may do so under the provisions of Section 13.04.070;

(13)    The council shall have the authority to rescind any permit heretofore or hereafter granted for a curb cut or sidewalk installation when it finds such action to be in the public interest. (Prior code § 23.5).

13.04.060 Authority of superintendent of streets to order property owner to correct curb cuts.
When the use, convenience and necessity of the public require it or when the use of a driveway or a curb cut ceases, the superintendent of streets shall have the authority to order the owner of the property adjacent to which curb cuts are maintained to alter or eliminate the curb cut in such manner as he shall find reasonably necessary under the circumstances. The order in question shall be addressed to the owner of the property in question, mailed by registered mail and shall give the owner twenty days within which to make such changes. In the event of the failure of the owner to act as required by such notice, the city may perform such work as is necessary and charge to the owner thereof the reasonable cost thereof. (Prior code § 23.6).

13.04.070 Appeals.
In cases where the applicant for a permit required by Section 13.04.040 deems himself aggrieved, appeal may be made to the City Council. The City Council shall have the power to vary, by resolution, the mandatory provisions of this article or to modify or reverse the decision of the superintendent of streets in any specific case in such manner that substantial justice is done and the spirit and purpose of this chapter is upheld.

Such appeal shall be made in writing to the council by filing with the city clerk a written notice of such appeal, setting forth specific grounds or basis thereof. Such notice must be filed within thirty days after such action appealed from. The city clerk shall forthwith set such matter for hearing before the council and cause notice thereof to be given to the applicant not less than five days prior to such hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall show cause, on the grounds specified in the notice of appeal, why the action excepted to should not be approved. The council may continue such hearing from time to time and its findings on appeal shall be final and conclusive in the matter. (Prior code § 23.7).

13.04.080 Penalty for violation of chapter.
It is unlawful for any person to violate any of the provisions of this chapter or any permit issued pursuant thereto or to cause, permit or suffer the same to be done; and any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter or any permit issued under this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor and each such person shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for each and every day or portion thereof during which any violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or such permit is committed, continued or permitted and upon conviction of any such violation, such person is punishable as provided in Section 1.12.010. (Prior code § 23.8).

13.24.070    Enforcement—Remedies for violation.

13.24.010 Intent and purpose.
This chapter is adopted because the city has been forested by stands of oak, bay and other trees, the preservation of which is necessary for the health and welfare of the citizens of this city in order to preserve the scenic beauty and historical value of trees, prevent erosion of topsoil and sedimentation in waterways, protect against flood hazards and landslides, counteract the pollutants in the air, maintain the climatic balance and decrease wind velocities. It is the intent of this chapter to establish regulations for the removal of heritage trees within the city in order to retain as many trees as possible consistent with the purpose of this chapter and the reasonable economic enjoyment of private property. (Ord. 928 § 1 (part), 2004).

13.24.020 Heritage tree defined.
As used in this chapter "heritage tree" means:

(1)    A tree or group of trees of historical significance, special character or community benefit, specifically designated by resolution of the city council;

(2)    An oak tree (Quercus) which is native to California and has a trunk with a circumference of 31.4 inches (diameter of ten (10) inches) or more, measured at fifty-four (54) inches above natural grade. Trees with more than one trunk shall be measured at the point where the trunks divide, with the exception of trees that are under twelve (12) feet in height, which will be exempt from this section.

(3)    All trees other than oaks which have a trunk with a circumference of 47.1 inches (diameter of fifteen (15) inches) or more, measured fifty-four (54) inches above natural grade. Trees with more than one trunk shall be measured at the point where the trunks divide, with the exception of trees that are under twelve (12) feet in height, which will be exempt from this section. (Ord. 928 § 1 (part), 2004).

13.24.025 Maintenance and preservation of heritage trees.
Any person who owns, controls, has custody or possession of any real property within the city shall use reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve all heritage trees located thereon in a state of good health pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Failure to do so shall constitute a violation of this chapter. Any person who conducts any grading, excavation, demolition or construction activity on property shall do so in such a manner as to not threaten the health or viability or cause the removal of any heritage tree. Any work performed within an area ten (10) times the diameter of the tree (i.e., the tree protection zone) shall require submittal of a tree protection plan for review and approval by the director of community development or his or her designee prior to issuance of any permit for grading or construction. The tree protection plan shall be prepared by a certified arborist and shall address issues related to protective fencing and protective techniques to minimize impacts associated with grading, excavation, demolition and construction. The director of community development or his or her designee may impose conditions on any city permit to assure compliance with this section. (Ord. 928 § 1 (part), 2004).

13.24.030 Removal and major pruning of heritage trees prohibited.
It is unlawful for any person to remove, or cause to be removed any heritage tree from any parcel of property in the city, or prune more than one-fourth of the branches or roots within a twelve (12) month period, without obtaining a permit; provided, that in case of emergency, when a tree is imminently hazardous or dangerous to life or property, it may be removed by order of the police chief, fire chief, the director of public works or their respective designees. Any person who vandalizes, grievously mutilates, destroys or unbalances a heritage tree without a permit or beyond the scope of an approved permit shall be in violation of this chapter. (Ord. 928 § 1 (part), 2004).

13.24.040 Permits.
Any person desiring to remove one or more heritage trees or perform major pruning as described in Section 13.24.030 shall apply for a permit pursuant to procedures established by the director of public works and shall pay a fee established by the city council. It is the joint responsibility of the property owner and party removing the heritage tree or trees, or portions thereof to obtain the permit. The director of public works or his or her designee may only issue a permit for the removal or major pruning of a heritage tree if he or she determines there is good cause for such action. In determining whether there is good cause, the director of public works or his or her designee shall give consideration to the following:

(1)    The condition of the tree or trees with respect to disease, danger of falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures and interference with utility services;

(2)    The necessity to remove the tree or trees in order to construct proposed improvements to the property;

(3)    The topography of the land and the effect of the removal of the tree on erosion, soil retention and diversion or increased flow of surface waters;

(4)    The long-term value of the species under consideration, particularly lifespan and growth rate;

(5)    The ecological value of the tree or group of trees, such as food, nesting, habitat, protection and shade for wildlife or other plant species;

(6)    The number, size, species, age distribution and location of existing trees in the area and the effect the removal would have upon shade, privacy impact and scenic beauty;

(7)    The number of trees the particular parcel can adequately support according to good arboricultural practices;

(8)    The availability of reasonable and feasible alternatives that would allow for the preservation of the tree(s). (Ord. 928 § 1 (part), 2004).

13.24.060 Appeals.
Any Menlo Park resident or property owner may appeal the decision of the director of public works or his or her designee to the environmental quality commission in writing within fifteen (15) days after his or her decision. Such a request shall be submitted to the city clerk and it shall state the reasons for the appeal. The matter will be reviewed by the commission at its earliest opportunity. Any Menlo Park resident or property owner may appeal the decision of the environmental quality commission to the city council in writing within fifteen (15) days after the decision of the commission. Such a request shall be submitted to the city clerk and it shall state the reasons for the appeal. The matter will be reviewed by the city council at its earliest opportunity. A permit shall not be issued until all appeals are completed and/or the time for filing an appeal has expired. (Ord. 928 § 1 (part), 2004).

13.24.070 Enforcement—Remedies for violation.
In addition to all other remedies set forth in this code or otherwise provided by law, the following remedies shall be available to the city for violation of this chapter:

(1)    If a violation occurs during development, the city may issue a stop work order suspending and prohibiting further activity on the property pursuant to the grading, demolition, and/or building permit(s) (including construction, inspection and issuance of certificates of occupancy) until a mitigation plan has been filed with and approved by the director of community development or his or her designee, agreed to in writing by the property owner(s), and either implemented or guaranteed by the posting of adequate security. The mitigation plan shall include measures for protection of any remaining trees on the property, and shall provide for replacement of each tree removed or heavily damaged on the property or at locations approved by the director of community development or his or her designee and by the director of public works, if replacement is to occur on public property. The replacement ratio shall be determined by the director of community development or his or her designee and shall be at a greater ratio than that required where tree removal is permitted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

(2)    If a violation occurs in the absence of development, or while an application for a building permit or discretionary development approval for the lot upon which the tree is located is pending, the director of community development or his or her designee may issue a temporary moratorium on development of the subject property, not to exceed eighteen (18) months from the date the violation occurred. The purpose of the moratorium is to provide the city an opportunity to study and determine appropriate mitigation measures for the tree removal, and to ensure measures are incorporated into any future development approvals for the property. Mitigation measures as determined by the director of community development or his or her designee shall be imposed as a condition of any subsequent permits for development on the subject property.

(3)    As part of a civil action brought by the city, a court may assess against any person who commits, allows, or maintains a violation of any provision of this chapter a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per violation. Where the violation has resulted in removal of a tree, the civil penalty shall be in an amount not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per tree unlawfully removed, or the replacement value of each such tree, whichever amount is higher. Such amount shall be payable to the city. Replacement value for the purposes of this section shall be determined utilizing the most recent edition of the Guide for Plant Appraisal, published by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers. Regarding injunctive relief, a civil action may be commenced to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such violation. In any civil action brought pursuant to this chapter in which the city prevails, the court shall award to the city all costs of investigation and preparation for trial, the costs of trial, reasonable expenses including overhead and administrative costs incurred in prosecuting the action, and reasonable attorney fees. (Ord. 928 § 1 (part), 2004).

13.26.010 Authority.
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the Mitigation Fee Act contained in Government Code Section 66000 et seq. (Ord. 964 § 2 (part), 2009)

13.26.020 Application.
This chapter applies to fees charged as a requirement of development approval to defray the cost of certain transportation improvements required to serve development within the city of Menlo Park. This chapter does not replace normal subdivision map exactions or other measures required to mitigate site-specific impacts of a development project including, but not limited to, mitigations pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act; regulatory and processing fees; fees required pursuant to a development agreement; funds collected pursuant to a reimbursement agreement that exceed the developer’s share of public improvement costs; or assessment district proceedings, benefit assessments, or taxes. (Ord. 964 § 2 (part), 2009)

13.26.030 Intent and purpose.
The city council of the city of Menlo Park declares that:

(a)    Adequate transportation improvements are needed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens to facilitate transportation and to promote economic well being within the city;

(b)    The city of Menlo Park provides transportation improvements and services for residents, businesses, and employees within the city;

(c)    Individual transportation improvements are part of an integrated system serving and providing benefits to the entire city;

(d)    Improvements to the existing transportation systems in the city are needed to mitigate the cumulative impacts of developments;

(e)    All types of development require and use the transportation system;

(f)    It is the stated goal of the general plan that level of service D or better shall be maintained at all city-controlled signalized intersections during peak hours, except at the intersection of Ravenswood Avenue and Middlefield Road and at intersections along Willow Road from Middlefield Road to U.S. 101, as defined in the City of Menlo Park General Plan;

(g)    There are not adequate public funds available to maintain the level of service as defined in the general plan in the city;

(h)    In order to ensure that the level of service as stated in the general plan is maintained, and to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the community, it is necessary that development pay a fee representing its share of costs of the necessary improvements;

(i)    The traffic impact fee is based upon the evidence that development generates additional residents, employees, and customers, which in turn place an additional cumulative burden upon the local transportation system and should be expected to pay a share of the new facilities, as more fully described in the City of Menlo Park Transportation Impact Fee Study;

(j)    The purpose of this fee is to help provide adequate transportation improvements to serve cumulative development within the city. However, the fee does not replace the need for all site-specific transportation improvements that may be needed to mitigate the impact of specific projects upon the city’s transportation system;

(k)    The transportation improvements for which the fee will be used are identified in the transportation impact fee study, as modified from time to time. Nothing in this chapter commits the city to construct all of the transportation improvements identified in the transportation impact fee study, as modified from time to time. (Ord. 964 § 2 (part), 2009)

13.26.040 Definitions.
The following definitions apply to this chapter:

(a)    Transportation improvements include all street and intersection improvements and related facilities and equipment identified in the transportation impact fee study, as modified from time to time.

(b)    Gross floor area shall be calculated in accordance with the definition of gross floor area in the most recent version of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual.

(c)    Land use categories included in the transportation impact fee study are as defined in the most recent version of the ITE Trip Generation Manual.

(d)    Other Uses. The transportation manager shall determine the appropriate land use category for any use not included in the transportation impact fee study, based on a similarity of use and peak hour trip characteristics of the use as indicated in the most recent version of the ITE Trip Generation Manual or calculate the fee based on the per trip fee in the transportation impact fee study, as modified from time to time. (Ord. 964 § 2 (part), 2009)

13.26.050 Fee requirement.
(a)    General. The amount of the proposed fee shall be established by resolution of the city council and shall be based upon the following considerations:

(1)    Development will pay fair-share cost of transportation improvements described in the transportation impact fee study.

(2)    Each type of development shall contribute to the needed improvements as described in the transportation impact fee study.

(b)    Types of Development Subject to the Fee. The fee shall be applicable to new development in all land use categories identified in the city’s zoning ordinance, any construction adding additional floor area to a lot with an existing building, new single-family and multifamily dwelling units, and changes of use from one land use category to a different land use category.

(c)    Amount. The amount of the fee shall be determined by the methodology set forth in the transportation impact fee study and more particularly shown on the table of rates attached to the resolution approving the fee, as modified from time to time. Any use that does not fit into the identified rates will be determined based on Section 13.26.040(d), Other Uses.

(d)    The transportation manager shall have authority to render final determinations regarding the appropriate classification of land use and the correct calculation of gross floor area for a particular development project as it relates to the calculation of the traffic impact fee. (Ord. 964 § 2 (part), 2009)

13.26.060 Fee payment.
The transportation impact fee shall be paid in full to the city of Menlo Park before a building permit is issued. The fee shall not apply to any project that has received discretionary planning review approval prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, except for any project that is subject to an existing development agreement that requires the payment of fees. (Ord. 964 § 2 (part), 2009)

13.26.070 Authority for additional mitigation.
Fees collected pursuant to this chapter are not intended to replace or limit requirements to provide mitigation of traffic impacts not mitigated by the transportation impact fee and created by a specific project, and imposed upon development projects as part of the development review process. (Ord. 964 § 2 (part), 2009)

13.26.080 Fee credit.
(a)    The transportation manager may adjust the fee imposed pursuant to this chapter in consideration for certain facilities or improvements constructed or paid for by the developer. A developer is entitled to credit for the reasonable cost of the improvements, as determined by the transportation manager, if the improvement is identified in the transportation improvement fee study.

(b)    For new construction, a developer shall receive credit toward the fee based on the gross floor area of existing buildings and/or the number of residential units which are being demolished and the predominant historical use as determined by the transportation manager.

(c)    For a change of use, a developer shall receive credit toward the fee based on the gross floor area of existing buildings and/or number of residential units for which there is a change of use based on the predominant historical use as determined by the transportation manager. (Ord. 964 § 2 (part), 2009)

13.26.090 Appeal.
(a)    The developer of a project subject to this chapter may appeal the imposition and/or calculation of the fee at any time after the final determination of the fee by the transportation manager and before payment of the fee without protest to the city council.

(b)    The appellant shall state in detail the factual basis for the appeal and shall bear the burden of proof in presenting substantial evidence to support the appeal.

(c)    The city council shall uphold the fee and deny the appeal if it finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the development project’s impact on transportation facilities and the amount of the fee. The city council shall consider the land use category determination and the substance and nature of the evidence, including the fee calculation method, supporting technical documentation, and the appellant’s technical data. Based on the evidence, the city council may also modify the fee. (Ord. 964 § 2 (part), 2009)

13.26.100 Refund of fee.
(a)    If a building permit or use permit expires, is canceled, or is voided and any fees paid pursuant to this chapter have not been expended, no construction has taken place, and the use has never occupied the site, the transportation manager may, upon the written request of the applicant, order the return of the fee, less administrative costs.

(b)    The city council shall make a finding with respect to any fee revenue not expended or committed five years or more after it was paid. If the city council finds that the fee revenue is not committed, it shall authorize a refund to the then-owner of the property for which the fee was paid, pursuant to Government Code Section 66001 or successor legislation. (Ord. 964 § 2 (part), 2009)

13.26.110 Accumulation and use of funds.
(a)    Transportation Impact Fee Fund. The city shall deposit the fees collected under this chapter in a special fund, the transportation impact fee fund, designated solely for transportation improvements.

(b)    Use of Funds. The fees and interest earned on accumulated funds shall be used only to complete the transportation improvement projects specified in the transportation impact fee study, as modified from time to time, or to reimburse the city for such construction if funds were advanced by the city from other sources. (Ord. 964 § 2 (part), 2009)

13.26.120 Adjustment of fee.
The transportation impact fee authorized by this chapter, implementing council resolutions, and supporting documentation, including the transportation impact fee study, as modified from time to time, may be reviewed from time to time in order to make any findings required by state law and to make any adjustments in the amount of the fee. The fee shall automatically increase annually on July 1st based upon the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index for the San Francisco Bay Area. (Ord. 964 § 2 (part), 2009)

I. General

15.16.010 Dedication requirements.
As a condition of approval of a map, the subdivider shall dedicate or make an irrevocable offer of dedication of all parcels of land within the subdivision that are needed for streets, alleys, including access rights and abutters’ rights, drainage, local transit facilities, bikeways, public utility easements, and other public easements as required. In addition, the subdivider shall install or agree to install all public and private street improvements, bikeways, local transit facilities, drainage facilities, utilities and fences as required. (Ord. 615 § 1 (part), 1977: Prior code § 24.5).

15.16.020 Recreation requirements for residential subdivisions.
The dedication of land or the payment of fees, or a combination of both, shall be required for park and recreational purposes as a condition to the approval of a tentative subdivision or parcel map required for, enabling, or resulting in residential development on one or more parcels of the subdivision. Dedication and payment requirements shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

(1)    As used in this section, residential development does not include commercial or industrial subdivisions or condominium projects or stock cooperatives which consist of the subdivision of airspace in any existing apartment building which is more than five years old when no new dwelling units are added.

(2)    The amount of land dedicated or fees paid shall be based upon residential density, which shall be determined on the basis of the approved or conditionally approved tentative map or parcel map and the average number of persons per household. The dedication of land, or payment of fees, or both, shall be the proportionate amount necessary to provide five acres of park area per one thousand persons residing within a development subject to this section.

(3)    The amount of land to be dedicated shall be calculated from the formula of AxB. The amount of fees to be paid shall be calculated from the formula of AxBxC.

(A)    A is the recreation area required per dwelling unit, based on 5 acres per one thousand persons, i.e., .005 acres per person. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a single family residential development will average 2.59 persons per unit so that if such presumption is not rebutted A will equal 2.59 x .005 = .013 acres per unit. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that all other residential developments will average 1.63 persons per unit so that if such presumption is not rebutted A will equal 1.63 x .005 = .008 acres per unit. As used herein, single family residential developments are residential developments authorized in the R-E, R-E-S, R-1-S, and R-1-U zoning districts and other residential developments are residential developments authorized only in other residential zoning districts. The above presumptions are derived from the 1990 census. Upon publication of a more recent census, the above presumptions shall be replaced by presumptions derived from the more recent census.

(B)    B is the number of dwelling units in the proposed development (excluding established dwellings incorporated into the development).

(C)    C is the average fair market value per acre of the land in the development.

(4)    Either the dedication of land or the payment of fees may be required in a subdivision having more than fifty lots or when a condominium project, stock cooperative, or community apartment project exceeds fifty dwelling units. Otherwise only the payment of fees may be required.

(5)    The land, fees, or combination thereof are to be used only for the purpose of developing new or rehabilitating existing neighborhood or community park or recreational facilities to serve the development. The amount and location of land to be dedicated or the fees to be paid shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the development.

(6)    The city shall develop a schedule specifying how, when, and where it will use the land or fees, or both, to develop park or recreational facilities to serve the residents of the development. Any fees collected shall be committed within five years after the payment of such fees or the issuance of building permits on one-half of the lots created by the development, whichever occurs later. To the extent required by law, fees not so committed shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the development in the same proportion that the size of their lot bears to the total area of all lots in the development.

(7)    Developments containing less than five parcels and not used for residential purposes shall be exempted from the requirements of this section. However, a condition shall be placed on the approval of such parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the parcels within four years, the fee shall be paid by the owner of such parcel as a condition to the issuance of such permit.

(8)    If the subdivider provides park and recreational improvements to the dedicated land, the value of the improvements together with any equipment located thereon shall be a credit against the payment of fees or dedication of land.

(9)    The fee will be determined at the time of tentative subdivision or parcel map approval and will be paid prior to recordation of the final subdivision or parcel map.

(10)    Stock cooperatives, community apartment projects, common interest developments and condominiums, if entitled by state law, shall be eligible to receive a credit as determined by the City Council, against the amount of land required to be dedicated or fee imposed pursuant to this section, for private open space within the development which is usable for active recreational uses. Developments not so entitled may receive such credit in the discretion of the City Council.

(11)    If any condition, requirement, or provision of this section is determined to be invalid, all other conditions, requirements, and provisions shall remain in full force and effect. If the acreage per one thousand persons or the number of persons per household per unit provided for in this section exceeds that authorized by state law, such acreage or number of persons shall be the minimum authorized acreage or persons. (Ord. 836 § 2, 1992; Ord. 749 § 1, 1987; Ord. 748 § 1, 1987: Ord. 615 § 1 (part), 1977: Prior code § 24.6(1)).

15.16.030 School sites.
As a condition of approval of a final map, any subdivider proposing a development of more than four hundred dwelling units within any three-year period on any parcel or contiguous parcels shall dedicate such land as deemed necessary to assure the residents of the subdivision adequate elementary school facilities. This requirement shall be applicable only to a subdivider and his successors who have owned the land being subdivided for less than ten years prior to the filing of the tentative maps in accordance with this chapter. The requirement of dedication shall automatically terminate unless the school district offers to enter into a binding commitment with the subdivider to accept the dedication within thirty days after the requirement is imposed. The required dedication may be made at any time up to sixty days after the filing of the final map on any portion of the subdivision. The school district shall, in the event that it accepts the dedication, repay to the subdivider or to his successors the original cost to the subdivider of the dedicated land, plus a sum equal to the total of the following amounts:

(1)    The cost of any improvements to the dedicated land since acquisition by the subdivider;

(2)    The taxes assessed against the dedicated land from the date of the school district’s offer to enter into the binding commitment to accept such dedication;

(3)    Any other costs incurred by the subdivider in maintenance of such dedicated land, including interest costs incurred on any loan covering such land. (Ord. 615 § 1 (part), 1977: Prior code § 26.6(2)).

15.16.100 Roads and streets.
(a)    Existing streets shall be extended as required by the planning commission.

(b)    Street stubs to adjacent unsubdivided property shall be required where, in the opinion of the planning commission, they are necessary. A satisfactory temporary turnaround may be required.

(g)    Cul-de-sac streets shall have the following limiting dimensions:

(1)    Forty feet minimum radius to curb, at turnaround;

(2)    Fifty feet minimum radius to property line at turnaround, commercial and industrial developments may require larger radii as determined by the city engineer;

15.32.010 Based on hardship.
It is realized that there are certain parcels of land of such dimension, subject to such title restrictions, so affected by physical conditions or devoted to such use that it is impossible for the subdivider to conform to all of the foregoing requirements when subdividing property. (Prior code § 24.10(1)).

15.32.020 Criteria for granting.
The City Council may grant variances from the foregoing requirements, when all of the following conditions are found to apply:

(1)    That any variance granted shall be subject to such conditions as will assure that the adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the same vicinity;

(2)    That because of special circumstances applicable to the subject property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict literal application of this title is found to deprive subject property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity;

(3)    That under the circumstances of this particular case, the variance, rather than the sections at issue in this title, actually carries out the spirit and intent of this title. (Prior code § 24.10(2)).

Improvements to be installed by the subdivider or land developer of any parcel or parcels of property for the benefit of the subdivision or parcels to be developed shall contain supplemental size, capacity, number, and length for the benefit of property not within the subdivision or parcels being developed, as determined to be necessary by the city engineer. Such improvements shall be dedicated to the public. The benefited properties not within the subdivision or parcels to be developed are referred to in this chapter as the "benefited properties." This chapter is adopted pursuant to Government Code Sections 66485 through 66487. (Ord. 824 § 1 (part), 1991).

15.40.020 Reimbursement agreement upon approval.
When a subdivider or developer is required to provide supplemental size, capacity, number or length in excess of the construction required for the subdivision or parcels to be developed, for the benefit of property not within the subdivision or parcels being developed, the city shall, upon recommendation by the city engineer and approval of the City Council, enter into an agreement with the subdivider or land developer to reimburse the subdivider or land developer for that portion of the cost of such improvements equal to the difference between the amount it would have cost the subdivider or land developer to install such improvements to serve the subdivision or parcels being developed only, and the actual cost of such improvements. This difference is referred to in this chapter as the "reimbursement amount." The agreement may, but shall not necessarily, provide for payment to the subdivider or developer of an amount attributable to interest, as the City Council may direct. (Ord. 824 § 1 (part), 1991).

15.40.030 Terms of reimbursement agreement.
The reimbursement agreement shall include at least the following provisions:

(1)    The city shall be obligated to make reimbursements to the subdivider or land developer when and as the city obtains funds from the owners of benefited properties (hereafter called benefited property owners) as such property owners eventually develop their properties.

(2)    Funds paid to the city by benefited property owners need not be paid to the subdivider or developer until the limitations period for instituting legal action seeking refund of funds paid under protests has run and no court action has been instituted. If an action is instituted, the city shall not pay such funds to the subdivider or developer until the action has been completed and the authority of the city to collect such charges sustained.

(3)    The city shall have the right to turn over the defense of any action seeking refund of amounts paid under protest, to the subdivider or land developer. If the subdivider or land developer fails to undertake defense of the action at its expense, the city may return the amounts so paid under protest, and the city shall not be further obligated to subdivider or land developer as to funds so refunded.

(4)    In the event a court action is maintained to prevent the city from collecting such funds from benefited property owners, the city shall have the right to tender the defense of the action to the subdivider or developer, who shall agree to hold the city harmless from any and all liability thereunder. In the event the subdivider or land developer fails to undertake defense of the action at its sole expense, and to agree to indemnify the city from liability, the city may cease collecting such funds, or enter into any other settlement of the litigation acceptable to the city, and the subdivider or land developer shall lose any right to reimbursement of such funds under the reimbursement agreement.

(5)    Except as above provided, the reimbursement agreement shall provide for reimbursement of all funds when and as collected unless the City Council otherwise determines. Under no circumstances shall the city be deemed liable for any funds not collected from benefited property owners. (Ord. 824 1 (part), 1991).

15.40.040 Methods of paying reimbursement amount.
(1)    Collect from each of the benefited property owners, including public agencies, a reasonable charge for such owners’ apportioned share of the reimbursement amount. Collection of these charges may be deferred until such time as the benefited property owners improve their property through construction or subdivision;

(2)    Contribute to the subdivider or developer part or all of the reimbursement amount. The City Council may levy charges upon the benefited properties in accordance with the following section to reimburse the city for its contributions, together with interest thereon;

(3)    Establish and maintain local benefit districts for the levy and collection of such charge or costs from the property benefited. (Ord. 824 1 (part), 1991).

15.40.050 Determination of benefit.
Prior to entering into a reimbursement agreement pursuant to this chapter, the City Council shall receive a report from the city engineer describing in detail the area outside the subdivision or parcels to be developed which is benefited by the supplemental sizing, capacity, number or length of improvements required, and recommending apportionment of the reimbursement amount among the benefited properties. The apportionment of benefit shall be on the basis of frontage upon such improvements, acreage served by such improvements, or any other formula rationally related to actual benefit. The City Council may approve the report as submitted, or modify the report, and the action of the City Council thereon shall determine the benefit to each of the benefited properties, the amount or amounts to be charged such properties, and the method of collection of such charges.

15.40.060 Public hearing.
In determining the benefit to the benefited properties, the City Council shall, unless consent of all affected property owners is filed with the city, hold a public hearing thereon and give notice by mail to property owners of record who would be affected by such determination, and provide to all such property owners an opportunity to appear and be heard upon the proposed determination of benefit and method of apportioning of costs thereof. Notices shall be sent to affected property owners of record as shown on the last equalized assessment roll at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing. Affected property owners include the owners of the subdivision, the parcels to be developed, and the benefited property. (Ord. 824 1 (part), 1991).

16.23.070 Design standards and guidelines.
Construction of a new building, additions to an existing building, and exterior alterations of an existing building occurring within the R-4-S district shall adhere to the development standards and guidelines.

The R-4-S zoning district establishes a combination of development standards and design guidelines to guide the development of higher density housing in a comprehensive and cohesive manner in appropriate locations. Standards are objective and measurable rules required for new development. Guidelines suggest means for enhancing building design, attractiveness and neighborhood fit, as well as residential comfort and usefulness.

Design standards are open to modification subject to architectural control established in Section 16.68.020.

(1)    Building Setbacks and Projections within Setbacks.

(A)    Standards.

(i)    Front, side and rear setback areas shall be developed with a variety of landscaping.

a.    A minimum average of one (1) fifteen (15) gallon container grown tree per twenty (20) linear feet for the length of the property frontage along a public right-of-way is required.

b.    Existing trees located in the public right-of-way along the property frontage shall count towards the minimum tree requirement for that property frontage.

c.    For other setback areas not along a public right-of-way, a minimum average of one (1) fifteen (15) gallon container grown tree per forty (40) linear feet for the length of the property line is required.

(ii)    Building projections, such as balconies and bay windows, at or above the second floor shall not project beyond a maximum of five (5) feet into the setback area.

(iii)    Where a property is contiguous to a single-family zoned property, no projections into the setback are permitted for balconies or decks at or above the second floor.

(iv)    The total area of all horizontal and vertical building projections shall not exceed thirty-five percent (35%) of the building facade area, and no one projection shall exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the facade area on which the projections are located. Where such projections enclose interior living space, eighty-five percent (85%) of the vertical surface of the projection shall be windows or glazed. (See Figure 1.)



(2)    Facade Modulation and Treatment.

(A)    Standards.

(i)    Building facades facing public rights-of-way or public open spaces shall not exceed fifty (50) feet in length without a minor building facade modulation. At a minimum of every thirty-five (35) feet of facade length, the minor vertical facade modulation shall be a minimum two (2) feet deep by five (5) feet wide recess or a minimum two (2) foot setback of the building plane from the primary building facade.

(ii)    Building facades facing public rights-of-way or public open spaces shall not exceed one hundred (100) feet in length without a major building facade modulation. At a minimum of every seventy-five (75) feet of facade length, a major vertical facade modulation shall be a minimum of six (6) feet deep by twenty (20) feet wide recess or a minimum six (6) foot setback of building plane from primary building facade for the full height of the building.

(iii)    In addition, the major building facade modulation shall be accompanied with a four (4) foot minimum height modulation and a major change in fenestration pattern, material and/or color.

(B)    Guidelines.

(i)    Minor facade modulation may be accompanied with a change in fenestration pattern, and/or material, and/or color, and/or height.

(ii)    Blank walls at ground floor are discouraged and should be minimized. When unavoidable, continuous lengths of blank wall at the street should use other appropriate measures such as landscaping, additional architectural enhancement, or artistic intervention such as murals.

(iii)    Entries should be prominent and visually distinctive from the rest of the facade with creative use of scale, materials, glazing, projecting or recessed forms, architectural details, color, and/or awnings.

(iv)    The use of articulation, setbacks and varying materials is encouraged to minimize bulk and massing and provide visual interest.

(v)    Architectural details and elements such as reveals, score-lines, trim, and/or other architectural elements and features should be scaled appropriately based on viewing distance (i.e., finer grain details from pedestrian viewpoints and large scale details from more distant viewpoints).

(vi)    Where a building intersects a street, consider providing a break in the building to provide view corridors.

(3)    Building Profile.

(A)    Standards.

(i)    The facade of a building shall be limited to one major step back. (See Figure 2.)

(ii)    Horizontal building and architectural projections, like balconies, bay windows, and dormer windows, beyond the forty-five (45) degree building profile shall comply with the standards for building setbacks and projection within the setbacks section and shall be architecturally integrated into the design of the building. (See Figure 3.)





(iii)    Vertical building projections like parapets and balcony railings shall not extend more than four (4) feet beyond the forty-five (45) degree building profile and shall be architecturally integrated into the design of the building.

(iv)    Rooftop elements that may need to extend beyond the forty-five (45) degree building profile due to their function, such as stair and elevator towers, shall be architecturally integrated into the design of the building.

(4)    Height.

(A)    Standards.

(i)    Vertical building projections such as parapets and balcony railings may extend up to four (4) feet beyond the maximum building height, and shall be architecturally integrated into the design of the building.

(ii)    Rooftop elements that may need to exceed the maximum building height due to their function, such as stair and elevator towers, shall not exceed fourteen (14) feet beyond the maximum building height. Such rooftop elements shall be architecturally integrated into the design of the building.

(iii)    Towers, cupolas, spires, chimneys, and other architectural features not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the roof area may exceed the maximum building height limit by a maximum of ten (10) feet. Such rooftop elements shall be architecturally integrated into the design of the building.

(5)    External Materials.

(a)    Standards.

(i)    Buildings shall be designed and incorporate materials that discourage graffiti. Windows, doors, and small architectural features are exempt from this requirement.

(ii)    All external stucco shall be completed in textures that are smooth, sanded, or fine-scraped. Heavy-figuring or rough cast stucco are not permitted.

(iii)    Stucco on the external facade shall be limited to no more than eighty percent (80%) of the entire area of an elevation, inclusive of all windows and doors.

(iv)    All external windows where in solid walls shall be inset by a minimum of two (2) inches from the face of the external finishes.

(v)    When simulated divided light windows are included in a development, the windows shall include mullions on the exterior of the glazing and contain internal dividers (spacer bars) between the window panes.

(B)    Guidelines.

(i)    Materials should be selected to reinforce architectural character, building articulation and add visual interest.

(ii)    Changes in material and/or color should be used to articulate building elements such as building entries; base, body and parapet caps; or bays and arcades.

(iii)    Changes in material and/or colors should occur at appropriate facade locations to appear integral with the building massing.

(iv)    High quality materials that are distinctive from the main external wall finish of the building, such as decorative concrete, masonry or tile, should be used at important locations to articulate the building facade, providing visual interest as well as durable performance.

(6)    Building Entries.

(A)    Standards.

(ii)    Surface parking should be visually attractive, address security and safety patterns, and provide landscaping and canopy trees for shade.

(iii)    To minimize or eliminate their visibility and impact from the street and other significant public spaces, parking garages should be underground, wrapped by other uses and/or screened from view through architectural and/or landscape treatment.

(iv)    Whether freestanding or incorporated into overall building design, garage facades should be designed with a modulated system of vertical openings and pilasters, with design attention to an overall building facade that fits comfortably and compatibility into the pattern, articulation, scale and massing of surrounding building character.

(vi)    To reduce water consumption and heat island effect, incorporate shade, use indigenous plant materials and use permeable materials, where appropriate.

(vii)    A mix of tree types should be incorporated into the planting palette, where at least fifty percent (50%) of the trees have a mature height of at least thirty (30) feet.

(viii)    Trees should be appropriately spaced and installed to allow for growth and prevent root damage to parking lot surfaces.

16.43.055 Master planned projects.
The purpose of a master planned project is to provide flexibility for creative design, more orderly development, and optimal use of open space, while maintaining and achieving the general plan vision for the Bayfront Area. Master planned projects for sites with the same zoning designation (O, LS or R-MU) in close proximity or for contiguous sites that have a mix of zoning designations (O or R-MU) that exceed fifteen (15) acres in size and that are held in common ownership (or held by wholly owned affiliated entities) and are proposed for development as a single project or single phased development project are permitted as a conditional use, provided that sites with mixed zoning are required to obtain a conditional development permit and enter into a development agreement. For master planned projects meeting these criteria, residential density, FAR and open space requirements and residential density, FAR and open space requirements at the bonus level, if applicable, may be calculated in the aggregate across the site provided the overall development proposed does not exceed what would be permitted if the site were developed in accordance with the zoning designation applicable to each portion of the site and the proposed project complies with all other design standards identified for the applicable zoning districts. (Ord. 1024 § 3 (part), 2016).

16.43.060 Bonus level development.
A development in a location identified as office-bonus (O-B) on the adopted city of Menlo Park zoning map may seek an increase in floor area ratio and/or height per Section 16.43.050, subject to obtaining a use permit or conditional development permit per Chapter 16.82 and providing community amenities consistent with Section 16.43.070. (Ord. 1024 § 3 (part), 2016).

16.43.070 Community amenities required for bonus development.
Bonus level development allows a project to develop at a greater level of intensity with an increased floor area ratio and/or increased height. There is a reasonable relationship between the increased intensity of development and the increased effects on the surrounding community. The required community amenities are intended to address identified community needs that result from the effect of the increased development intensity on the surrounding community. To be eligible for bonus level development, an applicant shall provide one (1) or more community amenities. Construction of the amenity is preferable to the payment of a fee.

(1)    Amenities. Community needs were initially identified through the robust community engagement process generally referred to as ConnectMenlo. The city council of the city of Menlo Park adopted by resolution those identified community needs as community amenities to be provided in exchange for bonus level development. The identified community amenities may be updated from time to time by city council resolution. All community amenities, except for affordable housing, shall be provided within the area between U.S. Highway 101 and the San Francisco Bay in the city of Menlo Park. Affordable housing may be located anywhere housing is allowed in the city of Menlo Park.

(2)    Application. An application for bonus level development is voluntary. In exchange for the voluntary provision of community amenities, an applicant is receiving a benefit in the form of an increased floor area ratio and/or increased height. An applicant requesting bonus level development shall provide the city with a written proposal, which includes but is not limited to the specific amount of bonus development sought, the value of the amenity as calculated pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, and adequate information identifying the value of the proposed community amenities. An applicant’s proposal for community amenities shall be subject to review by the planning commission in conjunction with a use permit or conditional development permit. Consideration by the planning commission shall include differentiation between amenities proposed to be provided on site and amenities proposed to be provided off site, which may require a separate discretionary review and environmental review per the California Environmental Quality Act.

(3)    Value of Amenity. The value of the community amenities to be provided shall equal fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of the additional gross floor area of the bonus level development. The value shall be calculated as follows: The applicant shall provide, at their expense, an appraisal performed within ninety (90) days of the application date by a licensed appraisal firm that sets a fair market value in cash of the gross floor area of the bonus level of development ("bonus value"). The form and content of the appraisal, including any appraisal instructions, must be approved by the community development director. The appraisal shall determine the total bonus value without consideration of the community amenities requirement established under this section. Fifty percent (50%) of the total bonus value is the value of the community amenity to be provided.

(4)    Form of Amenity. A community amenity shall be provided utilizing any one (1) of the following mechanisms:

(A)    Include the community amenity as part of the project. The community amenity designed and constructed as part of the project shall be from the list of community amenities adopted by city council resolution. The value of the community amenity provided shall be at least equivalent to the value calculated pursuant to the formula identified in subsection (3) of this section. Once any one (1) of the community amenities on the list adopted by city council resolution has been provided, with the exception of affordable housing, it will no longer be an option available to other applicants. Prior to approval of final inspection for the building permit for any portion of the project, the applicant shall complete (or bond for) the construction and installation of the community amenities included in the project and shall provide documentation sufficient for the city manager or his/her designee to certify compliance with this section.

(B)    Payment of a fee. If the city adopts an impact fee that identifies a square foot fee for community amenities, an applicant for the bonus development shall pay one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the fee; provided, that the fee adopted by the city council is less than full cost recovery and not less than the total bonus value as calculated pursuant to subsection (3) of this section.

(C)    Enter into a development agreement. An applicant may propose amenities from the list adopted by city council resolution to be included in a development agreement.

1    "Designed to meet LEED standards" is defined as follows: (a) applicant must submit appropriate LEED checklist and verifying cover letter from a project LEED AP with the project application and (b) applicant must complete all applicable LEED certification documents prior to approval of the final inspection for the building permit to be reviewed either for LEED certification or for verification by a third party approved by the city for which the applicant will pay for review and/or certification.

2    Building owners may choose to have additions and/or alterations follow the LEED ID+C path, or alternatively, building owners may upgrade the entire existing building’s core and shell to the current California Energy Code standards and follow the city’s requirements listed in Section 16.43.140(2)(B). If the building owner chooses to upgrade the entire building’s core and shell to current California Energy Code standards and follow the city’s requirements listed in Section 16.43.140(2)(B), additions and alterations of that building will be exempt from the LEED ID+C requirement for three (3) code update cycles beginning with the upgrade cycle and ending with the two (2) cycles following the upgrade cycle. If this option is selected by the applicant, the building owner must upgrade to the Energy Code in effect at the time of the first building permit application for interior alteration and/or additions. Building permits for the core and shell upgrade must be initiated and satisfactory progress must be made on the core and shell upgrade project before occupancy for the additions and/or alterations shall be granted by the city’s building department. If the building owner fails to complete these core and shell upgrades within one (1) year of permit initiation, or receive a written letter from the community development director or his/her designee extending the deadline, the building owner shall be subject to typical permit violation penalties, including but not limited to stop work orders on any construction on the subject property, fines, and legal action.

3    If over a period of five (5) years (or sixty (60) months) the subject property makes smaller additions and/or alterations that cumulatively equal or exceed the trigger square footage listed above (i.e., ten thousand (10,000) square feet or twenty-five thousand one (25,001) square feet), the subject property shall be required to comply with the green and sustainable building requirements of this table.

4    For this calculation, laboratory space as defined in the building code is included in the addition and/or alteration square foot total, but exempt from the ID+C requirement.

(3)    Water Use Efficiency and Recycled Water.

(A)    Single pass cooling systems shall be prohibited in all new buildings.

(B)    All new buildings shall be built and maintained without the use of well water.

(C)    Applicants for a new building more than one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet of gross floor area shall prepare and submit a proposed water budget and accompanying calculations following the methodology approved by the city. For all new buildings two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) square feet or more in gross floor area, the water budget shall account for the potable water demand reduction resulting from the use of an alternative water source for all city approved nonpotable applications. The water budget and calculations shall be reviewed and approved by the city’s public works director prior to certification of occupancy. Twelve (12) months after the date of the certification of occupancy, the building owner shall submit data and information sufficient to allow the city to compare the actual water use to the allocation in the approved water budget. In the event that actual water consumption exceeds the water budget, a water conservation program, as approved by the city’s public works director, shall be implemented. Twelve (12) months after city approval of the water conservation program, the building owner shall submit data and information sufficient to allow the city to determine compliance with the conservation program. If water consumption exceeds the budgeted amount, the city’s public works director may prohibit the use of water for irrigation or enforce compliance as an infraction pursuant to Chapter 1.12 until compliance with the water budget is achieved.

(D)    All new buildings shall be dual plumbed for the internal use of recycled water.

(E)    All new buildings two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) square feet or more in gross floor area shall use an alternate water source for all city approved nonpotable applications. An alternative water source may include, but is not limited to, treated nonpotable water such as graywater. An alternate water source assessment shall be submitted that describes the alternative water source and proposed nonpotable application. Approval of the alternate water source assessment, the alternative water source and its proposed uses shall be approved by the city’s public works director and community development director. If the Menlo Park Municipal Water District has not designated a recycled water purveyor and/or municipal recycled water source is not available prior to planning project approval, applicants may propose conservation measures to meet the requirements of this section subject to approval of the city council. The conservation measures shall achieve a reduction in potable water use equivalent to the projected demand of city approved nonpotable applications, but in no case shall the reduction be less than 30 percent (30%) compared to the water budget in subsection (3)(C) of this section. The conservation measures may include on-site measures, off-site measures or a combination thereof.

(F)    Potable water shall not be used for dust control on construction projects.

(G)    Potable water shall not be used for decorative features, unless the water recirculates.

(4)    Hazard Mitigation and Sea Level Rise Resiliency.

(A)    The first floor elevation of all new buildings shall be twenty-four (24) inches above the Federal Emergency Management Agency base flood elevation (BFE) to account for sea level rise. Where no BFE exists, the first floor (bottom of floor beams) elevation shall be twenty-four (24) inches above the existing grade. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for projects on sites of two (2) acres or less, the first floor elevation shall be the maximum height reasonably practicable as determined by the city, but in no case less than six (6) inches above BFE or existing grade where no BFE exists. The building design and protective measures shall not create adverse impacts on adjacent sites as determined by the city.

(B)    Prior to building permit issuance, all new buildings shall pay any required fee or proportionate fair share for the funding of sea level rise projects, if applicable.

(5)    Waste Management.

(A)    Applicants shall submit a zero-waste management plan to the city, which will cover how the applicant plans to minimize waste to landfill and incineration in accordance with all applicable state and local regulations. Applicants shall show in their zero-waste plan how they will reduce, recycle and compost wastes from the demolition, construction and occupancy phases of the building. For the purposes of this chapter, "zero waste" is defined as ninety percent (90%) overall diversion of nonhazardous materials from landfill and incineration, wherein discarded materials are reduced, reused, recycled, or composted. Zero-waste plan elements shall include the property owner’s assessment of the types of waste to be generated during demolition, construction and occupancy, and a plan to collect, sort and transport materials to uses other than landfill and incineration.

(6)    Bird-Friendly Design.

(A)    No more than ten percent (10%) of facade surface area shall have non-bird-friendly glazing.

(B)    Bird-friendly glazing includes, but is not limited to opaque glass, covering the outside surface of clear glass with patterns, paned glass with fenestration, frit or etching patterns, and external screens over nonreflective glass. Highly reflective glass is not permitted.

(C)    Occupancy sensors or other switch control devices shall be installed on nonemergency lights and shall be programmed to shut off during nonwork hours and between ten (10) p.m. and sunrise.

(D)    Placement of buildings shall avoid the potential funneling of flight paths towards a building facade.

(E)    Glass skyways or walkways, freestanding (see-through) glass walls and handrails, and transparent building corners shall not be allowed.

(F)    Transparent glass shall not be allowed at the rooflines of buildings, including in conjunction with roof decks, patios and green roofs.

(G)    Use of rodenticides shall not be allowed.

(H)    A project may receive a waiver from one (1) or more of the items listed in subsections (6)(A) to (F) of this section, subject to the submittal of a site specific evaluation from a qualified biologist and review and approval by the planning commission. (Ord. 1050 § 8, 2018; Ord. 1024 § 3 (part), 2016).

16.44.055 Master planned projects.
The purpose of a master planned project is to provide flexibility for creative design, more orderly development, and optimal use of open space, while maintaining and achieving the general plan vision for the Bayfront Area. Master planned projects for sites with the same zoning designation (O, LS or R-MU) in close proximity or for contiguous sites that have a mix of zoning designations (O or R-MU) that exceed fifteen (15) acres in size and that are held in common ownership (or held by wholly owned affiliated entities) and are proposed for development as a single project or single phased development project are permitted as a conditional use; provided, that sites with mixed zoning are required to obtain a conditional development permit and enter into a development agreement. For master planned projects meeting these criteria, residential density, FAR and open space requirements and residential density, FAR and open space requirements at the bonus level, if applicable, may be calculated in the aggregate across the site provided the overall development proposed does not exceed what would be permitted if the site were developed in accordance with the zoning designation applicable to each portion of the site and the proposed project complies with all other design standards identified for the applicable zoning districts. (Ord. 1025 § 3 (part), 2016).

16.44.060 Bonus level development.
A development in a location identified as life sciences-bonus (LS-B) on the adopted city of Menlo Park zoning map may seek an increase in floor area ratio and/or height per Section 16.44.050, subject to obtaining a use permit or conditional development permit per Chapter 16.82 and providing community amenities consistent with Section 16.44.070. (Ord. 1025 § 3 (part), 2016).

16.44.070 Community amenities required for bonus development.
Bonus level development allows a project to develop at a greater level of intensity with an increased floor area ratio and/or increased height. There is a reasonable relationship between the increased intensity of development and the increased effects on the surrounding community. The required community amenities are intended to address identified community needs that result from the effect of the increased development intensity on the surrounding community. To be eligible for bonus level development, an applicant shall provide one (1) or more community amenities. Construction of the amenity is preferable to the payment of a fee.

(1)    Amenities. Community needs were initially identified through the robust community engagement process generally referred to as ConnectMenlo. The city council of the city of Menlo Park adopted by resolution those identified community needs as community amenities to be provided in exchange for bonus level development. The identified community amenities may be updated from time to time by city council resolution. All community amenities, except for affordable housing, shall be provided within the area between U.S. Highway 101 and the San Francisco Bay in the city of Menlo Park. Affordable housing may be located anywhere housing is allowed in the city of Menlo Park.

(2)    Application. An application for bonus level development is voluntary. In exchange for the voluntary provision of community amenities, an applicant is receiving a benefit in the form of an increased floor area ratio and/or increased height. An applicant requesting bonus level development shall provide the city with a written proposal, which includes but is not limited to the specific amount of bonus development sought, the value of the amenity as calculated pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, and adequate information identifying the value of the proposed community amenities. An applicant’s proposal for community amenities shall be subject to review by the planning commission in conjunction with a use permit or conditional development permit. Consideration by the planning commission shall include differentiation between amenities proposed to be provided on site and amenities proposed to be provided off site, which may require a separate discretionary review and environmental review per the California Environmental Quality Act.

(3)    Value of Amenity. The value of the community amenities to be provided shall equal fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of the additional gross floor area of the bonus level development. The value shall be calculated as follows: The applicant shall provide, at their expense, an appraisal performed within ninety (90) days of the application date by a licensed appraisal firm that sets a fair market value in cash of the gross floor area of the bonus level of development ("bonus value"). The form and content of the appraisal must be approved by the community development director. The appraisal shall determine the total bonus value without consideration of the community amenities requirement established under this section. Fifty percent (50%) of the total bonus value is the value of the community amenity to be provided.

(4)    Form of Amenity. A community amenity shall be provided utilizing any one (1) of the following mechanisms:

(A)    Include the community amenity as part of the project. The community amenity designed and constructed as part of the project shall be from the list of community amenities adopted by city council resolution. The value of the community amenity provided shall be at least equivalent to the value calculated pursuant to the formula identified in subsection (3) of this section. Once any one (1) of the community amenities on the list adopted by city council resolution has been provided, with the exception of affordable housing, it will no longer be an option available to other applicants. Prior to approval of final inspection for the building permit for any portion of the project, the applicant shall complete (or bond for) the construction and installation of the community amenities included in the project and shall provide documentation sufficient for the city manager or his/her designee to certify compliance with this section.

(B)    Payment of a fee. If the city adopts an impact fee that identifies a square foot fee for community amenities, an applicant for the bonus development shall pay one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the fee; provided, that the fee adopted by the city council is less than full cost recovery and not less than the total bonus value as calculated pursuant to subsection (3) of this section.

(C)    Enter into a development agreement. An applicant may propose amenities from the list adopted by city council resolution to be included in a development agreement. The value of the amenities included in the development agreement shall be at least equivalent to the value calculated pursuant to the formula identified in subsection (3) this section. Timing of the provision of the community amenities shall be agreed upon in the development agreement. (Ord. 1025 § 3 (part), 2016).

1    "Designed to meet LEED standards" is defined as follows: (a) applicant must submit appropriate LEED checklist and verifying cover letter from a project LEED AP with the project application and (b) applicant must complete all applicable LEED certification documents prior to approval of the final inspection for the building permit to be reviewed either for LEED certification, or for verification by a third party approved by the city for which the applicant will pay for review and/or certification.

2    Building owners may choose to have additions and/or alterations follow the LEED ID+C path, or alternatively, building owners may upgrade the entire existing building’s core and shell to the current California Energy Code standards and follow the city’s requirements listed in Section 16.44.130(2)(B). If the building owner chooses to upgrade the entire building’s core and shell to current California Energy Code standards and follow the city’s requirements listed in Section 16.44.130(2)(B), additions and alterations of that building will be exempt from the LEED ID+C requirement for three (3) code update cycles beginning with the upgrade cycle and ending with the two (2) cycles following the upgrade cycle. If this option is selected by the applicant, the building owner must upgrade to the Energy Code in effect at the time of the first building permit application for interior alteration and/or additions. Building permits for the core and shell upgrade must be initiated and satisfactory progress must be made on the core and shell upgrade project before occupancy for the additions and/or alterations shall be granted by the city’s building department. If the building owner fails to complete these core and shell upgrades within one (1) year of permit initiation, or receive a written letter from the community development director or his/her designee extending the deadline, the building owner shall be subject to typical permit violation penalties, including but not limited to stop work orders on any construction on the subject property, fines, and legal action.

3    If over a period of five (5) years (or sixty (60) months) the subject property makes smaller additions and/or alterations that cumulatively equal or exceed the trigger square footage listed above (i.e., ten thousand (10,000) square feet or twenty-five thousand one (25,001) square feet), the subject property shall be required to comply with the green and sustainable building requirements of this table.

4    For this calculation, laboratory space as defined in the building code is included in the addition and/or alteration square foot total, but exempt from the ID+C requirement.

(3)    Water Use Efficiency and Recycled Water.

(A)    Single pass cooling systems shall be prohibited in all new buildings.

(B)    All new buildings shall be built and maintained without the use of well water.

(C)    Applicants for a new building more than one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet of gross floor area shall prepare and submit a proposed water budget and accompanying calculations following the methodology approved by the city. For all new buildings two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) square feet or more in gross floor area, the water budget shall account for the potable water demand reduction resulting from the use of an alternative water source for all city approved nonpotable applications. The water budget and calculations shall be reviewed and approved by the city’s public works director prior to certification of occupancy. Twelve (12) months after the date of the certification of occupancy, the building owner shall submit data and information sufficient to allow the city to compare the actual water use to the allocation in the approved water budget. In the event that actual water consumption exceeds the water budget, a water conservation program, as approved by the city’s public works director, shall be implemented. Twelve (12) months after city approval of the water conservation program, the building owner shall submit data and information sufficient to allow the city to determine compliance with the conservation program. If water consumption exceeds the budgeted amount, the city’s public works director may prohibit the use of water for irrigation or enforce compliance as an infraction pursuant to Chapter 1.12 until compliance with the water budget is achieved.

(D)    All new buildings shall be dual plumbed for the internal use of recycled water.

(E)    All new buildings two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) square feet or more in gross floor area shall use an alternate water source for all city approved nonpotable applications. An alternative water source may include, but is not limited to, treated nonpotable water such as graywater. An alternate water source assessment shall be submitted that describes the alternative water source and proposed nonpotable application. Approval of the alternate water source assessment, the alternative water source and its proposed uses shall be approved by the city’s public works director and community development director. If the Menlo Park Municipal Water District has not designated a recycled water purveyor and/or municipal recycled water source is not available prior to planning project approval, applicants may propose conservation measures to meet the requirements of this section subject to approval of the city council. The conservation measures shall achieve a reduction in potable water use equivalent to the projected demand of city approved nonpotable applications, but in no case shall the reduction be less than thirty percent (30%) compared to the water budget in subsection (3)(C) of this section. The conservation measures may include on-site measures, off-site measures or a combination thereof.

(F)    Potable water shall not be used for dust control on construction projects.

(G)    Potable water shall not be used for decorative features, unless the water recirculates.

(4)    Hazard Mitigation and Sea Level Rise Resiliency.

(A)    The first floor elevation of all new buildings shall be twenty-four (24) inches above the Federal Emergency Management Agency base flood elevation (BFE) to account for sea level rise. Where no BFE exists, the first floor (bottom of floor beams) elevation shall be twenty-four (24) inches above the existing grade. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for projects on sites of two (2) acres or less, the first floor elevation shall be the maximum height reasonably practicable as determined by the city, but in no case less than six (6) inches above BFE or existing grade where no BFE exists.

16.45.055 Master planned projects.
The purpose of a master planned project is to provide flexibility for creative design, more orderly development, and optimal use of open space, while maintaining and achieving the general plan vision for the Bayfront Area. Master planned projects for sites with the same zoning designation (O, LS, or R-MU) in close proximity or for contiguous sites that have a mix of zoning designations (O or R-MU) that exceed fifteen (15) acres in size and that are held in common ownership (or held by wholly owned affiliated entities) and are proposed for development as a single project or single phased development project are permitted as a conditional use; provided, that sites with mixed zoning are required to obtain a conditional development permit and enter into a development agreement. For master planned projects meeting these criteria, residential density, FAR and open space requirements and residential density, FAR, and open space requirements at the bonus level, if applicable, may be calculated in the aggregate across the site provided the overall development proposed does not exceed what would be permitted if the site were developed in accordance with the zoning designation applicable to each portion of the site and the proposed project complies with all other design standards identified for the applicable zoning districts. (Ord. 1026 § 3 (part), 2016).

16.45.060 Bonus level development.
As described in Section 16.45.070, as a threshold requirement for utilizing bonus level development in the residential mixed use-bonus (R-MU-B) zoning district, the applicant must construct the below market rate units required pursuant to Chapter 16.96 on site rather than utilizing an alternative means of compliance per Section 16.96.070, unless otherwise approved by the city council. Any such units will be sold or rented with a preference for current or recently displaced Belle Haven residents, followed by the preferences provided in the city’s below market rate housing guidelines. If and when Chapter 16.96 becomes void or unenforceable, the community amenity provided must be a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the total units on site for affordable housing units in accordance with the city’s below market rate housing ordinance and guidelines. (Ord. 1047 § 2, 2018: Ord. 1026 § 3 (part), 2016).

16.45.070 Community amenities required for bonus level development.
Bonus level development allows a project to develop at a greater level of intensity with an increase in density, floor area ratio and/or height. There is a reasonable relationship between the increased intensity of development and the increased effects on the surrounding community. The required community amenities are intended to address identified community needs that result from the effect of the increased development intensity on the surrounding community. To be eligible for bonus level development, an applicant shall provide one (1) or more community amenities. Construction of the amenity is preferable to the payment of a fee.

(1)    Amenities. Community needs, specifically including affordable housing, were initially identified through the robust community engagement process generally referred to as ConnectMenlo. The city council of the city of Menlo Park adopted by resolution those identified community needs as community amenities to be provided in exchange for bonus level development. The identified community amenities may be updated from time to time by city council resolution. All community amenities, except for affordable housing, shall be provided within the area between U.S. Highway 101 and the San Francisco Bay in the city of Menlo Park. Affordable housing may be located anywhere housing is allowed in the city of Menlo Park.

(2)    Application. An application for bonus level development is voluntary. In exchange for the voluntary provision of community amenities, an applicant is receiving a benefit in the form of an increased floor area ratio, density, and/or increased height. An applicant requesting bonus level development shall provide the city with a written proposal, which includes but is not limited to the specific amount of bonus development sought, the value of the amenity as calculated pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, and adequate information identifying the value of the proposed community amenities. An applicant’s proposal for community amenities shall be subject to review by the planning commission in conjunction with a use permit or conditional development permit. Consideration by the planning commission shall include differentiation between amenities proposed to be provided on site and amenities proposed to be provided off site, which may require a separate discretionary review and environmental review per the California Environmental Quality Act.

(3)    Value of Amenity. The value of the community amenities to be provided shall equal fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of the additional gross floor area of the bonus level development. The value shall be calculated as follows: The applicant shall provide, at their expense, an appraisal performed within ninety (90) days of the application date by a licensed appraisal firm that sets a fair market value in cash of the gross floor area of the bonus level of development ("total bonus"). The form and content of the appraisal, including any appraisal instructions, must be approved by the community development director.

(4)    Form of Amenity. A community amenity shall be provided utilizing any one (1) of the following mechanisms:

(A)    Include the community amenity as part of the project. As a threshold for utilizing bonus level development, any affordable housing required pursuant to Chapter 16.96 shall be designed and constructed on-site as part of the project; the applicant shall not be allowed to utilize an alternative means of compliance, unless otherwise approved by the city council. These affordable housing units shall be sold or rented with a preference for current or recently displaced Belle Haven residents, followed by the preferences provided in the city’s below market rate housing guidelines. The community amenity provided as part of the project shall be from the list of community amenities adopted by city council resolution, with a preference for including additional affordable housing units; for example, additional housing such that twenty percent (20%) of the development is affordable (fifteen percent (15%) inclusionary plus five percent (5%) additional affordable units). The value of the community amenity provided shall be at least equivalent to the value calculated pursuant to the formula identified in subsection (3) of this section. Once any one (1) of the community amenities on the list adopted by city council resolution has been provided, with the exception of affordable housing, it will no longer be an option available to other applicants. Prior to approval of final inspection for the building permit for any portion of the project, the applicant shall complete (or bond for) the construction and installation of the community amenities included in the project and shall provide documentation sufficient for the city manager or his/her designee to certify compliance with this section.

(B)    Payment of a fee. If the city adopts an impact fee that identifies a square foot fee for community amenities, an applicant for the bonus development shall pay one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the fee; provided, that the fee adopted by the city council is less than full cost recovery and not less than the total bonus value less the affordable housing amenity value as calculated pursuant to subsection (3) of this section.

(C)    Enter into a development agreement. An applicant may propose amenities from the list adopted by city council resolution to be included in a development agreement. The value of the amenities included in the development agreement shall be at least equivalent to the value calculated pursuant to the formula identified in subsection (3) of this section. Timing of the provision of the community amenities shall be agreed upon in the development agreement. (Ord. 1047 § 3, 2018: Ord. 1026 § 3 (part), 2016).

2    Long-term parking is for use over several hours or overnight, typically used by employees and residents. Short-term parking is considered visitor parking for use from several minutes to up to a couple of hours.

(1)    Parking spaces shall be unbundled from the price of residential units such that parking is sold or rented separately, except in cases where parking is physically connected to only one (1) unit. However, the planning commission may grant an exception from this requirement for projects which include financing for affordable housing that requires that costs for parking and housing be bundled together.

(2)    Parking facilities may be shared at the discretion of the city’s transportation manager if multiple uses cooperatively establish and operate the facilities, if these uses generate parking demands primarily during different hours than the remaining uses, and if a sufficient number of spaces are provided to meet the maximum cumulative parking demand of the participating uses at any time. An individual development proposal may incorporate a shared parking study to account for the mixture of uses, either on site or within a reasonable distance. The shared parking supply would be subject to review and approval based on the proposed uses, specific design and site conditions. Project applicants may also be allowed to meet the minimum parking requirements through the use of nearby off-site facilities at the discretion of the transportation manager. (Ord. 1026 § 3 (part), 2016).

16.45.090 Transportation demand management.
All new construction, regardless of size, and building additions of ten thousand (10,000) or more square feet of gross floor area, or a change of use of ten thousand (10,000) or more square feet of gross floor area shall develop a transportation demand management (TDM) plan necessary to reduce associated vehicle trips to at least twenty percent (20%) below standard generation rates for uses on the project site. Each individual applicant will prepare its own TDM plan and provide an analysis to the satisfaction of the city’s transportation manager of the impact of that TDM program.

(1)    Eligible TDM measures may include but are not limited to:

(A)    Participation in a local transportation management association (TMA) that provides documented, ongoing support for alternative commute programs;

(M)    Green trip certification.

(2)    Measures receiving TDM credit shall be:

(A)    Documented in a TDM plan developed specifically for each project and noted on project site plans, if and as appropriate;

(B)    Guaranteed to achieve the intended reduction over the life of the development, as evidenced by annual reporting provided to the satisfaction of city’s transportation manager;

(C)    Required to be replaced by appropriate substitute measures if unable to achieve intended trip reduction in any reporting year;

(D)    Administered by a representative whose updated contact information is provided to the transportation manager. (Ord. 1026 § 3 (part), 2016).

16.45.100 New connections.
Proposed development will be required to provide new pedestrian, bicycle, and/or vehicle connections to support connectivity and circulation as denoted in the city zoning map. These connections may be in the form of either a public street or a paseo as denoted in the city zoning map and are pursuant to the standards in Section 16.45.120. Streets shall meet the requirements of the adopted city of Menlo Park street classification map in the general plan circulation element.

(1)    If the location of a new connection is split between parcel/ownership, the first applicant must set aside the required right-of-way through dedication or a public access easement and bond for the completion of the new connection, or reach agreement with the other property owner(s) to allow the first applicant to complete the entire new connection;

(2)    If the location of a new connection is located on multiple properties with the same owner, applicant may move the connection up to fifty (50) feet in either direction from what is shown on the city zoning map for enhanced connectivity, and/or other considerations, subject to the review and approval of the city’s public works director;

(3)    For phased implementation of a development project, applicant must show an implementation plan for the new connection and the city may require a bond or right-of-way dedication or public access easement prior to the completion of the first phase;

(4)    The land area dedicated for new connections in the form of public streets (right-of-way) will be subtracted from the total lot area to determine the site’s floor area ratio;

(5)    The land area dedicated for new connections in the form of paseos will require a public access easement (PAE). The area of the PAE is included in the total lot area to determine the site’s floor area ratio. (Ord. 1026 § 3 (part), 2016).

16.45.110 Required street improvements.
For new construction and/or building additions of ten thousand (10,000) or more square feet of gross floor area or for tenant improvements on a site where the cumulative construction value exceeds five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) over a five (5) year period, the public works director shall require the project to provide street improvements on public street edges of the property that comply with adopted city of Menlo Park street construction requirements for the adjacent street type. When these are required by the public works director, the improvements do not count as community amenities pursuant to Section 16.45.070. The threshold for the value of improvements shall be adjusted annually on the first day of July, based on the ENR Construction Cost Index.

(1)    Improvements shall include curb, gutter, sidewalk, street trees, and street lights;

(2)    Overhead electric distribution lines of less than sixty (60) kilovolts and communication lines shall be placed underground along the property frontage;

(3)    The public works director may allow a deferred frontage improvement agreement, including a bond to cover the full cost of the improvements and installation to accomplish needed improvements in coordination with other street improvements at a later date. (Ord. 1026 § 3 (part), 2016).

16.45.120 Design standards.
All new construction, regardless of size, and building additions of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or more of gross floor area adhere to the following design standards, subject to architectural control established in Section 16.68.020. For building additions, the applicable design standards apply only to the new construction. The existing building and new addition shall have an integrated design. Design standards may be modified subject to approval of a use permit or a conditional development permit per Chapter 16.82.

(1)    Relationship to the Street. The following standards regulate the siting and placement of buildings, parking areas, and other features in relation to the street.

2    Building owners may choose to have additions and/or alterations follow the LEED ID+C path, or alternatively, building owners may upgrade the entire existing building’s core and shell to the current California Energy Code standards and follow the city’s requirements listed in Section 16.45.130(2)(B). If the building owner chooses to upgrade the entire building’s core and shell to current California Energy Code standards and follow the city’s requirements listed in Section 16.45.130(2)(B), additions and alterations of that building will be exempt from the LEED ID+C requirement for three (3) code update cycles beginning with the upgrade cycle and ending with the two (2) cycles following the upgrade cycle. If this option is selected by the applicant, the building owner must upgrade to the Energy Code in effect at the time of the first building permit application for interior alteration and/or additions. Building permits for the core and shell upgrade must be initiated and satisfactory progress must be made on the core and shell upgrade project before occupancy for the additions and/or alterations shall be granted by the city’s building department. If the building owner fails to complete these core and shell upgrades within one (1) year of permit initiation, or receive a written letter from the community development director or his/her designee extending the deadline, the building owner shall be subject to typical permit violation penalties, including but not limited to stop work orders on any construction on the subject property, fines, and legal action.

3    If over a period of five (5) years (or sixty (60) months) the subject property makes smaller additions and/or alterations that cumulatively equal or exceed the trigger square footage listed above (i.e., ten thousand (10,000) square feet or twenty-five thousand one (25,001) square feet), the subject property shall be required to comply with the green and sustainable building requirements of this table.

(3)    Water Use Efficiency and Recycled Water.

(A)    Single pass cooling systems shall be prohibited in all new buildings.

(B)    All new buildings shall be built and maintained without the use of well water.

(C)    Applicants for a new building more than one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet or more of gross floor area shall prepare and submit a proposed water budget and accompanying calculations following the methodology approved by the city. For all new buildings two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) square feet or more in gross floor area, the water budget shall account for the potable water demand reduction resulting from the use of an alternative water source for all city approved nonpotable applications. The water budget and calculations shall be reviewed and approved by the city’s public works director prior to certification of occupancy. Twelve (12) months after the date of the certification of occupancy, the building owner shall submit data and information sufficient to allow the city to compare the actual water use to the allocation in the approved water budget. In the event that actual water consumption exceeds the water budget, a water conservation program, as approved by the city’s public works director, shall be implemented. Twelve (12) months after city approval of the water conservation program, the building owner shall submit data and information sufficient to allow the city to determine compliance with the conservation program. If water consumption exceeds the budgeted amount, the city’s public works director may prohibit the use of water for irrigation or enforce compliance as an infraction pursuant to Chapter 1.12 until compliance with the water budget is achieved.

(D)    All new buildings shall be dual plumbed for the internal use of recycled water.

(E)    All new buildings two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) square feet or more in gross floor area shall use an alternate water source for all city approved nonpotable applications. An alternative water source may include, but is not limited to, treated nonpotable water such as graywater. An alternate water source assessment shall be submitted that describes the alternative water source and proposed nonpotable application. Approval of the alternate water source assessment, the alternative water source and its proposed uses shall be approved by the city’s public works director and community development director. If the Menlo Park Municipal Water District has not designated a recycled water purveyor and/or municipal recycled water source is not available prior to planning project approval, applicants may propose conservation measures to meet the requirements of this section subject to approval of the city council. The conservation measures shall achieve a reduction in potable water use equivalent to the projected demand of city approved nonpotable applications, but in no case shall the reduction be less than thirty percent (30%) compared to the water budget in subsection (3)(C) of this section. The conservation measures may include on-site measures, off-site measures or a combination thereof.

(F)    Potable water shall not be used for dust control on construction projects.

(G)    Potable water shall not be used for decorative features, unless the water recirculates.

Heights for fences, walls, hedges or similar structures as stated in Section 16.64.020(a) and (b) may be exceeded for residential properties fronting on Santa Cruz Avenue in accordance with the following procedures:

(1)    Requests for exceeding height limitations shall be made in writing by the owner of the property, lessee, purchaser in escrow or optionee with the consent of the owners, on a form prescribed by the city. The application shall be accompanied by a fee, set by the city council, and plans showing the details of the proposed fence, wall, hedge or similar structure.

(2)    Upon receipt of an application, a notice shall be mailed ten (10) days prior to action being taken on the application to all property owners and residents within three hundred feet (300’) of the exterior boundary of the property involved, using for this purpose the last known name and address of such owners as shown upon the current assessment roll of the city. The notice shall include a copy of the proposed plans, the pending date of action, and the appeal procedure.

(3)    The chief planner or designee shall review all applications for compliance with design criteria as specified in Section 16.64.035 for safety considerations and with consideration of all comments received from the public. If the proposed fence, wall, hedge or similar structure is in compliance with the design criteria, does not create a safety hazard, and there are no substantial objections from the public, the application may be deemed approved. If the fence does not conform with the design criteria, creates a safety hazard, or there are substantial public objections, the application may be conditionally approved, denied or forwarded to the planning commission through the use permit process in accordance with the procedures and standards of Chapter 16.82.

(4)    All administrative decisions of the chief planner or designee shall be reported in writing to the planning commission and City Council and made available to the general public.

(5)    Any person may appeal a decision of the chief planner or designee to the planning commission. The appeal shall be made in writing and filed with the chief planner within fifteen (15) days following the final decision of the chief planner or designee. The appeal shall be accompanied by a fee, as set by the City Council, and shall clearly state the reason for the appeal. Upon receipt of an appeal, the chief planner shall set a time, which insofar as practicable shall be within forty-five (45) days after receipt of such appeal, for a public hearing on such appeal. Any person may appeal any order, requirement, decision or determination of the planning commission to the City Council in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 16.86. (Ord. 906 § 1 (part), 2001).

All requests for fences exceeding the height limitations as stated in Section 16.64.020(a) and (b) for residential properties fronting on Santa Cruz Avenue shall adhere to the following design criteria:

(1)    Materials. Fence and wall materials and colors shall be compatible with the streetscape and surrounding environment. Use of chain link and barbed wire fencing shall be prohibited.

(2)    Height and Setbacks. The maximum height of the fence, wall, hedge or similar structure shall be determined by the setback distance between the front property line and the location of the fence, wall, hedge or similar structure. The maximum height of a fence, wall, hedge or similar structure with a front setback of less than two feet (2’) shall be four feet (4’). The maximum height of a fence, wall, hedge or similar structure with a front setback of two feet (2’), but less than six feet (6’), shall be five feet (5’). Beginning with a six foot (6’) front setback, the maximum height of the fence, wall, hedge or similar structure shall increase on an even gradient from a maximum of six feet (6’)in height at foot front setback to seven feet (7’) in height at a twenty foot (20’) front setback. Decorative columns or posts may be allowed to exceed the height of the primary portion of the fence.

(3)    Landscaped Area. All areas located between the front property line and fence, wall, hedge or similar structure shall be required to be irrigated and landscaped. If drought tolerant landscape material is used, irrigation will not be required.

(4)    Design Variation. All proposals for fences, walls, hedges and similar structures in excess of four feet (4’) in height shall incorporate design variation for a minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the length of the fence, wall, hedge or similar structure. Design variations may include changes in height and/or the depth of setbacks for a portion of the length of the fence. The intent of the requirement for variation is to create visual interest.

(5)    Entryway Identification. All entryways onto the property, including, but not limited to front doors and driveways, shall be identified by gateways, openings in the fence, wall, hedge or similar structure or by other architectural features. (Ord. 906 § 1 (part), 2001).

16.64.050 Violation deemed private nuisance.
Any violation of the provisions of this chapter or of this title as such relates to hedges, shrubs or trees (except as it may relate to "street corners") shall be presumed to be a private nuisance unless the City Council determines that such violation is one which affects at the same time an entire community or neighborhood or any considerable number of persons, in which case the City Council may declare it to be a public nuisance and cause the same to be abated by the persons and in the manner authorized by this code or other ordinances of the city. (Ord. 906 § 1 (part), 2001).

16.64.060 Trimming growth to avoid interference with use of sidewalks and roadways.

*    Prior ordinance history: Ords. 791 and 801.

16.67.010 Daylight planes in R-E, R-E-S and R-2 zoning districts.
Daylight planes for the main dwelling unit are established for each lot as follows:

(1)    Daylight Plane. A daylight plane shall begin at a horizontal line at a certain distance directly above each side setback line of each lot and shall slope inwards at a forty-five (45) degree angle. The distance between the side setback line and the horizontal line directly above it shall be nineteen (19) feet, six (6) inches above the grade of the side setback line. For an addition to an existing structure, such distance shall be the higher of:

(A)    Nineteen (19) feet, six (6) inches above the grade of the side setback line; or

(B)    Eighteen (18) feet above the underside of the actual first floor, measured at the side wall, or twenty (20) feet, six (6) inches above the grade of the sidewall, whichever is lower.

As used in this section, an "addition to an existing structure" does not include construction over a new foundation or construction cantilevered beyond a new or existing foundation, "grade of the side wall" means the average grade of the highest and lowest points of the natural grade of the portion of the lot covered by the side wall, and "grade of the side setback line" means the average grade of the highest and lowest points of the natural grade of the portion of the lot directly below the side setback line. No portion of the structure shall intrude beyond the daylight plane except for dormers and gables as provided in subsection (2) of this section and chimneys, vents, flues and solar collectors.

(2)    Gable and Dormer Intrusions. Gables and dormers may intrude into the daylight plane of a lot that is ten thousand (10,000) square feet or less. The permitted intrusion shall decrease on an even gradient from ten feet (10') in the case of a five foot (5’) required side setback to no permitted intrusion in the case of an eight foot (8') required side setback. Thus the permitted intrusion will be six feet (6'), eight inches (8") in the case of a six foot (6') required side setback, five feet (5') in the case of a six and one-half foot (6.5") required side setback, and three feet (3'), four inches (4") in the case of a seven foot (7') required side setback. Calculations of the permitted intrusion shall include fractional computations when necessary to maintain the even gradient. Gables and dormers may intrude into the daylight plane on one (1) side of a lot only. The gable or dormer must not extend beyond a triangle described as follows:

(A)    The base of the triangle is the line formed by the intersection of the building wall with the daylight plane;

(B)    The aggregate length of the bases of all triangles intruding into a daylight plane shall not exceed thirty feet (30'); and

(C)    The triangle must be entirely within the maximum building height. (Ord. 1006 § 18 (part), 2014; Ord. 938 § 8 (part), 2005).

16.67.020 Daylight planes in R-1-S and R-1-U zoning districts.
Daylight planes for the main dwelling unit are established for each lot as follows:

(1)    Daylight Plane. A daylight plane shall begin at a horizontal line at a certain distance directly above each side setback line of each lot and shall slope inwards at a forty-five (45) degree angle. The distance between the side setback line and the horizontal line directly above it shall be as follows:

(A)    Single-story development: twelve (12) feet, six (6) inches above the grade of the side setback line;

(B)    Development of two or more stories: nineteen (19) feet, six (6) inches above the grade of the side setback line. For an addition to an existing structure, such distance shall be the higher of:

(i)    Nineteen (19) feet, six (6) inches above the grade of the side setback line; or

(ii)    Eighteen (18) feet above the underside of the actual first floor, measured at the side wall, or twenty (20) feet, six (6) inches above the grade of the side wall, whichever is lower.

As used in this section, an "addition to an existing structure" does not include construction over a new foundation or construction cantilevered beyond a new or existing foundation, "grade of the side wall" means the average grade of the highest and lowest points of the natural grade of the portion of the lot covered by the side wall, and "grade of the side setback line" means the average grade of the highest and lowest points of the natural grade of the portion of the lot directly below the side setback line. No portion of the structure shall intrude beyond the daylight plane except for dormers and gables as provided in subsection (2) of this section and chimneys, vents, flues and solar collectors.

(2)    Gable and Dormer Intrusions. Gables and dormers may intrude into the daylight plane of a lot as follows:

(A)    Single-story development: no permitted gable or dormer intrusions.

(B)    Development of two (2) or more stories: gables and dormers may intrude into the daylight plane of a lot that is ten thousand (10,000) square feet or less. The permitted intrusion shall decrease on an even gradient from ten feet (10') in the case of a five foot (5') required side setback to no permitted intrusion in the case of an eight foot (8') required side setback. Thus the permitted intrusion will be six feet (6'), eight inches (8") in the case of a six foot (6') required side setback, five feet (5') in the case of a six and one-half foot (6.5') required side setback, and three feet (3'), four inches (4") in the case of a seven foot (7') required side setback. Calculations of the permitted intrusion shall include fractional computations when necessary to maintain the even gradient. Gables and dormers may intrude into the daylight plane on one (1) side of a lot only. The gable or dormer must not extend beyond a triangle described as follows:

(i)    The base of the triangle is the line formed by the intersection of the building wall with the daylight plane;

(ii)    The aggregate length of the bases of all triangles intruding into a daylight plane shall not exceed thirty feet (30'); and

(iii)    The triangle must be entirely within the maximum building height. (Ord. 1006 § 18 (part), 2014; Ord. 938 § 8 (part), 2005).

When an application is made for a building permit for the construction, alteration or remodeling of any building other than a single-family dwelling, duplex and accessory building, or for any structure, dwelling or duplex on land designated as a historic landmark site, it shall be accompanied by architectural drawings showing elevations of the proposed building or structure, proposed landscaping or other treatment of the grounds around such building or structure, and proposed design of, and access to, required parking facilities. Such drawings shall be considered by the planning commission, architectural committee, or community development director which shall approve said application if the following findings are made:

(1)    That the general appearance of the structures is in keeping with character of the neighborhood;

(2)    That the development will not be detrimental to the harmonious and orderly growth of the city;

(3)    That the development will not impair the desirability of investment or occupation in the neighborhood;

(4)    That the development provides adequate parking as required in all applicable city ordinances and has made adequate provisions for access to such parking;

(5)    That the development is consistent with any applicable specific plan.

The community development director shall be limited to approving minor modifications to buildings located in the M-2 (general industrial) district, the O (office) district, and the LS (life sciences) district. For purposes of this section, a minor modification is considered one in which there is no increase in gross floor area.

Each request to alter a site or area and each application for a building permit to do work on a historic landmark site shall include plans and specifications showing the proposed landscaping or planting changes, exterior appearance, color and texture of materials, and architectural design and detail; drawings or photographs showing the property or site in the context of its surroundings may also be required.

I. USE PERMIT

16.82.010 Issuance—Purpose—Hearing.
Use permits may be issued as provided in this article for any of the uses or purposes for which such permits are required or permitted by the terms of this title upon conditions designated by the planning commission.

The purpose of the use permit is to allow the proper integration into the community of uses which may be suitable only in specific locations in a zoning district, or if such uses are designed or laid out on the site in a particular manner.

The planning commission may approve, deny, or conditionally approve an application for a use permit.

The planning commission may impose such conditions as it deems necessary to secure the purposes of this title and may impose such requirements and conditions with respect to location, construction, maintenance, operation, site planning, traffic control and time limits for the use permit as it deems necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest and may require tangible guarantees or evidence that such conditions are being, or will be, complied with. A public hearing shall be held thereon. Notice of such hearings shall be given to the persons designated and in the manner prescribed in Chapter 16.84. (Ord. 789 § 1, 1989; Ord. 548 § 2 (part), 1973: Prior code § 30.701(A)).

16.82.020 Form of application—Accompanying fee and plans.
Application for a use permit shall be made in writing by the owners of the property, lessee, purchaser in escrow, or optionee with the consent of the owners, on a form prescribed by the planning commission of the city. The application shall be accompanied by a fee, set by the City Council, and plans showing the details of the proposed use to be made of the land or building. (Ord. 548 § 2 (part), 1973: Prior code § 30.701(B)).

16.82.030 Granting.
In considering an application, the planning commission shall consider and give due regard to the nature and condition of all adjacent uses and structures, and to general and specific plans for the area in question and surrounding areas, and the impact of the application thereon.

The planning commission shall determine whether or not the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use applied for will, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, morals, comfort and general welfare of the persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such proposed use, or whether it will be injurious or detrimental to property and improvements in the neighborhood or the general welfare of the city. If the planning commission finds that the aforementioned conditions will not result from the particular use applied for, it may grant the use permit.

When granting a use permit for sales of alcoholic beverages (including wine and beer and off and on sale), the planning commission may stipulate that the use permit shall be nontransferable.

A use permit shall be effective the fifteenth (15th) day after planning commission approval unless the planning commission action is appealed to the City Council, in which case the permit shall not be effective until the City Council has acted upon the appeal. (Ord. 931 § 9 (part), 2004: Ord. 643(a), 1979; Ord. 548 § 2 (part), 1973: Prior code § 30.701(C)).

16.82.035 Concurrent retailing of motor vehicle fuel with beer or wine.
(a)    Hearings. Hearings before the planning commission or City Council concerning an application for a use permit to allow the concurrent retailing of motor vehicle fuel with beer or wine for off-premises consumption shall be conducted according to this section. All parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to present testimony. Testimony shall be presented in the following order: (1) testimony by or on behalf of applicant; (2) testimony of the public for or against the application; (3) rebuttal testimony by or on behalf of applicant. Decisions by the planning commission and City Council shall be justified by written findings based on substantial evidence in view of the whole record. Hearings on appeals to the City Council shall be reported by a court reporter. If the applicant is the appellant, it shall pay the cost of the court reporter and the cost of the court reporter shall be estimated by the city clerk and paid in advance by applicant or the appeal will be dismissed. All hearings shall be public hearings. Notice thereof shall be given in accordance with Chapter 16.84 to the applicant, property owners within three hundred feet (300’), and any person who has filed a request for special notice.

(b)    Duration of Permit Right. The right to engage in the concurrent retailing of motor vehicle fuel with beer or wine under the terms of any use permit, whether granted before or after the enactment of the ordinance codified in this section, shall continue only so long as the licensed premises are operated continuously without substantial change in the mode or character of operation. Changes in the mode or character of operation shall include, but not be limited to, a change in the physical structure of the premises, a change in the ownership of the license, or a pattern of behavior in violation of state or local law. A dispute between the operator or property owner and the city as to whether the premises have been operated continuously without substantial change in the mode or character of operation shall be heard and resolved in accordance with the procedure specified in subsection (a) of this section and Section 16.82.190. (Ord. 768 § 1, 1988).

16.82.040 Appeal to City Council.
Appeals to the City Council regarding use permits shall be governed by Chapter 16.86. The appeal shall be accompanied by a fee as set by the City Council, and no part of such fee shall be refundable except as directed by motion adopted by the City Council. If on appeal, any material information or evidence is submitted to the City Council which was not presented or made available to the planning commission, the application shall be returned to the planning commission for its reconsideration. Where an application is denied by the planning commission, or upon appeal by the City Council, it shall not be eligible for resubmittal unless, in the opinion of the planning commission, new evidence is submitted or conditions have changed to such an extent that further consideration is warranted. (Ord. 738 § 1(a), 1986: Ord. 548 § 2 (part), 1973: Ord. 529 § 1, 1972; Prior code § 30.701(D)).

II. CONDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT PERMITS

16.82.050 Issuance—Purposes.
A conditional development permit may be issued to allow adjustment of the requirements of the district in order to secure special benefits possible through comprehensive planning of such large development. Further, such adjustment is intended to allow relief from the monotony of standard development; to permit the application of new and desirable development techniques; and to encourage more usable open space than would otherwise be provided with standard development. (Ord. 939 § 2, 2005: Prior code § 30.703(A)).

16.82.055 Applicability.
A conditional development permit shall apply to the following:

(1)    Development on a parcel in excess of one (1) acre in area; or

(2)    Development on a parcel with a lot area that is less than one (1) acre in area but greater than or equal to twenty thousand (20,000) square feet in area; provided, that the development complies with the below market rate (BMR) housing program set forth in Chapter 16.96 and that the number of BMR units developed on the site exceeds the required number of BMR units by a fractional equivalent of more than one-half (0.5) of a unit.

Conditional development permits shall not apply to any parcel in the SP-ECR/D district. (Ord. 979 § 12 (part), 2012: Ord. 939 § 3, 2005).

16.82.060 Application—Accompanying drawings and plans.
Every application for a conditional development permit shall be accompanied by architectural drawings and plot plans, all to a workable scale, showing the elevations and location of proposed buildings; proposed location and type of landscaping; use and treatment of grounds around such buildings; off-street parking; physical features such as trees, hydrants, utility poles, flood lights, driveways, fences, signs, proposed drainage facilities and any other pertinent information considered appropriate by the planning commission to bring the development within the purpose of this section. (Prior code § 30.703(B)).

16.82.070 Form of application.
Applications for conditional development permits shall be made in writing by a property owner, lessee, purchasers in escrow or optionee, with the consent of the owner, on a form prescribed by the planning commission and accompanied by a fee, set by the City Council. (Prior code § 30.703(C)).

16.82.080 Hearing on application.
Upon receipt of an application for a conditional development permit, the secretary of the planning commission shall set a date for a public hearing on such application; such hearing shall be held within forty-five (45) days after the filing of the application. Notice of such hearing shall be given as set forth in Chapter 16.84. (Prior code § 30.703(D)).

16.82.090 Planning commission action on application.
Application for conditional development permits shall be considered by the planning commission in relation to the effect upon the immediate neighborhood and the city. The planning commission may require offers of dedication or whatever special conditions or improvements are necessary to keep the proposed development within the spirit and purpose of this chapter. The application may be approved and recommended to the City Council if the commission finds that the development will serve the health, safety, and general welfare of the city. (Prior code § 30.703(E)).

16.82.100 Council action.
Upon receipt of the planning commission’s recommendation on a conditional development permit, the city clerk shall set a date for a public hearing thereon. Such hearing shall be held within thirty days after the receipt of the recommendation. At the conclusion of such hearing, the City Council may approve the conditional development permit, as recommended by the planning commission or as modified by the City Council. Council approval shall be in the form of an ordinance which shall combine the X district with the appropriate zoning district. (Prior code § 30.703(F)).

IV. REVOCATION OR DENIAL OF USE OF CONDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT PERMIT

16.82.170 Permits declared null and void when.
Any use permit or conditional development permit granted in accordance with the terms of Articles I and II shall be null and void if not used within one (1) year from the date of the approval thereof or within any different period of time, if so designated by the planning commission or City Council. The community development director may extend the effective date of approval upon the written request of the applicant for up to one (1) year, if the community development director finds that there is good cause for the extension based upon unusual circumstances and/or conditions not of the making of the applicant or its agents or employees. (Ord. 931 § 9 (part), 2004: Amended at city’s request, undated letter received May 1983; Prior code § 30.704 (part)).

16.82.180 Conditions of revocation.
Any use permit or conditional development permit granted in accordance with the terms of Articles I—II may be revoked by the City Council in the manner hereinafter set forth, if any of the conditions or terms of such permits are violated or if the following findings are made:

(1)    In connection with use permits: The continuance of the use would be detrimental to health, safety, morals, comfort and general welfare of the persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such use, or would be injurious or detrimental to property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city; or conditions of the permit are violated;

(3)    In connection with conditional development permits: One or more of the conditions of the permit are violated.

(Amended at city’s request, undated letter received May 1983; Prior code § 30.704(A)).

16.82.190 Hearing.
Before the council considers revocation of any permit, the planning commission shall hold a hearing thereon after giving written notice thereof to the permittee at least ten days in advance of such hearing. Within five days thereafter, the commission shall transmit a report of its findings and its recommendations on the revocation to the City Council.

(Amended at city’s request, undated letter received May 1983; Prior code § 30.704(B)).

16.82.200 Reapplication.
In the case of an application for a use permit or conditional development permit which has been denied, no application for the same property which is substantially the same shall be considered for a period of one year from the date of denial.

V. OCCUPANCY PERMITS

16.82.210 Where required.
In other than residential areas, no land or structure shall be occupied or used until an occupancy permit shall have been issued by the building department. (Prior code § 30.901).

16.82.220 Buildings.
Occupancy permits for a new building, or the enlargement or alteration of an existing building, shall be applied for coincidentally with the application for a building permit and shall be issued within ten days after the erection or alteration of such building has been completed in conformity with the provisions of this article. (Prior code § 30.902).

16.82.230 Vacant land.
Occupancy permits for the use of vacant land, or the change in the use of land as herein provided, shall be applied for before any such land shall be occupied or used for any purpose except that of tilling soil and the growing therein of farm, garden or orchard products.

16.82.240 Permit—Fee and content.
Occupancy permits shall state that the building, or proposed use of a building or land, complies with all the building and health laws and ordinances and with the provisions of this chapter. A record of all occupancy permits shall be kept on file in the office of the building official and copies shall be furnished on request to any person having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the building or land affected. No fee shall be charged for an original permit applied for coincidentally with the application for a building permit; for all other permits or for copies of any original permits there shall be a fee as established by resolution of the City Council. (Prior code § 30.904).

VI. VARIANCES

16.82.310 Issuance—Purpose—Hearing.
The planning commission, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards as provided by this title, may hear and decide applications for variances from the terms of this title when the following circumstances are found to apply:

(1)    That, because of special circumstances applicable to the subject property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict application of this title is found to deprive such property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and under identical zoning classification;

(2)    That any variance granted shall be subject to such conditions as will assure that the adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zone in which subject property is situated and which are necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare.

The planning commission may approve, deny, or conditionally approve an application for a variance. The planning commission may impose such conditions as it deems necessary to secure the purposes of this title and may impose such requirements and conditions with respect to location, construction, maintenance, operation, site planning, traffic control, and time limits for the variance as it deems necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest and may require tangible guarantees or evidence that such conditions are being, or will be, complied with. A public hearing shall be held thereon. Notice of such hearings shall be given to the persons designated and in the manner prescribed in Chapter 16.84. (Ord. 879 § 3 (part), 1996).

16.82.320 Variance applications.
Variance applications shall be filed on prescribed forms, indicating thereon, or supplemental thereto, such data and information as the prescribed form shall require. Each such application shall be verified by the owner(s) of the property involved. The application for the variance shall be accompanied by a filing fee in an amount established by resolution of the City Council, and no part of such fee shall be refundable. (Ord. 879 § 3 (part), 1996).

16.82.330 Duties of secretary of planning commission as to hearings.
Upon the filing of a verified application, the secretary of the planning commission shall:

(1)    Cause an investigation of applicable factors and secure a written staff report containing the facts thus far ascertained;

(2)    Set the matter for public hearing at the first available meeting of the commission;

(3)    Not less than ten (10) days preceding the date of the public hearing, send a notice through the United States mail to the latest recorded property owners of all property located within three hundred feet (300’) of subject property, as shown upon the current assessment role of the city and the county; said to identify the property for which a variance is applied, the nature of the proposed variance, the time and place of the public hearing; and have published the same notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. The failure of any property owner to receive said notice of hearing will not invalidate the proceedings.

Following the hearing on an application for a variance the commission may, if it deems necessary make, or cause to have made, further inquiries into fact and shall thereafter record its findings in resolution form. (Ord. 879 § 3 (part), 1996).

16.82.340 Purpose of the variance and required findings.
(a)    Purpose. The purpose of the variance is to allow variation from the strict application of the terms of this title where, by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness or unusual shape of a specific piece of property, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition of such piece of property, or by reason of the use or development of property immediately adjoining the piece of property in question, the literal enforcement of the requirements of this title would cause undue hardship unnecessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of this title. In no case shall a variance be granted to permit a use other than a use permitted in the district involved or to permit relief in excess of fifty percent (50%) of any requirement of this title. In the SP-ECR/D district, in no case shall a variance be granted to exceed the intensity (floor area ratio) or density (dwelling units per acre) standards.

(b)    Findings. The planning commission shall grant a variance only when all of the following conditions are found:

(1)    That a hardship peculiar to the property and not created by any act of the owner exists. In this context, personal, family or financial difficulties, loss of prospective profits and neighboring violations are not hardships justifying a variance. Further, a previous variance can never have set a precedent, for each case must be considered only on its individual merits;

(2)    That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other conforming property in the same vicinity and that a variance, if granted, would not constitute a special privilege of the recipient not enjoyed by his/her neighbors;

(3)    That the granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property;

(4)    That the conditions upon which the requested variance is based would not be applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification;

(5)    That the condition upon which the requested variance is based is an unusual factor that was not anticipated or discussed in detail during any applicable specific plan process. (Ord. 979 § 12 (part), 2012: Ord. 879 § 3 (part), 1996).

16.82.350 Willow Road land use plan, variances.
Notwithstanding the requirements of the preceding section, variances in residential densities may be granted whenever necessary to carry out the provisions of the Willow Road land use plan adopted by the City Council on November 24, 1987. (Ord. 879 § 3 (part), 1996).

16.82.360 Decisions of the commission and appeals therefrom.
(a)    Decision and Required Conditions.

(1)    Within thirty (30) days after the hearing of the application the planning commission shall render its decision and shall by written resolution render its order based on a finding of facts showing whether or not the findings required under Section 16.82.340(b) applying to the land and/or building for which the variance is sought have been met, and whether or not such variance will be in harmony with the general purpose of this title.

(2)    The commission may designate such conditions in connection with the variance, as it deems necessary to secure the purposes of this title, and may require guarantees and evidence that such conditions are being or will be complied with.

(b)    Appeal. Appeals from an action of the planning commission may be made pursuant to Chapter 16.86. The City Council shall consider the appeal with reference to Section 16.82.340 and shall render its decision based on the findings of fact as therein enumerated.

(c)    Issuance of Permit. Following the planning commission approval of a variance application or appeal to the commission, the secretary of the commission shall forward a copy of the resolution to the applicant, the building inspection division, and the city clerk. Said order shall become effective within fifteen (15) days from the date of the resolution. Thereafter, all administrative and enforcing offices of the city shall conform to such order.

(d)    Time Limit. The planning commission may establish a time limit within which the subject property and use shall be developed. Said time limit may be extended by the commission, or by the community development director for up to one (1) year, for good cause when the applicant presents proof of unusual conditions not of his own making. If no time limit is specified by the commission it shall not be for more than one (1) year.

(e)    New Applications. Following the denial of a variance or appeal to the commission, no application for a variance from the same or substantially the same exception to the ordinance on the same or substantially the same site, or the same appeal to the commission, shall be filed within one (1) year from the date of denial of a variance or appeal. (Ord. 931 § 9 (part), 2004: Ord. 879 § 3 (part), 1996).

16.82.370 Violation of orders.
The violation of any condition imposed by the commission in connection with an order granting a variance shall constitute a violation of this title and shall be subject to the same penalties as any other violations of this title. (Ord. 879 § 3 (part), 1996).

16.82.380 Revocation or modification of variances.
If at any time subsequent to an order of the planning commission, circumstances recited in the resolution as contributing to the justification for the order granting a variance should be changed, the commission may, upon its own initiative or on the recommendations of an enforcing office of the city, institute proceedings which shall be the same as those employed in considering an application for a variance. Upon the completion of the required hearing the commission shall by resolution enumerate its findings and, based thereon, shall issue its order to continue the original variance, modify the conditions of the variance, or revoke the variance as, in the judgment of the commission, is justified by its findings and necessary to conform to the purposes of this title.

Copies of such findings and order shall be distributed as in the case of action on an application or appeal to the commission as set forth in Section 16.82.360(c). (Ord. 879 § 3 (part), 1996).

VII. ADMINISTRATIVE PERMITS

16.82.410 Purpose.
An administrative permit, identified elsewhere in the zoning ordinance, may be granted in accordance with the following sections. An applicant may elect to apply for a use permit in accordance with Chapter 16.82 in lieu of applying for an administrative permit. (Ord. 931 § 10 (part), 2004).

16.82.420 Application.
Requests for an administrative permit shall be made in writing by the owner of the property, lessee, purchaser in escrow, or optionee with the consent of the owners, on a form prescribed by the city. The application shall be accompanied by a fee, set by the City Council, and plans showing the details of the proposal. (Ord. 931 § 10 (part), 2004).

16.82.430 Noticing.
Upon receipt of an application, a notice shall be mailed fifteen (15) days prior to action being taken on the application to all property owners and building occupants within three hundred feet (300’) of the exterior boundary of the property involved, using for this purpose the last known name and address of such owners as shown upon the current assessment roll maintained by the city. The notice shall include a description of the proposal, methods for providing comments, the pending date of action, means of being notified of a decision as an interested party, and the appeal procedure. (Ord. 931 § 10 (part), 2004).

16.83.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a procedure to request reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act in the application of zoning laws and other land use regulations, policies and procedures, and to establish relevant criteria to be used when considering such requests. (Ord. 1003 § 2 (part), 2014).

16.83.020 Applicability.
In order to make specific housing available to an individual with a disability, any person may request a modification or exception to the rules, standards and practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of his or her choice. A person with a disability is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits or substantially limits one or more major life activities, anyone who is regarded as having such impairment or anyone who has a record of such impairment. This chapter applies only to those persons who are defined as disabled under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. (Ord. 1003 § 2 (part), 2014).

16.83.030 Application requirements.
(a)    A request for reasonable accommodation shall be filed on the application form provided by the Community Development Department. If necessary to ensure accessibility, the applicant may request an alternative format. The applicant may be the person with the disability or his or her representative. The application shall be accompanied by a fee, set by the city council, and be signed by the owner of the property and shall provide the following information:

(1)    Applicant’s name and contact information;

(2)    Property address;

(3)    Current use of the property;

(4)    Basis for the claim that the individual is considered disabled under fair housing laws;

(5)    The zoning code provision, regulation or policy from which reasonable accommodation is being requested;

(6)    Explanation why the reasonable accommodation is necessary to make the specific property accessible to the individual; and

(7)    Plans showing the details of the proposal.

(b)    If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is being made also requires some other discretionary approval under this title (including but not limited to a conditional use permit, architectural control, variance, or zoning amendment), the application for reasonable accommodation shall be submitted and reviewed at the same time as the related applications. (Ord. 1003 § 2 (part), 2014).

16.83.040 Review authority.
(a)    If an application under this chapter is filed without any accompanying application for another approval, permit or entitlement under this title, the community development director shall make a written determination within forty-five (45) days and either grant, grant with modifications or deny a request for reasonable accommodation.

(b)    If an application under this chapter is filed with an application for another approval, permit or entitlement under this title, it shall be heard and acted upon at the same time and in the same manner as such other application, and shall be subject to all of the same procedures. (Ord. 1003 § 2 (part), 2014).

16.83.050 Findings and decision.
(a)    Any decision on an application under this chapter shall be supported by written findings addressing the criteria set forth in this subsection. An application under this chapter for a reasonable accommodation shall be granted if all of the following findings are made:

(1)    The housing, which is the subject of the request, will be used by an individual disabled under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act.

(2)    The requested reasonable accommodation is necessary to make specific housing available to an individual with a disability under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act.

(3)    The requested reasonable accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city.

(4)    The requested reasonable accommodation would not require a fundamental alteration in the nature of a city program or law, including but not limited to land use and zoning.

(5)    The requested reasonable accommodation would not adversely impact surrounding properties or uses.

(6)    There are no reasonable alternatives that would provide an equivalent level of benefit without requiring a modification or exception to the city’s applicable rules, standards and practices.

(b)    In granting a request for reasonable accommodation, the reviewing authority may impose any conditions of approval deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation would comply with the findings required by subsection (a) of this section. (Ord. 1003 § 2 (part), 2014).

16.83.060 Appeal determination.
Any decision of the community development director or designee may be appealed by the applicant to the planning commission. The appeal shall be made in writing and filed with the community development director within fifteen (15) days following the final decision. The appeal shall be accompanied by a fee, as set by the city council, and shall clearly state the reasons for the appeal. Where the request for accommodation is in conjunction with an application for another approval, permit or entitlement under this title, the appeal procedures for such other approval, permit or entitlement shall control. (Ord. 1003 § 2 (part), 2014).

16.83.070 Rescission of grants of reasonable accommodation.
Any approval or conditional approval of an application under this chapter may be conditioned to provide for its rescission or automatic expiration under appropriate circumstances. (Ord. 1003 § 2 (part), 2014).

16.96.010 Purpose.
The purpose of the below market rate (BMR) housing program is to increase the housing supply for households that have very low, low and moderate incomes compared to the median household income for San Mateo County. The primary objective is to create actual housing units, either "rental" or "for purchase" units, rather than equivalent cash. The below market rate requirements associated with residential development projects are a form of "inclusionary zoning." The below market rate requirements associated with commercial development projects are a form of "linkage." This chapter authorizes the below market rate housing program. The program is implemented through guidelines as adopted and amended from time to time by the city council. (Ord. 1045 § 2 (part), 2018: Ord. 905 § 2 (part), 2001).

16.96.020 Residential development projects.
(a)    Applicability. This section shall apply to conditional use permits, conditional development permits, planned development permits, subdivision approvals, architectural control approvals, variance approvals, and building permits for any residential development project of five (5) or more units. This section also applies to condominium conversions.

(b)    Requirements. For residential development projects of less than twenty (20) units, the developer shall provide not less than ten percent (10%) of the units at below market rates to very low-, low- and moderate-income households. For residential development projects of twenty (20) or more units, the developer shall provide not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the units at below market rates to very low-, low- and moderate-income households. If the number of units required for a residential development project includes a fraction of a unit, the developer shall provide either a whole unit or a prorata in lieu payment on account of such fraction as determined in the below market rate housing program guidelines. The requirements of this section may be met through the provision of on-site or off-site below market rate units as determined by the housing commission and the reviewing body (i.e., planning commission or city council).

(c)    Review Process. As part of an application for an applicable residential development project, the developer shall submit a below market rate housing agreement. The agreement shall set forth the developer’s plan to meet the requirements of this section. The agreement shall be reviewed by the housing commission and forwarded with a recommendation to the reviewing body for the application request. The reviewing body shall act on the agreement prior to or concurrently with the action on the application request. No building permit or other land use authorization may be issued or approved unless the requirements of this section have been met. (Ord. 1045 § 2 (part), 2018: Ord. 905 § 2 (part), 2001).

16.96.030 Commercial development projects.
(a)    Applicability. This section shall apply to conditional use permits, conditional development permits, planned development permits, subdivision approvals, architectural control approvals, variance approvals, and building permits for any commercial development project or the construction of such project or any portion thereof which includes any new square footage or any square footage that is converted from an exempt use to a non-exempt use or from a Group B (all other commercial/industrial uses) use to a Group A (office/R&D) use.

(b)    Exemptions. The following uses are exempt from this section:

(1)    Private schools and churches;

(2)    Public facilities;

(3)    Commercial development projects of less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet;

(4)    Projects that generate few or no employees.

(c)    Requirements. The developer shall mitigate the demand for affordable housing created by the commercial development project. The below market rate housing program guidelines provides various alternatives for mitigation. A commercial development project may be required to provide below market rate housing on site (if allowed by the zoning district) or off site. If it is not feasible to provide below market rate housing units, the developer shall pay an in-lieu fee prior to issuance of a building permit as follows:

(1)    Group A use: Eleven dollars and eighty-nine cents ($11.89) per square foot of new gross floor area;

(2)    Group B use: Six dollars and forty-eight cents ($6.48) per square foot of new gross floor area.

The in-lieu fee shall be adjusted annually on the first of July, in accordance with the guidelines.

(d)    Review Process. As part of an application for a commercial development project, the developer shall submit a below market rate housing agreement. The agreement shall set forth the developer’s plan to meet the requirements of this section. The agreement shall be reviewed by the housing commission and forwarded with a recommendation to the reviewing body (i.e., planning commission or city council) for the application request. The reviewing body shall act on the agreement prior to or concurrently with the action on the application request. No building permit or other land use authorization may be issued or approved unless the requirements of this section have been met. (Ord. 1045 § 2 (part), 2018: Ord. 927 § 1 (part), 2003; Ord. 905 § 2 (part), 2001).

16.96.040 Development regulations for below market rate housing units.
(a)    Generally. The provisions of this section shall apply only to housing developments and mixed-use developments that include housing that provide one (1) or more below market rate units in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. This section is intended as an alternative to the State Density Bonus Law, the enabling ordinance for which is set forth in Chapter 16.97 of the Menlo Park Municipal Code. Housing developments and mixed-use projects including housing may elect to utilize the bonuses and incentives under this chapter or Chapter 16.97, but not both.

(b)    Density and FAR bonuses. For each below market rate unit provided under the below market rate housing program, a developer shall be permitted to build one (1) additional market rate unit and, in the case of a subdivision, to create a legal lot or condominium unit for such additional unit. In addition, a developer shall be permitted to increase the floor area associated with the residential development project by an amount that corresponds to the increase in allowable density. Requests for density bonuses of a maximum of fifteen percent (15%) are subject to approval of the reviewing body (i.e., planning commission or city council) associated with the required application.

(c)    Incentives. The following incentives may be requested, if applicable:

(1)    To accommodate the increase in allowable density and floor area ratio described in subsection (b) of this section, the developer may request exceptions from all development regulations of the applicable zoning district of a residential development project that includes below market rate units, except for floor area ratio and density.

(2)    Development on a parcel of less than one (1) acre in area but greater than or equal to twenty thousand (20,000) square feet where the number of BMR units developed on the site exceeds the required number of BMR units by a fractional equivalent of more than one-half (0.5) of a unit may request exceptions from development regulations as specified in Sections 16.82.050 through 16.82.100, conditional development permits. (Ord. 1045 § 2 (part), 2018: Ord. 939 § 4, 2005; Ord. 905 § 2 (part), 2001).

16.96.050 Below market rate housing fund.

16.96.070 Rental housing alternative means of compliance.
For any rental housing development subject to this chapter, the applicant may comply with the requirements of this chapter by providing in-lieu fees, land dedication, off-site construction, or acquisition and rehabilitation of existing units. Any alternative means of compliance shall be approved by the city council upon findings that the alternative is commensurate with the applicable on-site requirement and complies with applicable program guidelines. (Ord. 1045 § 2 (part), 2018).

16.96.072 Treatment of contiguous parcels
(a)    For purposes of this chapter, new residential and commercial development projects on contiguous properties and that are submitted by the same applicant, are under common ownership, and/or under common control shall be treated as one (1) development project.

(1)    "Common ownership" means two (2) or more legally created parcels that share an owner, are owned or controlled by an owner’s spouse, or are under the direct or indirect control of one (1) person or legal entity through ownership, management, contract, or otherwise.

(2)    "Owner" means an owner of record or the holder of an equitable or legal interest in property. For purposes of this chapter, an owner shall include any person, persons, or entity with at least a ten percent (10%) interest in the property, either directly or by owning or controlling an entity with at least a ten percent (10%) interest in the property.

(3)    "Common control" means two (2) or more owners that directly or indirectly (1) share a managing member or members in the case of a limited liability company; (2) share a managing general partner or partners in the case of a partnership; or (3) are under the management or control of boards of directors or officers that overlap by fifty percent (50%) or more in the case of a corporation.

(b)    An applicant for a development project shall not avoid the BMR requirements of this chapter by submitting piecemeal applications. At the time of the application for first approval for a development project, the applicant shall identify all contiguous property under common ownership or common control. The applicant shall not be required to contribute BMR units or pay in-lieu fees based on common ownership or control of the contiguous property at the time of the application for first approval; however, the applicant shall be required to include the contiguous property under common ownership or control in its below market rate housing agreement. The agreement shall be recorded against the development project and all contiguous property under common ownership or control and shall require compliance with this chapter upon development of each contiguous property under common ownership or control at such time as there are development project applications on such properties that would authorize the application of the BMR requirements contained in this chapter to the initial development project and the subsequent development project on the contiguous property under common ownership or control. (Ord. 1045 § 2 (part), 2018).

16.96.080 Administrative relief.
(a)    As part of the initial application submittal for a residential or nonresidential project to which this chapter is applicable, a developer may request that the requirements of this chapter be waived or modified by the city council, based upon a showing that applying the requirements of this chapter would result in an unconstitutional taking of property or would result in any other unconstitutional result.

(b)    The request for a waiver or modification shall set forth in detail the factual and legal basis for the request.

(c)    Any request for a waiver or modification shall be reviewed and considered at the same time as the project application.

(d)    The waiver or modification may be approved only to the extent necessary to avoid an unconstitutional result, based upon legal advice provided by or at the behest of the city attorney, after adoption of written findings, based on legal analysis and substantial evidence. (Ord. 1045 § 2 (part), 2018).

16.97.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to adopt an ordinance that specifies how compliance with Government Code Section 65915 ("State Density Bonus Law") will be implemented in an effort to encourage the production of low income housing units in developments proposed within the city. (Ord. 1045 § 3 (part), 2018: Ord. 994 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.97.020 Definitions.
Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, the definitions found in state density bonus law shall apply to the terms contained herein. (Ord. 1045 § 3 (part), 2018: Ord. 994 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.97.030 Applicability.
This chapter shall apply to all zoning districts, including mixed use zoning districts, where residential developments of five (5) or more dwelling units are proposed and where the applicant seeks and agrees to provide low, very low, senior or moderate income housing units in the threshold amounts specified in state density bonus law such that the resulting density is beyond that which is permitted by the applicable zoning. This chapter and state density bonus law shall apply only to the residential component of a mixed use project and shall not operate to increase the allowable density of the nonresidential component of any proposed project. (Ord. 1045 § 3 (part), 2018: Ord. 994 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.97.040 Application requirements.
(a)    Any applicant requesting a density bonus, incentive(s) and/or waiver(s) pursuant to state density bonus law shall provide the city with a written proposal. The proposal shall be submitted prior to or concurrently with filing the planning application for the housing development and shall be processed in conjunction with the underlying application.

(b)    The proposal for a density bonus, incentive(s) and/or waiver(s) pursuant to state density bonus law shall include the following information:

(1)    Requested Density Bonus. The specific requested density bonus proposal shall evidence that the project meets the thresholds for state density bonus law. The proposal shall also include calculations showing the maximum base density, the number/percentage of affordable units and identification of the income level at which such units will be restricted, additional market rate units resulting from the density bonus allowable under state density bonus law and the resulting unit per acre density. The density bonus units shall not be included in determining the percentage of base units that qualify a project for a density bonus pursuant to state density bonus law.

(2)    Requested Incentive(s). The request for particular incentive(s) shall include a pro forma or other report evidencing that the requested incentive(s) results in identifiable, financially sufficient and actual cost reductions that are necessary to make the housing units economically feasible. The report shall be sufficiently detailed to allow the city to verify its conclusions. If the city requires the services of specialized financial consultants to review and corroborate the analysis, the applicant will be liable for all costs incurred in reviewing the documentation.

(3)    Requested Waiver(s). The written proposal shall include an explanation of the waiver(s) of development standards requested and why they are necessary to make the construction of the project physically possible. Any requested waiver(s) shall not exceed the limitations provided by Section 16.97.080 and to the extent such limitations are exceeded will be considered as a request for an incentive.

(4)    Fee. Payment of the fee in an amount set by resolution of the city council to reimburse the city for staff time spent reviewing and processing the state density bonus law application submitted pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 1045 § 3 (part), 2018: Ord. 994 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.97.050 Density bonus.
(a)    A density bonus for a housing development means a density increase over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the applicable zoning and land use designation on the date the application is deemed complete. The amount of the allowable density bonus shall be calculated as provided in state density bonus law. The applicant may select from only one (1) of the income categories identified in state density bonus law and may not combine density bonuses from different income categories to achieve a larger density bonus.

(b)    In the sole discretion of the city council, the city council may approve a density bonus and/or incentive(s) in accordance with state density bonus law for a project that does not maximize the underlying base zoning density. Additionally, nothing herein prevents the city from granting a greater density bonus and additional incentives or waivers than that provided for herein, or from providing a lesser density bonus and fewer incentives and waivers than that provided for herein, when the housing development does not meet the minimum thresholds.

(c)    The density bonus, incentives and waivers provided pursuant to state density bonus law are not additive with and shall not be combined with the density bonus provided pursuant to Section 16.96.040 (FAR and density bonus) or Chapter 16.98 (Affordable Housing Overlay).

(d)    An applicant shall be ineligible for a density bonus or any other incentives or waivers under this chapter if the housing development displaces qualifying rental dwelling units, unless the development replaces those units in accordance with state law. (Ord. 1045 § 3 (part), 2018: Ord. 994 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.97.060 Incentives.
(a)    The number of incentives granted shall be based upon the number the applicant is entitled to pursuant to state density bonus law.

(b)    An incentive includes a reduction in site development standards or a modification of zoning code requirements or architectural requirements that result in identifiable, financially sufficient and actual cost reductions. An incentive may be the approval of mixed use zoning (e.g., commercial) in conjunction with a housing project if the mixed use will reduce the cost of the housing development and is compatible with the housing project. An incentive may, but need not be, the provision of a direct financial incentive, such as the waiver of fees.

(c)    The city has specifically approved the following incentive for properties not located within the El Camino Real/Downtown specific plan boundary:

(1)    If the applicant proposes to put fifty percent (50%) of the required parking in a parking structure, then the applicant shall be eligible for a ten percent (10%) increase in the base density for purposes of the calculations of maximum base density and percentage of affordable units required to apply state density bonus law.

(d)    A requested incentive may be denied only for those reasons provided in state density bonus law. Denial of an incentive is a separate and distinct act from a decision to deny or approve the entirety of the project. (Ord. 994 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.97.070 Discretionary approval authority retained.
The granting of a density bonus or incentive(s) shall not be interpreted in and of itself to require a general plan amendment, zoning change or other discretionary approval. If an incentive would otherwise trigger one of these approvals, when it is granted as an incentive, no general plan amendment, zoning change or other discretionary approval is required. However, if the base project without the incentive requires a general plan amendment, zoning change or other discretionary approval, the city retains discretion to make or not make the required findings for approval of the base project. (Ord. 994 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.97.080 Waivers.
A waiver is a modification to a development standard such that construction at the increased density would be physically possible. Modifications to floor area ratio in an amount equivalent to the percentage density bonus utilized shall be allowable as a waiver. Requests for an increase in floor area ratio above that equivalent percentage shall be considered a request for an incentive. Other development standards include, but are not limited to, a height limitation, a setback requirement, an on-site open space requirement, or a parking ratio that applies to a residential development. An applicant may request a waiver of any development standard to make the project physically possible to construct at the increased density. To be entitled to the requested waiver, the applicant must show that without the waiver, the project would be physically impossible to construct. There is no limit on the number of waivers. (Ord. 994 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.97.085 Specific plan exemptions.
The following requirements in the Menlo Park El Camino Real Downtown specific plan area shall not be modified as either an incentive or waiver pursuant to this chapter:

(1)    The maximum FAR shall be limited to the public benefit levels.

(2)    The front and side setbacks facing a public right-of-way.

(3)    Building facade height.

(4)    Massing and modulation standards including major portions of a building facing a street should be parallel to the street, building breaks, building facade modulation and building profile, and upper story facade length. (Ord. 994 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.97.090 Affordable housing agreement.
Prior to project approval, the applicant shall enter into an affordable housing agreement with the city, to be executed by the city manager without review by the housing commission, planning commission or city council if the underlying application does not require review and/or approval by those bodies, to the satisfaction of the city attorney guaranteeing the affordability of the rental or ownership units for a minimum of thirty (30) years and identifying the type, size and location of each affordable unit. Such affordable housing agreement shall be recorded in the San Mateo County recorder’s office. (Ord. 994 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.97.100 Design and quality.
(a)    Affordable units must be constructed concurrently with market rate units and shall be integrated into the project. Affordable units shall be of equal design and quality as the market rate units. Exteriors, including architecture and elevations, and floor plans of the affordable units shall be similar to the market rate units. Interior finishes and amenities may differ from those provided in the market rate units, but neither the workmanship nor the products may be of substandard or inferior quality as determined by the building official. The number of bedrooms in the affordable units shall be consistent with the mix of market rate units.

(b)    Parking standards shall be modified as allowable under state density bonus law and anything beyond those standards shall be considered a request for an incentive. (Ord. 994 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.98.060    Continued affordability.

16.98.070    Design.

16.98.010 Purpose and goal.
The purpose of the affordable housing overlay ("AHO") zone established by this chapter is to encourage the development of affordable housing for low, very low and extremely low income households. The AHO serves to implement the housing element goal of providing new housing that addresses affordable housing needs in the city of Menlo Park by establishing development regulations for designated housing opportunity sites. The AHO is also intended to address those housing projects which provide a greater percentage of low and very low income units than identified in Government Code Section 65915. (Ord. 993 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.98.015 Applicability.
This chapter shall apply to the Menlo Park El Camino Real and Downtown specific plan area and those properties zoned R-4-S (AHO) (high density residential, special—affordable housing overlay). (Ord. 993 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.98.020 Affordable housing requirement.
(a)    For smaller projects that propose more than five (5) but less than one hundred (100) residential dwelling units, to qualify for the AHO and the density bonus and incentives provided pursuant to this chapter, a residential development project shall provide a minimum of twenty-one percent (21%) low income units or twelve percent (12%) very low income units. If a smaller project proposes to provide both low and very low income units, the minimum percentage of units to qualify for the AHO shall be more than the additive amount necessary to achieve a thirty-five percent (35%) density bonus as described in Government Code Section 65915. For example, a project that proposes to provide ten percent (10%) low (twenty percent (20%) density bonus) and five percent (5%) very low (twenty percent (20%) density bonus) would qualify for the AHO because the total additive density bonus under Government Code Section 65915 would be a forty percent (40%) density bonus.

(b)    For larger projects that propose one hundred (100) or more residential dwelling units, to qualify for the AHO and the density bonus and incentives provided pursuant to this chapter, a residential development project shall provide a minimum of twenty-one percent (21%) low income units or twelve percent (12%) very low income units. If a larger project proposes to provide both low and very low income units, the minimum percentage of units to qualify for the AHO shall be the additive amount necessary to achieve more than a thirty-five percent (35%) density bonus. For purposes of this subsection (b), to determine the additive percent density bonus required to qualify for the AHO, the density bonus percentages shall be as described in Government Code Section 65915 and as described in Table 1 below. For example, a project that proposes to provide ten percent (10%) low (twenty percent (20%) density bonus pursuant to Government Code Section 65915) and four percent (4%) very low income (seventeen and one-half percent (17.5%) density bonus pursuant to Table 1) would qualify for the AHO because the total additive density bonus pursuant to Government Code Section 65915 and Table 1 would be a thirty-seven and one-half percent (37.5%) density bonus.

(c)    The percentage of low or very low income units shall be calculated as a percentage of the maximum base unit density of the property, not including any public benefit density. The low or very low income percentage required to qualify for the AHO shall not include the below market rate units required to be provided by for-sale residential development projects and commercial development projects pursuant to the city’s below market rate housing program, Chapter 16.96.

(d)    Those projects located in the Menlo Park El Camino Real and Downtown specific plan area that qualify for the AHO shall be eligible for the density bonus and incentives identified in this chapter. The density bonus applies only to the residential component of a project in the Menlo Park El Camino Real and Downtown specific plan area and does not act to entitle a project to more office, retail or other nonresidential density.

(e)    To qualify for the AHO, a project must accommodate a full range of income levels. At least twenty-five percent (25%) of the affordable units in a project must be very low and/or extremely low income units or at least fifteen percent (15%) of the affordable units in a project must be extremely low income. (Ord. 993 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.98.030 Density bonus.
(a)    Low Income. A project that provides twenty-one percent (21%) low income units shall be entitled to a thirty-six and one-half percent (36.5%) density bonus. For each additional percentage of low income units above twenty-one percent (21%) or above the percentage of low income units provided to qualify for the AHO where a mix of low and very low income units is provided, the project shall be entitled to an additional one and one-half percent (1.5%) density bonus, up to the maximum density bonus identified in subsection (c) of this section.

(b)    Very Low Income. A project that provides twelve percent (12%) very low income units shall be entitled to a thirty-seven and one-half percent (37.5%) density bonus. For each additional percentage of very low income units above twelve percent (12%) or above the percentage of very low income units provided to qualify for the AHO where a mix of low and very low income units is provided, the project shall be entitled to an additional two and one-half percent (2.5%) density bonus, up to the maximum density bonus identified in subsection (c) of this section.

(c)    The maximum density bonus available pursuant to this chapter, whether achieved by provision of low, very low or a mix of low and very low income units, is sixty percent (60%). The density bonus percentages used to calculate the total additive density bonus for a project that proposes a mix of low and very low income units shall be calculated pursuant to Section 16.98.020 and this section. The density bonus provided pursuant to the AHO is not additive with and shall not be combined with the density bonus provided pursuant to state density bonus law, Government Code Section 65915.

(d)    For purposes of this chapter, any decimal fraction of less than one-half (0.5) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number and any decimal fraction of one-half (0.5) or more shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number. (Ord. 993 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.98.040 Incentives.
(a)    Floor Area Ratio. A project shall be permitted to increase the floor area ratio by an amount that corresponds to the increase in allowable density identified in Section 16.98.030 and an additional five percent (5%) or other increase reasonably sufficient to make development of low and very low income multiple-bedroom units and family housing feasible.

(b)    Stories/Height. A project that is entitled to up to a forty-five percent (45%) density bonus under this AHO shall be entitled to a maximum height of four (4) stories, but not more than forty-eight (48) feet. A project that is entitled to a density bonus above forty-five percent (45%) under this AHO and in which at least fifty percent (50%) of the affordable units are very low and extremely low income or at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the affordable units are extremely low income, shall be entitled to a maximum of five (5) stories, but not more than sixty (60) feet.

(c)    Parking. Unless modified herein, the parking requirements in the underlying zoning designation of the property shall apply. The parking requirements in the AHO shall be modified for each affordable unit as follows:

(1)    Number of Spaces.

(A)    A studio requires 0.8 parking spaces.

(B)    A one (1) bedroom requires one (1) parking space.

(C)    A two (2) bedroom or larger unit requires one and one-half (1.5) parking spaces.

(D)    For projects located in the station area or station area sphere of influence, each affordable unit shall be granted a reduction of 0.2 parking spaces from the minimum that would otherwise be required.

(2)    In the Menlo Park El Camino Real and Downtown specific plan area, projects qualifying for the AHO shall be required to provide either the number of spaces per subsection (c)(1) of this section, or as specified in the Menlo Park El Camino Real and Downtown specific plan, whichever is less.

(3)    A senior citizen housing project as defined in Sections 51.3 and 51.12 of the Civil Code shall be required to provide no more than 0.8 parking spaces per dwelling unit.

(4)    The spaces required for the affordable units need not be covered or located in a garage or carport.

(5)    If two (2) spaces are being provided for any one (1) affordable dwelling unit, the spaces may be in tandem.

(6)    Long-term bicycle parking shall be required at no more than one-half (0.5) space per unit.

(7)    Any requirement for electric vehicle parking or plug-in hybrid recharging stations shall be reduced by fifty percent (50%) or may be met by providing an equivalent number of car sharing spaces.

(d)    Contiguous parcels that touch or contiguous parcels in the same zone that are in close proximity may calculate density, floor area ratio, building coverage, paving, landscaping and required parking across the parcels; provided, that there is a recorded agreement among the owner(s) of the parcels to transfer development rights between the parcels such that the maximum overall density of the combined parcels is not exceeded.

(e)    Coverage. In addition to the amount necessary to physically accommodate the increased density provided for by this chapter, any applicable maximum building coverage and/or allowable paving requirement shall be increased by five percent (5%) and the minimum open space/landscaping requirement reduced by ten percent (10%) from the underlying zoning designation.

(f)    Setbacks. In addition to the amount necessary to physically accommodate the increased density provided for by this chapter, required setbacks shall be reduced to five (5) feet, except when the parcel subject to the AHO abuts a parcel zoned single-family residential, in which case the setbacks identified in underlying zoning shall control.

(g)    Open Space. In addition to the amount necessary to physically accommodate the increased density provided for by this chapter, any common and/or private open space may be reduced by up to fifty percent (50%) from the underlying zoning.

(h)    Maximum Facade Height. Where an increase in the overall height is permitted to be above forty (40) feet, the building profile shall be set at a height of thirty-two (32) feet and the maximum number of major step backs shall be one (1).

(i)    The incentives provided pursuant to the AHO are not additive with and shall not be combined with the incentives provided pursuant to state density bonus law, Government Code Section 65915.

(j)    Specific Plan Exemptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain requirements in the Menlo Park El Camino Real Downtown specific plan area shall not be modified pursuant to this section:

(1)    The maximum FAR shall be limited to the public benefit levels.

(2)    The front and side setbacks facing a public right-of-way.

(3)    Building facade height.

(4)    Massing and modulation standards including major portions of a building facing a street should be parallel to the street, building breaks, building facade modulation and building profile, and upper story facade length. (Ord. 993 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.98.050 Fee waivers.
(a)    Processing Fees. Those projects that provide at least fifty percent (50%) of the units in the base project for low income households or twenty percent (20%) for very low income households shall be entitled to a fee waiver for all the processing fees associated with the various applications for development.

(b)    Other Fees. Projects qualifying for the AHO shall be entitled to a reduction in all other fees in an amount that corresponds to the increase in allowable density identified in Section 16.98.030. Any project requesting a reduction or waiver of the traffic impact fee, park dedication fee, building construction street impact fee, Menlo Park El Camino Real Downtown specific plan preparation fee, or other fee(s) in excess of that percentage reduction shall apply for the requested reduction or waiver, which shall be subject to a discretionary review and approval process. The city council shall be the final decision maker regarding any such request. (Ord. 993 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.98.060 Continued affordability.
Prior to issuance of building permits, the applicant shall execute an agreement with the city, to be executed by the city manager without review by the housing commission, planning commission or city council, in a form acceptable to the city attorney ensuring the continued affordability of the affordable dwelling units for a period of not less than fifty-five (55) years. (Ord. 993 § 2 (part), 2013).

16.98.070 Design.
Development utilizing the AHO shall be subject to compliance review relative to adopted objective design standards and such compliance shall be determined by the community development director or his/her designee. Development in the Menlo Park El Camino Real Downtown specific plan area shall be subject to the architectural control process identified in the Menlo Park El Camino Real Downtown specific plan. No other discretionary action shall be required, unless the applicant requests a variance from the requirements of the AHO or requests architectural control for modification of the objective design standards. Low and very low income units must be constructed concurrently with market rate units and shall be integrated into the project and be comparable in construction quality and exterior design to any market rate units. The low and very low income units may be smaller in size and have different interior finishes and features than market rate units so long as the features are durable, of good quality and consistent with contemporary standards for new housing as determined by the community development director in his/her sole and absolute discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of bedrooms in the low and very low income units shall at minimum be consistent with the mix of market rate units. For example, if the market rate units consist of fifty percent (50%) one (1) bedroom, twenty-five percent (25%) two (2) bedroom and twenty-five percent (25%) three (3) bedroom units, the low and very low income units must match this breakdown. Applicants may elect to include a higher percentage of units with more bedrooms. (Ord. 993 § 2 (part), 2013).
