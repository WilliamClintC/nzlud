Chapter 2.56 CONTRACT LETTING
Note
*       Prior ordinance history: 1073 and 1143.

 

2.56.010 Contract letting.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of Article 3, Chapter 2, Part 3, Division 2 of the Public Contracts Code shall be controlling.

A.    The City, through the responsible department head, shall maintain a list of qualified contractors identified according to categories of work. The minimum criteria for development and maintenance of the contractor’s list shall be in accordance with Public Contracts Code Section 22034 and as determined by the California Uniform Construction Cost Accounting Commission.

B.     All contractors on the list for the category of work being bid and all construction trade journals specified in Section 22036 of the Public Contracts Code shall be mailed a notice inviting informal bids, except with respect to proprietary services or products. For purposes of this section, informal bids shall be public projects as specified in Section 22032(b), as such amount may be adjusted pursuant to Section 22020, of the Public Contracts Code or their statutory successors.

Chapter 2.57 DEBARMENT
2.57.010 Statement of purpose and intent.
A.    The City intends to accept bids or responses to requests for proposals or qualifications from, award contracts to, execute contracts with, consent to subcontracts, or do business in any way only with responsible contractors. “Responsibility” is a qualitative term embracing the attributes of integrity and trustworthiness, as well as the quality, fitness and capacity to perform City contracts. The City finds that the consideration of bids or responses from contractors who lack any of these attributes compromises the integrity of the contracting process and is contrary to state contracting law.

B.     The provisions of this chapter are intended to determine, in advance of submittal of bids or proposals on City contracts, whether a contractor is responsible or should be debarred as irresponsible. Debarment is a discretionary action designed to protect the City by ensuring only responsible contractors are able to participate in the full and open competition for contractual relationships with the City. Despite the serious consequences these proceedings may have on a contractor, debarment under this chapter is not meant as a punishment. These procedures are a necessary and appropriate means to enable the City to deal with irresponsible contractors, and to administer its duties with efficiency.

C.     Nothing in this chapter shall limit the City’s ability to determine prior to or at the time of contract award whether a bid or proposal is responsive to the City’s solicitation for bids or proposals and whether the contractor submitting the bid or proposal is responsible. (Ord. 1283 § 1, October 3, 2016)

2.57.050 Existence of grounds.
A.    Existence of grounds for debarment as described in Section 2.57.040 may be determined to exist by the Hearing Officer, or by the City Council on appeal, if any of the following is shown by a preponderance of the evidence:

2.57.060 Period of debarment.
A.    The debarment period may be temporary or permanent, and shall be commensurate with the severity of the contractor’s acts or omissions, as determined by the Hearing Officer or, on appeal, the City Council.

The initial period of a temporary debarment shall be no less than one year, but shall not exceed 10 years.

B.     The following mitigating factors may be considered in determining the length of the debarment period:

1.     Notice that a debarment is being considered;

2.     The grounds for the proposed debarment, in terms sufficient to put the respondent on notice of the conduct or action(s) upon which it is based;

3.     The intended period of the debarment;

5.     Notice that a hearing on the proposed debarment may be requested and the deadline for submitting a written request for such a hearing.

B.     Within 15 days after service of the notice of proposed debarment, the respondent or the respondent’s representative may submit a written request for a hearing on the proposed debarment and/or any written opposition to the proposed debarment. Such written request and/or written opposition shall specify the name and address of the person to which all subsequent notices and communications should be mailed.

C.     If the respondent requests a hearing in accordance with subsection B of this section, the Hearing Officer shall, within 15 days after receipt of such request, schedule an informal hearing at which the respondent or the respondent’s representative shall have a reasonable opportunity to provide information and argument, including the presentation and questioning of witnesses, to the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer shall mail the respondent written notice of the time, date, and location of such hearing, which shall be held no sooner than 10 days from the date the notice of hearing is served.

D.    The hearing shall be as informal as is compatible with the requirements of justice. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply. The Hearing Officer may consider all relevant evidence, including affidavits or declarations of witnesses; limit the scope of discovery; and shorten the time to produce records or witnesses. The hearing shall be open to the general public, but the Hearing Officer may exclude witnesses from the hearing when not testifying, exclude disorderly or disruptive persons from the hearing, and make other orders necessary to ensure the fair and orderly conduct of the hearing.

E.     The proceedings at the hearing shall be audio-recorded. A stenographer shall also transcribe the proceedings if ordered by the Hearing Officer or requested by the respondent, with the costs thereof to be borne by the person making the order or request. A copy of any audio recording or transcript of the proceedings shall be made available to the respondent upon request and upon payment of the cost of preparation thereof.

F.     The Hearing Officer’s debarment decision shall be rendered within 30 days after the hearing is completed. The Hearing Officer may extend the time to render a decision for good cause and shall notify respondent of the length of such extension. The Hearing Officer’s decision shall be in writing, shall contain findings of fact, and shall specify the grounds for debarment based on the evidence before the Hearing Officer.

G.    A copy of the Hearing Officer’s written decision shall be served on respondent and the City Clerk no later than five days after the written decision is made. If the Hearing Officer decides to impose debarment, the decision shall specify the period of debarment. Except in cases where the Hearing Officer’s written decision ordering disbarment is appealed in accordance with Section 2.57.080, the period of debarment shall begin on the date the written decision is mailed to the respondent. In cases where the Hearing Officer’s decision is appealed in accordance with Section 2.57.080, the period of debarment shall begin on the date that the City Council makes a decision to uphold or modify the Hearing Officer’s debarment decision, in accordance with Section 2.57.080.

2.57.090 Submission of written argument on appeal.
A.    At the City Council hearing on appeal, no new evidence may be presented. If respondent wishes to submit written argument supporting the appeal, then respondent shall do so by submitting said written argument to the City Clerk seven calendar days before the scheduled hearing. Person submitting the argument shall also serve it on all persons subject to the debarment and on the Hearing Officer.

B.     The failure to submit a written argument does not preclude a person from presenting an oral argument at the appeal hearing. (Ord. 1283 § 1, October 3, 2016)

 

2.57.100 Service of notices.

A.    Failure of respondent or respondent’s representative to submit a request for hearing or written opposition to the notice of proposed debarment within the time frame specified in subsection B of Section 2.57.070, or failure to appear at any hearing, shall be deemed an admission of the allegations stated in the notice of proposed debarment.

A debarment adopted pursuant to this subsection shall be final and not subject to appeal.

B.     Failure of respondent or respondent’s representatives to appear for any hearing under Section 2.57.070, for which notice has been served, shall be deemed an admission of the allegations in the notice of proposed debarment.

2.57.130 Extending the debarment period.

Prior to issuing a notice of debarment extension, the City Manager shall afford the debarred contractor notice and an opportunity to be heard on the continued lack of mitigating factors. The City Manager may preside over a hearing on a proposed extension or may designate one or more individuals to act as hearing officers. The City Manager’s decision to extend the debarment period following a hearing, if requested, shall be final. (Ord. 1283 § 1, October 3, 2016)

 

2.57.140 Shortening the debarment period.
A.    At any time after one year from a final decision on debarment, the City Manager or, if the City Council issued the final debarment decision, the City Council may shorten the debarment period for any reason which obviates the need for the debarment or which indicates a shorter debarment period will adequately protect the public interest. Such reasons include, but are not limited to, the following:

1.     Newly-discovered material evidence that was not previously available to the parties;

2.     Reversal of the conviction, civil judgment, or administrative penalty or sanction upon which the debarment was based;

The debarred contractor shall also provide any additional documentation requested in order to review such request.

C.     Any such review under this section shall be at the sole discretion of the City Manager or, if the City Council issued the final debarment decision, at the discretion of the City Council. The respondent does not have a right to review of debarment by either the City Manager or the City Council. The decision to shorten or maintain a debarment period shall not be appealable.

C.     To adopt sales and use tax regulations which impose a tax and provide a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes;

D.    To adopt sales and use tax regulations which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible, be consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of recordkeeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.

B.     The City Manager may make written demand that the grantee do or comply with any such requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule or regulation. If the failure, refusal or neglect of the grantee continues for a period of 30 days following such written demand, the City Manager may place his or her request for termination of the franchise upon the next regular City Council meeting agenda. The City Manager shall cause to be served upon such grantee, at least 10 days prior to the date of such Council meeting, a written note of his or her intent to request such termination, and the time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published by the City Clerk at least once 10 days before such meeting in a newspaper of general circulation within the City.

C.     The Council shall consider the request of the City Manager and shall hear any persons interested therein, and shall determine, in its discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause.

D.    If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause, the Council shall direct the grantee to comply within such time and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable.

E.     If the Council determines such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was without just cause, then the Council may, by resolution, declare that the franchise of such grantee shall be terminated and forfeited unless there by compliance by the grantee within such period as the Council may fix.

F.     In the event of the termination of the franchise pursuant to the provisions of this section, the City shall have the option (but not the obligation) to purchase the grantee’s community antenna television system with the City.

In the event of exercise of such option, the compensation to be paid by City to grantee shall be the depreciated original cost of the community antenna television system, with no value assigned to the franchise.

G.    In the event that the franchise is, for any reason whatsoever, not renewed upon the normal expiration thereof, the City shall have the option (but not the obligation) to purchase the community antenna television system of grantee.

H.    In the event that the City and grantee are unable to agree on the compensation required to be paid under either subsection F or subsection G of this section, then such compensation shall be determined by arbitration. The City and the grantee shall each appoint one arbitrator, and the first two arbitrators shall select a third. The determination of such board of arbitrators shall be final.

I.      The termination and forfeiture of any franchise shall in no way affect any of the rights of the City under franchise or any provision of law.

J.

5.24.060 Franchise payments.
A.    In consideration of the granting and exercise of a franchise to use the streets, as herein defined, for the operation of a cable television system, any grantee shall pay to the City, during the life of the franchise the following is applicable:

2.     A percentage of its gross annual nonbasic service receipts;

3.     A percentage of its gross annual advertising receipts;

4.     A percentage of its gross annual lease receipts.

The percentage payments shall be made in the manner, amounts and at times directed in the franchise, or in a Council resolution fixing franchise fees and adopting rules for services and rate regulation. Such payment by the grantee to the City shall be made annually, or as otherwise provided in the grantee’s franchise, by delivery of the same to the City, and shall be in lieu of any occupation tax, business license tax or similar levy.

B.     The grantee shall file with the City, within 60 days after the expiration of any calendar year or portion thereof during which such franchise is in force, a financial statement prepared by and signed by a certified public accountant, or person otherwise satisfactory to the Council, showing in detail the gross annual receipts, as defined in Section 5.24.010(K), of the grantee during the preceding calendar year or portion thereof. It shall be the duty of the grantee to pay to the City, within 15 days after the time for filing such statements, the sum hereinabove prescribed or any unpaid balance thereof for the calendar year or portion thereof covered by such statements.

C.     The City shall have the right to inspect the grantee’s records showing the gross receipts from which its franchise payments are computed and the right of audit and recomputation of any and all amounts paid under this chapter. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the City may have for further or additional sums payable under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation hereunder. (Ord. 862 § 1, March 1, 1976)

 

5.24.070 Limitations of franchise.
A.    Any franchise granted under this chapter shall be nonexclusive.

B.     No privilege or exemption shall be granted or conferred by any franchise granted under this chapter except those specifically prescribed herein.

C.     Any privilege claimed under any such franchise by the grantee in any street or other public property shall be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy of the streets or other public property.

D.    Any such franchise shall be a privilege to be held in personal trust by the original grantee. It cannot in any event be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale or by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, sale of corporate stock constituting controlling interest, or otherwise, without the prior consent of the Council expressed by resolution, and then only under such conditions as may therein be prescribed. Any such transfer or assignment shall be made only by an instrument in writing, a duly executed copy of which shall be filed in the office of the City Manager within 15 days after any such transfer or assignment. The consent of the Council may not be arbitrarily refused; provided, however, the proposed assignee must show financial responsibility and must agree to comply with all provisions of this chapter; and provided, further, that no such consent shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage or hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, except that when such hypothecation shall exceed 50% of the market value of the property used by the grantee in the conduct of the cable television system prior consent of the Council shall be required for such a transfer. Such consent shall not be withheld unreasonably. Such hypothecation shall not be deemed to include borrowing transactions by the grantee or parent corporation or entity in the normal course of its business operations, in which all assets of either corporation are routinely pledged as security for such borrowing. The grantee shall promptly give notice to the Council upon learning of any impending foreclosure or similar transaction related to loans of the grantee or parent corporation that might affect control of the grantee.

In the event that the grantee is a corporation, prior approval of the City Council, expressed by ordinance shall be required where there is an actual change in control or where ownership of more than 50% of the voting stock of the grantee is acquired by a person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom already own 50% or more of the voting stock, singly or collectively. Any such acquisition occurring without prior approval of the City Council shall constitute a failure to comply with a provision of this chapter within the meaning of Sections 5.24.050 and 5.24.055 of this chapter.

E.     Time shall be of the essence of any such franchise granted hereunder. The grantee shall not be relieved by his or her obligation to comply promptly with any of the provisions of this chapter by any failure of the City to enforce prompt compliance.

F.     The grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the City, its officers, employees or agents, for any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising out of any provision or requirement of this chapter or of any franchise issued hereunder or because of its enforcement.

G.    The grantee shall be subject to all requirements of City ordinances, rules, regulations and specifications heretofore or hereafter enacted or established.

H.    Any such franchise granted shall not relieve the grantee of any obligation involved in obtaining pole space from any department of the City, utility company, or from others maintaining poles in streets.

I.      Any franchise granted hereunder shall be in lieu of any and all other rights, privileges, powers, immunities and authorities owned, possessed, controlled or exercisable by the grantee, or any successor to any interest of the grantee, of or pertaining to the construction, operations or maintenance of any CATV system in the City; and the acceptance of any franchise hereunder shall operate, as between grantee and the City, as an abandonment of any and all of such rights, privileges, power, immunities, and authorities within the City, to the effect that, as between the grantee and the City, any and all construction, operation and maintenance by any grantee of any CATV system in the City shall be, and shall be deemed and construed in all instances and respects to be under and pursuant to the franchise, and not under or pursuant to any other right, privilege, power, immunity or authority whatsoever. (Ord. 862 § 1, March 1, 1976)

 

5.24.080 Rights reserved to the City.
A.    Nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to impair or affect, in any way, to any extent, the right of the City to acquire the property of the grantee, whether by purchase or through the exercise of the right to eminent domain, at a fair and just value, which shall not include any amount for the franchise itself or for any of the rights or privileges granted, and nothing herein contained shall be construed to contract away or to modify or abridge, either for a term or in perpetuity, the City’s right of eminent domain.

B.     There is reserved to the City every right and power which is required to be herein reserved or provided by any ordinance of the City, and the grantee, by its acceptance of any franchise, agrees to be bound thereby and to comply with any action or requirements of the City in its exercise of such rights of power, heretofore or hereafter enacted or established.

C.     Neither the granting of any franchise hereunder nor any of the provisions contained herein shall be construed to prevent the City from granting any identical, or similar, franchise to any other person, firm or corporation within all or any portion of the City.

D.    There is reserved to the City the power to amend any section or part of this chapter so as to require additional or greater standards of construction, operation, maintenance, or otherwise, on the part of the grantee.

E.     Neither the granting of any franchise nor any provision hereof shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power of the City.

F.     The Council may do all things which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this chapter and may determine any question of fact which may arise during the existence of any franchise granted hereunder. The City Manager is authorized and empowered to adjust, settle or compromise any controversy or charge arising from the operations of any grantee under this chapter, either on behalf of the City, the grantee, or any subscriber, in the best interest of the public. Either the grantee or any member of the public who may be dissatisfied with the decision of the City Manager may appeal the matter to the Council for hearing and determination. The Council may accept, reject or modify the decision of the City Manager, and the Council may adjust, settle or compromise any controversy or cancel any charge arising from the operations or any grantee or from any provision of this chapter. (Ord. 862 § 1, March 1, 1976)

5.24.090 Time of performance.
Installation of a CATV system shall be commenced within 120 days after any franchise is granted under the provisions of this chapter. The grantee shall accomplish significant construction within one year after receiving Federal Communications Commission certification, and shall thereafter reasonably make cable service available to 20% of its franchise area each year. For systems already constructed, the grantee must have accomplished significant construction and have equitably extended energized trunk cable to substantially all of the franchised area. Failure to so commence and diligently pursue to completion shall be grounds for termination of the franchise. The Council may extend the time for beginning the installation for additional periods in the event the grantee, acting in good faith, experiences delays by reason of circumstances beyond his or her control. (Ord. 862 § 1, March 1, 1976)

 

5.24.100 Location of property of grantee.
A.    Any poles, wires, cable lines, conduits or other properties of the grantee to be constructed or installed in streets, shall be so constructed or installed only at such locations and in such manner as shall be approved by the Director of Public Works acting in the exercise of his or her reasonable discretion. The Director of Public Works shall act within 30 calendar days after application is made by the grantee.

The grantee is to demonstrate that no poles, wire, cable lines, conduits, tracking antenna or other properties of the grantee shall impair solar access of buildings or solar collector locations on the southwall of southproof of adjacent buildings. (For definitions refer to: Solar Access Section 20.08.162; Collector, Section 20.08.066; Southwall, Section 20.08.166; Southroof, Section 20.08.165.)

B.     The grantee shall not repair, install or erect any facilities or apparatus on public property or public rights-of-way within the City without first obtaining written approval of the Director of Public Works in advance. In cases of emergency requiring immediate repairs to maintain service or to maintain public safety, the grantee may perform such work without first obtaining such written approval. The grantee shall make all reasonable efforts to obtain the written approval of the Director of Public Works before making such emergency repairs, and shall file a written application to make permanent repairs at the earliest practical time. The grantee shall thereafter comply with any requirements which may be imposed by the Director of Public Works in connection with the complete repairs.

C.     In those areas and portions of the City where the transmission or distribution facilities of both the public utility providing telephone service and the utility providing electric service are underground or hereafter may be placed underground, the grantee immediately upon written request by the Director of Public Works acting in concert with such utility or utilities, shall construct or reconstruct, operate, relocate and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground, except that for new structures, the builder or developer will provide and install at his or her sole cost and expense to the grantee’s current specifications, trenches for underground distribution, service laterals, service drop trenches to the buildings’ point of entry, and backfill and restoration of trench area, conduit, vaults and pedestals, and internal wiring. The grantee’s amplifiers and essential connections thereto may be in appropriate housing above the surface of the ground as approved by the Director of Public Works. The City shall not in any manner be responsible for any costs incurred by the grantee in placing this property underground. To insure that cable television service is available under these provisions, the builder or developer will provide the Director of Public Works plans for inclusion of cable television service with his or her plans for utilities including telephone, electrical service and gas service. The builder or developer will also include proof that a contractual agreement exists between the builder or developer and the grantee which is consistent with the provision of this section before a building permit is issued.

Provided the contractor or developer has fulfilled his or her contractual commitments to the grantee, the grantee shall make cable television service available to such new structure or structures within six months of the date of occupancy.

D.    The grantee shall at all times during the term of any license granted under this chapter, at its own cost and expense, properly and in good workmanlike manner, install and maintain adequate shielding, filtering and grounding at affected installations within the CATV system to eliminate television interference encountered from fundamental frequency overload by radio amateur transmissions which are in compliance with Federal Communications Commission regulations.

E.     The City shall have the right, free of charge, to make additional use, for any public or municipal purpose, whether governmental or proprietary, of any poles, conduits, or other similar facilities erected, controlled or maintained exclusively by or for the grantee in any street, provided such use by the City does not interfere with the use by the grantee.

F.     It is the desire of the City that all cable television systems franchised hereunder shall, insofar as financially and technically possible, be compatible one with another and with systems adjacent to the City.

G.    Wherever it is financially and technically feasible, the grantee shall so construct, operate and modify the system so as to tie the same into all other systems within and adjacent to the City. (Ord. 862 § 1, March 1, 1976; Ord. 999 § 2, November 15, 1982)

A.    In the event that:

1.     The use of any part of the system of the grantee is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of 30 days, without prior written notice to and approval by the City; or

2.     Any part of such system has been installed in any street or other area without complying with the requirements hereof; or

3.     Any franchise shall be terminated, canceled or shall expire, then the grantee shall, at the option of the City, and at the expense of the grantee and at no expense to the City, and upon demand of the City, promptly remove from any street or other area all property of the grantee, and the grantee shall promptly restore the street or the area from which such property has been removed to such condition as the City Manager shall approve.

B.     The Council may, upon written application therefor by the grantee, approve the abandonment of any of such property in place by the grantee and under such terms and conditions as the Council may prescribe. Upon abandonment of any such property in place, the grantee shall cause to be executed, acknowledged and delivered to the City such instruments as the City Attorney shall prescribe and approve, transferring and conveying the ownership of such property to the City. (Ord. 862 § 1, March 1, 1976)

 

5.24.120 Changes required by public improvements.
The grantee shall, at its expense, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate in the same street or other public place, or remove from the street or other public place, any property of the grantee when required by the Director of Public Works by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street vacation, freeway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines and tracks or any other type of structures or improvements by public agencies; provided, however, that the grantee shall in all such cases have the privileges and be subject to the obligations to abandon any property of the grantee in place, as provided in Section 5.24.110 hereof. (Ord. 862 § 1, March 1, 1976)

 

5.24.130 Failure to perform street work.
Upon failure of the grantee to commence, pursue or complete any work required by law or by the provisions of this chapter or by its franchise to be done in any street or other public place, within the time prescribed, and to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works, the Director of Public Works may, at his or her option, cause such work to be done and the grantee shall pay to the City the cost thereof in the itemized amounts reported by the Director of Public Works to the grantee within 30 days after receipt of such itemized report. (Ord. 862 § 1, March 1, 1976)

 

5.24.140 Faithful performance bond.
A.    The grantee shall, concurrently with the filing of and acceptance of award of any franchise granted under this chapter, file with the City Clerk, and at all times thereafter maintain in full force and effect for the term of such franchise or any renewal thereof, at the grantee’s sole expense, a corporate surety bond, in a company and in a form approved by the City Attorney, in the amount of $25,000.00, renewable annually, and conditioned upon the faithful performance of the grantee, and upon the further condition that in the event the grantee fails to comply with any one or more of the provisions of this chapter, or of any franchise issued to the grantee hereunder there shall be recoverable jointly and severally from the principal and surety of such bond any damages or loss suffered by the City as a result thereof, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the grantee as prescribed hereby which may be in default, plus a reasonable allowance for attorney’s fees and costs, up to the full amount of the bond; the condition to be a continuing obligation for the duration of such franchise and any renewal thereof and thereafter until the grantee has liquidated all of its obligations with the City that may have arisen from the acceptance of the franchise or renewal by the grantee or from its exercise of any privilege therein granted. The bond shall provide that 60 days’ prior written notice of intention not to renew, cancellation, or material change, be given to the City.

B.     Neither the provisions of this section, nor any bond accepted by the City pursuant hereto, nor any damages recovered by the City thereunder, shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by the grantee or limit the liability of the grantee under any franchise issued thereunder or for damages, either to the full amount of the bond or otherwise. (Ord. 862 § 1, March 1, 1976)

 

5.24.150 Indemnification of City.
A.

Chapter 5.28 UNIFORM TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX
5.28.010 Title.
This chapter shall be known as the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Law of the City of Mill Valley. (Ord. 690 § 1, May 20, 1968)

 

5.28.020 Definitions.
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter.

A.    “Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

B.     “Hotel” means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or similar structure or portion thereof.

C.     “Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

D.    “Transient” means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right or access, license or other agreement for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of 30 days has expired unless there is an agreement between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this ordinance may be considered.

 

 

E.     “Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel, valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom, whatsoever.

F.     “Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his or her function through a managing agent or any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purpose of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be in compliance by both.

G.    “Tax Collector” means the duly authorized and constituted Treasurer-Tax Collector of the City of Mill Valley. In the event state law is, at any time, changed to provide for collection of the tax imposed herein by officials of the State of California, “Tax Collector” shall thereafter mean such person or agency as may be designated by applicable state law. (Ord. 1102 § 24, September 16, 1991)

 

5.28.030 Tax imposed.
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of 10% of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the City which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Tax Collector may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax Collector. (Ord. 690 § 1; Ord. 824 § 1; Ord. 914 § 1; Ord. 925 § 1; Ord. 1114, November 16, 1992)

Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or national disaster, when such occupancy is paid for by the American National Red Cross, a governmental agency, or any other nonprofit organization which regularly provides emergency shelter for such victims. (Ord. 690 § 1; Ord. 934 § 1, January 2, 1979)

 

5.28.050 Operator’s duties.
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax, or any part thereof, will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided.

 

 

5.28.060 Registration.
Within 60 days after the effective date of this chapter, or within 30 days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register the hotel with the Tax Collector and obtain from him or her a “transient occupancy registration certificate” to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. The certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

A.    The name of the operator;

B.     The address of the hotel;

C.     The date upon which the certificate was issued;

D.    “This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax by registering with the Tax Collector for the purpose of collecting from the transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Collector. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit.” (Ord. 690 § 1, May 20, 1968)

 

5.28.070 Reporting and remitting.
Each operator shall on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the Tax Collector, make a return to the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax shall be remitted to the Tax Collector. The Tax Collector may establish shorter reporting or any certificate holder if he or she deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he or she may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Tax Collector. (Ord. 690 § 1, May 20, 1968)

 

5.28.080 Penalties and interest.
A.    Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of 10% of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.

Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of 30 days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of 10% of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the 10% penalty first imposed.

C.     Fraud. If the Tax Collector determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of 25% of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section.

D.    Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

E.     Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. (Ord. 690 § 1, May 20, 1968)

5.28.090 Failure to collect and report tax—Determination of tax by Tax Collector.
If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said taxes and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of said tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the Tax Collector shall proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax Collector shall procure such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the Tax Collector shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her known place of address. Such operator may within 10 days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the Tax Collector of a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Collector, shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Tax Collector shall give not less than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Tax Collector shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 5.28.100 of this chapter. (Ord. 690 § 1, May 20, 1968)

 

5.28.100 Appeal.
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Tax Collector with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the Board of Supervisors by filing a notice of appeal with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors within 15 days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due.

A.    To enforce all provisions of this chapter and all the laws of the State of California relating to the care, treatment, and impounding of animals, and specifically to issue citations and to make arrests for violations of the provisions of this chapter and related state laws;

B.     To provide an animal shelter for all animals which are subject to impoundment. Animals shall be provided with humane care and treatment, including veterinary care when appropriate, throughout the duration of their impoundment consistent with state laws and local ordinances;

C.     To take up, impound and safely keep any animals where authorized under the provisions of this chapter or the laws of this state;

 

 

 

D.    To collect any costs or charges hereinafter provided in this chapter for the impounding and keeping of any animal;

E.     Where authorized under the provisions of this chapter or the laws of this state, to enter upon any premises upon which any animal is kept for the purpose of taking up, seizing or impounding of any animal or for the purpose of determining whether such animal is licensed or is violating the provisions of this chapter;

F.     To euthanize any animal lawfully impounded which by reason of injury, disease or temperament is unsuitable for adoption placement;

G.    To enter upon any private or public property in order to pick up and dispose of any dead animal;

I.      To make determinations in accordance with the provisions of this chapter;

J.      To perform any and all services related to public records (handling, retention and availability) in the same manner as employees of the County of Marin regarding the handling of what would be public records if prepared, retained or distributed by Marin County employees.

 

6.04.122 Hearings.
A.    The administrative hearing officer selected by the Marin County Administrator or designee is authorized to conduct hearings in all cases authorized by the provisions of this chapter. This shall include, but not be limited to, all permit denials, permit revocations or refusals to renew permits authorized under this chapter. Written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given to the animal owner/guardian, permittee or permittee applicant at least 10 days prior to the date set for hearing, unless the animal owner/guardian, permittee or permittee applicant expressly requests, in writing, that the hearing be set for an earlier date, and the Animal Services Agency agrees to do so. Service of the notice shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.04.190 of the Marin County Code. If the owner/guardian of the affected animal, permittee or permittee applicant fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing shall nevertheless proceed, and an appropriate order shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

B.     Administrative Hearing and Fees. The administrative hearing officer shall have the ability to impose administrative hearing fees authorized under a fee ordinance or resolution adopted by the governing body under whose authority the hearing has been undertaken. The administrative hearing officer may impose the fees based upon the complainant’s, or business owner’s or animal owner/guardian’s culpability for causing administrative expenses to the Animal Services Agency’s program. At the administrative hearing, the hearing fee shall be in lieu of the imposition of any applicable statutory fine. In a de novo appeal to the Superior Court, both administrative expense fees as well as statutory penalties may be imposed upon the animal owner/guardian as deemed appropriate. Criminal restitution, damages and/or injury awards are the domain of the superior courts and are not available by way of the administrative hearing process. In any hearings other than ones involving the determination of the status of a potentially dangerous animal or vicious animal, the decisions of the hearing officer shall be final but subject to review by the Superior Court pursuant to the provisions of CCP Section 1094.5. De novo appeal of hearing officer decisions to the Superior Court is only available in the case of potentially dangerous animal or vicious animal hearings.

 

C.     Sanctions Hearings and Fees. If the animal owner/guardian does not appeal the orders of the hearing officer in a potentially dangerous or vicious animal case to the Superior Court within the time period prescribed in this chapter, the hearing officer’s orders shall be binding. In all other administrative hearings, the decisions of the hearing officer are final without further appeal to the Superior Court. Failure to abide by the hearing officer’s orders shall, upon petition by the Animal Services Agency, subject the animal owner/guardian (or commercial animal establishment-related licensee or other permitees/licensees) to attend a noticed sanctions hearing where further regulatory actions to protect the public health and safety may be considered and imposed. Notice requirements shall be the same as in the case of the initial hearing before the hearing officer. (See subsection A of this section.) The sanctions that may be imposed include any reasonable regulatory actions to preserve public health and safety including, but not limited to the destruction of the animal (which order is subject to de novo review), or in the case of a permit of license, loss of said permit or license. Lesser sanctions may be imposed provided the heath and safety of the public is not unreasonably placed at risk. Sanctions hearings shall be recorded or reported, and shall be final. The hearing officer shall have the authority to impose additional administrative fees authorized under a fee ordinance or resolution adopted by the governing body under whose authority the hearing has been undertaken for the expenses related to the sanctions hearing. The orders from such sanctions hearings shall be subject to review by the Superior Court pursuant to the provisions of CCP Section 1094.5.

D.    Any owner/guardian failing to abide by the final orders of the hearing officer within the period allowed within the orders or under law shall pay a civil administrative penalty in the amount of $500.00. The civil administrative penalty may be waived where failure to perform the required order(s) is/are due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond the control of the dog owner/guardian which shall be determined by the hearing officer. Any person dissatisfied with a hearing determination denying waiver of the civil administrative penalty may petition for review by the Superior Court pursuant to the provisions of CCP Section 1094.5.

 

6.04.130 Disposition of animals by Animal Services Agency.

B.     Identified Stray Animals. All impounded stray animals where an owner/guardian is known shall be held eight working days. The stray holding period shall not include the day upon which the animal was impounded, days the animal shelter is closed or holidays. At the end of the stray holding period, the Animal Services Agency shall determine the final disposition of the animal, which may include adoption, redemption, or euthanasia. The Animal Services Agency shall notify the owner/guardian by mail at the last known address of the animal being impounded. Notice of impoundment shall be given to the animal owner/guardian within 24 hours of impoundment.

C.     Release of Dogs. All dogs four months old and older shall be released to their owner/guardians with a current dog license. All cats four months old and older shall be released to their owner/guardians with proof of a current rabies vaccination.

All charges provided for under Section 6.04.150 must be paid to the Animal Services Agency prior to the animal being redeemed. If such animal is released to a person other than the owner/guardian, the owner/guardian of such animal may, at any time within 30 days, request the Animal Services Agency to return the animal to the owner/guardian. All costs of impoundment, including charges for boarding, shall be collected prior to the animal being released to the owner/guardian. No person may redeem an animal under this section if he or she was given written notice of such impoundment by the Animal Services Agency and failed for a period of eight days after the mailing of such notice to redeem such animal from impoundment.

 

6.04.150 Fees for redemption, placement, surrender—Redemption fees.

B.     Veterinary Fees. The Animal Services Agency shall collect all fees associated with veterinary care provided to any impounded animal.

C.     Surrender. Animals surrendered by their owner/guardians subsequent to impoundment for a violation of this chapter or any provisions of state law shall not relieve the owner/guardian of the obligation to pay such charges as set forth by separate ordinance of the Marin County Board of Supervisors, prior to such surrender.

 

6.04.155 Removal of dog feces.

This topic has been modified. View the section for details. 6.04.175 Dog control by responsible person.
A.    Dogs shall at all times be on a leash. A leash must be capable of restraining the dog and no more than six feet in length. An expansion type leash may be used provided it can be contracted to a length of no more than six feet. The owner/guardian or possessor of any dog that is not on a leash may be cited for a violation of this chapter and the dog may be seized and impounded. This section does not apply to dogs in city-designated off-leash areas.

6.04.179 Prohibition of habitual animal noise which unreasonably disturbs the peace.
A.    Subject to the provisions of subsections B, C, D, and E of this section, it is unlawful for any person to suffer or permit any dog, cat, fowl, or other animal to habitually bark, yelp, howl or create noise in such a manner which unreasonably disturbs the peace of any person(s).

B.     Any person who shall keep or permit to remain on any premises, an animal which disturbs the peace of any person in the manner set forth in subsection A of this section shall be guilty of an infraction for a first citable offense (and under subsection E be subject to fines pursuant to Marin County Code Section 1.05.030) and for a subsequent second citable offense of a misdemeanor as provided in Section 6.04.260(B). Any person found in violation of this subsection for a third or additional citable offense shall be guilty of a misdemeanor under Section 6.04.260(A). An animal kennel regulated by a use permit under the provisions of the Marin County Code shall not be subject to the provisions of this section. This section shall not apply to customary animal noises of livestock, horses or other animals kept for agricultural activities in areas including, but not limited to, farms, ranches and stables that are zoned or legally permitted for such purposes.

C.     Except as otherwise provided in subsection D of this section, where the animal owner/guardian is present and available at a household, the Sheriff will notify the keeper of the offending animal of the noise violation and direct that such violation be abated. If the Sheriff receives a second complaint from any person within 30 days of the notice of complaint of an additional violation by the animal, then the Sheriff may issue a citation provided there is probable cause to believe the noise has been continuous for one-half an hour or more. If an animal creates noise, but not to the extent of one-half hour of continuous noise, and the owner/guardian is not present at home, the Sheriff shall issue a written notice of complaint upon a first complaint that informs the owner/guardian that a further violation within 30 days of the notice of complaint may result in the issuance of a citation. Written notice of complaint shall be sufficient by securely posting the notice of the complaint upon the door of the household where the animal is kept. If the Sheriff receives a second complaint from any person within 30 days of the notice of complaint of an additional violation by the animal, then the Sheriff may issue a citation provided there is probable cause to believe the noise has been continuous for one-half an hour or more. Whenever possible, the Sheriff may recommend the services of county mediation to the complainant and the keeper of the animal as a means of resolving the animal nuisance noise. If mediation is refused by either party or is unsuccessful at the end of the 30 business days, then the matter shall proceed as if it were never referred to mediation.

D.    If the animal owner/guardian of the offending animal is unavailable, the Sheriff may issue a citation with a first complaint if it is determined by the Sheriff after investigation of the complaint and interview of the complainant that the noise created by the animal has persisted for one-half hour or more and cannot be abated or quieted so that it continues to disturb the peace of the complaining person(s). If the noise created by the animal can be abated or quieted so that it does not continue to disturb the peace, such abatement or quieting shall be done and the Sheriff shall issue a written notice of complaint upon a first complaint that informs the owner/guardian that a further violation within 30 days of the notice of complaint may result in the issuance of a citation. Written notice of complaint shall be sufficient by securely posting the notice of the complaint upon the door of the household where the animal is kept. If the Sheriff receives a second complaint from any person within 30 days of the notice of complaint of an additional violation by the animal, then the Sheriff may issue a citation provided there is probable cause to believe the noise has been continuous for one-half an hour or more. The Sheriff may in addition make a referral to Animal Services so an investigation may ensue as to whether the animal should be taken into protective custody. The animal may be taken into protective custody by Animal Services for animal owner/guardian abuse, neglect, or any other grounds within their authority. An animal placed under protective custody under this section may be redeemed by the owner/guardian provided there is presented to the Animal Services Agency proof of the owner/guardian’s identity and any required license certificate or license tag or other satisfactory proof of owner/guardianship and by paying the charges referenced under Section 6.04.150 and the fees that may be established by separate ordinance of the Board of Supervisors in reference thereto.

E.     The owner/guardian of an animal taken into protective custody under this section shall be entitled to a hearing conducted by a hearing officer designated by the Marin County Administrator or designee pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.04.122. The hearing shall be conducted for the purpose of determining whether the taking of the animal into protective custody was proper and whether the protective custody should continue. The hearing shall be held within 10 business days following the taking of the animal into custody provided such owner/guardian files a written request for a hearing with the Sheriff within five business days following written notice. Unless the hearing officer otherwise determines, the owner/guardian is liable for all charges related to such taking of the animal into protective custody.

F.     Such repeated acts by an owner/guardian of allowing an animal to disturb the peace, as described by subsection A and subject to the limitations set forth in subsections B, C, and D, shall constitute a public nuisance under the provisions of Marin County Code Section 1.05.020. Persons responsible for such disturbances may be held liable to the civil penalties set forth in Marin County Code Section 1.05.030.

 

6.04.180 Prohibition of animals trespassing on public or private property.
It is unlawful to suffer or permit any animal to trespass on private or public property so as to damage or destroy any property or thing of value, or so as to commit any other act dangerous to public health or safety, and any animal committing such an act is a public nuisance.

E.     A hearing on whether a dog shall be declared potentially dangerous or vicious shall be conducted in the following manner:

1.     If the Director has investigated and determined that there exists probable cause to believe that a dog is potentially dangerous or vicious as defined by this section, a hearing shall be conducted. The Director shall prepare a petition specifying the basis as to why the dog is potentially dangerous or vicious.

2.     A documented complaint must be received from a member of the public that serves as the evidentiary basis for the Director to find probable cause shall be sworn to and verified by the complainant and shall be attached to the petition.

3.     Prior to commencement of a potentially dangerous dog hearing and if the allegations of the petition indicate that the dog is potentially dangerous as defined under subsection B, the County Administrator or designee may offer in writing mediation services as an alternative to a hearing provided both the complainant and the owner/guardian agree in writing to mediation. Mediation must be concluded within 30 days of the offer to mediate. If mediation is refused or is unsuccessful, then the matter shall be referred to a hearing under this subsection.

4.     The County Administrator or designee shall designate a hearing officer from a panel of up to five persons whose membership shall be designated by the Board of Supervisors. Hearing officer applicants shall have had a minimum of five years’ experience as a practicing attorney and prior experience in administrative, arbitration or mediation hearings.

The owner/guardian of a dog for which a potentially dangerous or vicious dog petition has been issued may irrevocably waive his or her right to a hearing and any further appeal under Food and Agricultural Code Section 31622 and accept all conditions, sanctions and penalties set forth in Food and Agricultural Code Sections 31641, 31642 and 31643.

The dog may be, but is not required to be, removed from the list of potentially dangerous dogs prior to the expiration of the 36-month period if the owner/guardian of the dog demonstrates to the Director that changes in circumstances or measures taken by the owner/guardian, such as training of the dog, have mitigated the risk to public safety.

16.   Obligations for the owner/guardian of a dog deemed vicious:

a.

b.     The owner/guardian of a dog determined to be vicious shall, if it is not subject to destruction, at his or her own expense, have the vicious animal registration number assigned to the dog tattooed upon the dog’s left ear or, if the left ear is not available, on the left inner thigh, by a licensed veterinarian or a person trained, authorized and licensed to do business as an animal tattooist. As an alternative to tattooing, an owner/guardian may have a microchip injected beneath the skin, and between the shoulder blades of the animal by a licensed veterinarian. The owner/guardian shall provide proof satisfactory to the Animal Services Agency of such tattooing or microchipping within 30 days of the vicious determination.

c.     Upon request by the Animal Services Agency, the owner/guardian of a dog determined to be vicious shall, if it is not subject to destruction, present said animal within 10 days to the Animal Services Agency and allow photographs and measurements of the animal to be taken for purposes of identification.

The animal must be confined in a securely enclosed and locked pen or structure, suitable to prevent the entry of children or unauthorized persons. Such pen or structure shall be constructed such that the animal cannot climb, dig, jump or otherwise escape. The pen or structure shall be constructed with sufficiently strong materials and shall have a top that is secured to the floor and sides of the enclosure.

The Director shall have the discretion to remove the animal from the list of vicious animals upon proof of the successful completion of at least eight weeks of formal obedience training, other similar evidence of training, or other rehabilitative efforts designed to mitigate the risk to public safety.

17.   Regulatory Measures in Addition to Those Under State Law. The administrative hearing officer shall have the authority to impose any of the regulatory actions authorized under the Food and Agricultural Code and this section. To the extent justified by the circumstances, the administrative hearing officer shall have the authority to impose additional regulatory restrictions that have a reasonable nexus to the circumstances of the case which may not be adequately addressed by the normal statutory remedies. Such measures shall be undertaken in the interests of public health and safety, and may include, but not be limited to, the following:

a.     Destruction of the dog;

b.     Muzzling of the dog;

c.     Confinement of the dog;

A.    Investigation. Upon receipt of a complaint from a citizen, the enforcing officer or his/her designee, equipped with a sound level meter satisfying the requirements specified in Section 7.16.020, shall investigate the complaint. The investigation shall consist of a measurement and the gathering of data to adequately define the noise problem, including the following:

1.     Nonacoustic data;

2.     Type of noise source;

3.     Location of noise source relative to complainant’s property;

4.     Time period during which noise source is considered by complainant to be intrusive;

5.     Total duration of noise produced by noise source;

6.     Date and time of noise measurement survey.

B.     Noise Measurement Procedure. Utilizing the “A” or “C” weighting scale of the sound level meter and the “slow” meter response, the noise level shall be measured at a position or positions along the complainant’s property line closest to the noise source or at the location along the boundary line or on the complainant’s property where the noise level is at the maximum level. Generally, the microphone shall be located five feet above the ground unless another elevation is deemed appropriate. If the noise complaint is related to interior noise levels, interior noise measurements shall be made within the affected residential unit. The measurements shall be made at a point at least four feet from the wall, ceiling, or floor nearest the noise source. Calibration of the instrument being used shall be performed immediately prior to and immediately after recording any noise data utilizing an acoustic calibrator. The noise levels at the property line, with the alleged noise source in operation, shall be recorded on a data sheet, along with other pertinent data.

If possible, the ambient noise shall be measured at the same locations along the property line utilized in the preceding paragraph, with the alleged offending noise source inoperative. The noise levels measured for this condition shall also be recorded on the survey data sheet. If for any reason the alleged offending noise source cannot be shut down, then the ambient noise must be estimated by performing a measurement in the same general area of the source but at a sufficient distance such that the noise from the source is inaudible. If the difference between the noise levels with noise source operating and not operating is six decibels or greater, then the noise measurement of the alleged source can be considered valid with a small correction applied to account for the contribution of the ambient noise. The correction is to be applied in accordance with data shown in Table A-1.

7.16.080 Exemptions.
The following activities shall be exempted from the provisions of this chapter:

A.    Occasional outdoor gatherings, public dances, shows, and sporting and entertainment events, provided such events are conducted pursuant to a permit or license issued by the City relative to the staging of such events;

B.     Any mechanical device, apparatus or equipment used, related to, or connected with any emergency machinery, vehicle, work or warning alarm or bell, provided the sounding of any bell or alarm on any building or motor vehicle shall terminate its operation within 15 minutes of its being activated;

C.     Noise sources associated with or vibration created by construction, repair, remodeling, or grading of any real property or during authorized seismic surveys, provided such activities do not take place between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on weekdays, or at any time on Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday, and provided the noise level created by such activities does not exceed the noise standard of 60 dBA plus the adjustments specified in subsection B of Section 7.16.060, as measured on residential property, and any vibration created does not endanger the public health, welfare and safety. Heavy equipment and power tools are restricted to weekdays between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Owner/occupant builders are exempt from the time and heavy equipment and power tools restrictions on Saturdays between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Construction noise sources exceeding the above limits shall be allowed only upon issuance of a special permit under subsection D of Section 7.16.090. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit construction activities that do not exceed the ambient noise level by more than 10 dBA, such as painting or interior work.

D.    The use of backup, emergency generators during a prolonged power outage or emergency, as declared by the City of Mill Valley, state or local government agency, provided that the generator’s owner has a building permit and the generator complies with current fire and building codes. During a prolonged power outage period, generators for commercial uses may be operational 24 hours per day, but should be shut off when not critically needed to minimize the disturbance of neighbors. Generators for residential uses shall comply with setback standards of the underlying zoning district, be placed in an area that is reasonably practical for the homeowner that is least disruptive to neighbors. Generators supporting residential uses shall not be operated during the hours of 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., except as required for a bonafide health or medical need. Testing of emergency generators shall be limited to the hours between 9:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. on any day, and shall be limited in duration to that specified by manufactures specifications. Generator installations require a building permit from the City’s Building Division. For the purpose of this section a “prolonged power outage” means a power outage that is no less than 4 hours in duration. (Ord. 899 § 1, September 19, 1977; Ord. 1174 § 1, February 5, 2001; Ord. 1310 § 1, September 16, 2019)

 

7.16.090 Special noise limits.
A.    Motor Vehicles. It is unlawful for any person to operate any motor vehicle which is not subject to registration under the Vehicle Code in such a manner that the noise limits described in Section 23130 of the Vehicle Code are exceeded. Any measured noise level exceeding these limits shall be deemed to be prima facie evidence of a violation of the provisions of this section.

B.     Hawkers and Peddlers. It is unlawful for any person to sell anything by outcry within any area of the City zoned for residential uses. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to prohibit the selling by outcry of merchandise, food, and beverages at licensed sporting events, parades, fairs, circuses, or other similar licensed public entertainment events.

C.     Attracting Attention Using Noise. It is unlawful for any person to use any drum or other instrument or device of any kind for the purpose of attracting attention by the creation of noise. This section shall not apply to any person who is a participant in a school band or duly licensed parade, or who has been otherwise duly licensed to engage in such conduct.

D.    Construction Projects. The noise levels produced by construction projects shall not exceed 60 dBA plus the adjustments of subsection B of Section 7.16.060 without issuance of a special permit. The special permit shall not be issued by the authorized City department unless the applicant demonstrates that the equipment to be used produces noise levels that are the lowest of currently available equipment. Exception: No permit is required to perform emergency work.

 

Contractors shall be required to prominently display a notice of the date of commencement of construction noise at least three days prior to actual commencement. Such notice shall be located on the construction site and shall be readable from the closest adjacent street.

E.     Amplified Sound. While recognizing that the use of sound amplifying equipment is protected by the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and assembly, the City nevertheless feels obligated to reasonably regulate the use of sound amplifying equipment in order to protect the correlative constitutional rights of the citizens of this community to privacy and freedom from public nuisance of loud and unnecessary noise.

1.     Amplified Sound Out-of-Doors—Permit Required. Persons intending to install, use or operate within the City a loudspeaker or sound amplifying equipment in a fixed or moveable position or mounted upon any sound truck for the purpose of giving instructions, directions, talks, addresses, lectures, or transmitting music to any persons or assemblages of persons in or upon any private property out-of-doors or upon any street, alley, sidewalk, park, or public property out-of-doors shall obtain a permit from the City. Such permit shall be issued for one day at a time and shall allow the operation of the amplifying equipment between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on weekdays and Saturday and between 12:00 noon and 6:00 p.m. on Sundays and legal holidays.

 

 

The equipment shall be controlled by the permit holders so as not to disturb or be a nuisance to a person of normal sensitiveness. The only sounds allowed shall be of music or of human speech.

2.     Amplified sound emanating from within a building. Amplified sound emanating from within a building shall not exceed limits in Table A-2 at and beyond the property line.

F.     Noise Arising From Residential Activities. Certain types of activities and noise sources associated with residential living, although not considered acceptable by most residential inhabitants, are, nevertheless, tolerated. It is the purpose of this section to allow these noise sources to persist, however, at controlled noise levels and at specified times. The general noise limits of Table A-2 and the specified adjustments of subsection B of Section 7.16.060 apply to the noise sources listed in Table A-4 below, except during the time periods specified. The higher noise limits listed in Table A-4 are allowed only between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. on weekdays and between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. on Saturdays, and on Sundays and legal holidays as designated in Table A-4.

Such a clause shall substantially state, “It is a material breach of this agreement for tenant or any other person subject to the control of the tenant or present by invitation or permission of the tenant to engage in smoking in the unit as of November 18, 2016.”

b.     New. A clause providing that as of November 18, 2015, it is a material breach of the agreement to allow or engage in smoking in the unit.

Such a clause shall substantially state, “It is a material breach of this agreement for tenant or any other person subject to the control of the tenant or present by invitation or permission of the tenant to engage in smoking in any common area of the property, except in an outdoor designated smoking area, if one exists.”

B.     This chapter shall not create additional liability in a landlord to any person for a tenant’s breach of any smoking provision in a lease or other rental agreement for the occupancy of a unit in a multi-unit residence if the landlord has fully complied with this section.

C.     Failure to enforce any smoking provision required by this chapter shall not affect the right to enforce such provision in the future, nor shall a waiver of any breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or a waiver of the provision itself. (Ord. 1274 § 2, October 19, 2015)

 

7.20.080 Procedures and requirements for mandated submissions.
A.    Documents maintained pursuant to this chapter must include all material and information required by this chapter as well as other materials and information as the City Manager or designee deems necessary for the administration and enforcement of this chapter.

B.     All documents maintained pursuant to this chapter shall be available for the City Manager or designee to access and review during regular business hours or upon 24 hours’ written notice. A person who does not voluntarily provide access to said documents may seek precompliance review before the City’s administrative hearing officer by filing a written request with the City Manager or designee within 24 hours of the request to review records. (Ord. 1274 § 2, October 19, 2015)

 

7.20.090 Other requirements and prohibitions.
A.    No person, landlord, employer, or nonprofit entity shall knowingly or intentionally permit the presence or placement of ash receptacles, such as, for example, ash trays or ash cans, within an area under the legal or de facto control of the person, landlord, employer or nonprofit entity and in which smoking is prohibited by law, including, without limitation, within 20 feet in any direction from any area in which smoking is prohibited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the presence of ash receptacles in violation of this subsection shall not be a defense to a charge of smoking in violation of any provision of this chapter.

B.     No person shall dispose of used smoking or tobacco product waste within the boundaries of any area within City limits, except in a designated waste receptacle. A person, landlord, employer, or nonprofit entity that has legal or de facto control of an area in which smoking is prohibited by this chapter shall post a clear, conspicuous and unambiguous “no smoking” or “smoke-free” sign at each point of ingress to the area, and in at least one other conspicuous point within the area. The signs shall have letters of no less than one inch in height and shall include the international “No smoking” symbol (consisting of a pictorial representation of a burning cigarette enclosed in a red circle with a red bar across it). Signs posted on the exterior of buildings to comply with this section shall include the prohibition on smoking within 20 feet of the entrance to the building. At least one sign with a toll-free phone number where complaints can be directed must be conspicuously posted in each place in which smoking is prohibited. For purposes of this section, the City Manager or designee shall be responsible for the posting of signs in regulated facilities owned or leased in whole or in part by the City. Notwithstanding this provision, the presence or absence of signs shall not be a defense to a charge of smoking in violation of any other provision of this chapter.

C.     No person, landlord, employer, or nonprofit entity shall intimidate, threaten any reprisal, or effect any reprisal, for the purpose of retaliating against another person who seeks to attain compliance with this chapter.

D.    Whenever evidence of a violation of this chapter is obtained in any part through the participation of a person under the age of 18 years old, such a person shall not be required to appear or give testimony in any civil or administrative process brought to enforce this chapter and the alleged violation shall be adjudicated based upon the sufficiency and persuasiveness of the evidence presented.

E.     The provisions of this chapter are restrictive only and establish no new rights for a person who engages in smoking. Notwithstanding: (1) any provision of this chapter or other provisions of this Code; (2) any failure by any person to restrict smoking under this chapter; or (3) any explicit or implicit provision of this Code that allows smoking in any place, nothing in this Code shall be interpreted to limit any person’s legal rights under other laws with regard to smoking, including, for example, rights in nuisance, trespass, property damage, and personal injury or other legal or equitable principles. No person, landlord, employer, or nonprofit entity shall knowingly permit smoking in an area which is under the legal or de facto control of the person, employer or nonprofit entity and in which smoking is prohibited by this chapter, unless otherwise required by state or federal law.

F.     Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, nothing in this chapter prohibits any person, landlord, employer, or nonprofit entity with legal control over any property or facility from declaring the entire property or facility as nonsmoking and prohibiting smoking on any part of such property or facility, even if smoking is not otherwise prohibited in that area.

G.    For all purposes within the jurisdiction of the City, nonconsensual exposure to smoke occurring on or drifting into residential property is a nuisance, and the uninvited presence of smoke on residential property is a nuisance and a trespass. Any person bringing a civil action to enforce the nuisance provision contained in this section need not prove an injury other than the presence of smoke illegally drifting into residential property to prove a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 1274 § 2, October 19, 2015)

 

7.20.100 Smoking prohibitions violations and penalties.

F.     Business License. If a tobacco retailer’s license is denied, revoked, or suspended, the holder of a valid business license may nevertheless carry on all lawful aspects of his or her business, other than the sale or offering for sale tobacco products, unless otherwise prohibited.

G.    Enforcement.

1.     A tobacco retailer’s license may be revoked or suspended for any violation of this section or any state or federal tobacco-related laws. A tobacco retailer’s license may also be revoked or suspended on any of the following grounds:

a.     One or more of the grounds for denial of a tobacco retailer’s license existed either when a license application was made or before the tobacco retailer’s license was issued;

After considering the testimony and evidence submitted at the hearing, the hearing officer will issue a written decision to revoke or suspend or not revoke or suspend the license and will list in the decision the reason(s) for that decision. A revocation or suspension is without prejudice to the filing of a new application for a tobacco retailer’s license.

B.     It is the specific intention of the City Council that the administrative fine may be assessed by the Chief of Police for violations even where the City seeks revocation or suspension of a tobacco retailer’s license.

C.     Each day that tobacco products are offered for sale by a tobacco retailer without a tobacco retailer’s license is a separate violation. For violations other than for smoking or tobacco retail, each day of a continuing violation of this chapter shall constitute a separate violation. Thus, this administrative fine may be assessed at $500.00 per violation and may be assessed $500.00 for each day as a separate violation.

Chapter 7.30 ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE FOOD PACKAGING
7.30.010 Findings.
The City Council finds:

A.    Polystyrene foam used in food packaging is not biodegradable and is a common environmental pollutant.

B.     Styrene, a component of polystyrene foam, is a known hazardous substance and is classified as a possible human carcinogen by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”).

C.     The EPA believes styrene may leach from polystyrene foam containers into food and drink and, according to EPA studies, is now detectable in the fat tissue of every man, woman and child in the United States.

D.    Acute exposure to styrene in humans results in mucous membrane and eye irritations and gastrointestinal effects. Chronic exposure results in effects on the central nervous system including lethargy, drowsiness, staggering and sleepiness.

E.     Polystyrene foam is manufactured from non-renewable petroleum products and in a 2004 study, the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) ranked polystyrene’s environmental impacts second highest, behind aluminum, in the categories of energy consumption, greenhouse gas effect, and total environmental effect.

F.     Polystyrene foam products can take hundreds of years to deteriorate in the environment or a landfill.

G.    There is no meaningful reuse or recycling of polystyrene foam products.

H.    Polystyrene foam litter poses an environmental threat to creeks and waterways, contaminates the public storm drain systems and has serious negative impacts on tourism and wildlife.

I.      Polystyrene foam is notorious as a pollutant that breaks down into smaller, non-biodegradable pieces that pose significant threats to marine and other wildlife from ingestion and entanglement.

J.      Discarded packaging from single servings of food and beverages constitutes a significant and growing portion of the waste stream.

K.    Cost-effective, re-usable, and biodegradable food packaging products are readily available for numerous food service applications such as cold cups, plates and hinge containers and are less toxic and more environmentally friendly than polystyrene foam.

L.     Numerous cities in California have adopted ordinances banning the use of polystyrene foam packaging with local and national businesses successfully replacing polystyrene foam and other nonbiodegradable food packaging with affordable durable and reusable food service ware or biodegradable products.

M.    Restricting the use of polystyrene foam products will protect the public health and safety of Mill Valley residents and the City’s environment, waterways and wildlife.

Code enforcement is vital to the protection of the public’s health, safety and quality of life.

Unpaid fines or penalties and their related costs, arising from administrative citations, administrative civil penalties actions or other administrative enforcement actions as provided by this Code shall be a debt to the City of Mill Valley and subject to all remedies for debt collection as allowed by law. The City shall be entitled to interest from the date the order becomes final or 30 days after the first billing whichever date is later.

B.     Where an administrative enforcement action is relates to a specific property, administrative costs may also be recovered by the method prescribed in California Government Code Section 54988.

C.     Where an administrative enforcement action also involves abatement of a public nuisance, administrative costs related to abatement of the public nuisance may also constitute abatement costs recoverable by special assessment against the real property on which the nuisance exists.

8.02.090 Administrative enforcement and appeal hearings.
A.    In order to effect proper enforcement of this Code and provide for the procedural and substantive due process rights of all persons subject to enforcement of this Code through the application of its administrative code enforcement remedies, there shall be the following two general types of administrative hearing:

1.     Administrative Enforcement Hearing. Where this chapter requires the City to seek an administrative hearing as the means of enforcing this Code through the imposition of an administrative penalty for a responsible party’s failure or refusal to comply with the appropriate notice for his or her violation of the Code, the hearing shall be an “administrative enforcement hearing.”

2.     Administrative Appeal Hearing. Where an aggrieved, responsible party seeks to appeal from an administrative decision, or an administrative enforcement action not requiring an administrative enforcement hearing, the hearing shall be an “administrative appeal hearing.”

B.     Both types of hearing shall provide for judicial review. The rules procedures set forth at Sections 8.02.100 through 8.02.130 apply to both administrative enforcement and administrative appeal hearings conducted pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 1261 § 3, November 4, 2013)

 

8.02.100 General procedures for administrative hearings.
A.    Administrative hearings are intended to be informal in nature. Formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply. Other than copies of citations, notices, notice and orders, and inspection reports served on the responsible parties as part of the enforcement action giving rise to the hearing, no pre-hearing discovery of the City’s evidence shall be permitted.

B.     The City bears the burden of proof at an administrative hearing to establish the existence of a violation of this Code.

C.     A preponderance of the evidence shall be the standard of proof used by the administrative hearing officer in deciding the issues at an administrative hearing. The administrative citation or administrative civil penalties notice, along with any additional reports submitted by the enforcement officer shall constitute prima facie evidence of the facts contained in those documents.

D.    Each party shall have the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and present evidence in support of his or her case.

E.     The only evidence that shall be permitted at the hearing and considered by the administrative hearing officer in reaching a decision is that evidence that is relevant to the proof or disproof of:

1.     Ownership of the subject property, when applicable;

2.     Whether a person noticed by the City as a responsible party is, in fact, a responsible party, as defined in Section 8.02.020 of this chapter;

3.     Whether a violation of this Code occurred or continued to occur on the date or dates specified in the citation, notice, or order;

4.     Whether the responsible party has caused, maintained or permitted the violation(s) specified in the citation, notice, or order; and, in the event of an administrative enforcement hearing on an administrative civil penalties notice, whether the amount of civil penalties proposed by the enforcement officer to be assessed are reasonable based on the procedures and criteria set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 1261 § 3, November 4, 2013)

 

8.02.110 Failure to attend administrative hearing.
Any responsible party whose property or actions are the subject of an administrative hearing and who fails to appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing; the adjudication of the issues related to the hearing, any and all rights afforded under this Code; and shall be deemed to have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, provided that proper notice of the hearing as required by this or another applicable chapter of this Code has been served. (Ord. 1261 § 3, November 4, 2013)

 

8.02.120 Administrative hearing order.
The written decision of the administrative hearing officer setting forth the findings and ruling in a particular case shall be entitled “administrative hearing order,” unless a different title is imposed by this or another applicable chapter of this Code, and conform to the requirements set forth therein. (Ord. 1261 § 3, November 4, 2013)

 

8.02.130 Administrative hearing officer.
A.    The City Manager shall promulgate rules and procedures as are necessary to contract with qualified persons capable of acting as administrative hearing officers.

B.     The City Manager shall select an administrative hearing officer.

C.     In an administrative appeal hearing, the administrative hearing officer may be a member of the staff of the department through which the administrative citation was issued, provided that the staff member meets the requirements of this section. The enforcement officer that issues an administrative citation shall not serve as the administrative hearing officer on any matter related to that citation.

D.    The employment, performance evaluation, compensation and benefits of the administrative hearing officer shall not be directly or indirectly conditioned upon the amount of the administrative fines or penalties upheld, awarded, imposed, or assessed by the administrative hearing officer.

E.     Any person designated to serve as an administrative hearing officer is subject to disqualification for bias, prejudice, interest, or for other reason for which a judge may be disqualified in a court of law. Rules and procedures for the disqualification of an administrative hearing officer based upon a showing of actual bias, prejudice, interest, or other reason shall be promulgated by the City Manager.

F.     The administrative hearing officer shall have the power to:

1.     Conduct administrative enforcement hearings and administrative appeal hearings as provided under the authority of this Code;

2.     Continue a hearing based on good cause shown by one of the parties to the hearing or upon his or her own independent determination that due process has not been adequately afforded to a responsible party;

3.     Exercise continuing jurisdiction over the subject matter of an administrative enforcement hearing for the purposes of granting a continuance, ensuring compliance with an administrative civil penalties enforcement order, modifying an administrative civil penalties enforcement order, or where extraordinary circumstances exist, granting a new administrative enforcement hearing;

4.     Rule upon the merits of an administrative appeal hearing or an administrative enforcement hearing upon consideration of the evidence submitted and issue a written decision resolving the case;

5.     Uphold, award, impose, assess, or deny a fine or penalty authorized under this Code;

6.     Assess administrative costs according to proof;

7.     Set, increase, or decrease, according to proof, the amount of fine or penalty or the daily rate of such fine or penalty sought by the City to be awarded, imposed, or assessed in those cases where the fine or penalty is not fixed but is subject to a range as otherwise established by this Code;

8.     In those cases where the fine or penalty is not fixed but is subject to a range as otherwise established by this Code, determine the date certain upon which the assessment of civil penalties shall begin; and, where the corrections are subsequently completed to the City’s satisfaction, the date certain upon which the assessment of civil penalties shall end. If the violations have not been so corrected, the daily accrual of the penalties assessed shall continue until the violations are corrected or the legal maximum limit is reached; and

9.     Where appropriate in administrative enforcement actions arising from the issuance of an administrative civil penalties notice and as a condition of compliance in correcting the violations at issue; require each responsible party to cease violating this Code and to make all necessary corrections as specified by the City. (Ord. 1261 § 3, November 4, 2013)

It is the intention of the City Council, in adopting the provisions codified in this chapter, to set forth guidelines for determining what conditions constitute a public nuisance; to establish a method for giving notice of the conditions and an opportunity to correct them; and finally in the event the public nuisance is not abated or corrected, to provide a procedure for a hearing and determination of the facts and manner in which the conditions shall be corrected or removed.

C.     It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a just, equitable and practical method, in addition to any other remedy available at law, whereby lands or buildings which are dilapidated, unsafe, dangerous, unsanitary, cluttered with weeds, debris, abandoned vehicles, machinery or equipment, or are a menace, or hazard to life, limb, safety, health, morals, property values, aesthetic standards or the general welfare of the City of Mill Valley, may be required to be repaired, renovated, vacated, demolished, made safe or cleaned up by removal of offensive conditions.

D.    It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a program for the removal and/or abatement as public nuisances of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof from private or public property.

E.     In addition to the abatement procedures provided in this chapter, this chapter declares certain conditions to be public nuisances and that maintenance of such conditions shall be subject to the administrative remedies set forth in Chapter 8.02 of this Code and criminal prosecution pursuant to Chapter 8.03 of this Code.

F.     This chapter is not intended to enforce conditions, covenants and restricts (CC&Rs) on property, nor to supersede them. This chapter will be enforced uniformly within the City regardless of CC&Rs; therefore, this chapter does not abrogate the right of any homeowners association or private citizen to take action, legal or as otherwise provided in the CC&Rs, to force compliance with the CC&Rs applicable to their tract or association even though the CC&R provisions may be the same, more restrictive or may not be covered by this chapter. (Ord. 1261 § 5, November 4, 2013)

In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the State of California under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof as public nuisances, the City Council hereby makes the following findings and declarations.

The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property, is hereby found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or part thereof, on private or public property, except as expressly hereinafter permitted, is hereby declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1107 § 2, May 4, 1992)

8.34.030 Abandonment presumption.

B.     An owner who has made a bona fide sale or transfer of a vehicle and has delivered possession of the vehicle to a purchaser may overcome the presumption prescribed in subsection A by demonstrating that the owner has complied with Section 5900 of the Vehicle Code or providing other proof satisfactory to the court.

B.     The requirement that a 10-day notice of intention to abate and remove the vehicle or part thereof as a public nuisance may be waived if the property owner and the owner of the vehicle have signed releases authorizing removal and waiving further interest in the vehicle or part thereof. However, the notice of intention is not required for removal of a vehicle or part thereof which is inoperable due to the absence of a motor, transmission, or wheel and incapable of being towed, is valued at less than $200.00 by a person specified in Section 22855 of the Vehicle Code, and is determined to be a public nuisance presenting an immediate threat to public health or safety.

If the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located submits a sworn written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his or her land within such time period, this statement shall be construed as a request for hearing which does not require the presence of the owner submitting such request. If such a request is not received within such period, the Chief of Police shall have the authority to remove the vehicle.

If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the landowner and that he or she has not subsequently acquiesced in its presence, then the Chief of Police shall not assess costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempted to collect such cost from such owner.

Chapter 8.68 ATHLETIC RACES

As used in this chapter, the term “athletic race” shall mean any running, walking or bicycling competition over a set course, any portion of which lies within the City of Mill Valley, which involves 50 or more participants and which is publicly announced through advertisements, posters, circulars, or in any other manner.

 

8.68.020 Permit required for athletic races.
It shall be unlawful for any persons to conduct or participate in conducting any athletic race within the City of Mill Valley without first obtaining a permit to do so from the Mill Valley Parks and Recreation Commission. Application for race permits must be submitted no later than 90 days before the race date and no earlier than one calendar year prior to the race date. The application shall be on a form prescribed by the Mill Valley Parks and Recreation Department.

In granting or denying any such application, the Mill Valley Parks and Recreation Commission shall consider, among other things, the following:

A.    Whether the conduct of the race will substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of other traffic contiguous to its route.

B.     Whether the conduct of the race will require the diversion of so great a number of police officers of the City to properly police the line of movement and the area contiguous thereto as to prevent normal police protection to the City.

C.     Whether the conduct of the race will unduly interfere with the movement of fire, police, ambulance and other emergency vehicles.

If the actual direct and administrative costs incurred by the City exceed the amount deposited therefor, the permittee shall pay the excess to the City at the conclusion of the race.

Chapter 8.72 SOCIAL HOST ACCOUNTABILITY
8.72.010 Legislative purpose.
The purposes of this chapter are:

A.    To protect the public health, safety and general welfare;

B.     To promote the reduction of underage drinking and/or use of controlled substances by imposing an administrative fine on persons responsible for loud or unruly gatherings where alcohol and/or controlled substances are consumed by, served to, or in the possession of, underage persons;

C.     To facilitate the enforcement of laws prohibiting the service to, consumption of, or possession of, alcoholic beverages and/or controlled substances by underage persons;

D.    To offset the municipal costs associated with providing fire, police, and other emergency services to loud or unruly gatherings, by imposing a civil fee upon social hosts and/or landowners who knowingly allow such loud or unruly gatherings to occur on their premises, at their residences, or at rented facilities where alcoholic beverages and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by, or in the possession of, underage persons. (Ord. 1231, January 22, 2008; Ord. 1296, October 2, 2017)

 

8.72.020 Legislative findings.
The City Council finds as follows:

A.    The City of Mill Valley, pursuant to the police powers delegated to it by the California Constitution, has the authority to enact laws, which promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its residents;

B.     The occurrence of loud or unruly gatherings on private property where alcoholic beverages and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by, or in the possession of, underage persons is harmful to the underage persons themselves and is a public nuisance;

C.     The City of Mill Valley has made numerous and substantial efforts to enforce underage drinking laws. Despite these efforts, alcohol use by youth remains a serious problem in the City, contributing significantly to the incidence of adolescent crime, addiction, sexual assault, truancy, driving under the influence, and motor vehicle crashes involving alcohol and/or controlled substances and causing injury and/or death;

D.    Underage persons often obtain alcoholic beverages and/or controlled substances at gatherings held at private residences or at rented residential and commercial premises that are under the control of a person who knows or should know of the service to, possession by, and/or consumption of, alcohol by underage persons. Persons responsible for the occurrence of loud or unruly gatherings on private property over which they have possession or control have failed to ensure that alcoholic beverages and/or controlled substances are not served to, consumed by, or possessed by, underage persons at these gatherings;

E.     Residents have failed to prevent the occurrence or reoccurrence of loud or unruly gatherings, including those where alcoholic beverages and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by, or possessed by, underage persons, on private property, which seriously disrupts neighboring residents’ quiet enjoyment of their property;

F.     Control of loud or unruly gatherings on private property where alcoholic beverages and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by, or in the possession of, underage persons is necessary when such activity is determined to be a public nuisance;

G.    Persons held responsible for abetting or allowing loud or unruly gatherings where alcohol and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by, or in the possession of, underage persons will be more likely to properly supervise or to stop such conduct at gatherings held on property in their possession or under their control;

H.    In the past and present, law enforcement, fire and other emergency response services personnel have responded and are required to respond, sometimes on multiple occasions, to loud or unruly gatherings on private property at which alcoholic beverages and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by, or in the possession of, underage persons, and responses to such gatherings result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources of the City, which are underwritten by general municipal taxes paid to the City by its taxpayers and residents, and also result in a delay of responses to regular and emergency calls to the rest of the City;

I.      Problems associated with loud or unruly gatherings at which alcoholic beverages and/or controlled substances are served to, consumed by, or in the possession of, underage persons are difficult to prevent or deter unless the City has the legal authority to issue an administrative citation for an administrative fine;

J.      The intent of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, quiet enjoyment of residential property, and general welfare;

K.    Section 25658 of the State of California Business and Professions Code makes it unlawful for a person under the age of 21 years to purchase or attempt to purchase, or consume alcoholic beverages and makes it unlawful for any person to sell any alcoholic beverage to any person under the age of 21 years. Similarly, Section 11362.1 of the State of California Health and Safety Code makes it unlawful for a person under the age of 21 to possess marijuana;

L.     According to local, state and federal surveys, alcohol is overwhelmingly and consistently the most widely used drug at all adolescent age levels. A child who begins alcohol use prior to age 15 is four times as likely to experience alcohol dependence than one who refrains from alcohol use until age 20 or older;

M.    This City Council of the City of Mill Valley therefore determines that this chapter is a reasonable and necessary means to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the youth and other residents of the City of Mill Valley.

Sections 10.04.190 and 10.04.195 exclude specified types of small trucks and van campers that are used by residents in their daily lives. (Ord. 1260, April 7, 2014)

In said event the City shall serve on the permittee its written demand specifying the place or relocation or that the encroachment must be removed and specifying a reasonable time within which the work of relocation or removal must be commenced. The permittee must commence such relocation or removal within the time specified in said demand, and thereafter diligently prosecute the same to completion.

(Ord. 1175 § 1, February 20, 2001)

Upon receipt of an application for a right-of-way agreement which is determined to be complete by the Director, the City Council shall consider the application and may, by resolution or ordinance, grant or deny the requested right-of-way agreement.

11.18.110 Right-of-way usage fee.
Each right-of-way agreement granted under this chapter is subject to the City’s right, which is expressly reserved, to fix a fair and reasonable compensation to be paid by licensee for the rights granted in the right-of-way agreement. The right-of-way agreement shall specify the amount of compensation to be paid by the licensee for the use of the City’s right-of-way and the other privileges granted by the agreement. Compensation may be in the form of cash payments, in-kind contributions or other benefits of value paid or provided to the City by the licensee or any combination of the foregoing. This section shall not apply to right-of-way agreements approved and executed for right-of-way uses governed by the Broughton Act (Cal. Pub. Util. Code Section 6001 et seq.), the Franchise Act of 1937 (Cal. Pub. Util. Code Section 6201 et seq.), or Section 7901 of the Public Utilities Code. (Ord. 1175 § 1, February 20, 2001)

 

11.18.120 Security.
A.    Licensee shall, prior to the issuance of any permit for construction in the public right-of-way, deliver to the City satisfactory security in the amount of 110% of the total estimated cost of all work to be performed under such permit, as determined by the Director. Such security shall consist of an irrevocable letter of credit, cash deposit, or performance bond as determined by the Director. The security shall be provided in the manner required by the Director and maintained in full force and effect until the permitted work in the public right-of-way is completed to the satisfaction of the Director, at which time the amount of the security shall be reduced to 10% of the actual cost of the work. The reduced security shall be maintained by licensee for a period of one year as a guarantee that the work is of good quality and free from any defective or faulty material or workmanship. Any surety supplying a performance bond must be an “admitted surety insurer,” as defined in Section 995.120 of the Code of Civil Procedure, authorized to do business in the State of California. Return of the security shall be conditioned upon licensee’s faithful performance of all work in the public right-of-way specified in the applicable permit. In the event licensee fails to comply with any provisions of this chapter related to such work, or any provision of any applicable right-of-way agreement or permit, or other approval related to such work, any damages or loss suffered by the City as a result thereof shall be recoverable from the security, including but not limited to the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, cost of removal, or abandonment of any property of licensee, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs up to the full amount of the security.

B.     Neither the provisions of this section nor any damages recovered by the City hereunder shall be construed to excuse licensee’s faithful performance of any right-of-way agreement or limit the liability or damages of licensee under this chapter, either to the full amount of the security or otherwise. In addition to its rights to take action under the security, the City may pursue any other remedy provided by law. (Ord. 1175 § 1, February 20, 2001)

 

11.18.130 Use of facilities—Change in use.
Licensee’s facilities shall be placed, constructed, owned, controlled, operated, managed, and used solely and exclusively for the purposes and uses expressly set forth in licensee’s right-of-way agreement. Licensee shall not in any way use, or authorize or allow another person to use, any facility subject to licensee’s right-of-way agreement for any purpose or use other than the purposes and uses expressly set forth in the right-of-way agreement. (Ord. 1175 § 1, February 20, 2001)

 

11.18.140 Transfer of agreement or facilities.
The execution of a right-of-way agreement is a privilege to be held personally by licensee. Subject to applicable law, no right-of-way agreement or any facility permitted thereunder shall be sold, leased, licensed, assigned, disposed of, or otherwise transferred, in whole or in part, either by involuntary or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, stock transfer, transfer in trust, or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the City, and then only under such conditions as may be prescribed by the agreement. A sale or transfer of stock, assets, or other equitable interests of licensee, or any parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate of licensee, which effects a material change in licensee’s ownership or control, as determined by the City, shall be deemed to be a transfer for purposes of this section. Any transfer shall be made only by an instrument in writing, such as a bill of sale, or similar document, a duly executed copy of which shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk within 30 days after any such transfer or assignment. The consent of the City Council to a transfer may not be unreasonably denied. Any proposed transferee must show that it has the financial, technical and legal ability to perform all obligations and requirements of the right-of-way agreement and this chapter as determined by the City Council and must agree in writing to comply with all provisions of the right-of-way agreement and this chapter. No consent by the City shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage or other hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure any indebtedness. (Ord. 1175 § 1, February 20, 2001)

 

11.18.150 Nonexclusive use—Limitations.
A.    Any right-of-way agreement shall be for the nonexclusive use of the public rights-of-way. By executing a right-of-way agreement, the City does not agree to restrict the number of right-of-way agreements to be executed that cover all or any part of the City for any person in the same business, a related business, or a competing business as the licensee.

B.     A right-of-way agreement only authorizes licensee to use the public right-of-way specifically described in one or more encroachment permits issued by the City, and the use of any other public property, whether located within or outside a public right-of-way, is strictly prohibited unless authorized by a separate agreement with the City.

C.     No reference herein, nor in any right-of-way agreement, shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the City that its interest or other right to control the use of the property that is the subject of a right-of-way agreement is sufficient to permit its use for the purposes specified in the agreement. Any right-of-way agreement shall be deemed to grant no more than the rights which the City may have the authority to grant.

D.    Any privilege claimed by licensee in any public right-of-way shall be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy or use of the public right-of-way.

E.     Licensee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the City for any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising out of any provision or requirement of this chapter or of any right-of-way agreement executed under this chapter or because of its enforcement. (Ord. 1175 § 1, February 20, 2001)

 

11.18.160 Facilities—Installation.
A.    Conformance with Applicable Law. No person shall place, construct, own, control, operate, manage, or use any facility in, upon, above, beneath, or across any public right-of-way without first obtaining all necessary or required permits, agreements, or approvals from the City and all other governmental entities with jurisdiction over the facility or public right-of-way. All facilities shall be placed, installed or constructed and the right-of-way restored in accordance with the standard specifications adopted by resolution of the City Council and any applicable special conditions or provisions imposed by the City Council or Director.

The key map and detailed improvement plan shall be prepared by a California registered professional civil engineer. Revisions shall be made to reflect comments of the Director prior to the issuance of any encroachment permit. Prior to requesting the issuance of an encroachment permit for installation of any facility, the key map and detailed improvement plan shall be filed by the applicant with any other entity that owns, operates, or manages facilities in the affected right-of-way, so that such entities may advise the Director as to any location, operation, or compatibility problems created by the applicant’s proposed use of the right-of-way.

Upon permanent abandonment, the facility shall become that of the City and the licensee of such facility shall submit to the Director an instrument in writing, to be approved by the City Attorney, transferring ownership of the facility to the City. Instead of accepting a facility as being abandoned pursuant to this subsection B, the City in its sole discretion may remove the facility at licensee’s sole expense, and licensee shall promptly reimburse the City for the costs of such removal within 30 days after receiving an invoice from the City.

A.    No excavation shall be permitted in any public right-of-way that was constructed or resurfaced during the five year period prior to the proposed excavation. This prohibition shall not apply to emergency excavations approved by the director. A proposed excavation shall be considered an emergency if it is necessary to repair or replace underground facilities in order to prevent a disruption of services to customers or prevent injury or damage to life or property. This prohibition also shall not apply to excavations required to provide essential utility services to a property where there are no other reasonable means of providing such services to the property or where the work is mandated by state or federal laws or orders and the excavation cannot be reasonably avoided as determined in both events by the Director. In the event of an excavation permitted by this subsection A, the affected right-of-way shall be restored in accordance with the right-of-way restoration standards approved by resolution of the City Council.

B.     The special right-of-way restoration standards described in subsection A above also shall apply to the excavation of right-of-way that has been constructed or resurfaced more than five years before the proposed excavation, provided that the right-of-way has a Pavement Condition Index of 70 or higher as described in the City’s Pavement Management Program.

C.     On an annual basis, the City and each utility or other user of the public rights-of-way shall coordinate their current year and to the extent practicable their five year capital improvement programs for public right-of-way installations in order to reduce the number of excavations that occur. Such coordination shall occur annually at the time and in the manner specified by the Director. The Director may submit an annual report to the City Council on the results of this coordination process. This report may include recommendations on the timing of City right-of-way projects to accommodate street projects planned by utilities or other users of the public rights-of-way.

D.    Unless the right-of-way agreement prescribes a different time period, prior to submitting an application for a right-of-way agreement, the applicant shall notify in writing, on a form approved by the City, other existing or potential right-of-way users who are shown on the list of users maintained by the City. The notice shall describe the work to be performed, the specific rights-of-way that will be used, and the time when such work will be performed. All persons receiving such notice shall have 30 days from the date thereof to inform in writing the City and applicant sending the notice that such person desires to perform work jointly with the applicant. All work jointly performed by other persons shall be performed pursuant to right-of-way agreements and all required encroachment and excavation permits. The failure to timely respond to the notice and timely obtain the necessary right-of-way agreement and permits shall result in the person receiving the notice being prohibited from working in the designated right-of-way for a period of one year from the date that the work described in the notice is completed.

B.     There is reserved to the City every right and power which the City has under any local, state or federal law, and every person subject to this chapter, by its use of the public right-of-way, agrees to comply with any actions or requirements of the City in its exercise of such rights or powers.

C.     Neither the execution of a right-of-way agreement nor any provisions of this chapter shall constitute a waiver or bar the exercise of any governmental right or power of the City, including the City’s authority to make any proper public use of the public right-of-way.

D.    The City Council and the director may do all things which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of the City’s jurisdiction under this chapter.

E.     The City shall have the right to supervise all construction or installation work performed subject to the provisions of this chapter and make such inspections as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this chapter, a right-of-way agreement, an encroachment or excavation permit or any other local, state, or federal law, regulation, permit, or standard.

If the deposit exceeds the costs actually incurred, the balance shall be refunded to the applicant. If the actual costs incurred exceed such deposit, the applicant shall pay to the City the balance due. The acceptance by the City of such fee or costs shall not obligate the City to vacate any street nor to undertake statutory proceedings to vacate any street if the City’s investigation discloses that such action is not warranted. (Ord. 552; Ord. 560 § 20, June 19, 1963)

Chapter 11.30 STREET MAINTENANCE SECURITY AND CLOSURES
11.30.010 Findings.
The City Council of the City of Mill Valley does hereby determine that the streets of the City are particularly vulnerable to damage caused by heavily laden vehicles traveling to and from construction sites within the City for the following reasons, among others:

A.    Heavily laden vehicles delivering construction materials to construction sites repeatedly drive over the edge of the street paving onto unimproved property causing breakdowns of the paved shoulders of the streets.

B.     Construction activities frequently involve excavation of City streets for purposes of installing various utility services. Such excavations render streets particularly vulnerable to damage from heavily laden vehicles.

 

11.30.020 Security for repair of City streets.
The City Engineer is hereby authorized to require security in an amount to be established from time to time by City Council resolution, for the repair of damage to City streets which may occur as the result of use by vehicles traveling to and from construction sites within the City. Such security shall be in the form of cash, a corporate surety bond, or in such other form as may be approved by the City Engineer for any construction project involving the issuance of a building permit indicating a construction cost in excess of $25,000.00, or for any other construction project where the City Engineer has reasonable cause to believe that vehicles will be used which have a gross weight on any one axle in excess of 3,000 pounds. Such security shall be posted prior to commencement of construction by the owner or lessee of the construction site, or by such other person or entity for whose benefit such construction is undertaken. Upon the completion of any such construction work, and after giving reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard, the City Engineer shall determine the amount and location of any street damage resulting from vehicles attending the construction site. The decision of the City Engineer shall be final. The person posting such security with the City shall repair such damage within a period of 60 days after completion of construction. In the event such damage is not completed within such time to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, the City Engineer is authorized to complete the repairs and collect the cost thereof from the posted security. The security required hereunder shall be in addition to any other security (such as security for completion of frontage improvements) which may lawfully be required in connection with the construction site.

 

11.30.030 Road closures for construction projects.
A City street may be closed to the use of vehicles to accommodate the needs of private construction only upon approval of the City Engineer obtained at least 48 hours in advance of such closure. Signs stating the date and time of closure shall be posted, one in each direction, at least 48 hours in advance of the closure. The location of the signs shall be subject to approval by the City Engineer. Such signs shall consist of black letters on a white background, shall be at least two feet by four feet in size, and shall be approved by the City Engineer. (Ord. 1064, April 6, 1987)

Chapter 11.32 NEWSRACKS
11.32.010 Purpose and intent.
The City Council finds that newsracks placed on public sidewalks, streets and rights-of-way can interfere with the use and attractive appearance of such public sidewalks, streets and rights-of-way thereby threatening the health, safety and welfare of the public.

The City Council also recognizes that public streets, sidewalks and rights-of-way are historically associated with the sale and distribution of newspapers and other publications, and that access to the use of these areas for such purpose is not to be denied except where such use unreasonably interferes with the use of these areas by pedestrians or traffic, or whether such use presents a hazard to persons or property.

The City Council, therefore, has determined that a reasonable accommodation of these competing interests can be achieved by adoption of this chapter which regulates the placement, design and maintenance of newsracks.

 

11.32.020 Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, certain words and phrases used herein are defined as follows: unless it is apparent from the context that a different meaning is intended:

A.    “Newsrack” means any self-service or coin-operated box, container, storage unit or other dispenser, installed, used or maintained for the display, sale or distribution without charge, of any written or printed material, including but not limited to, newspapers, news periodicals, magazines.

B.     “Newsrack District” means that portion of the City of Mill Valley as more particularly set forth in Exhibit A to Ordinance 1099.

C.     “Permanent newsrack” means any newsrack maintained in a thoroughfare for more than 90 days.

D.    “Temporary newsrack” means any newsrack maintained in a thoroughfare for a trial period of not more than 90 days.

E.     “Person” means any individual, business or other organization of any kind, excepting the United States of America, the State of California or any political subdivision thereof.

F.     “Newsrack permit” means a permit issued to a person allowing the placement of a newsrack within a specifically designated portion of a thoroughfare.

G.    “Thoroughfare” means that portion of any public street other than the area included within the roadway, including a sidewalk.

H.    “Roadway” means that portion of a public street improved and/or customarily used for vehicular traffic.

I.      “Street” means all that area dedicated to the public use for public street purposes and included but is not limited to roadways and thoroughfares.

J.      “Sidewalk” means any surface or walkway dedicated to public use and provided for the exclusive or primary use of pedestrians.

 

11.32.030 Criteria for installation, maintenance, design and removal.
A.    Installation, Maintenance and Design. Any newsrack which in whole or in part rests upon, in or over any public street shall comply with the following criteria:

1.     No individual newsrack shall exceed five feet in height, 30 inches in width, or two feet in depth.

2.     Newsracks shall be placed adjacent to a wall, building, structure, bus bench or parallel to a curb. Newsracks shall be placed next to each other whenever feasible. Newsracks may be placed adjacent to the wall of a building (or if there is no building, adjacent to the property line) or near a street curb; the determination as to which side of the sidewalk the newsrack is located shall be determined by the Director of Public Works. Newsracks placed adjacent to the wall of a building (or property line) shall be placed with their long axis parallel to such wall (or line) and so that their back edge is six inches from the wall (or line). Newsracks placed near a street curb shall be placed so that the edge closest to the curb is 12 inches from the curb. Not more than five newsracks shall be located side-by-side outside the Newsrack District (whether secured together or separately secured to the sidewalk) and at least three feet of clear space shall separate any such group of five newsracks from the next such group. The above notwithstanding, where newsracks are placed alongside litter receptacles, posts, poles, sidewalk furniture, or other obstructions, the number of newsracks which may be located side-by-side under the foregoing sentence shall be reduced by one for each such obstruction standing alongside newsracks at such location.

3.     No newsracks shall be placed or maintained on the sidewalk or thoroughfare opposite one or more other newsracks.

4.     No newsrack shall be used for advertising material other than that dealing with the sale or distribution of the publication sold therein. Rack cards no larger than 11 inches high and 17 inches wide may be placed on the front of the newsrack below the display window.

5.     The name, address and telephone number of the owner shall be attached or affixed to the front or rear of the newsrack in an area not exceeding six inches.

6.     Every newsrack shall be constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and secure condition.

7.     Every newsrack shall be maintained in a clean and neat condition and in good repair at all times.

8.     Any single unit newsrack of standard design commonly in trade use may be permitted as a temporary newsrack in any single location for a period of not more than 90 days, in order to determine the suitability of long-term newsrack location, provided that the placement of such newsrack conforms with the standards set forth in this chapter. At least 10 business days prior to locating a temporary newsrack, a completed newsrack permit application shall be submitted, including written notice of the particular location and date upon which the 90-day trial period will begin. Within 10 business days after expiration of the 90-day trial period, the person maintaining the temporary newsrack shall either cause it to be removed or submit a written application to the Director of Public Works for an encroachment permit for a permanent newsrack location.

B.     Removal. In the event any newsrack is removed, the public property shall be repaired and restored to the same condition as existed prior to the installation of the newsrack.

C.     Newsrack District. All permanent newsracks located in the Newsrack District shall be of a multi-unit configuration except at a location where there is only one newsrack and no other newsrack is located within 150 feet unless separated by a street. Each permanent newsrack shall be of a standard type in trade use, as approved by the Director of Public Works, with Federal Brown panels provided that no group of newsracks shall utilize more than two horizontal rows of six compartments per row, and not more than one such group of newsracks shall be allowed at each corner of a street intersection. If the demand for newsracks exceed 12 at a single location, placement of additional newsracks shall be allowed which comply with all other provisions of this chapter as determined by the Director of Public Works.

 

11.32.040 Unlawful obstructions.
A.    Prohibited Locations. No newsrack shall be placed, installed, used or maintained in the following locations:

1.     Within three feet of any marked crosswalk.

2.     Within five feet of any fire hydrant, fire call box, police call box or other emergency facility.

3.     Within five feet of any driveway.

4.     Within three feet of any bus bench in any location whereby the sidewalk or thoroughfare for pedestrian access is reduced to less than 34  inches.

5.     At any location where the newsrack unreasonably obstructs or interferes with access to, or the use and enjoyment of, abutting property.

6.     Any location where the newsrack will unreasonably interfere with or obstruct flow of pedestrian traffic on the sidewalk or thoroughfare.

7.     At any location where the newsrack causes, creates or constitutes a traffic hazard.

8.     At any location where the newsracks will endanger persons or property.

B.     Waiver for Good Cause. In response to a written request, the Director of Public Works may waive or modify the standards for newsrack placement, installation and design contained in this chapter upon a showing of good cause and upon his or her determination that placing a newsrack at the location requiring the modification would not endanger the public health or safety or reasonably interfere with the use of the public right-of-way.

 

11.32.050 Permit requirement.
A.    Newsrack Permit. In order to facilitate the inspection and regulation of newsracks for the purpose set forth in this chapter, no person shall install, place or maintain a newsrack on any public property without first obtaining a newsrack permit from the City for such installation.

B.     Application. Application for a newsrack permit shall be made in writing on a form provided by the City and filed with the Director of Public Works. The application form shall inform the applicant of the requirements of this chapter regarding placement and design of newsracks, and shall require the following information from the applicant:

1.     The name, address and telephone number of the owner of the newsrack and the name and address of an agent for notice, who shall be the owner or another person to whom notice of any violation of this chapter or notice of relocation or removal may be given.

2.     The location of each newsrack to be installed, placed or maintained in the City by the applicant. Such location shall comply with the requirements of this chapter.

C.     Issuance of Permit. Upon compliance with the requirements of this section, the Director of Public Works shall issue a permit for the newsrack within 10 working days. If an application is disapproved, in whole or in part, the Director of Public Works shall notify the applicant promptly, explaining the reasons for denial of a newsrack permit. No fee or bond shall be required in connection with issuance of a permit.

D.    Additional Newsracks. A person securing a newsrack permit may install and maintain additional newsracks by an amendment to the permit originally granted to that person. The rules and procedures of this section shall also apply to the review and approval of any such amendment.

 

11.32.060 Violations.
A.    Violation with Immediate Danger. If a newsrack is installed or maintained in such a place or manner as to pose an immediate or serious danger to persons, vehicles or property, and it is impractical to remedy the violation by one person moving the newsrack to another point on the sidewalk or other public right-of-way without mechanical assistance, the City may seize and impound such machine immediately and without prior notice to the owner.

Within two working days after such seizure, the City shall notify the agent for notice, by mail, of the seizure and the reasons therefor, including the facts constituting immediate and serious danger. The notice shall also inform the agent for notice of the right to request, within 12 days of the date of such notice, a hearing before the Director of Public Works to determine whether such seizure was proper. Upon timely request, the Director of Public Works shall hold such hearing within 10 business days, unless the owner agrees to a later hearing. The hearing shall be informal, but oral and written evidence may be given by both sides. The Director of Public Works shall give his or her decision in writing to the agent for notice within seven days after any such hearing. If the Director of Public Works finds that such seizure was proper, he or she shall notify the agent to recover the newsrack.

B.     Violation without Immediate Danger. Whenever the Director of Public Works is advised that a newsrack is being maintained contrary to the provisions of this chapter, but is not posing an immediate danger to persons or property as described in subsection A of this section, and it is impractical to remedy the violation by one person moving the newsrack to another point on the sidewalk or other public right-of-way without mechanical assistance, the Director of Public Works shall notify the agent for notice of the violation. The notice shall state the nature of the purported violation and give the owner a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 12 consecutive calendar days, to remedy the purported violation.

If such violation is not cured within the period of time allotted, the Director of Public Works shall deliver to the agent for notice an order to show cause which shall state therein the time and place of a hearing to be conducted by the Director of Public Works to determine whether or not such newsrack should be removed. The hearing shall be informal, but oral and written evidence may be given by both sides. Any action by the City with respect to the alleged violation shall be stayed pending the written decision of the Director of Public Works following the hearing.

The Director of Public Works shall give his or her decision in writing to the agent for notice within seven days after any such hearing. If the Director of Public Works finds that substantial evidence presented at the time of the hearing shows that the newsrack is being maintained contrary to the provisions of this chapter, the Director of Public Works shall notify the agent for notice for such determination, and shall give the owner a period of not less than 12 days from the date of such notice to remove the newsrack or correct the violation. If the owner of the newsrack fails within the time permitted to remove or correct the violation of said machine, the Director of Public Works shall take steps to cause the newsrack to be removed and impounded and shall notify the agent for notice to recover the newsrack.

C.     Abandoned Newsracks. Newsracks remaining empty for 30 consecutive days shall be deemed abandoned, except that a newsrack remaining empty due to labor strike or a temporary interruption of distribution or publication by the newspaper sold from that newsrack shall not be deemed abandoned. An abandoned newsrack may be removed by the City and impounded, and may be disposed of if the responsible party does not claim the newsrack, and pay any costs required by this section, within 30 days of its removal.

D.    Impounded Newsracks. The owner, or any other person entitled to possession of an impounded newsrack, who fails, within 30 days of the giving of notice by the Director of Public Works, to recover said newsrack and to pay any costs required pursuant to this section, shall be deemed to have abandoned the newsrack, and it shall be disposed of in a manner prescribed by law for the disposal of abandoned personal property.

E.     Cost of Recovery of Impounded Newsrack. No newsrack abandoned or removed for violation of this chapter and impounded shall be restored to the owner thereof, or to another person entitled to possession, unless and until the City’s reasonable cost of removal and storage of the newsrack, has been paid to the City; provided, however, that if after hearing before the Director of Public Works it is determined that the newsrack was improperly removed by the City, there shall be no charge for restoration of such newsrack to the person entitled to possession thereof.

 

11.32.070 Application to existing newsracks.
As soon as possible after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the Director of Public Works shall conduct an investigation of existing newsracks resting upon, in or over any public street.

Where the Director of Public Works is able to ascertain the owner of a newsrack, he or she shall notify said owner of the requirement to obtain the permit required by Section 11.32.050 of this chapter.

The Director of Public Works shall take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to ascertain the identity of the owner(s) of all newsracks within the City which do not have the name, address and telephone number of such owner attached to said newsracks as required by Section 11.32.030(A)(6) of this chapter and/or California Business and Professions Code Section 17570, and shall advise such owners as he or she is able to identify of the requirement of said sections.

If the owner of an existing newsrack fails to comply with the requirements of this section, including the requirements of Section 12.23.030(A)(6) of this chapter and/or Business and Professions Code Section 17570, such shall be deemed violations of this chapter, and shall be subject to the provisions of Section 11.32.060 above.

If the Director of Public Works is unable to determine ownership, he or she shall impound such newsrack and hold the same for disposal as abandoned and unclaimed property.

 

11.32.080 Appeals.
Unless otherwise provided herein, any person who is aggrieved by a determination made by the Director of Public Works pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may file with the City Clerk a written appeal of such decision to the City Council. Such an appeal shall be deemed timely if filed with the City Clerk not later than the 10th consecutive day following the giving of notice of the decision to the aggrieved party. Upon receipt of a timely appeal, the City Clerk shall set the matter for hearing at the next most convenient meeting of the City Council, but in no event later than 30 days after the filing of the appeal.

L.     Chapter 6 of the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings is deleted. At the time fixed in the notice of hearing on the appeal, the Council shall proceed to hear the evidence relating to the Building Official’s notice, order, or action respecting the allegedly dangerous building. The Council may continue the hearing from time to time. If any appellant fails to appear at the time fixed for the hearing, or at any time to which the hearing may be continued, such failure to appear shall not deprive the Council of its jurisdiction to hear the matter. At the conclusion of the hearing, the City Council may adopt a resolution declaring the building dangerous and directing any Responsible Persons to whom the Building Official has addressed a notice and order to correct the dangerous condition within a reasonable period. In determining the period for correction, the City Council may consider, among other factors, the imminence of the danger involved. In its resolution, the City Council may direct that any officer or employee of the City of Mill Valley shall correct the dangerous condition in the event that the Responsible Person fails to abate it within the period prescribed by the Council. The City shall serve this resolution in accordance with Section 8.33.080.

M.    Any person aggrieved by the City Council’s declaration of a public nuisance after a hearing under this section must bring an action to contest the validity of any proceedings leading up to and including the adoption of the resolution in a court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days after the date of service of the Council resolution declaring such nuisance.

N.    After the expiration of the period identified in the Council resolution for abatement of the nuisance, the City has jurisdiction to abate the nuisance in the manner ordered in the resolution.

O.    Chapter 9 of the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings is deleted. (Ord. 1261 § 8, November 4, 2013)

 

14.05.031 Administration, organization and enforcement.
There is hereby established in Mill Valley, a code enforcement agency, which shall be under the administrative and operational control of the Building Official.

A.    General. The Building Official is hereby authorized and directed to enforce all the provisions of the Codes specified in this Chapter 14.05. For such purposes, he or she shall have the powers of a law enforcement officer.

B.     Deputies. In accordance with prescribed procedures and with the approval of the City Council, the Building Official may appoint such number of technical officers and inspectors and other employees as shall be authorized from time to time. He or she may deputize such inspectors or employees as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the code enforcement agency.

C.     Assistance of Other Officials. The Building Official may request and shall receive the assistance and cooperation of other officials of the City so far as is required in the discharge of the duties required by this Code or other pertinent law or ordinance.

D.    Right of Entry. When it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce the provisions of any Code specified in this Chapter 14.05, or when the Building Official has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in a building or upon a premises a condition which is contrary to or in violation of this Code which makes the building or premises unsafe, hazardous, or dangerous, the Building Official may enter the building or premises at reasonable times to inspect or to perform the duties imposed by this Code, provided that if such building or premises be occupied that credentials be presented to the occupant and entry requested. If such building or premises be unoccupied and unsecured, the Building Official shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the property owner or other person having charge or control of the building or premises and request entry. If entry is refused, the Building Official shall have recourse to the remedies provided by law to secure entry.

E.     Interpretations. The Building Official shall have the power to render interpretations of this Code and to adopt and enforce rules and regulations supplemental to this Code as may be deemed necessary in order to clarify the application of the provisions of this Code. Such interpretations, rules and regulations shall conform to the intent and purpose of this Code.

F.     Modifications. Whenever there are practical difficulties involved in carrying out the provisions of this Code, the Building Official may grant modifications for individual cases. The Building Official shall first find that a special individual reason makes the strict letter of this Code impractical and the modification does not lessen health life and fire safety requirements. The details of actions granting modifications shall be recorded and entered in the files of the Building Division.

G.    Board of Appeals. In order to determine the suitability of alternate materials and methods of installation and to provide for reasonable interpretations of the Codes specified in this Chapter 14.05, there is hereby created a Board of Appeals consisting of members who are qualified by experience and training to pass upon matters pertaining to design, construction, installation and maintenance of building, electrical, plumbing, and mechanical systems, equipment, and techniques. The Building Official shall be an ex officio member and shall act as secretary to the Board. The Board of Appeals shall be appointed by the City Council and shall hold office at its pleasure. The Board shall adopt reasonable rules and regulations to conduct its investigations and shall render all decisions and findings in writing to the Building Official with a duplicate copy to the appellant. The Board of Appeals shall have no authority relative to interpretation of the administrative provisions of this Code, nor shall the Board be empowered to waive requirements of this Code.

H.    Liability. The Building Official charged with the enforcement of this Chapter 14.05, acting in good faith and without malice in the discharge of the duties required by this chapter, shall not be rendered personally liable for damages that may accrue to persons or property as a result of an act or by reason of an act or omission in the discharge of such duties. This Chapter 14.05 shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the responsibility of any person owning, operating, or controlling any building or structure for any damages to persons or property caused by defects, nor shall the code enforcement agency or the City be held as assuming any such liability by reason of the inspections authorized by this chapter or any permits or certificates issued under this chapter. (Ord. 1244, November 15, 2010; Ord. 1261 § 8, November 4, 2013)

 

14.05.032 Permit administration.
To obtain a permit required for any work governed by any of the Codes specified in this Chapter 14.05, the applicant shall first file an application therefor in writing on a form furnished by the code enforcement agency for that purpose.

A.    Required Information. Every such application shall:

1.     Identify and describe the work to be covered by the permit for which application is made;

2.     Describe the land on which the proposed work is to be done by legal description, street address, or similar description that will readily identify and definitely locate the proposed building or work;

3.     Indicate the use or occupancy for which the proposed work is intended;

4.     Be accompanied by plans, diagrams, calculations, computations and specifications and other data as required in this section;

5.     State the valuation of any new building or structure or any addition, remodeling, or alteration to an existing building;

6.     Be signed by the applicant or an authorized agent of the applicant;

7.     Include conditions of compliance for the abatement of violations of this Code and other codes requiring permits for corrective work and such other data and information as may be required by the Building Official;

8.     Contain the information required by California Health and Safety Code Division 13, Part 3, Chapter 9, Section 19825;

9.     In addition to the information required by California Health and Safety Code Division 13, Part 3, Chapter 9, Section 19825 for architects and engineers, every permit shall contain the telephone numbers for any such persons, firms or designers responsible for the work proposed under the permit or application.

B.     Plans and Specifications.

1.     Plans, calculations, computations, diagrams, specifications, and other data shall be submitted in two or more sets with each application for a permit. When such plans are not prepared by an architect or engineer, the Building Official may require any applicant submitting such plans or other data to demonstrate that state law does not require that the plans be prepared by an architect or engineer. The Building Official may reject any plans deemed to be insufficient in detail or clarity and require that such plans be prepared by a competent designer/draftsperson, or by an engineer or architect licensed by the state to practice as such, when required by state law.

The Building Official may waive the submission of plans, calculations, computations, specifications, diagrams, or other data if it is found that the nature of the work applied for is such that plan review is not necessary to obtain compliance with this Chapter 14.05.

2.     Plans, diagrams, specifications, calculations, computations, reports, and other data submitted with the permit application for review shall detail clearly the nature, location, and extent of the work proposed and how it will conform to the provisions of this chapter and all other relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. All data and documents submitted for review shall identify the house number and street name of the work and the names and addresses of the property owner and person or firm who prepared them. Any conditions of approval pursuant to any other provision of the Mill Valley Municipal Code shall be shown on the plans or otherwise submitted with the permit application.

3.     Unless otherwise approved by the Building Official, plans shall be drawn to a minimum scale of one-fourth inch to one foot upon substantial paper or polyester based film (Mylar) and shall include a floor plan and a plot plan containing the following information as a minimum:

a.     Location and perimeter dimensions of the proposed and existing buildings or additions and other pertinent structures, including orthogonal measurements from property lines and between structures and elevations of finished grade, floors, and slabs;

b.     Proposed and existing site improvements, including drainage facilities, utilities, public and private easements, grading, and paving;

c.     Proposed and existing off-street parking and loading facilities, including parking stall size, angle of parking aisle width, interior circulation, and driveway elevations and proposed gradients;

d.     Location and perimeter dimensions of ground level usable open space as required by the Mill Valley Municipal Code;

e.     Location and size of existing and proposed trees and other landscaping and screening as required by city tree ordinances and regulations and other land use provisions;

f.      Addresses of contiguous properties;

g.     Locations, types, and dimensions of foundations, framing, windows, doors, finishes, adjoining rooms and uses, fire assemblies and dampers, fixtures, appliances, equipment, and distribution systems to the extent necessary for verification of compliance with all applicable regulations.

4.     In lieu of detailed specifications, the Building Official may approve references on the plans to a specific section or part of any Code specified in this Chapter 14.05 or other laws, ordinances, rules, or regulations.

5.     Calculations, testing reports and certifications, computations, conditions of approval, conditions of compliance and other data sufficient to demonstrate the correctness of the plans shall be submitted with the permit application and when otherwise required by the Building Official.

6.     Plans for buildings of other than Group R-3 and U occupancies shall detail clearly how required structural and fire-resistive integrity will be maintained where penetrations are made for electrical, mechanical, plumbing, fire extinguishing, or communications conduits, pipes, ducts, vents, supports and similar components or systems.

C.     Applications to Expire After 180 Days. Application for which no permit is issued within 180 days following the date of application shall expire by limitation, and plans and other data submitted for review may thereafter be returned to the applicant or destroyed by the Building Official. The Building Official may extend the time for action by the applicant for a period not exceeding 180 days upon request by the applicant showing that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have prevented action from being taken. No application shall be extended more than once. In order to renew action on an application after expiration, the applicant shall resubmit plans and pay a new plan review fee.

D.    Review and Approval. The application, plans, diagrams, calculations, specifications, computations and other data filed by an applicant for permit shall be reviewed by the Building Official. Such data may be reviewed by other departments of this and other jurisdictions to verify compliance with applicable laws under their jurisdiction. When the Building Official finds that the work described in an application for a permit and the plans, diagrams, computations, calculations, specifications and other data filed therewith conform to the requirements of this Code and other pertinent laws, ordinances and conditions of compliance for the abatement of violations of this Code and other codes and ordinances and that the fees, charges, costs and assessments specified by law, as well as all penalties, have been paid, the Building Official shall issue a permit therefor to the applicant.

When issuing a permit where plans are required, the Building Official shall endorse in writing or stamp the plans “APPROVED.” Such approved plans shall not be changed, modified or altered without authorization from the Building Official, and all work regulated by this Chapter 14.05 shall be done in accordance with the approved plans.

The Building Official may issue a permit for the construction of a part of a building or system before the entire plans and specifications for the whole building or system have been submitted or approved, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of the Codes specified in this chapter. The holder of a partial permit may proceed without assurance that the permit for the entire building, structure or system will be granted.

E.     Disposition of Plans. One set of approved plans, diagrams, calculations, specifications and computations shall be retained by the Building Official until final approval of the work covered therein. One set of approved plans and specifications shall be returned to the applicant, and said set shall be kept on the site of the building or work at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress.

F.     Permits Not to Authorize Otherwise Unlawful Work. The issuance of a permit or approval of plans, calculations, specifications, diagrams, and computations shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of any violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or of other ordinances, rules, or regulations of the City. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this chapter or of other ordinances, rules, or regulations of the City shall not be valid. The issuance of a permit based upon plans, calculations, specifications, computations and other data shall not prevent the Building Official from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said plans, calculations, computations, specifications, and other data or from preventing building operations being carried on thereunder when in violation of any law or regulation of the City of Mill Valley.

G.    Commencement of Work—Permit Expiration.

1.     Except for those construction projects where the Building Official, due to the nature of the project, deems these limitations to be unreasonable, every permit issued by the Building Official, under the provisions of this chapter, shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the building or work authorized by such permit is not physically commenced within 180 days following the issuance date of such permit.

2.     Following expiration of a permit under subsection (G)(1) and before work can commence, the original permit may be extended for one 180-day period provided: (a) no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and specifications for such work; and (b) that such delay has not exceeded one year from the date of original issuance of the permit. The fee for such extension shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit for such work. In all other cases, in order to renew action on a permit after expiration, the permittee shall pay a new full permit fee.

3.     A permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of the time to commence work. The Building Official may extend the time to commence work for a period not exceeding 180 days from the date that the permit otherwise would expire upon written request by the permittee showing that circumstances beyond the control of the permittee have prevented construction from commencing.

H.    Construction Time Limit Required.

1.     As part of any application for design review, the applicant shall file a reasonable estimate of the cost of the proposed construction, and based thereon, a construction time limit shall be established for the project in accordance with subsection I. Compliance with such time limit shall become a condition of design review approval. The time for completion of the construction shall also be indicated on the building permit.

2.     For projects exceeding $100,000 in value, a detailed Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) chart or GANTT chart, which provides detailed information on the critical path of the project, shall be required prior to the issuance of any building permit. Once approved, the property owner shall provide the Building Official with written monthly job progress reports consistent with the approved PERT or GANTT chart.

I.      Time Limit Established.

1.     Unless an extension is approved, the maximum time for completion of approved alterations, additions, modifications, repairs, or new construction, following issuance of the building permit, shall not exceed the following:

Construction Time Limits Based Upon

Demonstrable Estimated Project Value

Project Valuation

Total Time Allowed

Up to and including $10,000

6 Months

$10,000 to $50,000

9 Months

$50,000 to $100,000

12 Months

$100,000 to $1,000,000

18 Months

$1,000,000 to $5,000,000

24 Months

Over $5,000,000

36 Months

 

2.     Request for Extension of Construction Time Limit. An applicant may request an extension of the construction time limit either: (a) as part of the application for design review; or (b) at any other time prior to the expiration of the existing time limit. The application for an extension shall be accompanied by complete working drawings for the construction, a written explanation of the reasons for the requested extension, and the payment of a fee, as established by City Council resolution.

3.     Grant or Denial of Extension. An extension may be granted if it is determined that any one or more of the following factors not caused by the applicant present an unusual and unanticipated obstacle to complying with the required construction time limit:

a.     Site topography;

b.     Site access;

c.     Geologic issues;

d.     Neighborhood considerations;

e.     Other unusual factors.

The Planning Commission shall make the decision to grant or deny the extension. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if design review has already been approved and the request for extension is based on site access or geologic issues, the Director of Planning and Building shall make the decision of whether to approve or deny the extension of the construction time limit, provided that such extension does not exceed 18 months. The Director may request a meeting with the applicant, the project contractor, project architect, or any other representatives of the applicant, and shall render his or her determination within 10 days of the filing of the extension application (unless such deadline is waived by the applicant).

Any extension of the construction time limit shall not extend the existing expiration date of the design review approval. The decision of the Director of Planning and Building may be appealed to the Planning Commission in writing within 10 days of the Director’s decision. The decision of the Planning Commission to grant or deny the requested extension may be appealed in writing to the City Council within 10 days of the Commission’s decision.

J.      Failure to Comply With Timeline—Penalties.

1.     In the event that construction is not completed by the established time limit, the Building Official shall issue a compliance order to the owner of the property. The compliance order shall notify the property owner that construction must be completed within 30 days of the established time limit in order to avoid penalties, and shall notify the property owner of the rates at which penalties will apply if construction is not completed.

2.     Upon failure of a property owner to complete construction by the time limits established in this chapter, the following penalties shall apply:

a.     For the first 30 days that the project remains incomplete, there shall be no penalty;

b.     For the next 60 days that the project remains incomplete (i.e., the 31st through 90th day), the City shall impose a penalty of $400.00 per day;

c.     For the next 60 days that the project remains incomplete (i.e., the 91st through the 150th day), the City shall impose a penalty of $600.00 per day; and

d.     For any additional days during which the project remains incomplete (i.e., the 151st and subsequent days), the City shall impose a penalty of $800.00 per day, up to an overall maximum penalty of the lesser of 10% of the project valuation or $200,000.00. If necessary, the City may require that the project valuation be determined by an independent third party selected by the City at the cost of the property owner.

 

3.     Construction shall be deemed completed for purposes of this section upon the satisfactory performance of all construction work, including, but not limited to, compliance with all conditions of application approval and the clearing and cleaning of all construction-related materials and debris from the site, and the final inspection and written approval of the applicable work by the Building Official.

4.     Notice of Final Penalty. Once construction has been deemed complete or the penalty maximum has been reached, the property owner shall be notified in writing of the final amount of any penalty imposed pursuant to this section. Notice of the final penalty shall be given by personal service or by first class mail to the property owner at his or her last known address as it appears on the public records related to title or ownership of the property. Service by first class mail in the manner described above shall be effective on the date of mailing. All penalties shall be paid by the property owner within 30 days of service of notice of the final amount of the penalty.

5.     Collection; Interest. Unpaid penalties shall be a debt to the City and subject to all remedies for debt collection as allowed by law. The City shall be entitled to interest at the legal rate beginning from 30 days after the notice of final penalty or the date the order becomes final, whichever date is later.

6.     Appeal. The property owner may appeal the final penalty imposed by filing an appeal in writing with the City Clerk no later than 10 calendar days from the date of service of the notice of final penalty, along with payment of an appeal fee as established by City Council resolution. Within 45 days of receipt of the notice of appeal, the City Council shall hold a public hearing and shall affirm or modify the penalty. The Council shall consider, based on the evidence presented, whether the property owner was unable to comply with the construction time limit for reasons beyond the control of the property owner and/or his or her representatives. For purposes of this section, “reasons beyond the control” shall include, but not be limited to: administrative appeals of the project filed by third parties; delays required by the unforeseen discovery of archeological remains on the building site; labor stoppages; acts of war or terrorism; and natural disasters. However, “reasons beyond the control” shall not include: delays caused by the winter rainy season; failure of the applicant and/or his or her representatives to adequately protect the job site from damage due to the normal winter rainy season; failure of subcontractors to complete their work according to schedule; the use of custom and/or imported materials; the use of highly specialized subcontractors; significant, numerous, and/or late design changes; or by failure of materials suppliers to provide materials in a timely manner.

K.    Suspension or Revocation. The Building Official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this Chapter 14.05 whenever the permit is issued in error or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or in violation of any ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions of this Chapter 14.05.

L.     Investigation. Whenever any work for which a permit is required by this Code has commenced without first obtaining said permit, a special investigation shall be made before a permit may be issued for such work.

An investigation fee, in addition to the permit fee, shall be collected whether or not a permit is then or subsequently issued. The minimum investigation fee shall be established and assessed in accordance with Section 14.05.060. The payment of such investigation fee shall not exempt any person from compliance with all other provisions of this Code nor from any penalty prescribed by law. (Ord. 1187 § 4, March 17, 2003; Ord. 1244, November 15, 2010; Ord. 1267 § 1, December 1, 2014)

 

14.05.034 Confirming code compliance.
The Building Official may confirm compliance with the codes specified in this Chapter 14.05 by means of inspections and testing.

A.    Inspections. Equipment, buildings, and systems for which permits are required by this Chapter 14.05 shall be subject to inspection by the Building Official, at such times and in such manner as may be set forth more fully in each Code specified in this Chapter 14.05. Such equipment, buildings, and systems shall remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes until approved by the Building Official.

It shall be the duty of the permit applicant to cause the equipment, building, and systems to remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes. Neither the Building Official nor the jurisdiction shall be liable for expense entailed in the removal or replacement of any material required to permit inspection. When the installation of equipment or systems, or the construction of a building, is complete, an additional and final inspection shall be made.

Approval as a result of an inspection shall not be construed to be an approval of a violation of the provisions of this Code or of other ordinances, rules, or regulations of the jurisdiction. Inspections presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this Code or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be valid.

It shall be the duty of the person doing the work authorized by a permit to notify the Building Official that such work is ready for inspection.

A reinspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is requested is not complete or when required corrections have not been made. Reinspection fees may be assessed when the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for plan deviations requiring the approval of the Building Official. In instances where reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been paid.

B.     Tests. Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with the provisions of any Code specified in this Chapter 14.05, or evidence that a material or method does not conform to the requirements of such Code or in order to substantiate claims for alternate materials or methods, the Building Official may require tests as evidence of compliance to be made at no expense to the jurisdiction.

Test methods shall be as specified in the Codes specified in this Chapter 14.05 or by other recognized test standards. In the absence of recognized and accepted test methods, the Building Official shall specify the testing procedures.

Chapter 14.32 GRADING
14.32.010 Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish controls on the earthwork permitted by the City in the course of construction. The controls are established for reasons of aesthetics, sound soil engineering practice, erosion control, and water quality protection.

It is the intent of the City of Mill Valley to limit grading operations whenever possible. Grading necessary to construct homes should be confined within the footprint of the home. (Ord. 1182 § 1, April 2, 2002)

 

14.32.012 Findings.
The City Council finds that the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter is made necessary for the following reasons:

The topography in Mill Valley is characterized by densely wooded hillsides. Inadequately controlled grading will result in permanent scarring and excessive erosion.

Also a characteristic of Mill Valley is the high amount of rainfall and excessive runoff. These features, combined with inadequately controlled grading, can increase the possibility of earth slides and poor water qualify from excessive erosion.

 

14.32.020 Authority.
The Director of Public Works, Building Official, or their designees, are authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1182 § 1, April 2, 2002)

 

14.32.030 Grading permit required—Exemptions.
A grading permit shall be required for all excavation, fill or grading.

The following grading activities are exempt from the grading permit requirement:

A.    Where volume of material to be graded or filled does not exceed 50 cubic yards.

B.     Where natural and finished slopes are less than 10%.

C.     Excavations for basements and footings, or piers for a building, retaining wall or other structure authorized by a valid building permit.

D.    Excavations for wells or utilities.

E.     Exploratory excavations prepared under direction of soils engineers or engineering geologists. (Ord. 1182 § 1, April 2, 2002)

 

14.32.040 Design guidelines.
All grading permits shall comply with the provisions of the General Plan and all applicable design guidelines adopted by the City Council. (Ord. 1182 § 1, April 2, 2002)

 

14.32.042 Application.
Applications for a grading permit shall be in a format approved by the Director of Public Works and shall contain sufficient information as required by the Director of Public Works. (Ord. 1182 § 1, April 2, 2002)

 

14.32.044 Adverse soil conditions.
When application is made to any department or agency of the City for an entitlement to improve or develop any real property in an area of suspected soils instability, the City may require that the applicant submit a report of soil investigation prepared by a licensed engineer or geologist whose qualifications are satisfactory to the City. If the report discloses adverse soils conditions, the City may require that as a condition to the issuance of an entitlement to improve or develop real property, there shall be recorded in the office of the County Recorder of the County of Marin a “Notice of Adverse Soils Conditions” in a form satisfactory to the City. (Ord. 1182 § 1, April 2, 2002)

 

14.32.050 Security.
An applicant for a grading permit shall provide security for the performance of the work described and delineated on the approved grading plan and erosion control plans in an amount and form to be approved by the Director of Public Works. The amount of security shall be adequate to cover both the planned work and remedial work which may be required. (Ord. 1182 § 1, April 2, 2002)

 

14.32.060 Erosion control plans required submittals.
A.    Temporary Erosion Control Plans. When determined by the Director of Public Works, the applicant shall submit plans for temporary erosion control for approval. Temporary erosion control plans for the construction period must comply with the guidelines prescribed by the Director of Public Works.

Temporary erosion control plans will be required when any of the following conditions exist.

1.     There is a probability that runoff from graded areas cannot be contained on the subject property.

2.     There is a major water course which will be adversely affected by runoff from the graded area.

Temporary erosion control plans shall be submitted and approved prior to obtaining a grading permit.

The applicant shall be responsible for maintaining temporary erosion control measures to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works at all times. To guarantee conformance to requirements, the Director of Public Works may require appropriate bonding and/or cash deposits.

B.     Permanent Erosion Control Plans. Each grading plan submitted to the City for approval must include provisions for permanent erosion control. Erosion control techniques proposed for the post construction period must be equal to or more effective than the guidelines adopted by the Director of Public Works.

Plans shall include detailed design and installation specifications for both temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control measures. Supporting calculations, including runoff calculations, shall also be submitted. To insure compliance with the approved plans, the Director of Public Works may require appropriate bonding and/or cash deposits. (Ord. 1182 § 1, April 2, 2002)

 

14.32.070 Modifications.
The Director of Public Works may require modification of previously approved plans to accommodate unanticipated conditions on the site. Modifications to a previously approved plan may also be required, if the plan is found to be inadequate, or work does not proceed as scheduled. The Director of Public Works may require the permittee to submit work schedules, contingency plans, or status reports as deemed necessary. The Director of Public Works shall notify permittee in writing of the requirements and specify a reasonable time period for compliance. (Ord. 1182 § 1, April 2, 2002)

 

14.32.080 Rainy season grading.
A.    No grading activity shall take place during the rainy season (October 15th to April 15th) unless a rainy season grading permit has first been obtained from the Director of Public Works. Whether or not grading is permitted during the rainy season, all temporary and permanent erosion control measures shall be in place prior to October 15th. If an ordinary grading permit has been issued, but all work (including all grading, landscaping and erosion control measures) will not be completed by October 1st, the permittee shall submit an application for a rainy season grading permit on or before October 1st. The Director of Public Works may, as a condition of approval for a rainy season grading permit, require submittal of additional financial security in an amount sufficient to ensure performance of all planned and remedial work. A rainy season grading permit may be suspended or revoked as provided in Section 14.32.090, subsection A.

B.     Any party aggrieved by a decision to grant, deny, suspend or revoke a rainy season grading permit may request a hearing before the Director of Public Works by filing a written request within five calendar days after the decision. A hearing date shall be scheduled, and the Director of Public Works shall provide reasonable prior notice to the applicant and to all persons shown on the last equalized assessment roll as owners of real property within 100 feet of the property which is the subject of the application. At the hearing, the applicant and any other interested parties shall have the right to attend and be heard. The hearing shall be conducted by the Director of Public Works, who may affirm, modify or reverse the prior action. The decision of the Director of Public Works shall be final. (Ord. 1144 § 1, April 15, 1996; Ord. 1182 § 1, April 2, 2002)

Chapter 14.35 HAZARD REDUCTION IN UNREINFORCED MASONRY BUILDINGS
14.35.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote public safety and welfare by reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the effects of earthquakes on unreinforced masonry buildings, constructed prior to 1949 (the adoption date of the local building code requiring earthquake resistant design of buildings). Of secondary benefit is the reduction of property damage. Such buildings have been widely recognized for sustaining life-hazardous damage during moderate to strong earthquakes.

The provisions of this chapter are intended as minimum standards for structural seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of life loss or injury. Compliance with these standards will not necessarily prevent earthquake damage to rehabilitated buildings. This chapter does not require alteration of existing electrical, plumbing, mechanical or fire safety systems unless they constitute a hazard to life or property. It is also the City’s intent through the enactment of this chapter to have appropriate City staff work closely with building owners and tenants to minimize economic hardships or interruption of business during the process of bringing buildings into compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

This chapter provides systematic procedures and standards for the identification and classification of unreinforced masonry buildings based upon their present use. Priorities, time periods and standards are also established under which these buildings are required to be structurally analyzed and strengthened. Where the analysis finds deficiencies, this chapter requires the building to be strengthened or demolished.

 

14.35.020 Scope.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all buildings constructed or under construction prior to 1949 (adoption date of the first local earthquake resistant code requirements), or for which a building permit was issued prior to 1949, which on the effective date of this ordinance are of unreinforced masonry construction as defined herein.

EXCEPTION: This division shall not apply to detached one or two family dwellings and detached apartment houses containing less than five dwelling units and used solely for residential purposes.

 

14.35.030 Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter, the applicable definitions in Sections 2302 and 2312 of the 1988 Uniform Building Code shall apply.

For purposes of this chapter, the following additional definitions shall apply:

HIGH RISK BUILDING: Any building having an occupant load of 100 or more as determined herein.

MEDIUM RISK BUILDING: Any building having an occupant load of less than 100 and more than 20.

LOW RISK BUILDING: Any building having an occupant load of 20 or less as determined herein.

OCCUPANT LOAD: The maximum number of persons within a building as determined in accordance with Section 3302 of the 1988 Uniform Building Code. However, the Director of Planning and Building may allow a lower occupant load for a building, if no extraordinary hazard will result and the building is posted for the reduced maximum number of occupants.

QUALIFIED HISTORICAL BUILDING: Any structure or building deemed of importance to the history, architecture, or culture of an area by an appropriate local, state or federal governmental jurisdiction. This shall include designated structures on official existing or future national, state or local historical registers or official inventories, such as the National Register of Historic Places, State Historical Landmarks, State Points of Historical Interest, and parcels to which the City has applied the Historic Overlay Zoning District.

UNREINFORCED MASONRY CONSTRUCTION: A building or structure constructed with unreinforced masonry bearing walls as herein defined or a steel or concrete framed building with unreinforced masonry infilled walls.

UNREINFORCED MASONRY BEARING WALL: A masonry wall having all of the following characteristics:

1.     Provides the vertical support for a floor or roof.

2.     The total superimposed load is over 100 pounds per linear foot.

Chapter 15.06 WILDLAND-URBAN INTERFACE
15.06.010 Justification.
The City Council recognizes that the City of Mill Valley has within its borders and along its boundaries, significant areas of grass, brush and heavily forested lands. These hazardous conditions present an exceptional and continuing fire danger to the residents of the community due to the difficulty of the terrain and topography of the area, much of it consisting of boxed canyons with steep, brush-covered slopes; narrow winding streets used by residents of the area and the Fire Department for ingress and egress; steep hills which hinder Fire Department response time; older and inadequate water systems in certain areas of the community; and the location of buildings and structures with relation to these dangerous areas.

The City Council also recognizes that a great number of structures located within the City of Mill Valley were built in the late 1800s and early 1900s, thus lacking the built-in protection of modern construction. Many of the residential structures had been built on steep slopes with boxed canyons and large percentages are located in areas of heavy natural growth. Many structures (new and old) are constructed of highly combustible material, which offer little resistance to fire and could contribute to the spread of fire.

The City Council also recognizes the fact that the community has been plagued many times in the late 1800s and early 1900s by brush and forest fires which not only threaten destruction, but on a number of occasions devastated large portions of the town. The desire of the community to preserve natural vegetation has resulted in the encroachment of brush and grass on fire roads, trails, breaks and streets within the City, thus rendering such separations ineffective against the spread of fires. Natural growth, which is highly flammable during the drier months of the year, encroaches upon many properties, thus posing a potential fire threat to many structures and creating a substantial hindrance to the control of such fires.

The City Council recognizes that, in the event that the Fire Department is called to respond to a fire emergency in any of these areas, its response time to an emergency is increased by reason of the difficulties herein stated. In recognition thereof and acting pursuant to California Health and Safety Code Sections 17958.5 and 17958.7, the City Council finds that the fire protection requirements of this ordinance as such requirements modify state required regulations adopted pursuant to the California Health and Safety Code Section 17922 are hereby reasonably necessary because of local climatic, geological and topographical conditions.

 

15.06.020 Adoption of the International Urban-Wildland Interface Code.
A certain document, one copy of which is on file in the office of the Fire Marshal of the City of Mill Valley Fire Department, being marked and designated as the International Urban-Wildland Interface Code, 2006 edition, including Appendix Chapter A, as published by the International Code Council, is hereby adopted as the Urban-Wildland Interface Code of the City of Mill Valley in the State of California for regulating and governing the mitigation of hazard to life and property from the intrusion of fire from wildland exposures, fire from adjacent structures and prevention of structure fires from spreading to wildland fuels as herein provided; and further providing for the issuance of permits and collection of fees therefor; and each and all of the regulations, provisions, penalties, conditions and terms of said Urban-Wildland Interface Code on file in the office of the Fire Marshal of the Mill Valley Fire Department are hereby referred to, adopted, and made a part hereof, as if fully set out in this ordinance, with the additions, insertions, deletions and changes, if any, prescribed in Section 2 of this ordinance of which Code not less than one copy is filed in the office of the Fire Chief and Chief Building Official of the City of Mill Valley, and the same are hereby adopted and incorporated as fully as if set out at length herein, and from the date on which this chapter shall take effect, the provision thereof shall be controlling within the limits of the City of Mill Valley.

Application for the special sewer connection permit shall be made to the Planning and Building Department. The application shall disclose the nature of the use to be conducted on the premises and the sewage estimated to be generated therefrom.

B.     The application shall be heard by the Planning Commission and shall be granted only if the Planning Commission makes the following findings:

1.     That the proposed use is consistent with the provisions of the adopted Mill Valley General Plan;

2.     That the proposed use will promote the implementation of the adopted Mill Valley General Plan in an orderly fashion by not creating an imbalance or improper distribution among various land uses authorized by the General Plan;

3.     That if the proposed use is residential in character, it will promote that portion of the housing element of the adopted Mill Valley General Plan which attempts to make provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community;

4.     That the proposed use will promote the goals of the adopted Mill Valley General Plan as a basis for the efficient expenditure of City funds relating to the subjects of the General Plan.

If the City Council, the Planning Commission or the Planning and Building Department has undertaken a review of the adopted Mill Valley General Plan with the view of amending the same, and in connection therewith the City Council has adopted a resolution setting forth goals and objectives to be achieved by such amendments, then the Planning Commission, in making the findings hereinabove set forth, shall consider such goals and objectives in addition to the provisions of the adopted Mill Valley General Plan.

C.     An application for a special sewer connection permit may be heard and considered by the Planning Commission at the time the Planning Commission initially considers an application for a variance, a conditional use permit, a tentative subdivision map, a Planned Unit Development, an R-P zoning district development, or a special development permit for a Planned Development Combining District. At such time, or thereafter, the Planning Commission may, in its discretion, defer issuance of the special sewer connection permit for the project or may issue the same on the condition that the permit shall be effective for a period fixed by the Planning Commission, not to exceed one year. The Planning Commission may extend the effective period of the special sewer connection permit for good cause. In determining whether to issue a special sewer connection permit upon initial consideration of the above matters or to defer such matter, the Planning Commission shall consider, in addition to the matters set forth in subsection B of this section, the remaining uncommitted capacity of the City’s sewage treatment plant, the comparative importance of the proposed project and other projects pending before the City in implementing the goals of the Mill Valley General Plan, and the time and investment required to bring the project to the point where construction may commence.

D.    Except when issued for a longer period pursuant to the provisions of subsection C of this section, any special sewer connection permit issued hereunder shall be effective for a period of six months. During the effective period of any special sewer connection permit, the premises shall be entitled to issuance of a permit under the provisions of Section 17.04.110.

E.     Any premises for which a building permit application accompanied by building plans was on file with the building division on July 1, 1974, which building permit could be issued by the administrative staff without prior Planning Commission approval, shall have sewer connection rights reserved to it for a period of six months after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section. Upon issuance of a building permit for such premises within said six months and performance of all other prerequisite conditions, such premises shall be entitled to issuance of a permit under the provisions of Section 17.04.110.

F.     Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Planning Commission on an application for a special sewer connection permit may, within 10 days thereof, appeal the decision in writing to the City Council. The City Council shall hear such appeal and act thereon within 30 days following the filing thereof.

G.    Nothing contained in this section shall relieve the applicant from the obligation to pay all rates, charges and fees required by, and comply with, all other provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 825 § 2, August 5, 1974)

 

17.04.160 Septic tank—Permit—Plans—Maintenance.
When a public sewer is not available under the provision of Section 17.04.150, application may be made to the Building/Zoning Code Inspector for connection to a private septic tank. The application shall be accompanied by three sets of construction plans and specifications complying with septic tank standards set forth in ordinances of the County of Marin and the laws of the State of California. Such plans and specifications shall be forwarded by the Building/Zoning Code Inspector to the health officer of the County of Marin for report and recommendation. Such report shall include a recommendation concerning the length of leeching line required, and the number of fixture units for which designed. The applicant shall supply any other information (including, but not limited to, soil percolation tests) that may be required by such health officer. Upon receipt of the report and recommendation of such health officer, they shall be submitted to the City Council. No septic tank permit shall be issued until approved by the City Council. A plan inspection fee of $100.00 and an installation inspection fee of $80.00 shall be paid for the issuance of a septic tank permit. In addition, any fees imposed by the Marin County Health Department shall be paid by the permittee.

Septic tanks shall be constructed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications and shall be subject to inspection by the health officer of the County of Marin and Director of Public Works of the City of Mill Valley. A septic tank shall not become the property of the City but shall remain the private property and responsibility of the owner of the property served. The owner shall maintain the same in a safe and satisfactory operating condition in accordance with the ordinances of the City, the septic tank standards of County of Marin, and the laws of the State of California.

Upon being advised by the Marin County Health Department that any septic tank within the City has become overloaded or that proposed enlargement of the building served will result in overloading the septic tank, the City may require abandonment, alteration or repair of the septic tank to correct such condition. Furthermore, when a City-owned sewer line is extended to within 400 feet of any extremity of any property upon which is situated a building served by a septic tank, the building shall be connected to such sewer line as required by Section 17.04.150 and use of the septic tank shall be abandoned within 12 months after written notice by the Director of Public Works. (Ord. 514; Ord. 550; Ord. 733; Ord. 800 § 1, July 2, 1973; Ord. 1078 § 3, May 2, 1988)

 

17.04.170 Property outside City—Connection to City system—When allowed.
The sewage collection and disposal system of the City has been designed for benefit of properties within the City limits. Therefore, the City will not permit properties outside the City limits to connect to the system except as hereinafter set forth:

The City Council may, in its discretion, permit the connection, on a permanent basis, of properties outside the City limits for any of the following reasons:

A.    The property cannot be legally annexed to the City, but a connection to the sewer is necessary to alleviate a public health nuisance as reported by the County Health Officer, City Engineer, and City Manager.

B.     The property can be legally annexed to the City, but, in the opinion of the City Council, annexation to the City is premature at this time. In allowing the connection, the City may require the applicant to sign and record an agreement stating that the applicant will agree to annexation to the City at such time as annexation is proposed in the future.

Any property permitted to connect to the City collection and disposal system shall be disconnected from the septic system upon the last day of any fiscal year during which the City Council orders such disconnection. The owner shall be notified at least 30 days prior to the end of such fiscal year. The cost of such disconnection shall be collected on the tax roll in the manner set forth in Section 17.04.180. (Ord. 514 § 8; Ord. 550; Ord. 800; Ord. 1027 § 1, October 1, 1984)

17.04.180 Properties outside City—Service charge for City system connection.
All properties outside the City of Mill Valley which are or shall be connected to the City sewer system, in addition to all other fees provided for in this chapter, shall be charged a monthly sewer service charge in an amount prescribed by resolution to be adopted by the City Council; provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to outside connections when the same are served by a sanitary district or other public agency which has made arrangements with the City of Mill Valley for an alternate means of compensating the City for such sewer service, and when such service is provided by lines which are the property of the same sanitary district or public agency. The monthly service charge shall be paid in advance to the beginning of the next fiscal year, and thereafter collection of the service charge shall be made on the tax roll as hereinafter provided. (Ord. 514; Ord. 544; Ord. 550; Ord. 560; Ord. 733; Ord. 800 § 1, July 2, 1973)

 

17.04.190 Waiver of fees.
No facilities or services of the sewer system shall be furnished to any premises or to any owner or other person free of charge; provided, however, that the City Council may waive all or a portion of the fees and charges provided for in this title when the City Council determines that the fees and charges are for a project which falls within the “public purpose” exception to the limitations contained in Section 6 of Article XVI of the California Constitution. (Ord. 800 § 1, July 2, 1973; Ord. 1078 § 6, May 2, 1988)

 

17.04.210 Service to individual parcels.
Separate premises under single control or management shall be furnished the facilities and services of the sewer system through separate individual service connections unless the Council elects otherwise. Separate houses or buildings on the same lot, or on adjoining lots, under a single control or management shall be furnished the facilities and services, at the option of the owner exercising such control or management, by either of the following methods:

A.    Through separate service connections to each such house or building; or

B.     Through a single service connection to supply all such houses and buildings, in which case one connection charge and one monthly service charge shall be applied for each house or building and the responsibility for payment of charges for all facilities and service furnished shall be assumed by the owner having such control or management. (Ord. 800 § 2, July 2, 1973)

 

17.04.220 Termination of service.
When any premises become unusable as a result of a natural disaster, condemnation or for other cause, or when any premises have been disconnected from the sewer system, the applicable minimum monthly service charge shall be terminated. Any premises which are vacant but which continue to be usable and are connected to the sewer system shall continue to be subject to the applicable minimum monthly service charge. (Ord. 800 § 2, July 2, 1973; Ord. 811 § 1, March 4, 1974)

 

17.04.240 Persons responsible for payment.
The persons responsible for payment of all charges shall be the owner of record of such premises on the date on which such premises are required to connect to the City sewer system, the successor in interest to such person and any person requesting that such bill be charged to him or her. (Ord. 800 § 2, July 2, 1973)

 

17.04.250 Effective date of sewer service charges.
Sewer service charges shall become effective against all premises immediately upon connection or within 30 days from the time that a connection to the City sewer system could be made as provided herein, whichever is the earliest. (Ord. 800 § 2, July 2, 1973)

 

17.04.260 Sub-main and main sewers—Construction plans—Inspection—Permit issuance.
The Building/Zoning Code Inspector shall require every applicant for a permit to construct, install, extend or alter a sub-main or main sewer, to file plans and specifications therefor in such detail as the City Engineer may direct unless such plans and specifications have been previously prepared by the City Engineer. The design and construction of such sewers shall comply with the latest edition of the “City of Mill Valley Standards for Sanitary Sewers.”

Upon receipt of plans and specifications the Building/Zoning Code Inspector shall forward the same to the City Engineer who shall examine them and render a written report and recommendation to the City Council. The City Council may make such changes therein and impose such additional conditions in relation to the work as it deems proper. At the time of the consideration of such plans and specifications by the City Council the applicant shall present to the City a properly executed grant of easement for such sewer covering that portion of the sewer which is to be constructed outside the rights-of-way of City accepted streets. Such grant of easement shall be subject to the approval of the City Attorney and shall be accompanied by a title report evidencing the authority of the grantor to convey the same. The City Council may require the applicant to provide, at his or her own expense, a policy of title insurance in such amount as the Council may direct.

Upon receiving final approval of the application from the City Council, the Building/Zoning Code Inspector shall issue a permit for the work upon receiving from the applicant a satisfactory performance bond (as estimated by the City Engineer) to secure proper construction of the work.

The work of construction on such sewers shall be subject to inspection by the City Engineer, and no work shall be covered or concealed until the City Engineer has inspected and approved the same. No sub-main or main sewer shall be connected to the City system until all the work has been installed and the installation thereof inspected, found to be in strict accordance with the approved plans and specifications and approved by the City Engineer. Upon final completion the applicant shall file an as-built plan showing the location and details of the line. The applicant shall maintain the line for one year from the date of formal acceptance by the City Council and a maintenance bond shall be posted in an amount specified by the City Engineer to secure such maintenance. The applicant for a permit under this section shall pay to the City a fee equal to the actual cost of engineering services provided by the City, but in no event less than $150.00. (Ord. 514; Ord. 536; Ord. 550; Ord. 576; Ord. 616; Ord. 733; Ord. 800; Ord. 1078 § 4, May 2, 1988)

 

17.04.270 Construction, use and maintenance of private sewer laterals.
A.    Findings. The City finds and determines that I & I is a serious problem for the City in that during heavy rains a significant amount of water is introduced into the City’s system as a result of I & I from breaches in the entire pipeline system that leads to the Sewerage Agency of Southern Marin treatment facility. The I & I is introduced into the City’s pipelines and sewer mains from the sewer laterals or unpermitted drainage structures leading from a property to the City’s sewer mains. As a result of I & I, the City sewer treatment facilities have the potential to become overburdened during periods of heavy rains leading to sewage overflows and possible spills into the waters of Richardson Bay. Such overflows and spills can lead not only to significant fines and penalties against the City by state and federal water regulatory agencies, but may pose a significant risk to the environment, and the health and safety of the public at large. The City has determined that it is in the public interest to address I & I contributed by private sewer laterals and, as such, it is a City priority to authorize the enforcement of the upgrade and repair of private sewer laterals.

B.     New Construction Private Sewer Laterals. All new buildings shall have installed a new private sewer lateral. A minimum four-inch lateral shall serve single or duplex residential dwelling units. A minimum six-inch lateral shall be installed to serve buildings with three or more residential units, and industrial and commercial buildings. Construction shall conform to City standards.

C.     Connection Permits. Prior to constructing a lateral, the owner shall apply for and obtain a connection permit from the City. The application shall include a plan showing the location of the lateral and the proposed repair or replacement, and all buildings, other utilities, significant features and topography of the property and showing the public right-of-way or easement in which the lateral and the City sewer are located, and the proposed connection of the lateral to the City’s sewer.

D.    Illegal Connections to Private Sewer Lateral. It shall be illegal for a licensed contractor or owner to connect the following to a private sewer lateral: storm drains, roof drains, pool drains, or non-sewage pipes or drains. Violation of this subsection D is punishable under subsections M and O.

E.     Ownership, Maintenance and Repair of Private Sewer Laterals.

1.     Private sewer laterals shall be owned, maintained and repaired by the owner of the property, which the lateral serves. The entire lateral, from the building connection to and including the “wye” connection or other-tie-in to the sewer main, shall fall within the owner’s responsibility for installation, maintenance and repair.

2.     Each property owner shall, at the property owner’s expense, inspect, maintain in good working order, repair and replace, as necessary, the private sewer lateral so that it does not cause or contribute to any sewage overflow from either the private sewer lateral or the public sewer. The private sewer lateral shall be free of displaced joints, open joints, root intrusion, substantial deterioration of the line, cracks, leaks, inflow, infiltration of extraneous water, fats, oils and grease, sediment deposits or any other similar conditions, defects or obstructions likely to cause or contribute to blockage of the private sewer lateral or the public sewer. The owner shall perform such duties as may be required in response to observed overflows or seepage attributable to the lateral, or as discovered by smoke testing, televising or other surveys of the lateral. Where such maintenance requires excavation or replacement of existing sewer facilities, the owner shall apply for and receive a connection permit from the City.

F.     Mandatory Inspections.

1.     Health and Safety Basis for Requiring a Private Sewer Lateral Inspection. An owner shall have the private sewer lateral of his or her real property inspected in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, as directed and within the time period indicated by the City Engineer (or any designated representative thereof, collectively referred to in this section as the “City Engineer”) upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

a.     Overflow or Malfunction. Whenever the City Engineer determines that the private sewer lateral has recently overflowed or has recently malfunctioned.

b.     Lateral Failure or Lack of Maintenance. Whenever the City Engineer finds that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the private sewer lateral has failed, is likely to fail, or has not been properly maintained.

c.     Public Health Threat. Upon any other reasonable cause to believe that there is a threat to the public health, safety, or welfare due to the condition of a private sewer lateral.

d.     Age of Pipes or Extent of Foliage Causing Higher Flow Within the Service Area. Whenever the City Engineer determines that the age of pipes (clay, plastic or other material) in combination with observed foliage (tree roots near the private sewer lateral suggesting root intrusion causing infiltration) or the age of the pipes independently are causing a higher than average flow in a neighborhood or area, the City Engineer may direct an inspection of the private sewer lateral to determine the need for repair.

2.     Events Requiring a Private Sewer Lateral Inspection. An owner shall have the private sewer lateral of his or her property inspected in accordance with the requirements of this section upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

a.     Additions and Improvements. Prior to the issuance of a City building permit for a building addition or new improvements on the real property where said addition or improvements (or cumulative additions or improvements through multiple projects over the prior three years) have a value of $50,000.00 or greater.

b.     Transfer of Property Title. Prior to transfer of title upon the sale of any real property, the owner shall provide to the City Engineer an inspection report (as specified in subsection H of this section) of the private sewer lateral; provided, however, that in the event such inspection report is not provided to the City Engineer prior to transfer of property title, the buyer of the property shall be responsible for providing the inspection report within 30 days after the transfer, and shall be responsible for any needed repairs identified by such inspection. Failure of the buyer to comply with this regulation is punishable in accordance with subsection M of this section. Prior to transfer of title, the owner must disclose in writing to the buyer that the City requires inspection and repair of the sewer lateral in accordance with this chapter. This subsection (F)(2)(b) shall not apply to the sale of real property in a common interest development.

c.     City Work. Upon written notice from the City that the City will perform work that includes asphalt concrete overlay, road reconstruction or roadwork of a similar scope directly above any portion of private sewer lateral that connects to the sewer main, the owner shall conduct an inspection of the lateral as directed and within the time period indicated by the City Engineer.

3.     Exception to Inspection for Recent Prior Inspections and Repairs. The following exceptions do not apply to any inspection required under paragraph 1. The following are exceptions to the inspection requirements of paragraph 2 as indicated.

a.     Prior Replacement of Lateral. An owner otherwise required to perform a private sewer lateral inspection under paragraph 2 shall not be required to perform such an inspection if the owner (or the owner’s predecessor-in-interest) has originally installed or has replaced his or her property’s lateral within the 20 years prior to the date of the application for a building permit, listing the property for sale or the road work or sewer repair.

 

b.     Prior Inspection or Repair of a Lateral. An owner otherwise required to perform an inspection under paragraph 2 shall not be required to perform such an inspection if the owner has either completed an inspection (conducted in accordance with the inspection requirements of this section) or completed a permitted repair of the lateral within the three years prior to the date the inspection would otherwise be required.

The owner shall bear the burden of proving that the inspection requirements of paragraph 2 do not apply. The owner shall provide proof of any prior replacement, inspection or repair of a private sewer lateral in the form of a certificate, a paid bill or any documentation that ensures such prior replacement, repair or inspection of a private sewer lateral occurred pursuant to exception a or b above. The form and content of the document or proof must be deemed sufficient by the City Engineer.

4.     This subsection F shall apply to any structure which has a private sewer lateral.

5.     Any owner may request an administrative review pursuant to subsection R, regarding the propriety of an inspection required by this section, by filing a written notice of appeal with the City Manager no later than 30 days after receiving written notice of the need to perform an inspection.

6.     When an owner refuses to provide an inspection required by this subsection F, the City may conduct a televised inspection and owner shall be responsible for the costs of such inspection. Should the City’s inspection reveal the need for repairs, the City may issue a notice of repair to the owner and require any of the remedies provided in subsection I of this section to ensure repairs are made and costs are paid.

G.    Access to Properties for Private Sewer Lateral Inspections.

1.     The City Engineer may inspect laterals for the following purposes:

a.     To determine the size, depth, and location of any sewer connection.

b.     To determine the end outlet of any sewer connection by depositing harmless testing materials in any plumbing fixture attached thereto and flushing the same, if necessary.

c.     To determine, by measurements and samples, the quantity and nature of the sewage or wastewater being discharged into any sewer.

d.     To determine the location of the roof, swimming pool, floor and surface drains, and whether or not they physically connect to a sewer.

e.     To assess the condition of the lateral where the City Engineer reasonably suspects that the lateral may be allowing inflow or infiltration.

2.     The City Engineer is authorized to enter upon any property or premises within the City to ascertain whether the property or premises is in compliance with this chapter and to perform a sewer lateral inspection as authorized by this chapter. All such entries and inspections shall be done in a lawful and reasonable manner. If an owner, lawful occupant, or the respective agent thereof refuses permission to enter and inspect, the City Engineer may seek an administrative inspection warrant pursuant to the procedures provided by California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1822.50 through 1822.59, as may be amended from time to time, or the successor provisions thereto.

 

H.    Lateral Inspection Report—Requirements.

1.     City Standards and Specifications. The City Engineer shall establish standards and specifications (the “standards and specifications”) for the condition, maintenance and repair of private sewer laterals and for the preparation of the lateral inspection report.

2.     Inspection Report Standards. A lateral inspection report shall be prepared in accordance with the standards and specifications and include the following.

a.     The inspection report shall be prepared by a licensed plumber who shall declare under penalty of perjury that the report is true and correct.

b.     The inspection report shall identify all of the following:

i.      Any and all defects that could allow infiltration into the lateral or otherwise create a maintenance issue in the City sewer system.

ii.     Whether any connection, by pipes or otherwise, allows rainwater or groundwater to enter the private sewer lateral or public sewer.

iii.    Whether the private sewer lateral has an installed backwater device where any outlet or trap of the private sewer lateral is below the level of the nearest manhole. If a backwater device is already installed, the report shall indicate whether the backwater device is functioning properly.

iv.    Any other facts regarding the condition, maintenance and repair of the lateral as required by the standards and specifications.

c.     The report shall contain an express certification that the property has been inspected for any outdoor drain connection to the City sewer system and that no such unpermitted lateral exists. A licensed plumber who prepares a false lateral inspection report shall be subject to punishment under subsection M of this section in addition to any other legal remedies or punishment provided by law.

I.      Private Sewer Laterals—Required Repairs.

1.     Notice to Repair. Upon receipt of the lateral inspection report pursuant to this chapter, the City Engineer will determine whether it indicates any deficiencies in the operation of the private sewer lateral and, thereafter, shall provide the owner with a notice to repair as may be deemed appropriate by the Engineer. The City Engineer shall provide the determination and issue a notice to repair within three business days after receipt of the inspection report. The notice to repair shall specifically identify the deficiencies to be corrected and shall establish a deadline of 180 days, within which the owner shall complete the required corrective actions. The corrective action may include a requirement that the lateral be replaced altogether and also may include the installation of cleanouts and backwater valves if those devices are otherwise required by the standards and specifications.

2.     Obligations of the Owner. The owner shall complete all corrective action to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, and, if a building permit is required for the repairs, the owner shall obtain the requisite building permit and a final permit inspection and approval of the relevant building official.

3.     Appeals. Any owner who receives a notice to repair may request an administrative review, pursuant to subsection R, regarding the accuracy of the determination or the propriety of any corrective action required by the City Engineer, by filing a written notice of appeal with the City Manager no later than 30 days after receipt of the notice to repair.

4.     Repairs to Improper Connections Consisting of Multiple Private Connections to a Common Lateral. A private sewer lateral serving more than one residential dwelling, except as provided for in subsection K, is an improper connection and shall be repaired or replaced as deemed appropriate by the City Engineer. The owner of each affected residential dwelling shall be responsible for disconnecting their private sewer lateral from the common lateral and connecting to the nearest sewer main.

5.     Failure to Repair. Should an owner fail to conduct the required repairs within the time required by the notice to repair, the City may pursue the following to ensure that the repair or replacement is completed:

a.     Public Nuisance. Whenever the City Engineer believes a public nuisance exists as a result of inadequate, improper or negligent operation or maintenance of any private sewer lateral or appurtenance thereto which may endanger public health and safety, the City Engineer shall commence abatement proceedings pursuant to Chapter 8.04 of this Code, including, but not limited to, recovery of the costs of abatement.

b.     Disconnection of Private Sewer Lateral to Sewer Main. The City shall have the right to commence proceedings in Marin Superior Court to seek a court order disconnecting the private sewer lateral from the sewer main, thus leaving the home, building or industrial facility without sewer service. The City shall have the right to recover its attorney fees and costs for the pursuit of disconnection.

J.      Common Interest Developments. The homeowners association of a common interest development shall, along with the owner, be jointly and severally liable for the duties and obligations imposed by this chapter in relation to any private sewer lateral located within a common area of the common interest development. If no homeowners association exists, then the individual unit owners shall be jointly and severally liable for the duties and obligations with respect to private sewer laterals established by this chapter.

K.    Private Sewer Laterals—Multiple Connections. One private sewer lateral may serve two or more homes provided that the City Engineer determines the following: (1) the shared sewer lateral existed on or before January 1, 2015; and (2) the shared sewer lateral is functioning properly. The owners of the residences served by the shared sewer lateral shall jointly be responsible for any repairs. Where multiple residential connections are allowed to one private sewer lateral, the City encourages the homeowners to enter into a maintenance agreement between all of the homeowners sharing the private lateral to ensure that there is a mechanism in place to pay for required repairs and/or replacement of the private sewer lateral. In general terms, a common method is to proportion the costs of the maintenance, repair or replacement among the homeowners sharing the lateral. For example, homeowners upstream of the shared-lateral section requiring rehabilitation would proportion their costs relative to the length of the shared lateral which serves their home divided by the length of the entire shared lateral. The relative percentage may vary along the pipe depending on the number of connections upstream of the repair. In the event that the City Engineer determines that the shared sewer lateral is not functioning properly, the City may require the construction of a new private service lateral for each residential single family home or the construction of a new larger private service lateral to accommodate the multiple residences. Owners that are part of a multiple lateral connection are not subject to the transfer of property title requirement in subsection (F)(2)(b).

L.     Prohibited Discharges. No person shall discharge or deposit, or cause or allow to be discharged or deposited into the City sewer system any wastewater which contains any of the following: cooking grease, beyond a quality incidental to typical household production whether emulsified or not, waste automotive radiator coolant, explosive mixtures, radioactive wastes, solid or viscous wastes which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer pipeline, including cleansing wipes or “flushable” wipes, any toxic substances in excess of the United States Environmental Protection Agency standards pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Clean Water Act, or any other substances which may interfere with the biological processes of the wastewater system, and petroleum products of any kind.

M.    Punishment for Violation of this Chapter. Failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter shall be punishable pursuant to Chapter 8.02 Administrative Code Enforcement Remedies and Chapter 8.03 Criminal Prosecution, of this Code.

N.    Damage to City Sewer System. It is unlawful for any person to maliciously, willfully, or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment that is part of the City sewer system. Any violation of this subsection shall be punishable under subsection M and any violation may constitute other crimes under the California Penal Code or the United States Codes.

O.    Punishment—Contractors. Should a contractor make any connections in violation of subsection D of this section, the contractor shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of subsection M of this section and the City shall report such a contractor to the State Licensing Board.

P.     Assistance Programs. The City Council may establish by resolution one or more programs to assist owners with private sewer lateral repair or replacement.

Q.    Fees. The City Council may from time to time establish, by resolution, fees for issuing permits, performing inspections, reviewing reports and other activities of the City performed pursuant to this chapter.

R.     Appeals. A written notice of appeal must include all facts supporting the appeal and any statements and evidence, including copies of all written documentation and a list of any witnesses, that the appellant wishes to be considered in connection with the appeal. The appeal will be heard by the City Manager. The City Manager will conduct a hearing concerning the appeal within 45 days from the date that the notice of appeal is filed, or on a later date if agreed upon by the appellant and the City Manager, and will give the appellant 10 days’ prior written notice of the date of the hearing. The City Manager may, by providing a written decision, sustain, rescind, or modify the prior determination being appealed. The written decision of the City Manager is final and effective on the date of service of the written decision on the appellant, is not subject to further administrative review, and constitutes the final administrative decision. (Ord. 514 § 11; Ord. 536; Ord. 733; Ord. 800; Ord. 811; Ord. 1078 § 5, May 2, 1988; Ord. 1270 § 12, March 2, 2015)

 

17.04.280 Work about existing sewers.
Any person who undertakes to pave, resurface, regrade or do any work on any street or highway in territory within the City of Mill Valley shall not cover up or conceal any manhole, rodhole or lamphole and/or their covers. Every care must be used to protect such facilities.

Whenever it becomes necessary to raise, lower, change or reset any such casting, the party undertaking such work will be held responsible for the proper reinstallation. Such reinstallation must be done in a thorough workmanlike manner, resetting all castings in a concrete base to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works.

Any dirt, brick or other objectionable material, that by accident or design has fallen into the sewer or manhole, must be removed at once and the sewer left clear and in working order. (Ord. 514; Ord. 800 § 1, July 2, 1973)

 

17.04.290 Solid waste disposal.
No person shall permit garbage, fruit, vegetable, animal or other solid kitchen waste material to be thrown or deposited into any receptacle connected with a sanitary sewer; provided, however, that such materials from dwelling units and from restaurants, hotels, cafés, cafeterias, hospitals, rest homes, boarding houses, clubs and establishments where food or drink is prepared for consumption on the premises, may be admitted to the sanitary sewer if first passed through a mechanically operated grinder disposal that will grind the materials into particles, so that at least 40% shall pass a number eight sieve, at least 65% shall pass a number three sieve, and 100% shall pass a one-half inch U.S. Standard sieve, simultaneously with the flow of not less than two gallons of water per minute, or such additional quantity of water as may be required to cause the ground materials to flow readily through the sewer system.

No garbage grinder disposal unit shall be installed or used with any set of restaurant, commercial or industrial sinks served by a single trap. Each such garbage grinder disposal unit shall be connected to a separate trap. (Ord. 800 § 2, July 2, 1973)

 

17.04.300 High-strength sewage.
Sewage which exceeds a strength of 300 milligrams per liter in suspended solids, or 300 milligrams per liter in biochemical oxygen demand, shall be deemed high-strength sewage. (Ord. 800 § 2, July 2, 1973)

 

17.04.310 Trailer waste and septic tank waste.
Liquid wastes from the holding tanks of trailers, campers or other recreational vehicles and septic tank sludge shall be discharged at a designated location within the City of Mill Valley treatment plant facilities. (Ord. 800 § 2, July 2, 1973)

Such activities shall include, but not be limited to, ownership and use of parking lots, gasoline stations, industrial facilities, restaurants and other commercial facilities, ground disturbing activities, and businesses fronting city streets.

A.    Littering. Except for pollutants lawfully disposed of by way of containers or at a licensed disposal site, no person shall throw, deposit, leave, maintain, keep, or permit to be thrown, deposited, placed, left, kept or maintained, any solid waste, refuse, rubbish, garbage, or other discarded or abandoned objects, articles, and accumulations, in or upon any street, alley, sidewalk, storm drain, inlet, catch basin, conduit or other drainage structures, business place, or upon any public or private lot of land in the City, so that the same might be or become a pollutant discharged to water.

The occupant or tenant, or in the absence of occupant or tenant, the owner, lessee, or proprietor of any real property of any premises in the City in front of which there is a paved sidewalk shall maintain said sidewalk free of dirt or litter to the maximum extent practicable. Sweepings from said sidewalk shall not be swept or otherwise made or allowed to go into the gutter or roadway, but shall be disposed of in receptacles maintained on said real property as required for the recycling or disposal of solid waste.

B.     Standard for Parking Lots and Similar Structures. Persons owning or operating a parking lot, gas station area of pavement or similar structure shall clean those structures as frequently and thoroughly as practicable in a manner that does not result in discharge of pollutants to the City storm drain system or watercourse.

C.     Construction-Phase Best Management Practices.

1.     Any person performing construction activities in the City shall implement appropriate BMPs to prevent the discharge of construction wastes or contaminations, including gas and oils, from construction materials, tools and equipment from entering the storm drain system or watercourse.

2.     All construction plans and applications for construction activity submitted to the City shall consider the potential for erosion and sedimentation at the construction site, and shall include appropriate erosion and sedimentation controls.

3.     Construction-phase BMPs include erosion and sediment controls and pollution prevention practices. Erosion control BMPs may include, but are not limited to, scheduling and timing of grading activities, timely revegetation of graded areas, the use of hydroseed and hydraulic mulches, and installation of erosion control blankets. Sediment control may include properly sized detention basins, dams, or filters to reduce entry of suspended sediment into the storm drain system and watercourses, and installation of construction entrances to prevent tracking of sediment onto adjacent streets. Pollution prevention practices may include designated washout areas or facilities, control of trash and recycled materials, tarping of materials stored on-site, and proper location of and maintenance of temporary sanitary facilities. The combination of BMPs used, and their execution in the field, must be customized to the site using up-to-date standards and practices. The agency will provide references to current guidance manuals and BMP information on request.

4.     The City has the authority to review designs and proposals for construction activities to determine whether adequate BMPs will be installed, implemented, and maintained during construction and after final stabilization.

5.     Financial security may be required to ensure that temporary measures to control stormwater pollution are implemented and maintained during construction and after construction for a period determined by the agency. Financial security may include but not be limited to an irrevocable letter of credit, cash deposit, certificate of deposit or performance bond as determined by the agency.

6.     When any work is being done contrary to the provisions of this chapter, the authorized enforcement official may order the work stopped by notice in writing served on any persons engaged in doing or causing the work to be done. Such work shall stop until the authorized enforcement official authorizes the work to proceed. This remedy is in addition to and does not supersede or limit any and all other remedies, both civil and criminal provided in the City of Mill Valley Municipal Code.

7.     When required by the Phase II Stormwater Permit or by the authorized enforcement official, a project shall have an erosion and sediment control plan (ESCP) which addresses erosion and sediment control and pollution prevention during the construction phase as well as final stabilization control measures. The ESCP and the specific control measures to be utilized shall be subject to the review and approval of the City. The ESCP shall be implemented year round and shall be revised to reflect changing conditions on the project site. The City shall require modifications of an approved ESCP if during the course of construction at a site unanticipated conditions occur or the plans prove inadequate for the intended purpose. Revisions of the approved ESCP shall be submitted to the City for review and approval. An erosion and sediment control plan (ESCP) shall be required for any project:

a.     Subject to a grading permit under Chapter 14.32 Grading;

b.     Subject to a building permit or other permit that has the potential for significant erosion and/or significant non-stormwater discharges of sediment and/or construction site waste;

c.     Any other project as required by the authorized enforcement official considering factors such as whether the project involves hillside soil disturbance, rainy season construction, construction near a creek or an intermittent or ephemeral drainageway, or any other condition or construction site activity that could lead to a non-stormwater discharge to a storm drain if not managed by effective implementation of an ESCP.

8.     The ESCP shall be submitted for review and approval by the authorized enforcement official. The project applicant shall follow the most recent version of the MCSTOPPP construction erosion and sediment control plan applicant package to prepare the ESCP. At a minimum, the ESCP shall include:

a.     Description of the proposed project and soil disturbing activity;

b.     Site specific construction-phase best management practices (BMPs);

c.     Rationale for selecting the BMPs;

d.     List of applicable outside agency permits associated with the soil disturbing activity, such as: Construction General Permit (CGP); Clean Water Act Section 404 Permit; Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certification; Streambed/Lake Alteration Agreement (1600 Agreements).

9.     Implementation of an approved ESCP shall be a condition of the issuance of a building permit, a grading permit, or other permit issued by the City for a project subject to this section. The ESCP shall be implemented year round and must be updated to reflect changing conditions on the project site. Any modifications to the ESCP shall be submitted to the City for review and approval.

10.   For projects subject to the State’s General Construction Permit (CGP), project applicants may submit a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) developed pursuant to the CGP in lieu of submitting an ESCP.

11.   Grading operations shall not be conducted during the rainy season (October 15th through April 15th) without prior approval from the City. Such approval shall only be given upon clear demonstration, to the satisfaction of the City, that at no stage of the work will there be any substantial risk of sediment discharge from the site. When grading operations are permitted during the rainy season, a phasing plan and work schedule shall be required to ensure that the smallest practical area of erodible land is exposed at any one time and the time of exposure is minimized. The phasing plan and work schedule must be approved by the City as part of the ESCP prior to the start of grading or prior to October 1st at the discretion of the City.

D.    Permanent Best Management Practices for New Development and Redevelopment. The City may require, as a condition of project approval, permanent controls designed to remove sediment and other pollutants and to mimic the pre-project site hydrology by controlling the flow rates and/or the volume of stormwater runoff from the project’s added and/or replaced impervious surfaces. These controls may include limits on impervious area. The selection and design of such controls shall be in general accordance with criteria established or recommended by federal, state, and local agencies, and where required by the City, the BASMAA Post Construction Manual. Where physical and safety conditions allow, the preferred control measure is to retain drainage ways above ground and in as natural a state as possible or other biological methods such as bioretention areas. Where required by the Phase II Stormwater Permit Provision E.12, or where required by the nature and extent of a proposed project and where deemed appropriate by the City, every applicant shall develop, submit and implement a stormwater control plan (SCP) as described below:

1.     The SCP shall follow the appropriate SCP template, based on project type, in the most recent version of the BASMAA Post Construction Manual.

2.     The specific practices proposed in the SCP shall be subject to the review and approval of the agency and shall be in general accordance with the BASMAA Post Construction Manual, and the Phase II Stormwater Permit.

3.     The SCP is separate and distinct from the ESCP requirements described in subsection C.

4.     All stormwater management facilities shall be designed in a manner to minimize the need for maintenance and reduce the chances of failure. Design guidelines for bioretention facilities are outlined in the BASMAA Post Construction Manual.

5.     Where required by the Phase II Stormwater Permit and/or the City, as a condition precedent to the issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall submit a preliminary Stormwater Facilities Operation and Maintenance Plan (O&M Plan). The approval of the O&M Plan by the City is required prior to final inspection and approval of building permit closure.

Title 18 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
Chapter 18.04 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT

Chapter 18.04 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
Note
*       Prior ordinance history: Ords. 767, 837, 939, 1079, 1094, 1176, 1239, 1249.

 

18.04.010 Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Mill Valley does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. (Ord. 1257 § 2, October 15, 2012)

 

18.04.020 Findings of fact.
A.    Mill Valley tidelands, shorelines, waterways, beaches, mudflats and salt marshes are vital, natural resources which provide great benefits to present and future human generations. In addition to assisting the process of converting carbon dioxide to oxygen, they are essential features of the environment which not only provide food chains and serve as habitat for marine and bird life but are also, because of the unique part-time exposure to air, the only locations where certain fish eggs, larvae and other forms of life can develop. They provide one of a few remaining examples of natural seasonal growth and plant succession in the Bay Area. They provide protection against erosion during storm conditions and, if left undisturbed, a natural drainage system. They fulfill an indispensable role in preserving our temperate climate and the air purity of the Bay Area. They offer scenic views, open space, recreational opportunities such as fishing, swimming, boating, walking, picnicking, nature study and facilities for water transportation. But most important, they function as a delicately balanced biological system. The impact of man-made changes in one place is felt throughout the whole system and is not confined by property lines or other artificial boundaries. These benefits could be destroyed or seriously diminished by uncontrolled or haphazard conduct which is inimical to the welfare of both present and future residents of Mill Valley. Therefore, the tidelands, shorelines, waterways, beaches, mudflats, and salt marshes, together with all those areas designated elsewhere in this chapter, must be subject to proper controls for the preservation of these lands in their natural state so that these benefits may endure.

B.     The flood hazard areas of Mill Valley are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, disruption of commerce and governmental services, health and safety hazards, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

C.     These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in flood hazard areas causing increased flood heights and erosive velocities and the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages.

D.    The regulatory flood area selected for this chapter is representative of major floods known to have occurred in Mill Valley and which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur in the future. The chances of such flooding can be expected to occur with a one percent frequency in any one year. (Ord. 1257 § 2, October 15, 2012)

 

18.04.030 Purpose.
It is therefore the intention of the City Council and the purpose of this chapter to ensure the survival of these vital natural resources to protect and preserve essential elements of the environment, to maintain these benefits with a minimum of physical disturbance, to set forth the standards and procedures by which filling, excavating, mining and all other construction in the designated areas will be regulated and to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

A.    Protect human life and health.

B.     Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects.

C.     Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.

D.    Minimize prolonged business interruptions.

E.     Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard.

F.     Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage.

G.    Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard.

H.    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.

I.      Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities.

J.      Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.

K.    Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage. (Ord. 1257 § 2, October 15, 2012)

21.   “Floodplain management regulations” means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as the Floodplain Ordinance, Grading Ordinance, and Erosion Control Ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.

22.   “Floodproofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to nonresidential structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real estate, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. Structural components shall have the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy.

23.   “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and adjacent land area that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the surface water elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as regulatory floodway.

24.   “Floodway fringe” is that area of the floodplain on either side of the “regulatory floodway” where encroachment may be permitted.

25.   “Fraud and victimization” as related to Section 18.04.130, Variances, of this chapter means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City of Mill Valley will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

26.   “Governing body” is the local governing body unit—i.e., the City of Mill Valley—that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizenry.

27.   “Hardship” as related to Section 18.04.130, Variances, of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City of Mill Valley requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual or peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

28.   “Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

29.   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:

a.     Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

b.     Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

c.     Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or

d.     Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states with approved programs.

30.   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including a basement (see basement definition). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to, those specified in Section 18.04.100, Standards of construction.

31.   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term “manufactured home” also includes park trailers and travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site greater than 180 consecutive days.

32.   “Market value” means the replacement cost of an improvement less any depreciation that results from age or condition of the improvements. For purposes of this chapter, “market value” and “depreciated market value” have the same meaning. Market value of a structure excludes the value of the land, landscaping or detached accessory structures, as defined herein on the property. It is the property owner’s responsibility to submit evidence establishing the market value of an existing or pre-damaged structure for review and approval by the Floodplain Administrator. Market value shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed.

a.     The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry.

b.     The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence.

Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences.

33.   “Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1998, or other datum, to which base flood elevation is shown on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.

34.   “New construction” means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. The lowest floor of a new structure shall be a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.

35.   “Non-substantial or minor improvement” means an improvement (including an addition, conversion or rehabilitation) that is valued at less than 50% of the depreciated market value of the existing structure. The lowest floor of an existing structure does not have to conform with the Mill Valley Floodplain Management Ordinance in connection with non-substantial or minor improvements to an existing structure.

36.   “Obstruction” includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.

37.   “One hundred (100) year flood” means a flood which has a one percent annual probability of being equaled or exceeded. It is identical to the “base flood” which will be the term used throughout this chapter.

38.   “Permanent construction” does not include land clearing or filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure.

39.   “Public safety and nuisance” as related to Section 18.04.130, Variances, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.

40.   “Public service facilities” means any facilities installed by a governmental entity or an entity regulated by the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California and used or intended to be used to provide water, gas, electric or communication service and any pipelines and appurtenant facilities for the collection or transmission of sewage, floodwaters or stormwaters, petroleum, gas or any liquid substance.

41.   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:

a.     Built on a single chassis;

b.     Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

c.     Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and

d.     Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.

42.   “Regulatory floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

43.   “Remedy of violation” means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter, or otherwise deterring future similar violations; or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.

44.   “Riverine” means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc.

45.   “Sheet flow area” - See “Area of shallow flooding.”

46.   “Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means the land in the floodplain within Mill Valley that is subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Such areas are identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map or FHBM on file with the City of Mill Valley and are further identified as Zone A, A0, A1-A30, AE, or A99.

47.   “Start of construction” includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

48.   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.

49.   “Substantial damage” means:

a.     Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred; or

b.     Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This is also known as “repetitive loss.”

50.   “Substantial improvement” means any repair, remodel, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement within a two-year time period, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the “depreciated market” value of the existing structure either, before the improvement is started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. In instances where there has been substantial damage in the absence of an appraisal, the “depreciated market value” of a structure shall be established by the property owner and approved by the Floodplain Administrator through use of a combination of the latest Marin County Assessor rolls, qualified estimates of the actual cash value of the structure provided by a licensed contractor, a licensed appraisal containing the value(s) of other comparable houses in the neighborhood or any other improvement estimate accepted by the Floodplain Administrator. For the purposes of this definition “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The costs of improvements required to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations, or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or any state designation of historic places may be excluded from the total construction/improvement cost.

51.   “Tidelands” means those areas below the highest tide line as established by the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission for the Richardson Bay shoreline.

52.   “Variance” means a grant of release from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

53.   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

54.   “Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

55.   “Watercourse” means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. (Ord. 1257 § 2, October 15, 2012)

 

18.04.050 General provisions.

18.04.110 Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 18.04.050(B) are areas designated as “floodway.” The regulatory floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of the floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential. The following provisions apply to areas designated as “floodway”:

A.    No encroachments, including fill, or other development, as defined by this chapter, shall be permitted within an adopted regulatory floodway, unless it is demonstrated by a registered professional engineer or architect that the encroachment shall not result in an increase in flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

B.     If Section 18.04.110(A) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions. (Ord. 1257 § 2, October 15, 2012)

 

18.04.120 Tidelands.
For a proposed development on tidelands as defined in this chapter, a study and report by a qualified environmental biologist or other specialist in the field shall be required. The report shall classify and document the site in terms of its unique, intrinsic value as a wildlife habitat, and where there are differences in the value or sensitivity of portions of the site, shall rate them in order of lowest to highest wildlife resource value. Based on these classifications and ratings, the report shall contain specific recommendations on portions of the site that should not be disturbed in any manner, portions of the site that can sustain limited modification without major loss of resource value, and portions of the site best suited to development. Development permits for development on tidelands may be approved or conditionally approved only when it is found that:

A.    Public benefits from development clearly exceed public detriment from the loss of the designated areas; that the project is limited to water-oriented uses, or consists only of minor fill for improving shoreline appearance or public access to the bay or other waterway, or if the property does not front on the bay or other waterway, does not adversely affect public access to the bay or other waterway;

B.     Suitable upland location is not available for the proposed project;

C.     The area to be developed is the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of the project;

D.    The nature, location and extent of the proposed development is such that it will not cause harmful effects to the bay area, such as the reduction or impairment of the volume surface area or circulation of water, water quality, fertility of marshes or fish or wildlife resources;

E.     The proposed development will be constructed in accordance with sound safety standards which will afford reasonable protection to persons and property against the hazards of unstable geologic or soil conditions or of floodwaters, thus safeguarding public health, safety, welfare, and interests of all property owners;

F.     The proposed development will not cause or increase the likelihood of flooding, polluting, eroding or silting of adjoining lands;

G.    The proposed development will not destroy or accelerate the destruction of habitats essential to species of fish, shellfish, and other wildlife or plants of substantial public benefit;

H.    The proposed development will not diminish the scenic beauty of the shoreline in a manner which will impede future construction of parks and recreation facilities;

I.      The proposed development will not create a safety hazard in connection with potential settlement of fill or earthquakes, or landslides and similar instabilities;

J.      The proposal does not violate any adopted City General Plan or specific plan. (Ord. 1257 § 2, October 15, 2012)

 

18.04.130 Variances.
The City Council may issue a variance under the provisions of this chapter for floodplain management purposes only. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. It is the duty of the City of Mill Valley to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling, and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious, that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter shall only be granted based on the strict application of the findings listed, below. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited.

A.    In passing upon requests for variances, the City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the following, as may be applicable:

1.     Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2.     Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3.     Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;

4.     Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5.     Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6.     Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7.     Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8.     Relationship of the proposed use to the General Plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9.     Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10.   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and

11.   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.

B.     A variance shall only be approved based on making all of the following findings:

1.     That there is evidence in the public record to the satisfaction of the City Council of good and sufficient cause.

2.     That failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined herein, to the applicant.

3.     That the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance or cause fraud and victimization of the public as defined herein or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

4.     That the proposed new construction, substantial improvement and/or other proposed new development is necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the applicable provisions of subsection (A)(1)—(11) of this section are satisfied.

5.     That the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.

6.     That the variance is the “minimum necessary” considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. (For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City determines will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter).

C.     The City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. The City Council shall require as a condition of approval to the granting of a variance that the property owner enter into a recorded agreement with the City, before a development permit is issued, providing that the property owner will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the City from any claims, actions, damages or liabilities arising in any manner from the granting of the variance.

D.    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice by the Floodplain Administrator that:

1.     The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and that insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.

2.     Construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.

3.     A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Marin County Recorder so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

E.     The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance. (Ord. 1257 § 2, October 15, 2012)

 

18.04.140 Appeals.
Appeals from any determination of the Floodplain Administrator pursuant to this chapter shall be made to the City Council. For purposes of this chapter, any appeal of a determination of the Floodplain Administrator shall be considered in the same manner as a variance and subject to the applicable provisions of Section 18.04.130. (Ord. 1257 § 2, October 15, 2012)

 

18.04.150 Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Mill Valley, any officer or employee thereof, the State of California, or the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 1257 § 2, October 15, 2012)

20.16.035 Large family day care homes.
Notwithstanding Sections 20.16.020 and 20.16.030 of this chapter, a large family day care home may be permitted in the RS district pursuant to a use permit issued under the authority of this section.

A.    Standards. The Director of Planning and Building shall issue a use permit to a large family day care home if the day care home meets the following standards and requirements as prescribed by state law:

1.     There shall be a minimum distance of 500 feet between the exterior property line of the site on which the large family day care home is located and the exterior property line of the nearest other licensed large family day care home.

2.     The operation of the large family day care home shall comply with all applicable noise regulations of this Code or the General Plan. The use of amplified music which can be heard from a public right-of-way or neighboring property is prohibited during hours of operation.

3.     In addition to the parking otherwise required for a single family home, one paved parking space, which may be tandem, shall be provided for each nonresident employee, nonresident aide and any other nonresident person engaged in the operation of the day care home. Unless such spaces are located in an existing driveway, such spaces shall be located on the premises outside of the exterior yard setback and shall conform to the requirements of Section 20.60.090 of this title.

4.     There shall be adequate parking for the loading and unloading of children. Loading and unloading shall be on site, or on the street side adjacent to premises. The applicant’s driveway shall be sufficient for this purpose provided that the use of the driveway will not block the public right-of-way and all traffic laws are obeyed. Where street parking is available for residential uses, that shall be sufficient for this purpose provided that all traffic and parking regulations are obeyed and double parking is prohibited.

B.     Procedure. An application for a permit to operate a large family day care home shall be filed with the Director of Planning and Building in a form provided by the director. Such application shall be processed pursuant to the following procedures as required by state law.

2.     Hearing. No public hearing on the application shall be held unless a hearing is requested in writing by the applicant or by an affected party owning real property within 100 feet of the exterior boundaries of the proposed large family day care home. The hearing, if requested, shall be conducted by the Zoning Administrator.

3.     Appeal. The applicant or any interested party may appeal the decision of the Director to the Planning Commission. (Ord. 1215 § 2, November 20, 2006)

This topic has been modified. View the section for details. 20.16.040 Property development regulations.
The following property development regulations shall apply to all permitted uses within RS districts.

A.    Floor Area Calculations. These are the standards applied, along with other applicable development standards in this title and residential design guidelines, to effectively manage the height, bulk and mass of a given project in relation to the lot on which the project stands, in relation to surrounding structures on adjoining properties and in relation to the public realm (streets, sidewalks, open space, etc.).

1.     Adjusted floor area (as defined in Section 20.08.032) for a proposed project will be calculated as follows:

a.     The total gross floor area, measured from the outside faces of the structural walls, of all of the following will be totaled:

i.      All enclosed structures on the lot including but not limited to the main dwelling structure, accessory structures, residential second units, and sheds that require a building permit. Enclosed patios, terraces and balconies are included, but basements, exterior areas under roof eaves or other cantilevered overhangs and non-enclosed spaces (e.g., balconies, decks and porches) or structures (e.g., gazebos and carports) are not included. A space is considered non-enclosed if it is substantially open on at least two sides (sides with guardrails are considered open).

ii.     All enclosed but undeveloped volumes which could be utilized in the future as floor area and have minimum dimensions of eight feet by 10 feet and seven feet headroom without additional excavation. All space horizontally contiguous to this minimum space which maintains at least a width of eight feet and seven feet head room without additional excavation will be included.

b.     The following will be subtracted from the paragraph 20.16.040(A)(1)(a) total above:

i.      For lots of up to 8,000 square feet of gross area, up to 500 square feet of garage floor area.

ii.     For lots ranging from 8,000 to 10,000 square feet of gross area, up to 500 square feet of garage area or up to 800 square feet of combined garage and residential second unit area.

iii.    For lots over 10,000 square feet in gross floor area, up to 500 square feet of garage area or up to 1,000 square feet of combined garage and residential second unit area.

c.     A 50% premium (floor area multiplied by 1.5) will be added for floor area in interior spaces that has a height over 14 feet wherever the 14-foot height measurement is exceeded. The height will be measured as follows.

i.      On a “top floor” (as defined in Section 20.08.192), wherever the slope of the roof is less than a ratio of four feet of rise to 12 feet of run, the height measurement shall be the vertical distance from the finished floor to the “roof surface” (as defined in Section 20.08.161).

ii.     On a top floor, wherever the slope of the roof is equal to or greater than a ratio of four feet of rise to 12 feet of run, the height measurement shall be the vertical distance from the finished floor to the roof surface, except any roof surface higher than the midpoint elevation between the elevation of the roof ridge and the elevation of the roof surface at the point directly above the exterior wall surface of the structure shall be ignored and the midpoint elevation shall be considered the top measurement point for this area. If the slope of the roof does not continue linearly to a roof ridge (e.g., as with gambrel and mansard roof styles), then the midpoint elevation will be calculated using the projected intersection of the roof lines as the ridge elevation.

iii.    On any floor or portion thereof with developed space above (see top floor definition at Section 20.08.192 for attic space), the height measurement shall be the vertical distance from the finished floor to the ceiling.

d.     Stair well or elevator shaft floor area shall only be counted once for a building regardless of the number of floors through which the stair well or elevator passes.

e.     Interpretations of how to calculate adjusted floor area shall be made by the Director of Planning and Building and may be appealed to the Planning Commission as specified in Chapter 20.100.

2.     The maximum amount of adjusted floor area allowed on a specific lot shall be calculated using the applicable floor area ratio based on effective lot area (as defined in Section 20.08.090) as follows:

a.     Lots with less than 8,000 square feet of effective lot area: 35% of the effective lot area.

b.     Lots with 8,000 to 20,000 square feet of effective lot area: 10% of the effective lot area plus 2,000 square feet.

c.     Lots with more than 20,000 square feet of effective lot area: five percent of the effective lot area plus 3,000 square feet, to a maximum of 7,000 square feet.

The maximum adjusted floor area may be reduced through design review pursuant to Chapter 20.66.

3.     During the improvement of an existing single family dwelling, any enclosed but undeveloped volumes may be converted to habitable space and shall not be restricted to the maximum adjusted floor area as determined by Section 20.16.040(A)(2); provided that the conversion of the existing space does not change the existing height, bulk, mass or footprint of the structure and only if minimal excavation or modification of the existing grade is required.

4.     For any existing single family dwelling where the adjusted floor area which existed on May 6, 1991 exceeded or was within 100 square feet of the maximum adjusted floor area specified in this section, a building permit may be obtained for up to 100 square feet of additional floor area where the proposed addition complies with all other provisions of this title (e.g., no variances allowed). This additional floor area will only be available once per parcel.

B.     Maximum Building Height for Dwelling.

Twenty-five feet above natural grade.

Any single family dwelling, or portions of a single family dwelling, with more than twice all required yard setbacks may extend up to 35 feet above the natural grade.

Other exceptions to maximum height: See Section 20.60.060.

C.     Minimum Yard Setbacks.

Exterior: 15 feet.

Interior: One foot for every 1,000 square feet of effective lot area, but no less than five feet or more than 15 feet.

Exceptions to minimum yard setbacks: See Section 20.60.070.

Chapter 20.18 R-P DISTRICTS
20.18.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to effect the development of attractive residential properties in keeping with the character of the community with minimum disturbance to the quality of the neighborhoods and of the natural features of the landscape by requiring the approval of specific plans showing site design and overall design character prior to development.

In establishing R-P districts, the City of Mill Valley intends to make possible development in which the size and shape of buildings, building heights, and the open spaces surrounding buildings or groups of buildings may be varied. Density shall be set at a level or range of dwelling units which is consistent with limitations imposed by on-site, natural resource, topographic and geologic conditions and by the level of public services and road access that can be reasonably provided. The development approval process for R-P districts is intended to allow for continuous refinement of the permitted density as additional information is acquired regarding the capacity of the land. (Ord. 660 § 1; Ord. 672 § 1; Ord. 709 § 1; Ord. 884 § 1, December 20, 1976; Ord. 1015 § 1, November 21, 1983)

 

20.18.020 Procedure for obtaining planned development approval.
Except for uses listed in Section 20.18.040, land zoned R-P may not be used, developed or graded for purposes of development until plans for development have been approved by the City. The procedural steps in obtaining plan approval of lands zoned R-P are as follows:

A.    A determination of land capacity (development density) must be obtained pursuant to Section 20.18.060. This land capacity determination is made by the Planning Commission, subject to appeal by the City Council, after public hearing. A technical Land Capacity Report, paid for by the applicant and prepared by a person or firm mutually acceptable to the applicant and the City, and submitted by the applicant, is used by the City as an aid in making the land capacity determination. The land capacity determination is intended as a guide to be used by the applicant and the City in preparation and review of a master plan and precise development plan for the property. However, if justified by subsequent information, the City may permit a greater or require a lesser density when a master plan is approved for the property.

B.     A master plan must be approved for development of the land pursuant to Section 20.18.080. The general development criteria contained in Section 20.18.070 govern the preparation of the master plan.

C.     Following approval of the master plan, a precise development plan must be approved pursuant to Section 20.18.090.

D.    Since the master plan and precise development plan involve a more detailed study of the property, including its geology, accessibility, and other characteristics, information may come to light at these stages which may cause the City to either increase or decrease the allowed development density previously contained in the land capacity determination. (Ord. 660 § 1; Ord. 672 § 1; Ord. 884 § 1, December 20, 1976; Ord. 1015 § 2, November 21, 1983)

 

20.18.030 Division of property.
No real property zoned R-P shall be divided so as to create a parcel of less than 10 contiguous acres unless and until such subdivision is permitted under a planned development, which has been approved pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 660 § 1; Ord. 672 § 1; Ord. 884 § 1, December 20, 1976)

 

20.18.040 Uses permitted without planned development approval.
The following uses are permitted without planned development approval as required in this chapter:

A.    Agriculture;

B.     One single family dwelling on any single holding of land zoned R-P;

C.     Accessory structures.

(Ord. 660 § 1; Ord. 672 § 1; Ord. 709 § 2; Ord. 884 § 1; Ord. 976 § 1, April 20, 1981)

 

20.18.050 Uses permitted with planned development approval.
The following uses are permitted upon obtaining planned development approval as required in this chapter; provided, however, that all uses other than dwellings shall be distinctly secondary and accessory to the residential use of the R-P District and surrounding property and shall not change the basic residential character of the R-P District.

A.    Attached and detached dwellings;

B.     Commercial uses;

C.     Home occupations;

D.    Public and private country clubs;

E.     Golf courses;

F.     Tennis courts;

G.    Other non-commercial recreation facilities;

H.    Public and private schools, including nursery schools, kindergartens and day care centers;

I.      Churches;

J.      Public and private parks or playgrounds;

K.    Public utility structures;

L.     Accessory structures.

(Ord. 660 § 1; Ord. 672 § 1; Ord. 709 §§ 3, 4; Ord. 884 § 1; Ord. 976 § 2, April 20, 1981)

20.18.060 Land capacity determination.
The land capacity shall be expressed in terms of dwelling units per land area and shall be directly related to the natural features of the land. The procedures for land capacity determination shall be as follows:

A.    The applicant shall submit the following data to be used in the preparation of a land capacity report:

1.     A base map of the site and all adjoining properties within 150 feet of the site at a scale of one inch equals 100 feet or larger with a minimum contour interval of five feet showing slope bands in the ranges of 1% to 10%, 11% to 15%, 16% to 20%, 21% to 30%, 31% to 40%, 41% to 50%, and over 50%.

2.     A tabulation of the land area in square feet by the slope categories specified in paragraph 1 above.

3.     An explanation of the methods used to compute percent slope in the land areas by means sufficient to permit adequate review.

B.     The City Engineer shall certify the calculations required by subsection A above, prior to the preparation of the land capacity report.

C.     Determination of Land Capacity—Land Capacity Report. To ensure that land development is established at a level consistent with the capacity of the land, applicants for planned development approval shall furnish a land capacity report prepared by a person or firm mutually acceptable to the applicant and the City, which person or firm is qualified by training and experience to have expert knowledge of the development criteria. The land capacity report is, in part, an environmental assessment and will serve as a data base for an environmental impact report. The land capacity report shall consist of the following components:

1.     Natural and Manmade Site Features. This portion of the report shall describe the land features and environmental resources, including an identification and/or analysis of the following:

a.     Topography;

b.     Geologic and soils conditions;

c.     Hydrology;

d.     Vegetation;

e.     Scenic areas;

f.      Cumulative natural hazards;

g.     Public utilities;

h.     Roadways and existing levels of service;

i.      Primary resources such as archaeological, historical, etc.

2.     Land Capacity Calculation.

a.     Excluded Lands. Lands with any of the following characteristics shall not be included in the land area of the proposed development for the purposes of land capacity determination:

i.      Lands with greater than 50% slope.

ii.     Lands which are hazardous to life and property due to soils, geological, seismic or hydrological factors (if left in their natural state or if built upon without remedial work) unless such hazardous conditions can be eliminated with minimal grading and disturbance to existing land forms and vegetation. The determinations on what is hazardous land must be based on the analysis of a licensed engineering geologist.

iii.    Lands accessible only by roads passing through lands categorized as hazardous to life and property in paragraph (ii) above.

iv.    Lands that can be served only by a cul-de-sac of 800 feet or more. (As used in this chapter, the term “cul-de-sac” shall mean any street or street system within the planned development having only one point of vehicular access.)

b.     Buildable Lands. The building portions of the site shall be evaluated as follows:

i.      The base density of all lands shall be set according to their slope as follows:

Percent Slope

Land Area Per Dwelling Unit

0-10

7,500 sq. ft.

11-15

10,000 sq. ft.

16-20

15,000 sq. ft.

21-30

20,000 sq. ft.

31-40

40,000 sq. ft.

Over 40

10 acres

 

Lot slope shall be measured at right angles to the natural contours. Percentage slope equals the vertical rise in feet between two points, divided by the horizontal distance between the two points multiplied by 100.

ii.     Lands falling within an area of high fire hazard shall be limited to a density of one dwelling unit per five acres regardless of slope. High fire hazard areas are defined as those highly fire-prone brush assemblages known as chaparral formations which, among others, are composed of manzanita, chamise, chaparral, oak, huckleberry, chaparral pea, toyon, tree poppy, and chinquapin. The general locations of such high fire hazard areas are shown in the adopted Mill Valley General Plan, but are not necessarily limited to those locations.

iii.    Densities for lands excluded under paragraph (2)(a), Excluded Lands, parts (iii) and (iv), of this subsection C, may be calculated in the same manner as the remaining lands with 10% of the resulting density being transferred to the remaining lands, other than lands within high fire hazard areas. Any fraction of a full unit or aggregate fraction less than a full unit shall be counted as a full unit.

3.     Land Capacity Hearing and Determination. Within 30 days following receipt of the land capacity report, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing to consider the land capacity report and its recommended land capacity determination. The Planning Commission shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the proposed land capacity determination and notify the applicant of its action in writing, including the reasons for its decision. Should the Planning Commission disapprove of the proposed land capacity determination, the Commission shall inform the applicant of what it believes to be the correct land capacity determination. Plans thereafter submitted for the planned development, whether by the same or another applicant, shall be in accordance with the land capacity determination. Plans thereafter submitted for the planned development, whether by the same or another applicant, shall be in accordance with the land capacity determination. However, the applicant may also submit alternative plans for lesser or greater density if the applicant believes that new information regarding the land justifies a change in density. The land capacity determination represents the number of dwelling units allowable on the land based upon the site characteristics as documented and analyzed in the land capacity report. However, the Planning Commission and/or City Council may require a lesser or permit a greater number of dwelling units when necessary or appropriate under the general development criteria established in Section 20.18.070. Such determination shall be made in the master plan or precise development plan approval process contained in Sections 20.18.080 and 20.18.090. Appeal of the Planning Commission decision on the land capacity determination may be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 20.64.100. (Ord. 660 § 1; Ord. 672 § 1; Ord. 709 § 5; Ord. 884 § 1, December 20, 1976; Ord. 984 § 1, November 2, 1981; Ord. 1015 §§ 2, 5—7, 9, November 21, 1983)

 

20.18.070 General development criteria.
All planned developments under this chapter shall conform to the following general development criteria:

A.    Minimum Area. The minimum area required for a planned development shall be 10 acres of contiguous property unless the Planning Commission finds that property of less than 10 acres is suitable for planned development in accordance with all the provisions of this chapter.

B.     Assembly of Land. Where contiguous properties proposed for a planned development in accordance with the provisions of this chapter are under separate ownership, written consent of all participating property owners shall be filed with the Director of Planning and Building before any application for a planned development can be accepted by the City.

C.     Conformance to the General Plan. All planned development to which this chapter applies must conform to the adopted Mill Valley General Plan or to any adopted precise plan applicable to the area under consideration.

D.    Maximum Height of Structures. No structure shall exceed 30 feet in height pursuant to the building height definitions contained in Section 20.08.050.

E.     Environmental Quality Criteria.

1.     All development should be designed and located to conserve energy resources. Such efforts might include, but are not limited to, the clustering or location of development to reduce driving time, and structural designs which maximize use of solar energy and reduce the use of electricity and fossil fuels.

2.     Clustering to reduce paving, grading, runoff and changes in vegetative cover shall be encouraged. When a significant change in vegetative cover is proposed, it must be demonstrated that restoration measures will provide for minimal adverse impact and for equal protection from erosion as that provided by vegetation before grading.

3.     Development should be so designed as to minimize adverse impact on primary wildlife resources and to achieve a high degree of compatibility with wildlife habitat areas.

4.     Any lands whose sole means of access is via existing residential streets shall be limited to densities which will not produce substantial increases in traffic volumes on those streets. Traffic volumes exceeding 20% of existing volumes shall generally be considered substantial. Where more than one undeveloped site would contribute vehicular traffic to the street, the aggregate densities should not exceed the 20% level. The 20% level shall be used as a general guideline and is intended to minimize adverse traffic impacts on existing neighborhood streets. Densities may be approved which would produce lesser or greater traffic volumes depending upon the particular impact as may be identified in any environmental impact report prepared for the planned development.

F.     Site Design Criteria.

1.     All roads, buildings, and other structural improvements or land coverage shall be located, sited and designed to fit the natural topography and shall minimize grading and modification of existing land forms and natural characteristics.

2.     Lands to which it is necessary to provide access by constructing a roadway or roadways traversing slopes in excess of 30% grade for a total cumulative distance of 300 feet shall be considered unbuildable unless it can be demonstrated that any adverse impact, including visual impact, is insignificant or can be satisfactorily mitigated.

3.     Development shall be designed to minimize detraction from the scenic and visual quality of the City and the natural characteristics of scenic ridge lines, existing major water courses, established trees, dominant vegetative communities and primary wildlife habitats.

4.     Lands that can be served only by a cul-de-sac of 800 feet or more shall not be considered buildable unless it can be demonstrated that adequate provision can be made for public safety and/or emergency access.

5.     Vegetation for the stabilization of graded areas or for replacement of existing vegetation shall be compatible with surrounding vegetation and shall recognize climatic, soil and ecological characteristics of the region.

6.     Underground utility lines shall be required, except where such undergrounding would result in significant adverse environmental impact.

7.     It must be demonstrated that sufficient storm drainage, sewerage capacity and domestic water supply are available and that adequate fire, police, and school facilities either exist, or can be reasonably supplied to the development.

G.    Natural Hazards and Public Safety Criteria.

1.     Areas of Slope Instability. Development in areas of slope instability shall not be permitted unless detailed geotechnical and hydrological studies demonstrate that reasonable safeguards have been provided for public safety. Studies made by licensed engineering geologists and/or engineers specializing in soils problems must show that both static and dynamic hazardous conditions either do not exist or can be overcome by site preparation measures and/or engineering design which are not contrary to the purposes of this chapter.

2.     Areas of Steep Topography. Any portion of a site over 50% grade shall not be considered buildable unless it can be demonstrated that the placing of structures thereon will not require undue disruption of the existing ground surfaces and vegetation, and unless it can be demonstrated that roads and utilities to the site can be provided in a manner which does not cause geologic instability, undue disruption or damage to any existing roads, soils, vegetation and utilities due to earth movement, and in a manner which ensures adequate access for public safety vehicles. Any such lands which do not meet these criteria, or the criteria in subsection (F)(2) of this section, and are, therefore, declared unbuildable may have 10% of their otherwise allowable density transferred to buildable lands. Any fraction of a full unit or aggregate fraction less than a full unit shall be counted as a full unit.

3.     Seismic Hazards. With all areas of Mill Valley being subject to the severe effects of seismic shaking, all developments shall be subject to the following criteria:

a.     All new buildings shall conform to the latest seismic structural standards of the Uniform Building Code.

b.     All lands shall be evaluated for the presence of faults or seismic shaking related conditions and their implications for structural design. Any particular seismic hazard characteristics disclosed by such evaluation shall be made public.

4.     Fire Hazard Areas. Development in high fire hazard areas (as defined in Section 20.18.060(C)(2)) shall be limited to a density of one dwelling unit per five acres. (Ord. 660 § 1; Ord. 709 § 6; Ord. 884 § 1, December 20, 1976)

Chapter 20.20 PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS*
* CodeAlert: This topic has been affected by Ordinance No. 1314U and 1323U. To view amendments and newly added provisions, please refer to the CodeAlert Amendment List.


20.20.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to create attractive residential developments which complement the character of the community, result in minimum disturbance to adjacent neighborhoods and preserve significant natural features of the sites. In establishing Planned Residential Districts, the City of Mill Valley intends to make possible development in which lot sizes, the size and shape of buildings, the location of buildings on lots, building heights, and the open spaces surrounding buildings or groups of buildings may be varied consistent with limitations imposed by on-site natural resource, topographic and geologic conditions and by the level of public services and road access that can be reasonably provided. The development approval process for Planned Residential Districts is intended to allow for continuous refinement of the development plan as additional information is acquired regarding the specific characteristics of the land.

 

20.20.020 Procedure for obtaining planned development approval.
Except for uses listed in Section 20.20.040, land zoned Planned Residential may not be used, developed nor graded for purposes of development until plans for development have been approved by the City. The procedural steps in obtaining plan approval of lands zoned Planned Residential are as follows:

A.    A master plan must be approved for development of the land pursuant to Section 20.20.080. The general development criteria contained in Section 20.20.070 shall govern the preparation of the master plan.

B.     Following approval of the master plan, a precise development plan must be approved pursuant to Section 20.18.090.

C.     Since the master plan and precise development plan involve a more detailed study of the property, including its geology, accessibility, and other characteristics, information may come to light at these stages which may cause the City to modify the location or decrease the development density specified in the City General Plan.

 

20.20.030 Division of property.
No real property zoned Planned Residential shall be divided unless and until such subdivision is permitted under a planned development, which has been approved pursuant to this chapter.

 

This topic has been modified. View the section for details. 20.20.040 Uses permitted without planned development approval.
The following uses are permitted without planned development approval as required in this chapter:

A.    Agriculture.

B.     One single family dwelling on each legal lot of record zoned Planned Residential.

C.     Accessory structures.

D.    One residential second unit on an existing lot of record as authorized by Chapter 20.90.

E.     Other projects which the Director of Planning and Building determines are minor or incidental in nature and are consistent with the intent and objectives of this chapter. (Ord. 1075 § 1, February 1, 1988; Ord. 1188 § 9, June 2, 2003)

 

20.20.050 Uses permitted with planned development approval.
The following uses are permitted upon obtaining planned development approval as required in this chapter; provided, however, that all uses other than dwellings shall be distinctly secondary and accessory to the residential use of the Planned Residential District and surrounding property and shall not change the basic residential character of the Planned Residential District.

A.    Single family detached dwellings on both RSP (Residential, One Family Planned District) and RMP (Residential, Multiple Planned District) designated parcels.

B.     Attached dwellings on RMP (Residential, Multiple Planned District) designated parcels.

C.     Home occupations.

D.    Non-commercial recreation facilities.

E.     Public and private parks or playgrounds.

F.     Public utility structures.

G.    Accessory structures.

 

20.20.060 Density designation.
The ordinance adopting a Planned Residential District shall specify the maximum number of dwelling units per gross acre which will be allowed within the district and this density shall be combined with the zoning designation. The density thus computed shall in fact be the maximum number of dwelling units allowed per gross acre.

 

20.20.070 General development criteria.
All planned developments under this chapter shall conform to the following general development criteria:

A.    Assembly of Land. At a minimum, any planned development shall include all contiguous land under the applicant’s ownership.

* CodeAlert: This topic has been affected by Ordinance No. 1314U, 1315U and 1323U. To view amendments and newly added provisions, please refer to the CodeAlert Amendment List.


20.24.005 Purpose and intent.
The multi-family residential zones are intended to create and maintain medium and higher density residential neighborhoods that blend a range of housing types with a mix of unit sizes with a limited mix of neighborhood-scale commercial, office, and institutional uses. The City’s goals include preservation of the existing stock of rental housing in these areas and provision of opportunities for development of new multi-family housing that increase the diversity of housing options within the City.

The purpose and intent of the City’s multiple family zoning districts are as follows:

A.    Miller Avenue “Passage” District. The Miller Avenue Passage district accommodates medium density residential, including mixed-use with offices or commercial and small-scale multi-family residential developments. Residential land use in these areas is intended to be small- to medium-scale multi-family residential developments, live-work, and mixed-use development.

B.     Miller Avenue “Parkway” District. The Miller Avenue Parkway district accommodates medium and higher density residential in accordance with the adopted Land Use Map.

C.     Miller Avenue “Marsh” and “Bayfront” Districts. The Marsh/Bayfront areas accommodate higher density residential, including larger two- to three-story multi-family residential complexes and large-lot condominium and townhouse developments. A major component of the Marsh District is the Redwoods senior housing, which is targeted for an Affordable Housing Overlay Zone to facilitate development of affordable senior housing for the City. The Pickleweed Apartments and Mill Creek Meadows are also located in the Marsh district.

The Bayfront District includes, but is not limited to, the Bayfront, Enchanted Knolls, Shelter Bay, Shelter Hill, and Plymouth Square developments. (Ord. 1278 § 10, July 18, 2016)

 

20.24.008 Applicability.
The regulations of this chapter apply to all new development and changes of use within these zoning districts with the exception of existing single family dwellings. Existing single family dwellings in the multi-family residential zones are not considered nonconforming and can be altered and enlarged, if such additions meet the setback, height and other development standards of this Code.

New development and changes of use must meet both the multi-family development standards contained in this chapter as well as the City of Mill Valley Multi-Family Residential Design Guidelines. Additional standards contained throughout this title also apply as noted in “Additional Standards and Provisions” listed in the Use Table in Section 20.24.030. (Ord. 1278 § 10, July 18, 2016)

Chapter 20.54 H-O DISTRICTS — HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICTS
20.54.010 H-O Overlay District—Creation.
There is hereby created an Overlay Zoning District to be known as H-O Historic Overlay District which may be combined with any of the basic zoning districts designated in this title and applied to any individual property or group of properties. The addition of the H-O Historic Overlay District designation to any basic district shall not operate to reduce or eliminate any requirements established by the basic district regulations or other requirements contained in this title applicable to any district to which the H-O Historic Overlay District is added, unless expressly provided herein; provided, however, that if any of the regulations specified in this chapter for the H-O Historic Overlay District conflict with the basic district regulations, then the regulations of this chapter shall apply.

The purpose of the H-O Historic Overlay District is to promote the general welfare of the public through:

A.    The protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of structures, sites and areas that are reminders of people, events, or eras, or which provide significant examples of architectural styles and physical surroundings in which past generations lived;

B.     The development and maintenance of appropriate settings for such structures, site or areas;

C.     The enhancement of property values, the stabilization of neighborhoods and the increase of economic and financial benefits to the City and its residents;

D.    The enrichment of the cultural and educational dimensions of human life by encouraging study and enjoyment of our historical heritage. (Ord. 972 § 1, December 15, 1980)

 

20.54.020 Powers and duties of Planning Commission.
The Planning Commission:

A.    On its own initiative or upon application of any person (whether the owner of the property or not) and payment of the fee established by resolution of the City Council, the Planning Commission shall hold public hearings and make recommendations to the City Council on the creation of H-O Historic Overlay Districts.

B.     May establish and maintain a list of structures and other landmarks deserving official recognition although not designated as Historic Overlay Districts, and take appropriate measures which, although not constituting mandatory regulations, will encourage the continued preservation of such structures or landmarks.

C.     May, upon request of the property owner, advise with respect to any proposed work not requiring a City permit within an H-O Overlay District. Such work may include, but is not limited to, painting and repainting of exterior surfaces, roofing, fencing, landscaping, glazing and installation of lighting fixtures. Such advice, although not mandatory, shall be designed to preserve the historic characteristics of the property.

 

20.54.030 H-O District regulations.
A.    All applications for construction, alteration, demolition or sign permits within any H-O Historic Overlay District shall be subject to Design Review as provided in Chapter 20.66 of this title, if such permit involves the construction of any new structure, the demolition of any existing structure, exterior alterations or any interior alterations which would affect the exterior of any structure. In addition to other matters set forth in this title, the United States Secretary of the Interior’s “Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings,” GPO 937-843, with its latest revisions, subject to such considerations as may be appropriate for local Mill Valley conditions, shall be utilized as guidelines in exercising Design Review.

B.     The Zoning Administrator may approve any application referred to in subsection A of this section, or may suspend the action of all City departments on such application for a period not to exceed 180 days. The City Council may extend the suspension for an additional period not to exceed 180 days, if such extension is made not more than 90 days and not less than 30 days prior to the expiration of the original 180-day period. During such suspension, the Zoning Administrator shall consult with civic groups such as the Mill Valley Historical Society, historic preservation organizations, public agencies, and interested citizens and shall make recommendations to the City Council for acquisition of the property by public or private bodies or agencies, explore the possibility of moving one or more structures, and take any other reasonable measures necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. If, at the expiration of the suspension period, the City has not taken such action as will legally preclude the issuance of the permit applied for, then the application shall be processed.

C.     If the applicant presents facts clearly demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator that failure to approve the application will work immediate and substantial hardship because of the conditions peculiar to a particular structure or other feature of the property, and such hardship has not been created by an act of the owner in anticipation of action under this chapter, the Zoning Administrator may approve such application even though it does not meet the standards set forth herein. Personal, family or financing difficulties, loss of prospective profits and neighboring violations are not justifiable hardships.

D.    None of the provisions of this chapter shall prevent any reasonable measures of construction, alteration or demolition necessary to correct any condition which has been declared unsafe or dangerous by the City and where the proposed corrective measures have been declared necessary by the City.

E.     The owner, lessee and any other person in actual charge or possession of any property within an H-O Historic Overlay District shall keep in good repair all exterior portions of any structure on such property and all interior portions, the maintenance of which may be necessary to prevent deterioration of any exterior portion. Building permit fees for such maintenance and repair shall be waived.

F.     The Building/Zoning Code Inspector may apply the provisions of regular building standards and building regulations adopted pursuant to California Health and Safety Code Section 18958, or any combination of regular and alternative building standards and building regulations, in permitting repairs, alterations, and additions necessary for the preservation, restoration, rehabilitation, moving or continued use of an historical building or structure.

The relocation payment shall be a one-time payment, paid no later than the day on which the applicant gives notice to the tenant to vacate the premises. This money may be used as down payment assistance to purchase the unit when it is converted. Tenants will be provided with the approximate amount of relocation assistance as part of the distribution of the handout identified in Section 20.59.090(A).

B.     Leasehold Rights. Tenants shall receive the following rights during the 180 day termination of tenancy period caused by the proposed condominium conversion.

1.     Rent increases shall not be permitted.

20.60.065 Fences.
A.    Purpose. The City has determined that controls and limitations on fencing are necessary to preclude fencing from adversely affecting the appearance and character of the community and the health, safety, welfare and enjoyment of its citizens.

The limitations contained in this section are intended to provide reasonable surety that fencing does not unreasonably restrict views, natural animal movements, air circulation or sunlight; impair safe sight distances related to vehicular, pedestrian or other types of circulation or become undesirable physical features of the community.

B.     Definitions.

1.     Fencing. Fencing is defined as any manmade barrier, barricade, or boundary marker serving as screening, restriction to access, definition of boundaries, privacy screen, method of confinement or security screen.

2.     Measurement of Height. The height of fencing shall be the vertical distance between finished grade at the base of the fence and the top edge of fence material. Fencing on top of masonry, concrete, stone or wood walls or on an artificially built up ground surface which faces an adjacent property or public right-of-way, shall be measured to the base of the wall or the natural grade.

C.     When a Fence Permit is Required. Fencing located entirely on a private property outside the required setbacks or within the required interior yard setbacks and not exceeding seven feet in height or within the required exterior yard setbacks and not exceeding four feet in height may be constructed without obtaining a permit from the City.

Fencing located within public right-of-ways or which exceeds the four-foot and seven-foot height limits require a fence permit from the Planning and Building Department.

D.    Application Requirements for a Fence Permit. A request for a fence permit shall be submitted to the Planning and Building Department and shall include a completed application form, the fee as set by resolution of the City Council and plans adequately indicating the location and design of the proposed fence.

E.     Fences Located in Public Right-of-Way. Prior to granting a permit for any fence located entirely or partially within a public right-of-way, the application shall be referred to the Department of Public Works for its review and recommendations and intended action on the separately required revocable encroachment permit.

F.     Findings Required to Approve Any Fence Permit. In approving any application for a fence permit the following findings must be made:

1.     The fence will not impair vehicular and pedestrian movements and sight lines;

2.     The fence will be structurally sound;

3.     The fence will be aesthetically attractive to the community and adjacent residents by incorporating design features such as lattice or trellis work or consisting of open wire fabric;

4.     The fence will not unreasonably restrict natural animal movement.

G.    Additional Findings Required to Approve Any Fencing Located in a Public Right-of-Way. In addition to the findings specified above, the following additional findings must be made in approving any application for fencing located within a public right-of-way:

1.     The portion of the public right-of-way being enclosed by the proposed fence is not anticipated to be needed for any public use;

2.     The fence will enclose the minimum amount of the right-of-way necessary to accomplish the intended purpose;

3.     The proposed location of the fence will still allow an adequate area for pedestrians to walk off the edge of the traveled way;

4.     The fence will not obstruct access to public improvements and utilities;

5.     The fence will not eliminate existing or potential parking spaces within the public right-of-way; and

6.     The Department of Public Works has indicated its intention to issue a Revocable Encroachment Permit under Chapter 11.16 of this Code.

 

H.    Appeal of Decision on Fence Permits. Any decision of the Planning and Building Department on a Fence Permit may be appealed to the Planning Commission in accordance with Chapter 20.100 of this Code.

I.      Vegetation. The controls on fencing contained in this section shall not apply to native or landscape vegetation. However, the City may trim or remove or require the adjacent property owner to trim or remove any landscape vegetation located on a public right-of-way if the vegetation adversely affects public safety or restricts reasonable use of the right-of-way. (Ord. 1123 § 7, August 2, 1993; Ord. 1182 § 6, April 2, 2002)

 

20.60.070 Projections, encroachments—Yards measured from official plan line.
A.    Encroachment on Official Plan Line. Whenever an official plan line has been established for any street as a precise section of the master street and highway plan, required yards shall be measured from such line, and in no case shall the provisions of this title be construed as permitting any encroachment upon any official plan line.

B.     Eaves, stairs, not over six treads in length, chimneys and other minor projections shall be allowed to encroach upon yard requirements to a maximum of 30% of each dimension required.

C.     In an R district, entrance stairways, entrance patios, or entrance decks may be located within the required front yard if the average downslope of the front 35 feet of the lot exceeds four feet fall in a horizontal distance of 10 feet.

 

This topic has been modified. View the section for details. 20.60.075 Regulations for accessory building or structure.
With the exception of setback, height and size limitations for second units in new or existing accessory structures outlined in Chapter 20.90 of this title, in any residential district, the following regulations shall apply to all other accessory buildings and structures as defined in this title.

A.    Setback Requirements. Accessory buildings or structures may not occupy any portion of a required interior or exterior yard with the following exceptions:

1.     Fences not exceeding seven feet in height in required interior yards and four feet in required exterior yards, or within 15 feet of the street corner of a corner lot.

2.     Steps, retaining walls, and similar functional design elements required for pedestrian or vehicle access to a structure shall be allowed within a setback based on the minimum design needed to make access feasible.

3.     Driveways, uncovered car decks, and retaining walls that support parking structures shall be allowed in setbacks, subject to Design Review as specified in Section 20.66.020.

A minimum separation of six feet must be maintained between an accessory structure, excluding below grade swimming pools, and the main building or any another structure on the property.

B.     Lot Coverage Requirements. In addition to the main structure, the amount of lot coverage resulting from any accessory building or structure shall be taken into account in determining whether a property is in compliance with the applicable lot coverage limitations set forth by the specific zoning on the property. No more than three accessory structures are permitted on any property excluding below grade swimming pools, and carports and garages which are necessary to satisfy applicable parking requirements for the specific zoning on the property.

C.     Height Requirements. Except as permitted herein, the height of an accessory structure or building, as measured in accordance with the provisions of Section 20.08.050 of the Mill Valley Municipal Code, shall not exceed 15 feet except that an accessory structure constructed above a new or existing parking structure may be increased pursuant to the provisions contained in Chapter 20.90 of this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a garage or carport which is necessary to satisfy applicable parking requirements for the specific zoning on the property shall be subject to the following height limitations:

1.     The overall height of the entire structure, as measured in accordance with the provisions of Section 20.08.050 of the Mill Valley Municipal Code, shall not exceed 30 feet.

2.     The height of the structure, as measured vertically from the finished floor elevation of the parking deck, but otherwise in accordance with the provisions of Section 20.08.050 of the Mill Valley Municipal Code, shall not exceed 25 feet.

D.    Maximum Size Requirements. The maximum gross floor area of an individual accessory structure, excluding swimming pools, shall be limited to 500 square feet of enclosed space as measured from the exterior walls of the proposed structure except that the gross floor area permitted for a residential second unit or residential second unit/garage structure is established pursuant to Chapter 20.90 of this title. (Ord. 1199 § 4, March 1, 2004; Ord. 1307 § 1, March 4, 2019)

 

20.60.080 Garages—Carports—Lot location regulated.
In any R district, front walls of garages or front posts of carports or parking decks must be set back at least 15 feet from an exterior property line, or 20 feet from the edge of the sidewalk or street paving nearest the exterior property line, whichever distance is greater if the average slope of the front 35 feet is 10% or less. They may be located to within three feet of the exterior property line if the average slope of the front 35 feet of the lot exceeds 40%. The permitted setback for garages, carports or parking decks for properties averaging between 39% and 11% in the front 35 feet shall be as follows:

Percentage of Slope in Front 35 Feet

This topic has been modified. View the section for details. 20.60.090 Parking space and car storage.
A.    Off-street parking spaces conforming to the requirements of Section 20.08.158 and acceptable to the City Engineer as usable under all weather conditions shall be installed on the premises prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the use or building involved. In addition to the provisions of Section 20.08.160, all parking spaces shall be provided with adequate ingress and egress and with appropriate turning and circulation areas as depicted on Table I entitled “Standards for Design of Parking

Spaces,” attached hereto and incorporated herein. For uses other than single residential, adequate turning radii shall be provided on the property to permit safe ingress and egress. Backing onto a public street shall not be permitted except in R-S districts.

B.     Where more than one use is included within any one building or on any single parcel, or on any series of parcels covered by any application before the City, the parking space requirements shall be the sum total of the requirements of the various uses; however, where the operation of these uses is such that hours of operation complement each other in regard to parking, the Planning Commission may authorize a reduction in these requirements.

 

 

C.     Parking spaces needed to meet the requirements of a particular building or use shall not be transformed or changed to another type of use, or transferred to meet the parking space requirements of another building or use, until the parking spaces required for the original use or building is provided at another location.

D.    Any building or use requiring one-half or more of a parking space shall be deemed to require the full space.

E.     The gross floor area for the purpose of determining the number of required parking spaces shall be the total floor area of all buildings devoted to the particular use involved, exclusive of floor area permanently allocated for parking or loading spaces.

F.     For any use, 25% of the required parking spaces may be for compact cars.

G.    When there is a change or expansion of a commercial use which is presently nonconforming because it does not satisfy parking space requirements, and additional parking spaces cannot reasonably be provided on the premises, no additional parking spaces or payments in lieu thereof shall be required so long as the changed or expanded use requires the same or fewer parking spaces than the immediately preceding use. The determination whether a changed or expanded use requires additional parking spaces shall be based upon a calculation of the net increase, if any, in the number of required parking spaces attributable to the changed or expanded use as compared to the number of required parking spaces attributable to the immediately preceding pre-existing uses on the site. If feasible, additional parking spaces shall be provided on site. If a change or expansion of a use results in an increased number of required parking spaces and the additional parking spaces cannot reasonably be provided on the site, then a parking variance shall be required. If approved, the parking variance may be conditioned upon a requirement that the applicant make payments in lieu of parking for the additional spaces pursuant to Section 20.60.095. This section shall not apply to any use which has been abandoned or discontinued as defined in Section 20.60.140.

H.    Off-street parking spaces shall be provided for specific uses and buildings in the following numbers:

I.      For existing commercial uses that cannot reasonably provide additional parking on site, the Director of Planning and Building may permit existing commercial parking spaces to be converted to required accessible parking spaces or access aisles, even if the conversion results in fewer parking spaces than required under this chapter.

26.

More parking spaces may be required as a condition of any conditional use permit or master plan approval when the Planning Commission finds that characteristics of a specific use require more parking, to relieve a critical shortage of curb space, to facilitate the free flow of traffic or to reduce a hazard to public safety.

 

 



(Ord. 611; Ord. 752 § 1; Ord. 859 § 1; Ord. 898 § 1; Ord. 961 §§ 1, 2, and 3, June 2, 1980; Ord. 1168 § 1, September 7, 1999; Ord. 1188 § 14, June 2, 2003; Ord. 1209, November 21, 2005; Ord. 1278 § 17, July 18, 2016)

 

20.60.095 Payments in lieu of providing off-street parking.
Where it can be demonstrated that the reasonable and practical development of property precludes the provision of required off-street parking, the Planning Commission may permit the requirements thereof to be satisfied in all areas zoned CG, CN and PA by the payment to the City of a sum equivalent to the estimated, normal, current cost to the City of providing required parking spaces to serve the contemplated use. Any off-street parking satisfied in this manner shall run with the land and any subsequent change of use which re-quires more parking shall require subsequent action to satisfy the additional parking requirement. No refund of such payments shall be made when there is a change to a use requiring less parking. Prior to issuance of a building permit and/or business license, the applicant shall either deposit the in lieu payment in one lump sum or agree to a payment schedule.

The maximum amount of payment for each required parking space shall be fixed by resolution adopted from time to time by the City Council. Funds derived from such payments shall be deposited by the City in a special fund, and, unless the applicant consents otherwise, shall be used and expended exclusively for the purpose of planning, designing, acquiring and developing off-street parking facilities located, insofar as practical, in the general vicinity of the property for which the in-lieu payments were made. A request for permission to make such payment in lieu of providing off-street parking shall be included with the variance application.

When a variance is granted from all or a portion of the off-street parking requirements of this title, such variance may be granted upon the condition that the applicant make payment to the City in accordance with the provision of this section. (Ord. 743 § 1; Ord. 805 § 1; Ord. 836 § 1; Ord. 852 § 1; Ord. 932 § 1; Ord. 961 § 4, June 2, 1980; Ord. 1168 § 2, September 7, 1999)

 

20.60.100 Loading space—Off-street parking.
Loading space off the street right-of-way, in addition to any required parking area, shall be required as follows:

A.    Retail stores, supply houses, warehouses, wholesale establishments, manufacturing or industrial establishments, and similar uses: One space for each establishment and not less than one space for each 10,000 square feet of gross area (ground or floor) used for the listed or related uses;

B.     Hotels, hospitals and public or semi-public buildings where large amounts of goods are received or shipped: One space for each establishment;

C.     In any case where the use involves the standing of vehicles, such as a service station or drive-in operation, no structure shall be located closer to a street than will permit space for the standing of vehicles off the street and adequate space for traffic movements.

 

20.60.140 Nonconforming uses and existing buildings.
The lawful use of land and structures which existed at the time of the adoption of this title on December 19, 1956, although such uses do not conform to the regulations herein specified for the district in which the lot or structure is located, may be continued provided that such use shall not be enlarged nor increased nor extended to occupy a greater area than that occupied by such use at the time of the adoption of this title and further provided that such use is not conducted in a manner constituting a public nuisance. A nonconforming structure or nonconforming area of a structure shall remain within the same occupancy classification as defined by the most recent version of the California Building Code. Intensifying the building or structure’s occupancy (e.g., from a non-habitable space to a habitable space) shall require compliance with all applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.

If such use or occupancy is abandoned or discontinued for a continuous period of one year, the subsequent use of such land or structure shall be in conformity with the regulations specified by this title for the district in which such lot is located. Temporary cessation of use for periods of time less than one year or where a property owner can demonstrate that he or she has diligently been attempting to lease the space shall not be regarded as an abandonment or discontinued use. If, not later than one year following cessation of use, the property owner applies for and thereafter diligently pursues necessary permits and approvals to authorize continuation of the use, the use shall not be regarded as abandoned or discontinued.

If a nonconforming commercial building is located in a residential district and still has economic life as a commercial building, the Planning Commission may, through the conditional use permit procedure, allow other commercial uses which, in its opinion, are similar in nature.

The purpose of planned unit development approval is to allow diversification in the relationships of various buildings and structures, and open spaces in planned building groups and in the allowable heights of said buildings and structures, to allow variation in lot sizes; to encourage comprehensive site-planning productive of optimum adaptation of development to the land, while insuring that the intent of this title in requiring adequate standards related to the public health, safety, and general welfare shall be observed.

B.     Limitation of Development and on Issuing Building Permits. After application for a P.U.D. approval, no development of the land involved shall be permitted, nor shall any building permit be issued for any structure to be located within the limits of the development until the applicant has filed written notice with the Commission that he or she is withdrawing his or her application for P.U.D. approval.

C.     Minimum Area. The minimum area of a P.U.D. shall be not less than four acres of undeveloped property, and/or property which may be redeveloped, but in no event may it comprise less than the entire contiguous property under one ownership.

The Planning Commission may require the submission of additional plans, data and information.

1.     No architectural drawings and plot plans shall be required in any single family residential district; provided that the Planning Commission at its discretion may require submission of said drawings and plans prior to approval of the P.U.D.

2.     In any multiple family, commercial, professional office or unclassified district, no architectural drawings need accompany the original application and the Planning Commission may give partial approval of the P.U.D. on this basis, but no building permit shall be issued, nor any construction commenced unless and until the drawings have been considered and approved by the Planning Commission and full approval of the P.U.D. secured.

3.     Where completed drawings are considered, planned unit development approval shall be noticed as provided for in Section 20.60.200.

F.     Public Hearings. At least one public hearing shall be held on each application.

That all residential development will constitute an environment of sustained desirability and stability, will be in harmony with the character of the surrounding neighborhood, and will result in an intensity of land utilization no higher than, and standards of open spaces at least as high as permitted, or as otherwise specified, for the district in which this development occurs.

4.     That all commercial development will create no traffic congestion, will not interfere with any projected improvements, has provided for proper entrances and exits along with proper provisions for internal traffic and parking, and that the development will be an attractive and efficient center which will fit harmoniously into and will have no adverse effects upon the adjacent and surrounding existing or prospective development.

5.     That the development of an harmonious, integrated whole justifies exceptions, if such are required, to the normal requirements of this title, and that the contemplated arrangements or use make it desirable to apply regulations and requirements differing from those ordinarily applicable under the district regulations.

H.    Action by Commission and City Council. The Planning Commission may recommend to the City Council approval, conditional approval or denial of an application for a P.U.D. Upon receipt of the report of the action of the Planning Commission, the City Council, after public hearing, may affirm, modify or reverse the decision of the Planning Commission.

20.64.045 Entertainment—Alcoholic beverages—Special use permit considerations.
The City of Mill Valley is a predominantly residential community. Commercial zones within the City are intended primarily to provide local retail and service businesses necessary to serve adjoining residential areas. They are to serve as neighborhood commercial zones and are not intended for the purpose of providing retail and service businesses on a regional basis. In order to maintain its community character, it is desirable to restrict or limit certain types of uses. Establishments which provide live entertainment and/or which serve alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises could have a detrimental effect on the community if established in larger numbers, or if established without adequate controls as hereinafter set forth. The location, number and manner of operation of such uses should be controlled to strengthen and promote the stability, balance and predominantly residential character of the City. For these reasons, the Planning Commission, before making the findings required by Section 20.64.040 with respect to such uses, shall consider, among other things, the following:

A.    The location of the proposed use and its relationship and effect upon residential or other areas of the City and surrounding uses;

B.     The number of such uses presently existing or recently approved within the affected neighborhood and within the City;

C.     The need of the community for additional numbers of such uses, paying particular heed to the question of whether the neighborhood is already adequately served by similar uses;

D.    The hours of operation of the proposed use and the potential conflict of those hours with the health, safety and comfort of the residents of the neighborhood;

E.     The relationship and/or conformance of the use to the goals, objectives and policies of the City’s General Plan or any specific plans adopted or under consideration;

F.     The recommendations of the City Engineer, Police and Fire Departments as to traffic, safety and other matters;

G.    The impact on the community of any proposed entertainment. (Ord. 826 § 1, August 5, 1974)

 

20.64.046 Entertainment—Alcoholic beverages—Special use permit conditions.
Prior to approving a conditional use permit for establishments which provide live entertainment and/or which serve alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises, the Planning Commission, in making the findings set forth in Section 20.64.040, shall consider the following matters, among others, and the necessity of imposing specific conditions with respect thereto:

A.    Off-Street Parking. Parking requirements may be imposed exceeding those set forth in Chapter 20.60.

B.     Ventilation. Doors and windows may be required to be closed between certain hours. The applicant may be required to install and maintain mechanical equipment sufficient to provide adequate ventilation without reliance upon open doors and windows. The applicant may be required to provide the building official with the necessary engineering data to verify that this condition can be met.

C.     Noise. The applicant may be required to provide adequate measures controlling noise within and without the premises.

D.    Hours of Operation. Hours of operation may be restricted. These hours may be subject to adjustment at each periodic review of the application.

E.     Seating Capacity and Occupancy Load. Seating capacity and occupancy load may be limited and the applicant required to provide reasonable means of enforcing such limitations. (Ord. 826 § 2, August 5, 1974)

 

20.64.047 Entertainment—Alcoholic beverages—Conditional use permit review.
Because establishments which provide live entertainment and/or which serve alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises could have detrimental effects which are difficult to foresee upon original examination, conditional use permits for such establishments shall be reviewed six months after issuance and not less than annually thereafter. Upon such review, the conditions of the conditional use permit may be modified if necessary to achieve the objectives of this chapter, or the same may be revoked for the reasons set forth in Section 20.64.140. Any such modification or revocation shall be subject to the notice, hearing and appeal provisions of this title. (Ord. 826 § 3; Ord. 880 § 1, October 21, 1976)

 

20.64.050 Building permit issuance—Use permit or variance.
No building permit shall be issued where a use permit or variance is required until such use permit or variance has been granted, and then only in accordance with the terms and conditions of the use permit or variance so granted. No building permit shall be issued until the 10-day appeal period as provided in this title has elapsed. If an appeal is filed, in writing, then no building permit may be issued before the matter has been settled.

 

20.64.060 Variances—Conditions governing grant of.
When, because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict application of the provisions of this title will deprive such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under identical zoning classification, or deprive provision of solar access, variances may be granted by the Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator as provided in this chapter; provided, however, that no variance may be granted under this title which authorizes a use or activity which is not otherwise expressly authorized by the zone regulation governing the parcel of property. Any decision granting a variance shall expressly set forth the findings of fact which support such decision. (Ord. 892 § 2; Ord. 932 § 6; Ord. 999 § 6, November 15, 1982)

A.    That there are exceptions, or extraordinary circumstances, or conditions applying to the land, building or use referred to in the application, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to the property in question, and do not apply generally to land, buildings and/or uses in the same district.

B.     That the hardship is not due to any action on the part of the applicant.

C.     That the granting of the application is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of reasonable property rights of the petitioner.

D.    That the granting of such application will not under the circumstances of the particular case, affect adversely the health, comfort or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the property of the applicant and will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood. (Ord. 788 § 5; Ord. 932 § 7, November 20, 1978)

 

20.64.080 Variances—Public hearing.

The Planning Commission or Zoning Administrator may designate such conditions in connection with a variance as deemed necessary to secure the purpose of this title and may require such guarantees and evidences that said conditions are being or will be complied with. (Ord. 932 § 8, November 20, 1978)

 

20.64.100 Variances for solar access.

20.64.110 Construction after notice of violation.
If the applicant for a conditional use permit or a variance has been notified by the City in writing that a structure has been commenced in violation of the terms and conditions of this title, and construction continues after such notice, a fee of $1,000.00 shall be paid by the applicant.

 

20.64.140 Revocation and expiration—Use permits—Variances.
Any use permit or variance may be revoked if any of the conditions or terms of such use permit or variance are violated or for other good cause. In such case the Planning Commission shall hold a hearing on the proposed revocation, after giving written notice to the permittee at least 10 days prior to the hearing, and shall submit its recommendations to the City Council. The City Council shall act thereon within 30 days.

Any use permit, variance or plan review becomes null and void if not exercised within one year following the date the same is granted; provided, however, that when a use permit, variance or plan review has not been exercised within one year and good cause for such delay has been shown, the Planning Commission may grant an extension of not more than one year within which such conditional use permit, variance or plan review may be exercised.

Continuing violations shall constitute a separate offense for every day the violation occurs or continues. Any individual who personally, or through an agent, employee, or representative, commits a violation under this chapter shall be subject to the following fines:

A.    The fines for tree damage or removal of any protected tree shall be as follows:

1.     For the first violation:

a.     A minimum of $1,000.00 for non-heritage tree removals, or the replacement value of the tree, whichever is greater.

b.     A minimum of $5,000.00 for heritage tree removals, or the replacement value of the tree, whichever is greater.

2.     Each tree damaged or destroyed shall be considered a separate offense. If multiple trees are damaged or destroyed in the same incident, the fines above shall be levied for each tree.

3.     For each additional violation an individual commits within a 24-month period, regardless of the location of the violation, the fines shall be double those specified in subsection (A)(1) above.

4.     In the event that the condition of an illegally removed tree cannot be determined after its removal, the condition of the tree shall be assumed to be in excellent condition for the purposes of establishing the replacement value.

5.     When required, the replacement value of a tree shall be established by the City Arborist in accordance with the most recent published edition of the “Guide for Plant Appraisal” by the Council of Tree and Landscape.

6.     The City’s Planning Department shall maintain a list of qualified tree care professionals who have signed affidavits attesting to their understanding and adherence to the City’s tree ordinance requirements. If a property owner contracts for tree work with a qualified tree care professional appearing on the list, any fines for a violation of this chapter shall be assessed to the qualified tree care professional, and the qualified tree care professional shall be removed from such list. If a property owner conducts the tree work or contracts for tree work with any party not on the Planning Department’s list of qualified tree care professionals, any and all violation fines shall be assessed to the property owner.

B.     In addition to assessment of fines, each tree removal shall be subject to replacement as follows:

1.     Non-heritage trees shall be replaced at a ratio of 3:1 for each tree removed.

2.     Heritage trees shall be replaced based on the following formula:

For each six inches or fraction thereof of the diameter of a tree which was not approved for removal, three trees of the same genus and species as the removed tree (or another native species, if approved by the Director), each of a minimum 24-inch box size, shall be planted on the project site, provided however, that an increased number of smaller size trees of the same genus and species may be planted if approved by the Director, or a fewer number of such trees of a larger size if approved by the Director.

3.     Replacement trees shall be subject to the provisions of Section 20.67.150.

C.     In addition to the above mitigations, violators shall be liable for all costs associated with taking corrective action deemed reasonably necessary as the result of a violation of this chapter, including the planting of replacement trees, erosion control and slope stabilization. At the City’s option, any necessary corrective action may be undertaken pursuant to the nuisance abatement procedures set forth in Chapters 8.04 and 20.66 of this Code.

(Ord. 1304 § 1, September 6, 2018)

 

20.73.020 Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter, the following defined terms shall have the meaning set forth in this section unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

1.     “Accessory equipment” means any equipment associated with the installation of a wireless telecommunications facility, including, but not limited to, cabling, generators, air conditioning units, electrical panels, equipment shelters, equipment cabinets, equipment buildings, pedestals, meters, vaults, splice boxes, and surface location markers.

2.     “Antenna” means that part of a wireless telecommunications facility designed to radiate or receive radio frequency signals or electromagnetic waves for the provision of services, including, but not limited to, cellular, paging, personal communications services (PCS) and microwave communications. Such devices include, but are not limited to, directional antennas, such as panel antenna, microwave dishes, and satellite dishes; omnidirectional antennas; wireless access points (Wi-Fi); and strand-mounted wireless access points. This definition does not apply to broadcast antennas, antennas designed for amateur radio use, or satellite dishes designed for residential or household purposes.

3.     “Base station” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(1), as may be amended, which defines that term as a structure or equipment at a fixed location that enables FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a communications network. The term does not encompass a tower as defined in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(9) or any equipment associated with a tower. The term includes, but is not limited to, equipment associated with wireless communications services such as private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul. The term includes, but is not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, regular and backup power supplies, and comparable equipment, regardless of technological configuration (including distributed antenna systems and small-cell networks). The term includes any structure other than a tower that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the State or local government under this section, supports or houses equipment described in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(1)(i) and (ii) that has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another State or local regulatory review process, even if the structure was not built for the sole or primary purpose of providing such support. The term does not include any structure that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the State or local government under this section, does not support or house equipment described in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(1)(i) and (ii).

4.     “Building-mounted” means mounted to the side or façade, but not the roof, of a building or another structure such as a water tank, pump station, church steeple, freestanding sign, or similar structure.

5.     “Cellular” means an analog or digital wireless telecommunications technology that is based on a system of interconnected neighboring cell sites.

6.     “Collocation” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(2), as may be amended, which defines that term as the mounting or installation of transmission equipment on an eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting or receiving radio frequency signals for communications purposes. As an illustration and not a limitation, the FCC’s definition effectively means “to add” and does not necessarily refer to more than one wireless telecommunication facility installed at a single site.

7.     “Eligible facilities request” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(3), as may be amended, which defines that term as any request for modification of an existing tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station, involving: (1) collocation of new transmission equipment; (2) removal of transmission equipment; or (3) replacement of transmission equipment.

8.     “Eligible support structure” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R.

9.     “Existing” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(4), as may be amended, which provides that a constructed tower or base station is existing for purposes of the FCC’s Section 6409(a) regulations if it has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another state or local regulatory review process, provided that a tower that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a zoned area when it was built, but was lawfully constructed, is existing for purposes of this definition.

10.   “FCC” means the Federal Communications Commission or its duly appointed successor agency.

11.   “Modification” means any change to an existing wireless telecommunications facility that involves any of the following: collocation, expansion, modification, alteration, enlargement, intensification, reduction, or augmentation, including, but not limited to, a change in size, shape, color, visual design, or exterior material. Modification does not include repair, replacement, or maintenance if those actions do not involve a change to the existing facility involving any of the following: collocation, expansion, modification, alteration, enlargement, intensification, reduction, or augmentation.

12.   “Monopole” means a structure consisting of a single pole used to support antennas or related equipment and includes a monopine, monoredwood, and similar monopoles camouflaged to resemble trees or other objects.

13.   “Personal wireless services” means the same as defined in 47 U.S.C. Section 332(c)(7)(C)(i), as may be amended, which defines the term as commercial mobile services, unlicensed wireless services and common carrier wireless exchange access services.

14.   “Personal wireless service facilities” means the same as defined in 47 U.S.C. Section 332(c)(7)(C)(i), as may be amended, which defines the term as facilities that provide personal wireless services.

21.   “Section 6409(a)” means Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-96, 126 Stat. 156, codified as 47 U.S.C. Section 1455(a), as such law may be amended from time to time.

22.   “Section 6409(a) approval” means the approval required by Section 6409(a).

23.   “Site” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(6), as may be amended, which provides that for towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the tower and any access or utility easements currently related to the site, and, for other eligible support structures, further restricted to that area in proximity to the structure and to other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground.

24.   “Substantial change” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(7), as may be amended, which defines that term differently based on the particular wireless facility type (tower or base station) and location (in or outside the public right-of-way). For clarity, this definition organizes the FCC’s criteria and thresholds for a substantial change according to the wireless facility type and location.

a.     For towers outside the public rights-of-way, a substantial change occurs when:

i.      The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than 10% or the height of one additional antenna array not to exceed 20 feet (whichever is greater); or

ii.     The proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than 20 feet from the edge of the wireless tower or the width of the wireless tower at the level of the appurtenance (whichever is greater); or

iii.    The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four; or

iv.    The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the wireless tower, including any access or utility easements currently related to the site.

b.     For towers in the public rights-of-way and for all base stations, a substantial change occurs when:

i.      The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than 10% or 10 feet (whichever is greater); or

ii.     The proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than six feet from the edge of the wireless tower or base station; or

iii.    The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground when there are no existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or

iv.    The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new ground-mounted equipment cabinets that are 10% larger in height or volume than any existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or

v.     The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground.

c.     In addition, for all towers and base stations wherever located, a substantial change occurs when:

i.      The proposed collocation or modification would defeat the existing concealment elements of the support structure as determined by the Zoning Administrator; or

ii.     The proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval, provided however that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to height, width, equipment cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in this section.

The thresholds for a substantial change outlined above are disjunctive. The failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds means that a substantial change would occur. The thresholds for height increases are cumulative limits. For sites with horizontally separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the originally-permitted support structure without regard to any increases in size due to wireless equipment not included in the original design. For sites with vertically separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the permitted site dimensions as they existed on February 22, 2012—the date that Congress passed Section 6409(a).

25.   “Telecommunications tower” or “tower” means a freestanding mast, pole, monopole, guyed tower, lattice tower, free standing tower or other structure designed and primarily used to support wireless telecommunications facility antennas.

26.   “Transmission equipment” means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(8), as may be amended, which defines that term as equipment that facilitates transmission for any FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communication service, including, but not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, and regular and backup power supply. The term includes equipment associated with wireless communications services including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul.

The City may modify the permit to reflect such conditions, changes or limitations by following the same notice and public hearing procedures as are applicable to the grant of a wireless telecommunications facility permit for similarly located facilities, except the permittee shall be given notice by personal service or by registered or certified mail at the last address provided to the City by the permittee.

2.     The permittee shall not move, alter, temporarily relocate, change, or interfere with any existing structure, improvement or property without the prior consent of the owner of that structure, improvement or property. No structure, improvement or property owned by the City shall be moved to accommodate a wireless telecommunications facility unless the City determines that such movement will not adversely affect the City or any surrounding businesses or residents, and the permittee pays all costs and expenses related to the relocation of the City’s structure, improvement or property. Prior to commencement of any work pursuant to an encroachment permit issued for any facility within the public right-of-way, the permittee shall provide the City with documentation establishing to the City’s satisfaction that the permittee has the legal right to use or interfere with any other structure, improvement or property within the public right-of-way to be affected by applicant’s facilities.

3.     The permittee shall assume full liability for damage or injury caused to any property or person by the facility.

4.     The permittee shall repair, at its sole cost and expense, any damage including, but not limited to, subsidence, cracking, erosion, collapse, weakening, or loss of lateral support to City streets, sidewalks, walks, curbs, gutters, trees, parkways, street lights, traffic signals, improvements of any kind or nature, or utility lines and systems, underground utility line and systems, or sewer systems and sewer lines that result from any activities performed in connection with the installation or maintenance of a wireless telecommunications facility in the public right-of-way. The permittee shall restore such areas, structures and systems to the condition in which they existed prior to the installation or maintenance that necessitated the repairs. In the event the permittee fails to complete such repair within the number of days stated on a written notice by the Zoning Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall cause such repair to be completed at permittee’s sole cost and expense.

5.     Prior to issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall obtain the Zoning Administrator’s approval of a tree protection plan prepared by a certified arborist if the installation of the wireless telecommunication facility will be located within the canopy of a street tree, or a protected tree on private property, or within a 10-foot radius of the base of such a tree. Depending on site specific criteria (e.g., location of tree, size, and type of tree, etc.), a radius greater than 10 feet may be required by the Zoning Administrator.

6.     Should any utility company offer electrical service that does not require the use of a meter cabinet, the permittee shall at its sole cost and expense remove the meter cabinet and any related foundation within 30 days of such service being offered and reasonably restore the area to its prior condition.

7.     The permittee shall modify, remove, or relocate its facility, or portion thereof, without cost or expense to the City, if and when made necessary by:

a.     Any public improvement project, including, but not limited to, the construction, maintenance, or operation of any underground or aboveground facilities including, but not limited to, sewers, storm drains, conduits, gas, water, electric or other utility systems, or pipes owned by the City or any other public agency;

b.     Any abandonment of any street, sidewalk, or other public facility;

c.     Any change of grade, alignment or width of any street, sidewalk or other public facility; or

d.     A determination by the Zoning Administrator that the wireless telecommunications facility has become incompatible with public health, safety or welfare or the public’s use of the public right-of-way.

8.     Any modification, removal, or relocation of the facility shall be completed within 90 days of written notification by the City unless exigencies dictate a shorter period for removal or relocation. Modification or relocation of the facility shall require submittal, review and approval of a permit amendment pursuant to the Mill Valley Municipal Code. The permittee shall be entitled, on permittee’s election, to either a pro-rata refund of fees paid for the original permit or to a new permit, without additional fee, at a location as close to the original location as the standards set forth in the Mill Valley Municipal Code allow. In the event the facility is not modified, removed, or relocated within said period of time, the City may cause the same to be done at the sole cost and expense of permittee. Further, due to exigent circumstances as provided in the Mill Valley Municipal Code, the City may modify, remove, or relocate wireless telecommunications facilities without prior notice to permittee provided permittee is notified within a reasonable period thereafter. (Ord. 1304 § 1, September 6, 2018)

 

20.73.120 Findings.
A.    Where a wireless telecommunication facility requires a conditional use permit under this chapter, the reviewing authority shall not approve any application unless, in addition to the findings generally applicable to all conditional use permits, all of the following additional findings are made:

1.     The proposed facility complies with all applicable provisions of this chapter.

2.     The proposed facility has been designed and located to achieve compatibility with the community to the maximum extent reasonably feasible.

3.     The applicant has submitted a statement of its willingness to allow other carriers to collocate on the proposed wireless telecommunications facility wherever technically and economically feasible and where collocation would not harm community compatibility.

4.     Noise generated by equipment will not be excessive, annoying nor be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare and will not exceed the standards set forth in this chapter.

B.     In addition to the findings in subsection A of this section, approval of a wireless telecommunications facility permit for a facility that will be located in the public right-of-way may be granted only if the following findings are made by the reviewing authority:

1.     The applicant has provided substantial written evidence supporting the applicant’s claim that it has the right to enter the public right-of-way pursuant to state or federal law, or the applicant has entered into a franchise or other agreement with the City permitting them to use the public right-of-way.

2.     The applicant has demonstrated that the facility will not interfere with the use of the public right-of-way, existing subterranean infrastructure, or the City’s plans for modification or use of such location and infrastructure. (Ord. 1304 § 1, September 6, 2018)

 

20.73.130 Exceptions.
A.    Exceptions pertaining to any provision of this chapter, including, but not limited to, exceptions from findings that would otherwise justify denial, may be granted by the reviewing authority if the reviewing authority makes the finding that:

1.     Denial of the facility as proposed would violate federal law, state law, or both; or

2.     A provision of this chapter, as applied to applicant, would deprive applicant of its rights under federal law, state law, or both.

B.     An applicant may only request an exception at the time of applying for a wireless telecommunications facility permit. The request must include both the specific provision(s) of this chapter from which the exception is sought and the basis of the request. Any request for an exception after the City has deemed an application complete shall be treated as a new application.

C.     Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a conditional use permit shall be required for a facility when an exception is requested.

D.    The applicant shall have the burden of proving that denial of the facility as proposed would violate federal law, state law, or both, or that the provisions of this chapter, as applied to applicant, would deprive applicant of its rights under federal law, state law, or both, using the evidentiary standards required by that law at issue. The City shall have the right to hire an independent consultant, at the applicant’s expense, to evaluate the issues raised by the exception request and shall have the right to submit rebuttal evidence to refute the applicant’s claim. (Ord. 1304 § 1, September 6, 2018)

 

20.73.140 Wireless telecommunications facilities covered under Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012.
A.    Purpose. Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Pub. L. 112-96, codified in 47 U.S.C. Section 1455(a), generally requires that state and local governments “may not deny, and shall approve” requests to collocate, remove or replace transmission equipment at an existing tower or base station. Federal Communication Commission regulations interpret this statute and create procedural rules for local review, which generally preempt certain subjective land-use regulations, limit permit application content requirements and provide the applicant with a potential “deemed granted” remedy when the state or local government fails to approve or deny the request within 60 days after submittal (accounting for any tolling periods). Moreover, whereas Section 704 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, codified in 47 U.S.C. Section 332, applies to only “personal wireless service facilities” (e.g., cellular telephone towers and equipment), Section 6409(a) applies to all “wireless” facilities licensed or authorized by the FCC (e.g., cellular, Wi-Fi, satellite, microwave backhaul, etc.).

The overlap between wireless deployments covered under Section 6409(a) and other wireless deployments, combined with the different substantive and procedural rules applicable to such deployments, creates a potential for confusion that harms the public interest in both efficient wireless facilities deployment and carefully planned community development in accordance with local values. A separate permit application and review process specifically designed for compliance with Section 6409(a) contained in a section devoted to Section 6409(a) will mitigate such potential confusion, streamline local review and preserve the City’s land-use authority to the maximum extent possible.

B.     Applicability. This section applies to all collocations or modifications to an existing wireless tower or base station submitted with a written request for approval pursuant to Section 6409(a).

C.     Approval Required. Any request to collocate, replace or remove transmission equipment at an existing wireless tower or base station submitted with a written request for a Section 6409(a) approval shall be subject to the Zoning Administrator’s approval, conditional approval or denial without prejudice pursuant to the standards and procedures contained in this chapter.

D.    Other Regulatory Approvals. No collocation or modification approved under any Section 6409(a) approval may occur unless the applicant also obtains all other applicable permits or regulatory approvals from the City and state or federal agencies. Furthermore, any Section 6409(a) approval granted under this chapter shall remain subject to any and all lawful conditions or requirements associated with such other permits or regulatory approvals from the City and state or federal agencies.

E.     Application Requirement. The City shall not approve any wireless facility subject to this chapter except upon a duly filed application consistent with this section and any other written rules the City or the Zoning Administrator may establish from time to time. An application must include the information required by Section 20.73.050 and the following additional information:

1.     A title report prepared within the six months prior to the application filing date in order for the City verify the property owner’s identity. If the applicant does not own the subject property, the application must include a written authorization signed by the property owner that empowers the applicant to file the application and perform all wireless facility construction, installation, operation and maintenance to the extent described in the application.

2.     A written statement that explains in plain factual detail whether and why Section 6409(a) and the related FCC regulations at 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001 et seq., require approval for the specific project. A complete written narrative analysis will state the applicable standard and all the facts that allow the City to conclude the standard has been met. Bare conclusions not factually supported do not constitute a complete written analysis. As part of this written statement the applicant must also include: (a) whether and why the support structure qualifies as an existing tower or existing base station; and (b) whether and why the proposed collocation or modification does not cause a substantial change in height, width, excavation, equipment cabinets, concealment or permit compliance.

F.     Procedures for a Duly Filed Application. The City shall not review any application unless duly filed in accordance with this section, as follows:

1.     Pre-Submittal Conference. Before application submittal, applicants must schedule and attend a pre-application meeting with the Zoning Administrator for all proposed modifications submitted for approval pursuant to Section 6409(a). The pre-submittal conference is intended to streamline the review process through informal discussion that includes, without limitation, the appropriate project classification, including whether the project qualifies for Section 6409(a); any latent issues in connection with the existing tower or base station; potential concealment issues (if applicable); coordination with other City departments responsible for application review; and application completeness issues. To mitigate unnecessary delays due to application incompleteness, applicants are encouraged (but not required) to bring any draft applications or other materials so that City staff may provide informal feedback about whether such applications or other materials may be incomplete or unacceptable. The Zoning Administrator may, in the Zoning Administrator’s discretion, grant a written exemption to the submittal appointment under Section 20.73.140(F)(2) or for a specific requirement for a complete application to any applicant who: (a) schedules, attends and fully participates in any pre-submittal conference; and (b) shows to the Zoning Administrator’s satisfaction that such specific requirement duplicates information already provided in other materials to be submitted or is otherwise unnecessary to the City’s review under facts and circumstances in that particular case. Any written exemption will be limited to the project discussed at the pre-submittal conference and will not be extended to any other project.

2.     Submittal Appointment. All applications must be filed with the City at a pre-scheduled appointment. Applicants may generally submit one application per appointment, but may schedule successive appointments for multiple applications whenever feasible and not prejudicial to other applicants. Any application received without an appointment, whether delivered in-person or through any other means, will not be considered duly filed unless the applicant received a written exemption from the Zoning Administrator at a pre-submittal conference.

3.     Appointment Scheduling Procedures. For any event in the submittal process that requires an appointment, applicants must submit a written request to the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall endeavor to provide applicants with an appointment as soon as reasonably feasible and within five business days after a written request is received.

4.     Applications Deemed Withdrawn. To promote efficient review and timely decisions, an application will be automatically deemed withdrawn by the applicant when the applicant fails to tender a substantive response to the City within 90 calendar days after the City deems the application incomplete in a written notice to the applicant. The Zoning Administrator may, in the Zoning Administrator’s discretion, grant a written extension for up to an additional 30 calendar days when the applicant submits a written request prior to the 90th day that shows good cause to grant the extension. Delays due to circumstances outside the applicant’s reasonable control will be considered good cause to grant the extension.

5.     Departmental Forms, Rules and Other Regulations. The City Council authorizes the Zoning Administrator to develop and publish permit application forms, checklists, informational handouts and other related materials that the Zoning Administrator finds necessary, appropriate or useful for processing requests for Section 6409(a) approvals. Without further authorization from the City Council, the Zoning Administrator may, from time to time, update and alter any such permit application forms, checklists, informational handouts and other related materials as the Zoning Administrator deems necessary, appropriate or useful to respond to regulatory, technological or other changes related to this chapter. The City Council authorizes the Zoning Administrator to establish other reasonable rules and regulations, which may include, without limitation, regular hours for appointments with applicants, as the Zoning Administrator deems necessary or appropriate to organize, document and manage the application intake process.

G.    Administrative Review—Decision Notices. The Zoning Administrator shall administratively review an application for a Section 6409(a) approval and act on such an application without prior notice or a public hearing. Within five working days after the Zoning Administrator conditionally approves or denies an application submitted for Section 6409(a) approval or before the FCC timeframe for review expires (whichever occurs first), the Zoning Administrator shall send a written notice to the applicant. In the event that the Zoning Administrator determines that an application submitted for approval pursuant to Section 6409(a) does not qualify for approval, the Zoning Administrator will send written notice to the applicant that includes the reasons to support the review authority’s decision and states that the application will be automatically denied without prejudice on the 60th day after the date the application was filed unless the applicant withdraws the application.

H.    Required Findings for 6409(a) Approval. The Zoning Administrator may approve or conditionally approve an application submitted for Section 6409(a) approval when the Zoning Administrator finds that the proposed project:

1.     Involves collocation, removal or replacement of transmission equipment on an existing wireless tower or base station; and

2.     Does not substantially change the physical dimensions of the existing wireless tower or base station.

I.      Criteria for Denial Without Prejudice. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this chapter, and consistent with all applicable federal laws and regulations, the Zoning Administrator may deny without prejudice an application submitted for approval pursuant to Section 6409(a) when it finds that the proposed project:

1.     Does not satisfy the criteria for approval;

2.     Violates any legally enforceable standard or permit condition reasonably related to public health and safety then in effect; or

3.     Involves the replacement of the entire support structure.

J.      Conditional 6409(a) Approvals. Subject to any applicable limitations in federal or state law, nothing in this chapter is intended to limit the City’s authority to conditionally approve an application for a Section 6409(a) approval to protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare.

K.    Appeals. Notwithstanding any provision of the Mill Valley Municipal Code to the contrary an applicant may appeal a decision by the Zoning Administrator to deny without prejudice a Section 6409(a) application. The appeal must be filed within 10 days from the Zoning Administrator’s decision. The appeal must state in plain terms the grounds for reversal and the facts that support those grounds. The City Manager shall serve as the appellate authority for all appeals of all actions of the Zoning Administrator taken pursuant to this section. The City shall provide notice for an administrative hearing by the City Manager. The City Manager shall limit its review to whether the project should be approved or denied in accordance with the provisions in subsections H and I of this section. The decision of the City Manager shall be final and not subject to any further administrative appeals.

L.     Standard Conditions of Approval. In addition to all other conditions adopted by the Zoning Administrator, all Section 6409(a) approvals, whether approved by the Zoning Administrator or deemed approved by the operation of law, shall be automatically subject to the following conditions in this section; provided, however, that the Zoning Administrator shall have discretion to modify or amend these conditions on a case-by-case basis as may be necessary or appropriate under the circumstances:

1.     Approved Plans. Before the permittee submits any application for a building permit or other permits required by the Mill Valley Municipal Code, the permittee must incorporate the wireless telecommunications facility permit granted under this section, all conditions associated with the wireless telecommunications facility permit and the approved plans and any photo simulations (the “approved plans”) into the project plans. The permittee must construct, install and operate the wireless telecommunications facility in strict compliance with the approved plans. The permittee shall submit an as built drawing within 90 days after installation of the facility.

2.     Permit Term. The City’s grant or grant by operation of law of a Section 6409(a) approval constitutes a federally-mandated modification to the underlying permit or other prior regulatory authorization for the subject tower or base station. The City’s grant or grant by operation of law of a Section 6409(a) approval will not extend the permit term, if any, for any conditional use permit, or other underlying prior regulatory authorization. Accordingly, the term for a Section 6409(a) approval shall be coterminous with the underlying permit or other prior regulatory authorization for the subject tower or base station.

3.     Accelerated Permit Terms Due to Invalidation. In the event that any court of competent jurisdiction invalidates any portion of Section 6409(a) or any FCC rule that interprets Section 6409(a) such that federal law would not mandate approval for any Section 6409(a) approval, such 6409(a) approvals shall automatically expire one year from the effective date of the judicial order, unless the decision would not authorize accelerated termination of previously approved Section 6409(a) approvals or the Zoning Administrator grants an extension upon written request from the permittee that shows good cause for the extension, which includes, without limitation, extreme financial hardship. Notwithstanding anything in the previous sentence to the contrary, the Zoning Administrator may not grant a permanent exemption or indefinite extension. A permittee shall not be required to remove its improvements approved under the invalidated Section 6409(a) approval when it has submitted an application for a conditional use permit for those improvements before the one-year period ends.

4.     No Waiver of Standing. The City’s grant or grant by operation of law of a Section 6409(a) approval does not waive, and shall not be construed to waive, any standing by the City to challenge Section 6409(a), any FCC rules that interpret Section 6409(a) or any Section 6409(a) approval.

5.     Build-Out Period. The Section 6409(a) approval will automatically expire one year from the issuance date unless the permittee obtains all other permits and approvals required to install, construct and operate the approved wireless facility, which includes without limitation any permits or approvals required by the any federal, state or local public agencies with jurisdiction over the subject property, the wireless facility or its use. The Zoning Administrator may grant one written extension to a date certain when the permittee shows good cause to extend the limitations period in a written request for an extension submitted at least 30 days prior to the automatic expiration date in this condition. Any further extensions may be granted by the Planning Commission.

6.     Maintenance Obligations—Vandalism. The permittee shall keep the site, which includes, without limitation, any and all improvements, equipment, structures, access routes, fences and landscape features, in a neat, clean and safe condition in accordance with the approved plans and all conditions in this Section 6409(a) approval. The permittee shall keep the site area free from all litter and debris at all times. The permittee, at no cost to the City, shall remove and remediate any graffiti or other vandalism at the site within 48 hours after the permittee receives notice or otherwise becomes aware that such graffiti or other vandalism occurred.

7.     Compliance with Laws. The permittee shall maintain compliance at all times with all federal, state and local statutes, regulations, orders or other rules that carry the force of law (“laws”) applicable to the permittee, the subject property, the wireless facility or any use or activities in connection with the use authorized in this Section 6409(a) approval. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that this obligation is intended to be broadly construed and that no other specific requirements in these conditions are intended to reduce, relieve or otherwise lessen the permittee’s obligations to maintain compliance with all laws.

8.     Adverse Impacts on Other Properties. The permittee shall use all reasonable efforts to avoid any and all undue or unnecessary adverse impacts on nearby properties that may arise from the permittee’s construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair, removal or other activities at the site. The permittee shall not perform or cause others to perform any construction, installation, operation, modification, maintenance, repair, removal or other work that involves heavy equipment or machines on any day and at any time prohibited under the Mill Valley Municipal Code. The restricted work hours in this condition will not prohibit any work required to prevent an actual, immediate harm to property or persons, or any work during an emergency declared by the City. The Zoning Administrator may issue a stop work order for any work that violates this condition.

9.     Noise Complaints. The permittee shall conduct all activities on the site in compliance with the noise standards in the Mill Valley Municipal Code. In the event that any person files a noise complaint and the City verifies that such complaint is valid, the permittee must remedy the violation within 10 days after notice from the City, which may include a demonstration that the permittee has amended its operational guidelines in situations where the violation arises from the permittee’s personnel rather than the permittee’s equipment.

10.   Inspections—Emergencies. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the City or its designee may enter onto the site and inspect the improvements and equipment upon reasonable prior notice to the permittee; provided, however, that the City or its designee may, but will not be obligated to, enter onto the site area without prior notice to support, repair, disable or remove any improvements or equipment in emergencies or when such improvements or equipment threatens actual, imminent harm to property or persons. The permittee will be permitted to supervise the City or its designee while such inspection or emergency access occurs.

11.   Contact Information. The permittee shall furnish the City with accurate and up-to-date contact information for a person responsible for the wireless facility, which includes, without limitation, such person’s full name, title, direct telephone number, facsimile number, mailing address and email address. The permittee shall keep such contact information up-to-date at all times.

12.   Indemnification. The permittee and, if applicable, the property owner upon which the wireless facility is installed shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the City, its agents, officers, officials, employees and volunteers from any and all: (a) damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs and expenses and from any and all claims, demands, law suits, writs and other actions or proceedings (“claims”) brought against the City or its agents, officers, officials, employees or volunteers to challenge, attack, seek to modify, set aside, void or annul the City’s approval of this Section 6409(a) approval; and (b) other claims any kind or form, whether for personal injury, death or property damage, that arise from or in connection with the permittee’s or its agents’, directors’, officers’, employees’, contractors’, subcontractors’, licensees’, or customers’ acts or omissions in connection with this Section 6409(a) approval or the wireless facility. In the event the City becomes aware any claims, the City will use best efforts to promptly notify the permittee and the private property owner and shall reasonably cooperate in the defense. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the City shall have the right to approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, the legal counsel providing the City’s defense, and the property owner or permittee (as applicable) shall promptly reimburse the City for any costs and expenses directly and necessarily incurred by the City in the course of the defense. The permittee expressly acknowledges and agrees that the permittee’s indemnification obligations under this condition are a material consideration that motivates the City to approve this Section 6409(a) approval, and that such indemnification obligations will survive the expiration or revocation of this Section 6409(a) approval.

13.   Performance Bond. Before the City issues any construction permit in connection with the wireless facility, the permittee shall post a performance bond from a surety and in a form acceptable to the City Manager in an amount equal to or greater than a written estimate from a qualified contractor with experience in wireless facilities removal. The written estimate must include the cost to remove all equipment and other improvements, which includes, without limitation, all antennas, radios, batteries, generators, utilities, cabinets, mounts, brackets, hardware, cables, wires, conduits, structures, shelters, towers, poles, footings and foundations, whether above ground or below ground, constructed or installed in connection with the wireless facility. In establishing or adjusting the bond amount required under this condition, and in accordance with California Government Code Section 65964(a), the City Manager shall take into consideration information provided by the permittee regarding the cost to remove the wireless facility.

14.   Record Retention. The permittee must maintain complete and accurate copies of all permits and other regulatory approvals issued in connection with the wireless facility, which includes, without limitation, this approval, the approved plans and photo simulations incorporated into this approval, all conditions associated with this approval and any ministerial permits or approvals issued in connection with this approval. In the event that the permittee does not maintain such records as required in this condition, any ambiguities or uncertainties that would be resolved through an inspection of the missing records will be construed against the permittee.

15.   Compliance Obligations. An applicant or permittee will not be relieved of its obligation to comply with every applicable provision in the Mill Valley Municipal Code, any permit, any permit condition or any applicable law or regulation by reason of any failure by the City to timely notice, prompt or enforce compliance by the applicant or permittee. (Ord. 1304 § 1, September 6, 2018)

 

20.73.150 Wireless telecommunications collocation facilities covered under California Government Code Section 65850.6.
A.    Purpose. The purpose of this section is to comply with an application for a wireless telecommunications collocation facility under California Government Code Section 65850.6, for which a Section 6509(a) approval is not being requested. This section provides the requirements, standards and regulations for a wireless telecommunications collocation facility for which subsequent collocation is a permitted use pursuant to California law. Only those facilities that fully comply with the eligibility requirements set forth in California Government Code Section 65850.6, or its successor provision, and which strictly adhere to the requirements and regulations set forth in this section shall qualify as a wireless telecommunications collocation facility.

B.     Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms are defined as follows:

1.     “Collocation facility” means the placement or installation of wireless facilities, including antennas, and related equipment, on, or immediately adjacent to, a wireless telecommunications collocation facility.

2.     “Wireless telecommunications facility” means equipment and network components such as towers, utility poles, transmitters, base stations, and emergency power systems that are integral to providing wireless telecommunications services.

3.     “Wireless telecommunications collocation facility” means a wireless telecommunications facility that includes collocation facilities.

C.     Procedures. An application for a wireless telecommunications collocation facility under California Government Code Section 65850.6 shall be processed in the same manner as an application for Section 6409(a) approval is processed, except that where the process requires justification for the Section 6409(a) approval, the applicant shall instead provide the justification for a wireless telecommunications collocation facility under California Government Code Section 65850.6.

D.    Requirements. All requirements, regulations, and standards set forth in this chapter for a wireless telecommunications facility shall apply to a wireless telecommunications collocation facility; provided, however, the following shall also apply to a wireless telecommunications collocation facility:

1.     The applicant for a wireless telecommunications collocation facility permit shall describe or depict:

a.     The wireless telecommunications collocation facility as it will be initially built; and

b.     All collocations at full build-out, including, but not limited to, all antennas, antenna support structures, and accessory equipment.

2.     Any collocation shall use screening methods substantially similar to those used on the existing wireless telecommunications facilities unless other optional screening methods are specified in the conditions of approval.

3.     A wireless telecommunications collocation facility permit shall not be approved unless an environmental impact report, negative declaration, or mitigated negative declaration was prepared and approved for the wireless telecommunications collocation facility.

E.     Permitted Use. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a subsequent collocation on a wireless telecommunications collocation facility shall be a permitted use only if all of the following requirements are satisfied:

1.     The wireless telecommunications collocation facility:

a.     Was approved after January 1, 2007, by discretionary permit;

b.     Was approved subject to an environmental impact report, negative declaration, or mitigated negative declaration; and

c.     Otherwise complies with the requirements of California Government Code Section 65850.6(b), or its successor provision, for addition of a collocation facility to a wireless telecommunications collocation facility, including, but not limited to, compliance with all performance and maintenance requirements, regulations and standards in this chapter and the conditions of approval in the wireless telecommunications collocation facility permit.

2.     The collocations were specifically considered when the relevant environmental document was prepared for the wireless telecommunications collocation facility.

Removal shall be in accordance with proper health and safety requirements and all ordinances, rules, and regulations of the City. The facility shall be removed from the property within 30 days, at no cost or expense to the City. If the facility is located on private property, the private property owner shall also be independently responsible for the expense of timely removal and restoration.

B.     Failure to Remove. Failure of the permittee, owner, or operator to promptly remove its facility and restore the property within 30 days after expiration, earlier termination, or revocation of the permit, or abandonment of the facility, shall be a violation of the Mill Valley Municipal Code, and be grounds for:

1.     Prosecution;

2.     Calling of any bond or other assurance required by this chapter or conditions of approval of permit;

3.     Removal of the facilities by the City in accordance with the procedures established under the Mill Valley Municipal Code for abatement of a public nuisance at the owner’s expense; or

In the event the Zoning Administrator determines that the condition or placement of a wireless telecommunications facility located in the public right-of-way constitutes a dangerous condition, obstruction of the public right-of-way, or an imminent threat to public safety, or determines other exigent circumstances require immediate corrective action (collectively, “exigent circumstances”), the Zoning Administrator may cause the facility to be removed summarily and immediately without advance notice or a hearing. Written notice of the removal shall be served upon the person who owns the facility within five business days of removal and all property removed shall be preserved for the owner’s pick-up as feasible. If the owner cannot be identified following reasonable effort or if the owner fails to pick-up the property within 60 days, the facility shall be treated as abandoned property.

D.    Removal of Facilities by City. In the event the City removes a facility in accordance with nuisance abatement procedures or summary removal, any such removal shall be without any liability to the City for any damage to such facility that may result from reasonable efforts of removal. In addition to the procedures for recovering costs of nuisance abatement, the City may collect such costs from the performance bond posted and to the extent such costs exceed the amount of the performance bond, collect those excess costs in accordance with the Mill Valley Municipal Code. Unless otherwise provided herein, the City has no obligation to store such facility. Neither the permittee nor the owner nor operator shall have any claim if the City destroys any such facility not timely removed by the permittee, owner, or operator after notice, or removed by the City due to exigent circumstances. (Ord. 1304 § 1, September 6, 2018)

 

20.73.230 Effect on other ordinances.
Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not relieve a person from complying with any other applicable provision of the Mill Valley Municipal Code, including, but not limited to, obtaining any necessary encroachment or building permits. In the event of a conflict between any provision of this chapter and other provisions of the Mill Valley Municipal Code, this chapter shall control. (Ord. 1304 § 1, September 6, 2018)

 

20.73.240 Effect of state or federal law.
In the event that state or federal law prohibits discretionary permitting requirements for certain wireless telecommunications facilities, the permits required by this chapter for those facilities shall be deemed to be ministerial permits. For those facilities, in lieu of a conditional use permit, a ministerial permit shall be required prior to installation or modification of a wireless telecommunications facility and all provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to any such facility with the exception that the required permit shall be reviewed and administered as a ministerial permit by the Zoning Administrator rather than as a discretionary permit. Any conditions of approval set forth in this chapter or deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator shall be imposed and administered as reasonable time, place and manner rules.

20.74.050 Signs which are prohibited.
For the reasons stated below, among others, the following signs are not allowed:

A.    Signs on public property or in the public right-of-way (see exceptions for awning/canopy signs, Section 20.74.040(D); projecting signs, Section 20.74.040(E); and City-approved banner poles, Section 20.74.030(A)(1). This is to ensure that no private or commercial use or event is promoted on public property.

B.     Signs projecting above the eave line or parapet. This is to prevent extension of the building’s height and protect the architectural integrity of the façade.

C.     Portable signs including “A Frame” and “sandwich” signs. This is to prevent hazards to pedestrians and maintain continuity of the streetscape.

 

 

D.    Signs which move or have moving parts (except barber poles which require a permit), or have flashing illumination, or contain reflective material. This is to prevent distractions to motorists and pedestrians.

E.     Signs which produce light by the application of electric current to an inert gas light source such as neon, because they are inconsistent with the design guidelines in the General Plan.

F.     Obstructing signs, in order to prevent safety hazards.

G.    Signs imitating official traffic signs or signals. This is to prevent confusion to motorists and pedestrians.

H.    Off-site signs (see exceptions for real estate signs, Sections 20.74.030(A)(3) and 20.74.040(J)). This is to minimize duplication of signs and require signs to be on the site where business is conducted.

I.      All other signs not mentioned in Sections 20.74.030, 20.74.040 and 20.74.050, including, but not limited to, banners which are not completely attached to a structure, balloons, inflated signs, pennants, streamers, festoons and searchlights.

J.      Signs in a single family residential district except professional nameplates, real estate, political, or governmental signs. This is to retain the residential character of an existing neighborhood.

 

20.74.060 Limits on size of permanent signs.
The signs listed in Section 20.74.040 shall comply with the following standards:

A.    The maximum sign area allowed for a ground level business, office or portion thereof, shall be one square foot for each linear front foot the business or office or portion thereof has an outdoor public use area, to a maximum of 75 square feet unless otherwise authorized by a sign program or conditions which apply specifically to that development.

B.     The maximum sign area allowed for an upper level business, office or portion thereof shall be no greater than two square feet unless otherwise authorized by a sign program or conditions of approval which apply specifically to that development. Only one sign may be displayed for a business or office located entirely on an upper level and shall be located at the exterior entrance of the building unless its size or location is otherwise established as part of a sign program approved by the Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission or City Council pursuant to Section 20.74.080.

C.     The maximum sign area allowed for any individual business or office which occupies more than one level in the same building, including any part of the ground level, shall be determined by combining subsections A and B in this section; however, the total size shall not exceed 75 square feet.

D.    Each face of a permanent sign shall be deducted from the total sign area permitted for that business or office. However, with the exception of Section 20.74.030(B)(6), the face of each temporary or permanent sign permitted by Section 20.74.030 is not calculated as part of the total sign area permitted.

 

20.74.070 Sign permit application requirements.
When a sign permit is required under the provisions of this chapter, the applications shall include the following:

A.    A completed application form which may be obtained from the Department of Planning and Building;

B.     The application fee as established by resolution of the City Council;

C.     The signed consent of the owner on whose property the sign is to be erected;

D.    Scaled elevations and sections along with a written description of the proposed installation method. The plans shall show any proposed lighting. Photos or elevations must show the precise location of the sign on the building or, for a ground sign, its location with respect to the street and adjacent buildings.

 

20.74.080 Sign permit review procedure.
Sign permit applications will be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator unless the application is part of a development and/or entitlement requiring design review of elements other than signs, in which case the Planning Commission shall review the application.

Chapter 20.76 CREEK SETBACK ORDINANCE
20.76.010 Purpose.
The City of Mill Valley seeks to protect, maintain, enhance and restore Mill Valley’s streams and waterways and adjacent riparian habitat and wetlands; to prevent further degradation of habitat and water quality; and to limit or mitigate the impacts of development activities within the riparian areas.

Riparian areas adjacent to creeks provide shade, sediment transport, nutrient and chemical regulation, stream bank stability, input of large woody debris and organic matter, hydrologic control of floodwaters, and educational and recreational opportunities. The purpose of the creek setback is to conserve the quality and quantity of remaining riparian habitat and water resources and to provide for the recovery of Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, listed in 2000 as a “threatened” species under the Endangered Species Act) and other anadromous fish historically found within the Mill Valley watershed.

The intent is to allow development that is compatible with the important physical, habitat, aesthetic, and recreational functions of the riparian areas within the City’s watershed, while ensuring that these functions and values are protected in perpetuity.

The purpose of this section is also to implement the Open Space Policies of the Mill Valley General Plan regarding protection of the City’s creeks.

 

20.76.020 Creek setback requirement.
No structures are permitted within 30 feet of the top bank of the following creeks within the City of Mill Valley: Warner Canyon, Corte Madera Del Presidio, Sutton Manor Creek, Cascade Creek, Old Mill Creek, Reed Creek (the “Creek Setback Area”). (Ord. 1211 § 2, December 5, 2005)

Chapter 20.80 AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS *
* CodeAlert: This topic has been affected by Ordinance No. 1323U. To view amendments and newly added provisions, please refer to the CodeAlert Amendment List.


Note
*       Prior ordinance history: Ords. 1034, 1077, 1261 and 1271.

 

20.80.010 Findings.
A.    Mill Valley is experiencing a housing shortage for affordable households. Increasingly, persons with extremely low, very low, low and moderate incomes who work and live within the City are unable to locate housing at prices they can afford and are increasingly excluded from living in the City.

B.     The shortage of affordable housing in Mill Valley is detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare.

C.     A goal of the City, as expressed in the Mill Valley General Plan, is to achieve a balanced community with housing available for households of a range of income levels. State law requires the City to make an adequate supply of housing available for persons of all economic segments of the community.

D.    The high cost of newly constructed housing does not, to any appreciable extent, provide housing affordable to extremely low, very low, low and moderate income households, and new market­rate development which does not include nor contribute toward lower cost housing, further aggravates the current housing problems by reducing the supply of developable land.

E.     The demolition and replacement or construction of new market-rate housing has a deleterious impact on affordable housing opportunities in the City, by displacing current tenants and occupants, by replacing smaller, older and more affordable units with larger and more expensive housing, and by reducing the supply of vacant or developable land in the City.

F.     In order to meet the goals and objectives described in the General Plan, it is necessary that the City establish the Housing Trust Fund to fund City efforts to create affordable housing opportunities within the City.

G.    All new market-rate residential development in the City must provide affordable opportunities to City residents or pay a fee to mitigate the impacts of the development on affordable housing opportunities in the City. (Ord. 1295, September 5, 2017)

20.80.020 Purpose and intent.
A.    The purpose of this chapter is to enhance the public welfare and assure that all residential development projects proportionately contribute to the City’s housing goals by constructing affordable unit(s) or pay a fee aimed at developing, constructing and/or maintaining affordable housing unit(s) in Mill Valley.

B.     The provisions of this chapter are intended to:

1.     Implement the Housing Element of the General Plan, and the requirements of state law (Government Code Section 65915, et seq.).

2.     Maintain a balanced community with a wide variety of housing available to households of all income levels.

3.     Increase the supply of affordable housing units.

4.     Increase the supply of housing for the disabled, seniors, and other households with special housing needs, as defined in the Housing Element.

5.     Address the need for affordable housing related to the increase in jobs and services associated with new and/or expanded market rate residential development.

6.     Provide affordable housing units that are compatible in character and quality with their surrounding neighborhoods.

7.     Maintain the physical condition and affordability of units produced through the provisions of this chapter over time.

8.     Protect and maintain the existing affordable housing units within the City’s existing housing stock. (Ord. 1295, September 5, 2017)

To ensure compliance with the Costa Hawkins Act (Chapter 2.7 of Title 5 of Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code), the City may only approve a proposal to provide rental affordable units if the applicant agrees in a recorded agreement with the City to limit rents in consideration for a direct financial contribution or a form of assistance specified in Chapter 4.3 (commencing with Section 65915) of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code. Such a proposal must be made by the applicant and not by the City, in the event that a court finds that this subsection would violate the Costa-Hawkins Act, the court shall sever this subsection from the remainder of this chapter, and the remainder of this chapter including, but not limited to, the requirement that an applicant pay the affordable housing impact fee shall remain in full force and effect.

D.    Projects Subject to Providing Affordable Housing Units. The primary intent of the inclusionary requirement is to achieve the construction of new affordable units, as outlined in this chapter and as consistent with state and federal law. Other alternatives of equal value, such as, but not limited to, payment of the impact fee, acquisition and rehabilitation of existing units, construction of affordable units off site or the transfer of sufficient land and/or cash to the City or non-profit housing organization or housing developer to develop the required number of affordable units may be considered at the sole discretion of the City.

1.     Multi-Family Rental and Ownership Units (Four or More New or Replacement Units). Multi-family and mixed use ownership projects of four or more units shall construct affordable housing unit(s) as follows:

a.     Affordable Housing Units. At least 25% of the total number of dwelling units within a project that creates four or more new units shall be made available to moderate and low income households. Of these designated affordable units, at least 50% shall be rented or sold to low income households.

b.     Fractions. Fractional numbers of inclusionary units are “rounded up” to the nearest whole integer and treated as a whole inclusionary unit; alternatively, the requirements of this section may be satisfied through payment of the impact fee, applied to remaining fractional number, and calculated based on a percentage of construction valuation for the project, as stipulated in Section 20.80.050(C).

c.     Conditions of Approval. Any discretionary approval of new dwelling units shall have conditions attached which will assure compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Such conditions shall:

i.      Specify the timing of payment of the impact fee and/or the construction of the affordable units, the number of inclusionary units and the appropriate income and purchase price or rental restrictions, and amenities associated with each unit.

ii.     Require an affordable housing agreement providing for long-term affordability, income certification and screening of potential purchasers and/or renters of inclusionary units, resale control mechanism and on-going management of the affordable units.

iii.    Contain a provision indicating that residents of affordable units shall not be denied access to common open spaces or recreational amenities.

iv.    Where an applicant elects to initially rent all of the units in a residential ownership project, the affordable housing agreement shall provide affordable rents for the affordable unit(s) during the rental period.

2.     Alternative to Building Affordable Units On-Site. Where feasible, it is the preference of the City that the requirements of this section be met through the construction of affordable units within the project. Construction of affordable units within another site or sites within the City may be approved on a case-by-case basis through the City’s discretionary process; or upon finding by the Planning Commission or City Council that the construction of the required affordable units is not feasible or appropriate as part of the project or elsewhere in the City, the City may allow the applicant to satisfy the requirements of this section through the payment of the impact fee set forth in Section 20.80.070 for the new construction or the donation of land at the sole discretion of the City as provided below.

a.     Land Donation. At the sole discretion of the City, applicants may satisfy the requirements of this chapter by an irrevocable offer of dedication of land for construction of affordable housing within the City.

i.      Identification of the land to be dedicated shall be accomplished prior to approval of the discretionary permit for the residential development permit project.

ii.     In addition to any other findings required by statute, ordinance, or otherwise, any project approval for an in-lieu land dedication shall include a finding that the land to be dedicated is not subject to liens, is served or proposed to be served by municipal services, including water, sewer, roads, electricity, telephone or other similar customary services, and contains no unusual planning or development constraints.

iii.    Land for affordable housing projects shall be dedicated to either for-profit or non­ profit affordable housing builders only, subject to an affordable housing agreement or other legal contract approved by the City Council that shall provide for the construction of affordable units and the long-term affordability, management, and maintenance of the units. The amount of land shall be at least as much as necessary to provide one and one-half times (150%) the required number of affordable units as stipulated in this chapter. The City Council may, in its sole discretion, approve, conditionally approve or reject such offer of dedication. Rejection of an offer of dedication of land under this section shall not relieve an applicant of the obligation to comply with this chapter through another means.

iv.    Prior to City approval of the options set forth in this subsection, the City must find that the dedication of land will provide an equivalent or greater number of affordable units than would otherwise be required by this chapter consistent with any environmental constraints of the site.

b.     Off-Site Units. Where provided for, applicants may satisfy the requirements of this chapter by constructing affordable units on another site within the City.

i.      New inclusionary units not built on the site of the proposed original project shall be constructed simultaneously with market-rate dwellings constructed on the original site, unless alternative arrangements are approved as part of the project approval.

ii.     The City may approve off-site rental affordable units be provided in lieu of ownership units.

iii.    Where inclusionary units are permitted off-site, such units do not count as affordable units for the purpose of receiving a density bonus, as outlined in Chapter 20.81.

iv.    In addition to any other findings required by state law or city ordinance, any approval of the linked project shall include a finding that the off-site inclusionary units shall be equivalent or greater in number than what would otherwise be required under this chapter, consistent with any environmental constraints of the site. (Ord. 1295, September 5, 2017; Ord. 1299 §§ 3—5, April 2, 2018)

Marketing materials submitted to the City shall include: application fees, waiting list process, conditions and restrictions applicable to occupancy, identification of rent, permitted rent increases, maximum qualifying household income, requirement for annual household income recertification, preferences, and requirement to vacate the affordable unit should the tenant’s household income exceed the maximum qualifying household income.

d.     The owner, developer or designee identified in the housing agreement shall review and screen applicants of affordable units on the same basis as all other prospective tenants, including persons who are recipients of Federal certificates for rent subsidies pursuant to the existing housing program under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act or any successor. The owner, developer or designee shall not apply selection criteria to Section 8 certificate or voucher holders that are more burdensome than criteria applied to all other prospective tenants for the affordable unit, nor permit management policies or lease provisions that may preclude occupancy by such prospective tenants.

e.     The developer or owner shall retain final discretion in the selection of the eligible households provided that the same rental terms and conditions (except rent levels and income) are applied to tenants of inclusionary units as are applied to tenants, except as required to comply with government subsidy programs.

f.      Upon initial occupancy and annually thereafter, the owner, developer or designee shall submit certifications to the City or its designee, verifying that the tenants of the affordable units do not exceed the maximum allowable household income established under the housing agreement.

F.     Terms of Affordability. Prior to approval of a final map or issuance of building permits, whichever is earlier, the applicant shall execute an affordable housing agreement with the Housing Authority ensuring the continued affordability of the affordable housing units.

1.     The affordable housing agreement shall be recorded on title and shall be binding on all future owners and successors in interests.

2.     Affordable rental units granted in connection with the inclusionary requirements (Section 20.80.050) shall be made affordable in perpetuity, or based on the maximum allowable timeframes established by law at the time of project approval.

3.     Affordable ownership units shall remain affordable in perpetuity, unless the Housing Authority reduces the term of the inclusionary requirement to reflect the maximum term that is permitted by financing sources.

a.     The term of the agreement shall commence on the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the affordable unit(s), with the affordability timeframe adjusted if necessary upon the sale or transferring of the property to a new owner or owners.

b.     Owners of an affordable housing unit shall include, in the grant deed conveying title of any such affordable housing ownership unit a declaration stating the restrictions imposed pursuant to this chapter. The grant deed shall provide the City with the right to enforce the restrictions. The declaration of restrictions shall include all applicable resale controls, occupancy restrictions, and prohibitions as required by this chapter.

4.     Affordable units granted through density bonus (Chapter 20.81) shall be subject to affordability time frames established with state density bonus statutes at the time of project approval.

G.    Affordable Housing Agreement. A housing agreement shall be recorded against the subject property. This agreement may be made subordinate to acquisition, construction, bridge, and long-term permanent financing associated with the development of the project in which the affordable housing units will be located.

1.     The agreement shall contain provisions that implement all of the requirements of this chapter, including, but not limited to, the following:

a.     The number and type of affordable housing units to be provided by the project.

b.     The initial sales prices or rents for the affordable units.

c.     Criteria for the certification and selection of buyers or renters, which may include household income and assets, household size, and the size or special needs features of the available units.

d.     A provision guaranteeing that the initial sale or rent and continuing availability of all units will remain at the same affordable income levels, as designated through the requirements of this chapter.

e.     A provision indicating the noticing process to ensure that all prospective purchasers or renters of an affordable housing unit shall be advised of the restrictions of the affordable units, including, but not limited to, occupancy requirements and household income restrictions, as set forth in this chapter.

2.     The housing agreement shall state that the Housing Authority may revise the sales prices and rent limits from time to time in response to changes in income limits, monthly housing costs, and the real estate market.

3.     The housing agreement shall include a provision that provides for the enforcement of the housing agreement that entitles the City and/or the Housing Authority to recover reasonable attorney’s fees (including City Attorney fees), investigation and litigation expenses, and any related staff costs associated with enforcing the provisions of this chapter.

4.     The housing agreement shall include a provision restricting the sale of all affordable ownership units to “first time home buyers” as defined by the Housing Authority.

5.     The agreement shall contain a provision requiring that the sale of an affordable housing unit shall include an assignable option agreement granting the Housing Authority and City the right of first refusal to purchase the unit at the time of subsequent sale for fair market value as set forth in the Marin County Below Market Rate policies or other applicable regulations or guidelines.

6.     For rental projects, the housing agreement shall require an annual report verifying, under penalty of perjury, that the rental of affordable units complies with the terms and conditions contained in Section 20.80.060.

H.    Owner-Occupancy and Sub-Leasing Affordable Units. The purchaser or renter of the affordable housing unit shall reside in the unit as their principal residence and may not rent or sublease the unit in its entirety to another party, including short-term rentals or sublets.

1.     Every purchaser or renter of an affordable housing unit shall certify upon initial move-in that the unit is being used as the purchaser or renter’s primary place of residence.

2.     As part of the housing agreement, the Housing Authority is responsible for monitoring each affordable unit to prevent potential program abuses and violations of deed restrictions. Any irregularities or suspected abuses will be reported to the City in writing, and action taken, as deemed appropriate.

3.     For affordable rental units, annual income verification shall be required by the Housing Authority to assure that the affordable rental units are rented and occupied by affordable households.

4.     As part of the affordable housing agreement for ownership units, the Housing Authority shall monitor and verify the owner-occupancy requirement. Failure by a purchaser of an affordable unit to maintain eligibility for the homeowners’ property tax exemption, or failure to provide proof of residence, when requested, shall be construed to mean that the affordable housing unit is not the primary place of residence of the purchaser. (Ord. 1295, September 5, 2017; Ord. 1299 §§ 6—8, April 2, 2018)

 

20.80.070 Affordable housing impact fees and trust fund.
A.    Affordable Housing Impact Fees. The affordable housing impact fees shall contribute towards the City’s housing fund for the purpose of creating, developing and/or maintaining existing housing targeted for affordable households within the City.

1.     Affordable housing impact fees shall apply to all residential projects, as outlined in this chapter.

2.     No application for a rezoning, tentative map, parcel map, conditional use permit, special use permit, building permit or other entitlement shall be approved without compliance with this section.

3.     The impact fee shall be calculated based on a percentage of the construction valuation of an applicable project, with the actual percentage established by way of City Council resolution.

4.     The construction valuation threshold shall be initially set at $100,000.00, adjusted on an annual calendar year basis based on the California Construction Cost Index as reported by the California Department of General Services to account for market fluctuations and to ensure that the impact fee reflects current costs.

5.     Impact fees shall not exceed the cost of mitigating the impact of market rate residential projects on the need for affordable housing in the City.

6.     The amount of any affordable housing impact fee payable under this section is based on the fee schedule in effect at the time of issuance of the building permit for the dwelling unit to which the fee relates.

7.     The impact fee shall be paid prior to issuance of the building permit for the project.

8.     lnclusionary units and impact fees are not considered to be mutually exclusive, and a project may create inclusionary units and pay impact fees, so long as the total amount of units and fees shall not exceed the cost of mitigating the impact on affordable housing in the City as described in this chapter.

9.     Fractional requirements may be satisfied by the construction of an additional affordable unit or payment of the affordable housing impact fee by applying the fractional remainder to the construction valuation, and applying the fee accordingly.

B.     Affordable Housing Trust Fund. The purpose of the affordable housing fund is to receive and disburse affordable housing impact fee revenues and other housing funds to address the housing needs of affordable households in the City. Separate accounts within such housing fund may be created from time to time to avoid commingling if required by law or as deemed appropriate to further the purposes of the housing fund.

1.     All affordable housing impact fees shall be deposited into the affordable housing fund.

2.     The affordable housing trust fund, including accrued interest, shall be subject to all the applicable provision of the Mitigation Fee Act, including, but not limited to, the requirements for accounting, reporting and expenditure of the fund to increase the supply of affordable housing in Mill Valley.

3.     The fees collected under this chapter and all earnings from investment of the fees shall be expended exclusively to provide or assure continued provision of affordable housing in the City to meet the housing needs of the City’s workforce through acquisition, construction, development assistance, substantial rehabilitation or maintenance, financing, rent or other subsidies, or methods, and for costs of administering programs which serve those ends. The housing shall be of a type, or made affordable at a cost or rent, for which there is a need in the City and which is not adequately supplied in the City by private housing development in the absence of public assistance and to the extent feasible shall be utilized to provide housing opportunities to affordable households.

4.     Housing assisted with affordable housing impact fees shall be subject to long-term affordability covenants established through an affordable housing agreement.

5.     Prior to the distribution of funds, guidelines and administrative procedures shall be approved by City Council resolution, outlining the application, review, scoring/ranking or priority setting, distribution and use of trust fund monies. (Ord. 1295, September 5, 2017)

 

20.80.080 Other affordable housing incentives.
It is the intent of this chapter that the requirements for affordable units shall not be determined by the availability of government subsidies. This is not to preclude the use of such programs or subsidies, if available. This chapter is also not intended to be an undue burden on the developers of residential projects. Therefore, as detailed below, the following provisions may be granted in association with the construction of affordable units.

A.    Density Bonus. Applicants constructing affordable units within a project may apply for concessions outlined in Chapter 20.81, Density Bonus, if eligible.

B.     Modification to Total Number of Units. The City may consider requests to reduce the total number of required moderate income inclusionary units within a project, or increase the number of market rate units, if some or all of the inclusionary units are sold or rented at prices affordable to very low or low income households.

C.     Modification to Amenities in Affordable Units. The City may consider requests to modify the amenities in affordable units, provided that additional inclusionary units are built or the level of affordability associated with the affordable units is adjusted from moderate income to low or very low income households.

D.    Planned Development Combining District. Should a proposed project exceed the required number of inclusionary units set forth in this chapter, an applicant may apply for the use of a planned development zoning designation as part of the project.

1.     The planned development zoning designation, as outlined in Chapter 20.57 allows the City and applicant to review and assess development standards for an established Zoning District, which may be of particular impact, value and benefit to the entire community, such as providing additional affordable units.

2.     A Planned Development Combining District request cannot be used in combination with density bonus regulations set forth in Chapter 20.81.

E.     Fee Waivers. In the attempt to avoid any undue burden on developers who are required to provide inclusionary units under the provisions of this chapter, the City may waive or reduce park dedication, development fees, and other City fees applicable to the inclusionary units in the project.

F.     Technical Assistance. In order to emphasize the importance of securing low and very low income housing as a part of this program, City staff, other agencies, or designated consultants may provide advice on financial subsidy programs to applicants. During individual project review, the City may request that the applicant provide an economic analysis which will indicate the most suitable methods for the implementation of the requirements of this chapter. This is to be done with the objective of increasing the feasibility and lowering the cost of units affordable to moderate, low, and very low income households. (Ord. 1295, September 5, 2017)

 

20.80.090 Housing Advisory Committee.
A.    Purpose. A Housing Advisory Committee shall be created for the purpose of assisting staff and advising the City Council (and Planning Commission) on matters relating to the Housing Element of the General Plan and the Affordable Housing Ordinance.

B.     Appointment. The Housing Advisory Committee shall be appointed by the City Council. Members shall reside or work within the City. Term of service and number of individuals serving on the Housing Advisory Committee shall be outlined in the Committee by-laws, established in subsection C.

C.     By-Laws. The City Council shall adopt by-laws containing rules and procedures for the transaction of business of the Housing Advisory Committee. The City Council may amend said by-laws from time to time. (Ord. 1295, September 5, 2017)

 

20.80.100 Enforcement.
A.    Except as provided herein, no building permit or occupancy permit shall be issued, nor any development approval granted, for any project which does not meet the requirements of this chapter.

B.     In addition to, or in lieu of, the provisions of subsection A of this section, the City may institute appropriate legal actions or proceedings including, but not limited to, equitable relief for the enforcement of any affordable housing agreement or the requirements set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 1295, September 5, 2017)

 

20.80.110 Appeals.
A.    Any person aggrieved by any action involving denial, suspension or revocation of a building or occupancy permit or denial, suspension or revocation of any development approval may appeal such action or determination to the Planning Commission, with further appeal possible to the City Council by filing a written appeal to the Director of Planning and Building and paying the appropriate application fees.

B.     As part of an application for the approval of a residential project, an applicant may apply for a reduction, adjustment, or waiver of the requirements of this chapter based upon a showing, based on substantial evidence, that there is no reasonable relationship between the impacts of the project and the requirements of this chapter, or that applying the requirements of this chapter would result in an unconstitutional taking of property or would violate a provision of state or federal law. The applicant shall set forth in detail the requisite evidence to demonstrate the alleged unlawful result. (Ord. 1295, September 5, 2017)

 

20.80.120 Consistency with state law and severability.
The provisions of this section are intended to comply with California Government Code Section 65915, the Mitigation Fee Act at Government Code Section 66000, et seq., and state and federal law. In the event that any provision of this section conflicts with state or federal law applicable to the City, state or federal law shall apply. The provisions of this section are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, or portion of this section, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this section, or the validity or its application to other persons or circumstances. (Ord. 1295, September 5, 2017)

Chapter 20.81 DENSITY BONUS
20.81.010 Purpose and intent.
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to:

A.    Establish the standards and procedures in granting affordable housing density bonuses for housing developments, in an effort to incentivize the development of affordable units in the City; and

B.     Implement the requirements of the State Density Bonus Law (Government Code Sections 65915 and 65915.5). (Ord. 1266 § 1, December 1, 2014)

 

20.81.020 Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall be interpreted as set forth in this section.

A.    “Affordable units” means units within a residential development which will be reserved for sale or rent to, and made available at an affordable rent or affordable ownership cost to very low, lower or moderate income households.

B.     “Child care facility,” as defined in Government Code Section 65915(h)(4), means a child day care facility other than a family day care home, including, but not limited to, infant centers, preschools, extended day care facilities, and school-age child care centers.

C.     “Density bonus,” as defined in Government Code Section 65915(f), means a density increase over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density as of the date of application by the applicant to the City.

D.    “Development standard,” as defined in Government Code Section 65915(o)(1), includes a site or construction condition, including, but not limited to, a height limitation, a setback requirement, a floor area ratio, an on-site open-space requirement, or a parking ratio that applies to a residential development pursuant to any ordinance, general plan element, specific plan, or other local condition, law, policy, resolution, or regulation.

E.     “Granting authority” means the Building Official, Director, Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission, or City Council, as the case may be.

F.     Household Income Levels. Households whose gross incomes do not exceed the qualifying very low, lower and moderate income limits established in 25 C.C.R. Section 6932, and amended periodically based on the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) estimate of median income in Marin County, and as adjusted by the State Department of Housing and Community Development. Pursuant to 25 C.C.R. Sections 6926, 6928 and 6930, these income limits are equivalent to the following:

1.     “Very low income household” means persons and families whose gross incomes do not exceed 50% of area median income, adjusted for household size appropriate for the unit and other factors determined by HUD.

2.     “Lower income household” means persons and families whose gross incomes do not exceed 80% of area median income, adjusted for household size appropriate for the unit and other factors determined by HUD.

3.     “Moderate income household” means persons and families whose gross incomes do not exceed 120% of area median income, adjusted for household size appropriate for the unit and other factors determined by HUD.

G.    “Housing development,” as defined in Government Code Section 65915(i), means a development project for five or more residential units. For the purposes of this chapter, “housing development” also includes a subdivision or common interest development, as defined in Civil Code Section 4100, as approved by the City, and consists of residential units or unimproved residential lots and either a project to substantially rehabilitate and convert an existing commercial building to residential use or the substantial rehabilitation of an existing multifamily dwelling, as defined in Government Code Section 65863.4(d), where the result of the rehabilitation would be a net increase in available residential units. For the purpose of calculating a density bonus, the residential units shall be on contiguous sites that are the subject of one development application, but do not have to be based upon individual subdivision maps or parcels. The density bonus shall be permitted in geographic areas of the housing development other than the areas where the units for the lower income households are located.

H.    “Maximum allowable residential density,” as defined in Government Code Section 65915(o)(2), means the density allowed under the zoning ordinance and land use element of the general plan, or if a range of density is permitted, means the maximum allowable density for the specific zoning range and land use element of the general plan applicable to the project. Where the density allowed under the zoning ordinance is inconsistent with the density allowed under the land use element of the general plan, the general plan density shall prevail. (Ord. 1266 § 1, December 1, 2014)

 

20.81.030 Applicability.
A.    This chapter shall apply to all zoning districts within the City that allow residential use.

B.     The bonus granted pursuant to this chapter shall apply only to residential projects or residential components of mixed-use projects, not including units granted as a density bonus.

 

C.     The proposed project shall have all of the following characteristics in order to qualify for a density bonus:

1.     The residential development must include a minimum of five dwelling units.

2.     The applicant seeks and agrees to provide housing units to very-low, lower or moderate income households or senior citizens at rates consistent with those specified in Table 20.81.060 (Density Bonus Allowance).

3.     The resulting density is beyond that permitted by the applicable zoning district.

4.     The applicant agrees to retain the affordable status of housing units in accordance with Section 20.81.050. (Ord. 1266 § 1, December 1, 2014)

 

20.81.040 Application requirements.
A.    Any applicant requesting a density bonus, incentives, and/or concessions must provide the City with a written proposal.

B.     The proposed project shall have all of the following characteristics in order to qualify for a density bonus:

1.     Requested Density Bonus.

a.     Evidence that the project includes the qualifying percentages of residential units set forth in Section 20.81.060, excluding the units added by the granted density bonus;

b.     Calculations showing the maximum base density;

c.     Number or percentage of affordable units and the income level at which the units will be restricted to;

d.     Number of market rate units that will result from the granted density bonus;

e.     Resulting density, described in units per square foot; and

f.      A written acknowledgement that the project will be subject to the affordability restrictions set forth in Section 20.81.050.

b.     The proposal shall include a description of any proposed waivers of development standards and why they are necessary for making the project physically possible.

c.     All requested incentives and concessions should not exceed the limits stated in Table 20.81.070 (Incentives and Concessions).

3.     Payment of fees set by resolution of the City Council. (Ord. 1266 § 1, December 1, 2014)

 

20.81.050 Affordability restrictions.
A.    An applicant shall agree to, and the City shall ensure, continued affordability of all very low and lower income rental units that qualified the applicant for the award of the density bonus for 55 years or a longer period of time if required by the construction or mortgage financing assistance program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program. Rents for the lower income density bonus units shall be set at an affordable rent as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50053.

B.     An applicant shall agree to, and the City shall ensure that, the initial occupant of all for-sale units that qualified the applicant for the award of the density bonus are persons and families of very low, lower, or moderate income, as required, and that the units are offered at an affordable housing cost, as that cost is defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5. The City shall enforce an equity sharing agreement, unless it is in conflict with the requirements of another public funding source or law. The following apply to the equity sharing agreement:

1.     Upon resale, the seller of the unit shall retain the value of any improvements, the down payment, and the seller’s proportionate share of appreciation. The City shall recapture any initial subsidy, as defined in subsection (2) below, and its proportionate share of appreciation, as defined in subsection (3) below, which amount shall be used within five years for any of the purposes described in Health and Safety Code Section 33334.2(e) that promote home ownership.

2.     For purposes of this section, the City’s initial subsidy shall be equal to the fair market value of the home at the time of initial sale minus the initial sale price to the moderate-income household, plus the amount of any down payment assistance or mortgage assistance. If upon resale the market value is lower than the initial market value, then the value at the time of the resale shall be used as the initial market value.

3.     For purposes of this section, the City’s proportionate share of appreciation shall be equal to the ratio of the City’s initial subsidy to the fair market value of the home at the time of initial sale. (Ord. 1266 § 1, December 1, 2014)

 

20.81.060 Density bonus allowance for affordable and senior housing.
A.    Except as otherwise may apply by virtue of Section 20.81.120 or 20.81.130, a request for a density bonus pursuant to this chapter shall be granted only if the applicant agrees to construct a residential project that includes at least one of the following categories of deed restricted dwelling units:

1.     At least five percent of the units are dedicated to very-low income households;

2.     At least 10% of the units are dedicated to lower income households;

3.     At least 10% of the units are dedicated to moderate-income households and are developed as common interest developments (including condominium projects, planned developments, community apartment projects or stock cooperatives) and are available to the general public for sale; or

4.     At least 35 dwelling units are dedicated and available exclusively to persons aged 55 and older and persons residing with them in accordance with Government Code Section 65915(b)(1)(C).

B.     The applicant shall elect whether the bonus shall be awarded on the basis of Section 20.81.060(A)(1), (A)(2), (A)(3), or (A)(4) above, and may elect to accept a lesser percentage of density bonus than shown in Table 20.81.060.

C.     The density bonuses available under this section shall not be combined.

D.    All calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number.

20.81.070 Incentives and concessions.
A.    In addition to the density bonus, an applicant who utilizes the density bonus provisions of this chapter may request one or more concessions or incentives. The number of incentives or concessions granted to the applicant shall be pursuant to the State Density Bonus Law, as set forth in Table 20.81.070 Incentives and Concessions, unless the City makes the findings and rejects a request under the procedures described in Section 20.81.080.

B.     “Incentives and concessions” means any of the following:

1.     A reduction in site development standards or a modification of zoning code requirements or architectural design requirements that exceed the minimum building standards provided in Part 2.5 (commencing with Section 18901) of Division 13 of the California Health and Safety Code, and which result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions.

2.     Approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the housing project if commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development and if the commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses are compatible with the housing project and the existing or planned development in the area where the proposed housing project will be located.

3.     Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the developer or the City that result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions.

C.     Applicants may seek a waiver or reduction of development standards that will have the effect of precluding the construction of a residential development meeting the criteria of Section 20.81.060 of this chapter at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted by this chapter. The applicant must demonstrate that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the residential project, with the affordable units, economically feasible.

D.    The denial of an incentive is separate from a decision to approve or deny the project as a whole.

E.     The granting of a density bonus, incentives or concession, in and of itself, shall not be interpreted to require a General Plan amendment, Zoning Map amendment, or other discretionary action for approval. Except as provided in this section, the granting of a density bonus shall not be interpreted to require the waiver of any ordinances or provisions of any ordinance of the City of Mill Valley unrelated to development standards.

F.     Nothing in this section shall limit or require the provision of direct financial incentives for the housing development, including the provision of publicly owned land, by the City, or the waiver of fees or dedication requirements.

G.    The City Council may adopt implementing resolutions for the review of requested incentives or concessions.

20.81.080 Grounds for denial of requested incentives or concessions.
The City reserves the right to deny incentives or concessions requested by the applicant if written findings are made based upon substantial evidence demonstrating any of the following:

A.    The concession or incentive would be contrary to State or Federal law.

B.     The concession or incentive is not required to provide for affordable housing costs as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5, or for rents for the targeted units to be set at affordable levels as specified in Health and Safety Code Section 50053.

C.     The requested waiver or reduction of development standards would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2), upon:

1.     Public health or safety for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low and moderate income households; or

2.     The physical environment for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low and moderate income households.

D.    The requested waiver or reduction of development standards would have an adverse impact any real property listed in the California Register of Historical Resources.

E.     Development is physically possible without granting a waiver of development standards.

F.     The applicant’s project is deemed ineligible for an incentive or concession by operation of Section 20.81.090 or 20.81.100. (Ord. 1266 § 1, December 1, 2014)

 

20.81.090 Requirement to replace affordable housing to qualify for density bonus, incentive, or concession.
A.    An applicant shall be ineligible for a density bonus or any other incentives or concessions under this chapter if the housing development is proposed on any property that includes a parcel or parcels on which rental dwelling units are or, if the dwelling units have been vacated or demolished in the five-year period preceding the application, have been subject to a recorded covenant, ordinance, or law that restricts rents to levels affordable to persons and families of lower or very low income; subject to any other form of rent or price control through the City’s valid exercise of its police power; or occupied by lower or very low income households, unless the proposed housing development replaces those units, and either of the following applies:

1.     The proposed housing development, inclusive of the units replaced pursuant to this paragraph, contains affordable units at the percentages set forth in Section 20.81.060.

2.     Each unit in the development, exclusive of a manager’s unit or units, is affordable to, and occupied by, either a lower or very low income household.

B.     For the purposes of this section, “replace” shall mean either of the following:

1.     If any dwelling units described in subsection A are occupied on the date that the application is submitted to the City, the proposed housing development shall provide at least the same number of units of equivalent size or type, or both, to be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same or lower income category as those households in occupancy. For unoccupied dwelling units described in subsection A in a development with occupied units, the proposed housing development shall provide units of equivalent size or type, or both, to be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same or lower income category in the same proportion of affordability as the occupied units. All replacement calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number. If the replacement units will be rental dwelling units, these units shall be subject to a recorded affordability restriction for at least 55 years. If the proposed development is for-sale units, the units replaced shall be subject to subsection (B)(2).

2.     If all dwelling units described in subsection A have been vacated or demolished within the five-year period preceding the application, the proposed housing development shall provide at least the same number of units of equivalent size or type, or both, as existed at the highpoint of those units in the five-year period preceding the application to be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same or lower income category as those persons and families in occupancy at that time, if known. If the incomes of the persons and families in occupancy at the highpoint is not known, then one-half of the required units shall be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, very low income persons and families and one-half of the required units shall be made available for rent at affordable housing costs to, and occupied by, low-income persons and families. All replacement calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number. If the replacement units will be rental dwelling units, these units shall be subject to a recorded affordability restriction for at least 55 years. If the proposed development is for-sale units, the units replaced shall be subject to Section 20.81.050(B). (Ord. 1266 § 1, December 1, 2014)

 

20.81.100 Condominium conversion.
A.

The City may place such reasonable conditions on the granting of a density bonus or other incentives of equivalent financial value as it finds appropriate, including, but not limited to, conditions which assure continued affordability of units to subsequent purchasers who are persons and families of low and moderate income or lower income households.

B.     For purposes of this section only, “density bonus” means an increase in units of 25% over the number of apartments, to be provided within the existing structure or structures proposed for conversion.

C.     For purposes of this section only, “other incentives of equivalent financial value” shall not be construed to require the City to provide cash transfer payments or other monetary compensation but may include the reduction or waiver of requirements which the City might otherwise apply as conditions of conversion approval.

D.    An applicant for approval to convert apartments to a condominium project may submit to the City a preliminary proposal pursuant to this section prior to the submittal of any formal requests for subdivision map approvals. The City shall, within 90 days of receipt of a written proposal, notify the applicant in writing of the manner in which it will comply with this section. The City shall establish procedures for carrying out this section, which shall include approval by the City Council of the means of compliance with this section.

E.     Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the City to approve a proposal to convert apartments to condominiums.

F.     An applicant shall be ineligible for a density bonus or other incentives under this section if the apartments proposed for conversion constitute a housing development for which a density bonus or other incentives were provided under any other section of this chapter.

G.    An applicant shall be ineligible for a density bonus or any other incentives or concessions under this section if the condominium project is proposed on any property that includes a parcel or parcels on which rental dwelling units are or, if the dwelling units have been vacated or demolished in the five-year period preceding the application, have been subject to a recorded covenant, ordinance, or law that restricts rents to levels affordable to persons and families of lower or very low income; subject to any other form of rent or price control through the City’s valid exercise of its police power; or occupied by lower or very low income households, unless the proposed condominium project replaces those units, as defined in Government Code Section 65915(c)(3)(B), and either of the following applies:

1.     The proposed condominium project, inclusive of the units replaced pursuant to Government Code Section 65915(c)(3)(B), contains affordable units at the percentages set forth in subsection A.

2.     Each unit in the development, exclusive of a manager’s unit or units, is affordable to, and occupied by, either a lower or very low income household. (Ord. 1266 § 1, December 1, 2014)

 

20.81.110 Alternative parking standards.
A.    For density bonus projects meeting the criteria set forth under Table 20.81.060 Density Bonus Allowance, upon a request by the applicant, the City shall allow the following modified parking requirements:

B.     The parking ratios set forth in this section are inclusive of accessible and guest parking spaces.

C.     All fractions of numbers shall be rounded up.

D.    An applicant may use tandem or uncovered parking spaces to meet these parking requirements.

E.     An applicant may request parking incentives or concessions beyond those provided in this section pursuant to Section 20.81.070. (Ord. 1266 § 1, December 1, 2014)

 

20.81.120 Design and quality.

1.     Exterior architectural appearance shall not differentiate between affordable and market rate units.

2.     Interior design, finishes and amenities of affordable units may differ from market rate units, but may not be of substandard or inferior quality as determined by the Community Development Director. (Ord. 1266 § 1, December 1, 2014)

 

20.81.130 Child care facilities.
A.    When the applicant proposes to construct a housing development that includes affordable housing units as stated in Table 20.81.060 Density Bonus Allowance and includes a “child care facility,” as defined in this chapter, to be located on the premises of, part of, or adjacent to the housing development, the City shall grant either of the following to the applicant:

1.     An additional density bonus in an amount of square footage of residential space that is equal to or greater than the total square footage of the child care facility; or

2.     An additional incentive or concession that contributes significantly to the economic feasibility of the construction of the child care facility.

B.     A housing development shall be eligible for either the density bonus or concession described in this section once the granting authority makes the following findings:

1.     The granted density bonus or concession would contribute to the economic feasibility of the construction of the child care facility.

2.     The density bonus or concession would not have a significant adverse impact on public health, public safety or the physical environment to an extent which cannot be feasibly mitigated or avoided without compromising the affordability of very-low income, low income and moderate income housing units. A specific adverse impact is a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified, written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date that application was deemed complete.

C.     A floor area density bonus for the provision of a child care facility may be combined with a density bonus granted for the provision of affordable housing units. The combined density bonus for any residential development shall not exceed 35%.

D.    In order to grant the density bonus or concession available under this section, the City shall impose, as a condition of approval of the project, the following:

1.     The child care facility shall remain in operation for the same period of time in which affordable units of the development are proposed and required to remain affordable.

2.     Of the children attending the child care facility, the percentage of children of very-low income, low income or moderate income households shall be equal to or greater than the percentage of the dwelling units proposed to be affordable to very-low income, low income and moderate income households.

E.     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City shall not be required to grant a density bonus or concession under this section if it determines, based on substantial evidence, that the community has adequate child care facilities. (Ord. 1266 § 1, December 1, 2014)

 

20.81.140 Land donations.
A.    An applicant for a tentative subdivision map, parcel map, or other residential development who donates land to the City, as provided for in this section, shall be entitled to a density bonus as shown in Table 20.81.140 Density Bonus for Land Donation.

B.     This increase shall be in addition to any increase in density allowed by Section 20.81.060, up to a maximum combined density bonus of 35% if an applicant seeks both the increase required pursuant to this section and Section 20.81.060. When calculating the number of permitted density bonus units, any calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded to the next whole number.

C.     An applicant shall be eligible for the increased density bonus described in this section when all of the following requirements are met:

1.     The applicant shall donate and transfer the land no later than the date of approval of the final tract or parcel map, or residential development application.

5.     The land shall be transferred to the City, or to a housing developer approved by the City. The City may require the applicant to identify and transfer the land to the housing developer approved by the City.

6.     The transferred land and the very-low income units will be subject to a deed restriction ensuring continued affordability of the units constructed consistent with this chapter, which restriction will be recorded on the property at the time of transfer.

7.     The transferred land shall be within the boundary of the proposed development or, with the approval of the City, within one-quarter mile of the boundary of the proposed development

Chapter 20.85 REQUESTS FOR REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING ACTS
20.85.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a formal procedure to request reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (the Acts) in the application of zoning laws and other land use regulations, policies and procedures, and to establish relevant criteria to be used when considering such requests.

 

20.85.020 Applicability.
In order to make specific housing available to an individual with a disability, any person may request a modification or exception to the rules, standards and practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice.

A person with a disability is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits or substantially limits one or more major life activities, anyone who is regarded as having such impairment, or anyone who has a record of such impairment. This chapter applies only to those persons who are defined as disabled under the Acts.

 

20.85.030 Application requirements.
A.    Requests for reasonable accommodation, in a form approved by the Director of Planning and Building, together with the appropriate fee, as established by resolution adopted by the City Council, and other required information, shall be filed in the office of the Department of Planning and Building.

B.     If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is being made also requires some other discretionary approval under this title (including, but not limited to, a conditional use permit, design review, variance, general plan amendment or zone change), the application shall be submitted and reviewed at the same time as the related applications.

 

20.85.040 Review authority.
A.    If an application under this chapter is filed without any accompanying application for another approval, permit or entitlement under this title, it shall be heard and acted upon by the Zoning Administrator.

B.     If an application under this chapter is filed with an application for another approval, permit or entitlement under this title, it shall be heard and acted upon at the same time and in the same manner as such other application, and shall be subject to all of the same procedures.

 

20.85.050 Findings and decision.
A.    Any decision on an application under this chapter shall be supported by written findings addressing the criteria set forth in this subsection. An application under this chapter for a reasonable accommodation shall be granted if all of the following findings are made:

1.     The housing, which is the subject of the request, will be used by an individual disabled under the Acts.

2.     The requested reasonable accommodation is necessary to make specific housing available to an individual with a disability under the Acts.

3.     The requested reasonable accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the City.

4.     The requested reasonable accommodation would not require a fundamental alteration in the nature of a City program or law, including, but not limited to, land use and zoning.

5.     The requested reasonable accommodation would not adversely impact surrounding properties or uses.

6.     There are no reasonable alternatives that would provide an equivalent level of benefit without requiring a modification or exception to the City’s applicable rules, standards and practices.

B.     In granting a request for reasonable accommodation, the reviewing authority may impose any conditions of approval deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation would comply with the findings required by subsection A above.

 

20.85.060 Appeal determination.
Any decision on an application under this chapter shall be subject to appeal pursuant to Chapter 20.100 of the Municipal Code.

 

20.85.070 Rescission of grants of reasonable accommodation.
Any approval or conditional approval of an application under this chapter may be conditioned to provide for its rescission or automatic expiration under appropriate circumstances. (Ord. 1209, November 21, 2005)

e.     When there is a City-approved and dedicated parking space for a car share vehicle located within one block of the accessory dwelling unit.

N.    Not withstanding the above, where an existing garage is converted into an accessory dwelling unit, the conversion shall not eliminate any required off-street parking for the primary residence.

O.    A deed restriction shall be recorded that provides for the following:

1.     The accessory dwelling unit may be rented, but it may not be sold separately from the primary residence.

Chapter 21.04 TITLE, PURPOSE AND INTERPRETATION
21.04.010 Purpose of title—Planning Commission, powers and duties—Designated.
This title is enacted for the purpose of adopting subdivision regulations in accordance with the Subdivision Map Act of the State of California. The Planning Commission of the City of Mill Valley, hereinafter referred to as the “Planning Commission,” is hereby designated as the advisory agency with respect to subdivisions as provided in said Subdivision Map Act and this title, and shall have all the powers and duties with respect to tentative and final maps and the procedures relating thereto which are specified by law and by this title. (Ord. 447 § 1.1, April 17, 1956)

 

21.04.020 Purpose of title—Subdivision defined.
This title is also enacted under the provisions of Section 11540.1 of the Subdivision Map Act of the State of California, for the purpose of adopting regulations to govern any subdivision which for the purpose of this title is defined as: any real property improved or unimproved, or portion thereof, which is divided for the purpose of sale or lease or any other purpose, whether immediate or future, into five or more lots or parcels wherein any parcel is less than 20 acres in net area. (Ord. 447 § 1.2, April 17, 1956)

 

21.04.030 Purpose of title—Subdivision in less than five parcels.
This title is also enacted to provide for the division or subdivision of any parcel of land in the City into two, three, or four parcels of land, the procedure being set forth in Chapter 21.28.

For such subdivisions the requirements of filing tentative and final maps shall not apply, but such subdivisions shall conform to all of the general regulations and requirements of this title. (Ord. 447 § 1.3, April 17, 1956)

 

21.04.040 Applicability of title.
The regulations established by this title shall apply to all subdivisions or parts of subdivisions of lands lying wholly or in part within the incorporated territory of the City of Mill Valley, and are declared to be the minimum reasonably necessary to promote and protect the public health, safety, peace, morals, comfort and general welfare. (Ord. 447 § 1.4, April 17, 1956)

Repealed and replaced by Chapter 21.70. (Ord. 1031 § 1, April 15, 1985)

 

21.04.050 Hillside areas—Regulations authorized.
There are many areas within the City which are of sloping topography, and the degree of natural slope is widely varied within such areas which are otherwise of a homogeneous character with respect to their suitable basic zoning classification, and it is not feasible or practicable to establish fixed boundaries within such areas, between the portions of different natural slopes.

It is in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare, and consistent with the present and intended character of the City that these hillside lands be developed in a manner productive of optimum living environment and stabilized property values, which are characterized by buildings and appurtenant construction adapted to the topography so as to minimize grading, disturbance of natural features, problems of drainage and soil stability, so as to provide the maximum feasible solar access, so as to provide the maximum of usable outdoor area, views, planting, privacy, and so as to provide safe and convenient vehicular access to the lots.

There is demonstrable correlation between lot area and shape and topography, with respect to the provision of opportunity and incentive to produce optimum hillside development as defined above, and it is feasible to set forth reasonable regulations enumerating said correlation. (Ord. 447 § 1.5, April 17, 1956; Ord. 999 § 6, November 15, 1982)

 

21.04.060 Action by interested official prohibited.
When any provision of the Subdivision Map Act or of this title requires the execution of any certificates or affidavit or the performance of any act by a person in his or her official capacity who is also a subdivider or an agent or employee thereof, such certificate or affidavit shall be executed or such act shall be performed by some other person duly qualified therefor and designated so to act by the City Council. (Ord. 447 § 10, April 17, 1956)

 

21.04.070 Severability.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this title is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the title. The City Council of the City of Mill Valley, State of California, hereby declares that it would have passed this title and each section, subsection, sentence, clause, and phrase thereof irrespective of the fact that any one or more other sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared invalid or unconstitutional. (Ord. 447 § 11, April 17, 1956)

For purposes of this section, minimum width is defined as either: the distance between the side lot lines, measured at right angles to the median between the side lot lines, at a point midway between front and rear lot line; or, the dimension on a line parallel to the average direction of the natural contours, passing through the center of an area which, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, would permit the location of a dwelling with the least amount of grading, the safest and most convenient driveway access, and which would otherwise conform to all provisions of this title, and with the intent of this section.

For the purposes of this section, lot slope shall be measured along a line passing through the center of the lot or the building site between lot lines and perpendicular to the natural contours. Percentage slope equals the vertical rise in feet between two points, divided by the horizontal distance between the two points multiplied by 100, and rounded to the nearest full percent.

The Planning Commission may recommend and/or the City Council may amend and authorize conditional exceptions allowing a lot with lesser width and area than required by the percent of slope. Any such exception should be made pursuant to those guidelines outlined in Chapter 21.36, Exceptions, of this title. In addition to those findings set forth therein, the following findings shall be made.

A.    Demonstrate reasonable and realistic access.

B.     Indicate minimal disturbance of existing site conditions from new construction.

C.     Show minimal impact to neighborhood including traffic circulation and public safety.

Nothing contained in this section shall result in a merger of contiguous parcels or units of land under Section 21.04.044 or any other provision of law. (Ord. 984 § 2, November 2, 1981; Ord. 1093 § 8, March 19, 1990)

(Ord. 447, § 2.6, April 17, 1956)

 

21.08.280 Reserved strips—Requirements.
Reserved strips controlling the access to public ways, or which will not prove taxable for special improvements, will not be approved unless such strips are necessary for the protection of the public welfare or of the substantial property rights, or both, and in no case except when the control and disposal of the land comprising such strips is placed definitely within the jurisdiction of the City under conditions approved by the Planning Commission.

21.08.330 Filling needed—Investigation—Curb grade.
Where marsh or low lands are proposed for subdivision, the subdivider shall have a soil investigation and recommendation made by a recognized, qualified soil mechanics engineer, and the program for development shall be made on the basis thereof. In no case, however, shall any subdivision be approved which has any street curb grade at an elevation of less than eight feet on the standard mean sea level datum as established by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, and then only where there is an adequate provision for the passage of stormwater run-off.

Chapter 21.30 LOT LINE ADJUSTMENTS
21.30.010 Lot line adjustment defined.
“Lot line adjustment” means an adjustment or realignment of a boundary line and a transfer of real property between two adjacent parcels when the adjustment or realignment does not result in the creation of any additional parcels or potential building sites than originally existed.

 

21.30.020 Requirements for lot line adjustments.
Requirements for lot line adjustments shall be as required for subdivisions requiring parcel maps, as specified in Chapters 21.20 and 21.28, except for the following:

B.     The City Engineer may waive the requirement for a parcel map and may require a record of survey; or may waive the filing of a parcel map and record of survey, if he or she determines the adjusted boundary line is already adequately monumented of record or easily located due to existing monumentation of record or other physical circumstances as may be determined by the City Engineer.

Chapter 21.48 DRAINAGE AREAS
21.48.010 Purpose.
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the provisions of Section 11543.5 of the Business and Professions Code of the State of California for the purpose of establishing drainage fees to defray the actual or estimated costs of constructing planned drainage facilities for the removal of surface and stormwaters from local or neighborhood drainage areas. (Ord. 732 § 1, March 15, 1971)

 

21.48.020 Adoption of drainage plan—Findings as to costs.
The following drainage plans and the maps (consisting of one or more parts) which are on file with the City Clerk and estimates of costs contained therein are hereby adopted for the local drainage areas described in said plans:

A.    Mill Valley General Drainage Plan, Part No. 1, Sutton Manor Branch.

B.     Mill Valley General Drainage Plan, Part No. 2, Marshland Area.

C.     Mill Valley General Drainage Plan, Part No. 3, Warner Creek Branch.

D.    Mill Valley General Drainage Plan, Part No. 4, Enchanted Knolls.

E.     Mill Valley General Drainage Plan, Part No. 5, Downtown.

F.     Mill Valley General Drainage Plan, Part No. 6, Old Mill Creek.

G.    Mill Valley General Drainage Plan, Part No. 7, Blithedale Canyon.

The City Council of the City of Mill Valley does hereby find that the subdivision, or division of land not defined as a subdivision, and development of property within the planned local drainage areas will require construction of the facilities described in the drainage plans and the costs, whether actual or estimated, set forth in said plans are based upon such finding. The City Council, by resolution adopted from time to time, shall amend the local drainage plans in order that the costs set forth therein shall truly represent the actual or estimated cost of construction of facilities referred to therein. The resolutions shall establish fees to be paid as a condition of approval of final subdivision maps, or parcel maps for a division of land not defined as a subdivision, which fees shall fairly apportion the cost of construction of the facilities referred to in the drainage plans on the basis of benefits conferred on property proposed for subdivision or other division or on the need for such facilities created by the proposed subdivision or other division and development of property within such areas. The fees so fixed as to any property proposed for subdivision within such a local area shall not exceed the pro rata share of the amount of the total actual or estimated costs of all facilities within such area which would be assessable on such property if such costs were apportioned uniformly on a per acre basis. (Ord. 732 § 1, March 15, 1971)

 

21.48.030 Payment of fees.
All future subdivisions, or divisions of land not defined as a subdivision, within the local drainage areas set forth in Section 21.48.020 shall be charged a drainage fee as set forth in resolutions adopted by the City Council. In the case of subdivisions containing five or more lots, the drainage fee shall be paid by the subdivider to the City on or before the approval of the final map of such subdivision or the payment thereof shall be guaranteed in a manner satisfactory to the City. In the case of a division of land not defined by state law as a subdivision, said drainage fee shall be paid by the subdivider to the City at or prior to the final approval of a parcel map of said division or payment thereof shall be guaranteed in a manner satisfactory to the City. Prior to the issuance of any building permit with a building permit valuation of $5,000.00 or more for construction on a parcel of property which is not a part of a subdivision or other division of land for which a drainage fee has already been paid, the fee set forth in said resolution shall be paid to the City of Mill Valley. The drainage charges imposed by this section shall be in addition to all other charges to be made against the property for street improvements or other purposes. All fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be paid into a “Planned Local Drainage Facilities Fund.” Separate funds shall be established for each local drainage area. Monies in such funds shall be expended solely for construction or reimbursement for construction of local drainage facilities within the area from which the fees comprising the fund were collected, or to reimburse the City for the cost of engineering and administrative services incurred in the establishment of said areas and the design and construction of such facilities. (Ord. 732 § 1, March 15, 1971; Ord. 741 § 1, September 20, 1971)

21.50.020 Limitations and exceptions.
A.    Subdivisions containing less than five parcels and not used for residential purposes shall be exempted from the requirements of this chapter; provided, however, that a condition may be placed on the approval of such parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the parcels within four years after recordation thereof, a fee may be required to be paid by the owner of each such parcel as a condition to the issuance of such permit.

B.     The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to industrial subdivisions.

C.     The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to condominium projects which consist of the subdivision of air space in an existing apartment building which is more than five years old, when no new dwelling units are added.

D.    The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to parcel maps for a subdivision containing less than five parcels for a shopping center containing more than 300,000 square feet of gross leaseable area and no residential development or uses.

E.     When land is required to be dedicated or fees required to be paid, or a combination thereof is required pursuant to this chapter, the same shall be used only for the purpose of providing park or recreational facilities to serve the subdivision for which such requirement is imposed.

F.     The amount and location of land to be dedicated or fees to be paid pursuant to this chapter shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the subdivision for which such requirement is imposed.

G.    Only the payment of fees may be required in subdivisions containing 50 parcels or less.

H.    Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this chapter, the park and recreation facilities for which land is required to be dedicated or fees required to be paid shall be in accordance with definite principles and standards contained in the Recreational Element of the Mill Valley General Plan. (Ord. 944 § 1, June 4, 1979)

 

21.50.030 Requirement of dedication of land or payment of fees.
Subject to the limitations contained in this chapter and in state law, the City may require the dedication of land, the payment of fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of both for park or recreational purposes as a condition to the approval of a final map or parcel map. (Ord. 944 § 1, June 4, 1979)

 

21.50.040 Standards for determining land to be dedicated.
The amount of land to be dedicated shall be based upon the anticipated population density for the proposed subdivision and shall be equal to three acres of land for each 1,000 persons. Anticipated population density shall be determined on the basis of 2.77 persons per dwelling unit. (Ord. 944 § 1, June 4, 1979)

 

21.50.050 Standards for determining in-lieu fees.
The subdivider may be required to pay fees in lieu of dedication of land:

A.    For subdivisions containing 50 parcels or less;

B.     When the City determines that the park or recreational needs of the subdivision can best be served in whole or in part at locations outside the subdivision;

C.     Where the subdivision is served in whole or in part by existing City park or recreational facilities. Fees in lieu of land dedication shall be based on the average current fair market value per acre of land in the proposed subdivision. The City may, in its discretion, require an appraisal of the property to ascertain the average current fair market value per acre. The amount of fees to be paid shall be a sum equal to the fair market value of the land which would otherwise be required to be dedicated in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 21.50.040. (Ord. 944 § 1, June 4, 1979)

 

21.50.060 Credits against dedication or in-lieu fees.
In recognition of the fact that privately owned open space areas and/or recreational facilities may serve the park and recreational needs of a subdivision, and thus reduce the burden on public parks and facilities, the City may grant credits against land or fees otherwise required by the provisions of this chapter. In determining whether such credit shall be allowed, the City may consider, among other matters, the location, shape, topography, geology and access of such private open space and/or recreational facilities, the provisions for ownership, maintenance and supervision thereof, and the relationship of such open space or recreational facilities to the provisions of the Mill Valley General Plan. (Ord. 944 § 1, June 4, 1979)

All land or funds received by the City shall be developed or used in the manner provided in this chapter. At the time of approval of any final map or parcel map, the City shall develop a schedule specifying how and when it will use the land or fees, or both, to develop park or recreational facilities. Any fees collected under this chapter shall be committed within five years after the payment of such fees or the issuance of building permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. If such fees are not committed, they shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lot bears to the total area of all lots within the subdivision. (Ord. 944 § 1, June 4, 1979)

Chapter 21.60 SOLAR ACCESS IN NEW SUBDIVISIONS, RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS
21.60.010 Intent.
In accordance with the provisions of the California Civil Code Section 714, (California Solar Rights Act), it is the intent of this ordinance to encourage the successful use of solar energy in new subdivisions by requiring as a condition of approval of all tentative maps, the insertion of restrictions in the deed of each parcel to assure to the extent feasible that future solar energy systems have adequate and reasonable access to solar energy. (Ord. 997 § 1, November 15, 1982)

 

21.60.020 Definitions.
A.    Restrictive Covenant. A contract between two or more people which involves mutual promises or reciprocal benefits and burdens among the contracting land owners.

B.     Solar Energy System. Any solar collector or other solar energy device or any structural design feature of a building whose primary purpose is to provide for the collection, storage or distribution of solar energy for space heating or cooling, for water heating or for electricity.

C.     South Face of Buildable Area. The southernmost boundary of the buildable portion of the lot which will accommodate the primary building or dwelling.

D.    Unobstructed Sunlight. Energy from the sun which is not blocked by any vegetation or structure between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on December 21st of any year. (Ord. 997 § 1, November 15, 1982)

 

21.60.030 Protection of solar access.
Approval of tentative subdivision maps, including tentative parcel maps, shall be conditional upon the placement of a restrictive covenant in the deed of each lot for the purpose of protecting access to direct sunlight. Such a covenant shall assure that, to the extent feasible, no building, wall, fence, or other structure shall be constructed and no vegetation shall be allowed to grow on the lot so as to prevent unobstructed sunlight from reaching the south face of the buildable area of the adjacent lots.

Reasonable shading which does not cast a shadow greater than 10% upon the south face of the buildable area at any one time shall be allowed, but in no event shall such shading significantly decrease the efficiency of the solar energy system.

Deciduous trees shall be exempt from the terms of the covenant if such trees allow unobstructed sunlight to reach south facing roof areas between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time on June 21st, and do not otherwise significantly impede the operation of a solar energy system.

A proposed restrictive covenant to protect solar access in the subdivision shall be submitted for review by the Planning Commission with the tentative map. In establishing solar access covenants, consideration shall be given to the contour and configuration of the parcel to be divided, size of proposed lots and existing vegetation on the site. It is not the intent of this section to result in reducing development densities, the percentage of a lot which may be occupied by a structure or cause the unnecessary destruction of existing trees. (Ord. 997 § 1, November 15, 1982)

 

21.60.040 Categorical exemptions.
The requirements of this chapter shall not apply to either of the following:

A.    Condominium projects which consist of the subdivision of air space in an existing building when no new structures are added.

B.     Proposed lots in excess of one acre. (Ord. 997 § 1, November 15, 1982)

 

21.60.050 Waiver or modification of requirements.
A.    Criteria. In approving a tentative subdivision map, including a tentative parcel map, the requirements of Section 21.60.030 of this chapter may be waived or modified by the Planning Commission for one or more proposed lots in the subdivision upon the finding that either:

1.     The use of the restrictive covenant will result in reducing densities below what would normally be allowed by the Planning Commission.

2.     The use of a restrictive covenant is not feasible, taking into account economic, environmental, social or technological factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, contour and orientation of the parcels, slope stability, tree preservation and access to existing streets.

B.     Procedure. Any subdivider requesting a waiver for one or more proposed lots or modification of the terms of the covenant, shall submit a written statement and sufficient supporting documentation describing the basis for the request with the tentative map. It is not the intent to require the initial submission of an alternative tentative subdivision or parcel map in submitting sufficient supporting documentation.

 

21.60.070 Severability.
If any provision of this ordinance or application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this ordinance which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application. And to this end, the provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable. (Ord. 997 § 1, November 15, 1982)

Chapter 21.70 MERGER OF PARCELS
21.70.010 Purpose.
This chapter is enacted for the purpose of amending the existing merger ordinance of the City of Mill Valley (previously Section 21.04.044 of the Mill Valley Municipal Code) to bring it into compliance with Section 66451.11 of the California Government Code. The City of Mill Valley had a merger ordinance in existence prior to January 1, 1984.

As used in this chapter, “merged by operation of law” refers to the merger of parcels pursuant to the provisions of the Mill Valley Municipal Code and the State Subdivision Map Act in effect prior to January 1, 1984.

C.     “Merger” means the joining of two or more contiguous parcels or units of improved or unimproved land, which are held by the same owner or owners, into one building site pursuant to this title. Parcels or units may include land division or subdivision lots, assessor’s tax parcels, or lots created by deed.

D.    “Minimum parcel size” means the minimum size to permit development under established zoning, subdivision or other City codes. Minimum size includes lot area required by any applicable lot slope or density standards of Title 20 (Zoning) of the Mill Valley Municipal Code.

E.     Same Owner. Contiguous parcels or units of land are considered to be held by the same owner if one owner holds at least a fractional share in two or more contiguous parcels.

 

21.70.020 General.
Except as provided for in this chapter, two or more contiguous parcels or units of land shall not merge by virtue of the fact that such contiguous parcels are held by the same owner if they were created in one of the following manners:

A.    Pursuant to the provisions of the State Subdivision Map Act;

B.     Pursuant to Mill Valley Municipal Code, Title 21;

C.     Pursuant to any prior City ordinance regulating the division of land;

D.    Or were not subject to such provisions at the time of their creation. If such creation has occurred, no further proceeding under the provisions of this title shall be required to permit sale, lease or financing of such contiguous parcels or units of land.

 

21.70.025 Requirements for merger on or after January 1, 1984.
When any one of two or more contiguous parcels or units of land, which are held by the same owner or owners, on or after January 1, 1984, does not conform to the standards for minimum parcel size under the applicable zoning designation, the contiguous parcels shall merge if all of the following requirements are satisfied:

A.    At least one of the affected parcels is undeveloped by any structure for which a building permit was issued or for which a building permit was not required at the time of construction, or is developed only with an accessory structure or accessory structures, or is developed with a single structure, other than an accessory structure, that is also partially sited on a contiguous parcel or unit of land.

B.     With respect to any affected parcel, one or more of the following conditions exist:

1.     At least one of the affected parcels comprises less than 5,000 square feet in area at the time of the determination of merger.

2.     At least one of the affected parcels was not created in compliance with applicable laws and ordinances in effect at the time of its creation.

3.     At least one of the affected parcels does not meet current standards for sewage disposal.

4.     At least one of the affected parcels does not meet current standards for domestic water supply.

5.     At least one of the affected parcels does not meet slope stability standards. A parcel will be deemed to not meet slope stability standards if more than 50% of its gross area is located within slope stability zones 3 and 4 as shown on the maps prepared by Earth Science Associates as part of the Mill Valley General Plan.

6.     At least one of the affected parcels has no legal access which is adequate for vehicular and safety equipment access and maneuverability. The standards of access shall be those contained in Title 21 of the Mill Valley Municipal Code.

7.     The development of at least one of the affected parcels would create health or safety problems.

8.     At least one of the affected parcels is inconsistent with the policies of the Mill Valley General Plan, other than minimum lot size or density standards.

For purposes of determining whether contiguous parcels are held by the same owner, ownership shall be determined as of the date that the notice of intent to determine status is recorded pursuant to Section 21.70.035.

C.     Subsection B of this section shall not apply if on or before July 1, 1981, one or more of the contiguous parcels or units of land is enforceably restricted open space land pursuant to a contract, agreement, scenic restriction, or open space easement, as defined and set forth in Section 421 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

 

21.70.030 Effective date of merger.
A merger of parcels or units of land becomes effective on the date a notice of merger is filed for record with the Recorder of the County of Marin. A notice of merger shall specify the names of the record owner or owners and shall particularly describe the real property that is the subject of the merger.

 

21.70.035 Notice of intent to determine status.
Prior to recording a notice of merger, the Director of Planning and Building shall cause to be mailed by certified mail to the current record owner of the property a notice of intention to determine status, notifying the owner that the affected parcels may be merged pursuant to standards specified in Title 21 of the Mill Valley Municipal Code, advising the owner of the opportunity to request a hearing on determination of status and to present evidence at the hearing that the property does not meet the criteria for merger. The notice shall also inform the owner or owners that the Planning Commission or Director of Planning and Building is authorized to make a determination of merger or non-merger in accordance with Mill Valley Code Section 21.70.050 based on the information available from County records in the event that a request for hearing is not filed within 30 days pursuant to Mill Valley Municipal Code Section 21.70.040. The notice of intention to determine status shall be filed for record with the recorder of the County of Marin on the date that notice is mailed to the property owner.

 

21.70.040 Request for hearing.
At any time within 30 days after recording of the notice of intention to determine status, the owner of the affected property may file with the Director of Planning and Building a request for a hearing on determination of status.

 

21.70.043 Hearing body.
When a property owner files a request for a hearing on determination of status pursuant to Section 21.70.040, the property owner may request that the hearing be conducted before the Planning Commission or the Zoning Administrator. When a request for hearing does not specify a hearing body, the Zoning Administrator shall conduct the public hearing. In any event, where the Zoning Administrator determines that significant policy questions are at issue, the Zoning Administrator may refer the determination of merger to the Planning Commission for action.

 

21.70.045 Procedure for hearing.
Upon receiving a request for a hearing on determination of status, the Director of Planning and Building shall fix a time, date, and place for a hearing to be conducted by the Planning Commission or the Zoning Administrator, as applicable, and shall so notify the property owner by certified mail. The hearing shall be conducted not less than 30 days following the Director’s receipt of the property owner’s request for hearing, but may be postponed or continued with the mutual consent of the Director of Planning and Building and the property owner. At the hearing, the property owner shall be given the opportunity to present any evidence that the affected property does not meet the standards for merger specified in Title 21 of the Mill Valley Municipal Code. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Planning Commission or the Zoning Administrator, as applicable, shall make a determination that the affected parcels are to be merged or are not to be merged and shall so notify the owner of its determination.

Chapter 21.80 VESTING TENTATIVE MAPS
21.80.010 Citation and authority.
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 66498.1) of Division 2 of Title 7 of the Government Code of the State of California (hereinafter referred to as the Vesting Tentative Map Statute), and may be cited as the “Vesting Tentative Map Ordinance.”

 

21.80.020 Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to establish procedures necessary for the implementation of the Vesting Tentative Map Statute, and to supplement the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and the Mill Valley Subdivision Ordinance. Except as otherwise set forth in the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of the Subdivision Ordinance shall apply to the Vesting Tentative Map Ordinance.

To accomplish this purpose, the regulations outlined in this ordinance are determined to be necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety and general welfare, and for the promotion of orderly growth and development.

 

21.80.030 Consistency.
No land shall be subdivided and developed pursuant to a vesting tentative map for any purpose which is inconsistent with the Mill Valley General Plan and any applicable specific plan or not permitted by Title 20 (Zoning Ordinance) or other applicable provisions of the Mill Valley Municipal Code.

 

21.80.040 Definitions.
A.    A “vesting tentative map” shall mean a “tentative map” for a residential subdivision, as defined in the Mill Valley Subdivision Ordinance, that shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words “Vesting Tentative Map” at the time it is filed in accordance with Section 21.80.060 and is thereafter processed in accordance with the provisions hereof.

B.     All other definitions set forth in the Mill Valley Subdivision Ordinance are applicable.

 

21.80.050 Application.
A.    This chapter shall apply only to residential developments. Whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act, as implemented and supplemented by the Mill Valley Subdivision Ordinance, requires the filing of a tentative map and tentative parcel map for a residential development, a vesting tentative map may instead be filed, in accordance with the provisions hereof.

B.     If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by the Vesting Tentative Map Statute, the filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, permit for construction, or work preparatory to construction.

 

21.80.060 Filing and processing.
A vesting tentative map shall be filed in the same form and have the same contents, accompanying data and reports and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in the Mill Valley Subdivision Ordinance for a tentative map except as hereinafter provided:

A.    At the time a vesting tentative map is filed, it shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words “Vesting Tentative Map.”

B.     At the time a vesting tentative map is filed, a subdivider shall also supply the following information:

1.     The height, size, and location of buildings.

2.     Sewer, water, storm drain and road details.

3.     Information on the uses to which the buildings will be put.

4.     Detailed grading plans.

5.     Geological studies.

6.     Flood control information.

7.     Architectural plans for the units.

 

21.80.070 Fees.
Upon filing a vesting tentative map, the subdivider shall pay the fees required by resolution adopted by City Council for the filing and processing of a tentative map.

 

21.80.080 Expiration.
The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall expire at the end of the same time period, and shall be subject to the same extensions, established by the Subdivision Ordinance for the expiration of the approval or conditional approval of a tentative map.

 

21.80.090 Vesting on approval of vesting tentative map.
A.    The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards described in Government Code Section 66474.2.

However, if Section 66474.2 of the Government Code is repealed, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved.

B.     Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a permit, approval, extension, or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following are determined:

1.     A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both.

2.     The condition or denial is required, in order to comply with state or federal law.

C.     The rights deferred to herein shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in Section 21.80.080. If the final map is approved, these rights shall last for the following periods of time:

1.     An initial time period of two years. Where several maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded.

2.     The initial time period set forth in paragraph 1 of this subsection shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review, if such processing exceeds 30 days from the date a complete application is filed.

3.     A subdivider may apply for a one-year extension at any time before the initial time period set forth in paragraph 1 of this subsection expires. If the extension is denied, the subdivider may appeal that denial to the City Council within 15 days.

4.     If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time specified in paragraphs 1—3 of this subsection, the rights referred to herein shall continue until the expiration of that permit, or any extension of that permit.

 

21.80.100 Development inconsistent with zoning—Conditional approval.
A.    Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning ordinance in existence at that time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The City may deny such a vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned on the subdivider, or his/her designee, obtaining the necessary change in the zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If the change in the zoning ordinance is obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall, notwithstanding Section 21.80.090(A), confer the vested right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning ordinance and the map, as approved.

B.     The rights conferred by this section shall be for the time periods set forth in Section 21.80.090(C).

 

21.80.110 Applications inconsistent with current policies.
Notwithstanding any provision of this ordinance, a property owner or his/her designee may seek approvals or permits for development which depart from the ordinances, policies, and standards described in Sections 21.80.090(A) and 21.80.100, and local agencies may grant these approvals or issue these permits to the extent that the departures are authorized under applicable law. (Ord. 1045 § 1, December 16, 1985)
