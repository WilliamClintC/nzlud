REDWOOD CITY, CALIFORNIA - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of
Redwood City, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 20,
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
  
> 
PREFACE 
The Redwood City, California Municipal Code, originally published by Sterling Codifiers, Inc., has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Sterling Codifiers, Inc., and subsequently Book Publishing Company. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance list and disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 20, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 2463, passed May 20, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a decimal. The figure before the decimal refers to the chapter number and the figure after the decimal refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1.2, and the first section of chapter 9 is numbered 9.1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. 
Ordinance History Note 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and date. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 5-6-2002).) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 20 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross-referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 20 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List 
Beginning with Supplement No. 20, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Insertion Guide 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Insertion Guide. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference.

ARTICLE II. - ADMINISTRATIVE CODE ENFORCEMENT 
 
Sec. 1.10. - ADMINISTRATIVE CODE ENFORCEMENT:  
Sec. 1.10.0. - STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND INTENT: 
The Council has determined that the enforcement of the Municipal Code and applicable State codes throughout the City is an important public service and is vital to the protection of the public's health, safety and quality of life. The Council has determined that there is a need for alternative methods of code enforcement and that a comprehensive code enforcement system uses a combination of judicial and administrative remedies to gain compliance with code regulations. The Council finds that there is a need to draft precise regulations that can be effectively applied in judicial and administrative proceedings and further finds that there is a need to establish uniform procedures for the administrative enforcement hearings.

A.  All appeals authorized by this Municipal Code or the Redwood City Zoning Code for which there is no conflicting specific provision shall be processed and heard as set forth in this Article III.

Accordingly, any final determination of the Planning Commission, City Manager, Zoning Administrator, Community Development Director, or other discretionary decision by City staff may be called up for review and shall be processed and heard as set forth in this Article III, unless there is a conflicting specific provision. A call up is not an appeal and does not require that a Council member requesting review be aggrieved or object to a decision. If a Council member requests a call up, there shall be a presumption that the reason is that the action would benefit from additional review, transparency or public participation. No inference of bias shall be made or implied due to a call up request being filed.

Sec. 1.45.85. - SCHEDULING AN APPEAL OR CALL UP:

B.  If so requested by the appellant, if any, and the cost of copies are paid in advance, the City Clerk shall also provide to the appellant copies of all materials being submitted by city staff to be considered by the reviewing body. The charge for copies of such materials shall be the cost of such copies as established by City Council resolution. Except for reports regarding those matters authorized to be heard in closed session, the staff report and all records and materials being submitted by city staff to the reviewing body shall be made available to the public at the time of distribution. In addition, when any matter is contested and a request is made in writing prior to the date of the hearing, a record shall be made and duly preserved, a copy of which shall be available at cost.

C.  The hearing shall be conducted as other public hearings, with a staff presentation of the matter prior to the public hearing. Any member of the public, including the appellant, if applicable, and the applicant shall have the right to be heard by the reviewing body either in person or by counsel.

No party shall have the right to cross-examine any other party or witness. 
D.  When reviewing any decision on appeal or call up, the reviewing body shall use the same standards for decision making and shall make findings in accordance with the Municipal Code, Redwood City Zoning Code, or applicable state law. The reviewing body may adopt the lower decision-making body's decision and findings as its own and may affirm, reverse, or modify any decision or determination appealed or called up. 
E.  Notice of the decision of the reviewing body shall be provided to the appellant, where applicable, and the applicant in the same manner as the notice of the hearing. 
F.  A decision of the City Council becomes final on the date of the decision. A decision of other reviewing bodies becomes final when the opportunity to appeal and/or call up the decision has expired. A person aggrieved by a final decision may seek judicial review by timely appealing to the appropriate court pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1094.5, 1094.6, 1094.8 or other applicable law.

DIVISION 1. - INTRODUCTION AND BASIC PRINCIPLES 
 
Sec. 3.50. - TITLE: 
This title may be known as the "Redwood City Sign Ordinance," or the "Sign Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 2309, § 2, 5-7-07)  
Sec. 3.51. - REGULATORY SCOPE: 
This Article regulates signs, as defined in this Article, located on private property which is not public right-of-way, and on properties which are owned by public entities other than the City, and over which the City has land use regulatory authority. Further, this Article does not regulate signs used in conjunction with special public events, when such events are regulated by Article III of this Chapter. The City's policies regarding private party signs on property owned or controlled by the City, as well as on public rights-of-way, are stated in Article III of this Chapter. Except where otherwise expressly provided in this Article, all signs within the regulatory scope of this Article shall be erected and maintained in conformity with this Article. 
(Ord. No. 2309, § 2, 5-7-07)  
Sec. 3.52. - BALANCING: 
This Article states the legislative decisions made by the City Council regarding display of signs on regulated land, after carefully balancing many competing factors and interests. This Article consolidates all general provisions relating to the installation, regulation and amortization of signs on regulated land throughout the City. 
(Ord. No. 2309, § 2, 5-7-07)  
Sec. 3.53—3.56. - RESERVED:  
Sec. 3.57. - PURPOSES: 
The City has a reputation as a community of natural beauty, distinctive architecture and historic tradition. Signs significantly affect the aesthetic appeal of the City and its streetscapes; they also affect the quality of the visual environment and influence perceptions of local economic conditions. The purpose of this Article is to ensure that information by signs on regulated land is presented safely and effectively in a manner which enhances the quality of the visual environment, aids in attracting shoppers and other visitors, and promotes traffic safety and convenient circulation for motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians. This Article is enacted to further the public health, welfare and safety, and to serve the City's interests in promoting community aesthetics, commerce and tourism, to serve the interests in the safety of traffic, pedestrians and animals, to protect and preserve property values, and to protect the right of free speech by sign display. 
(Ord. No. 2309, § 2, 5-7-07)  
Sec. 3.58. - OBJECTIVES: 
The objects of this Article include: 
A.  Implementation of General Plan: To implement the goals and policies of the City General Plan by establishing uniform standards and procedures to control the size, type, number, design, placement, illumination and maintenance of signs on regulated property; 
B.  Site Relevance: To encourage signs that are attractive and functional for the type of establishment to which they may pertain, and that are in scale and architectural harmony with the project site, project building(s), adjacent buildings and development in the commercial district or neighborhood in which they are located; 
C.  Reduction of Visual Clutter: To reduce visual clutter by generally prohibiting the erection, construction or use of any off-site commercial signs on permanent structures (billboards), oversized signs, roof signs, animated signs and electronic message signs, other than those which are already legally existing in the City as of the date this Article, or when a prior version of this Article containing a similar provision first took effect; 
D.  Aesthetics: To enhance the aesthetic appeal of commercial streetscapes and minimize distractions to motorists by limiting the percentage of any storefront window that may be covered with signs and by limiting the combined area of signs displayed on any building facade; 
E.  Neighborhood Preservation: To protect and preserve the character of residential areas by prohibiting commercial signage in such areas, except as required by State law or applicable judicial decisions; 
F.  Historic Preservation: To establish procedures to allow the continued use, maintenance and repair of nonconforming historic signs that preserve locally recognized values of community appearance or that reflect unique characteristics of development; 
G.  Safety: To promote traffic safety by prohibiting signs that constitute a traffic hazard or obstruct the visibility of motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians, or cause confusion by virtue of visual similarity to traffic control signs; and 
H.  Updating: To encourage the upgrading, updating or removal of signs that are poorly maintained, out of character with their surroundings, or do not conform to this Article. 
(Ord. No. 2309, § 2, 5-7-07)  
Sec. 3.59. - BASIC PRINCIPLES: 
The principles, policies, rules and regulations stated in this Section (the "Basic Principles") apply to all signs within the regulatory scope of this Article and to all provisions of this Article, and override more specific provisions to the contrary. 
A.  Administration Authority: The Director is authorized and assigned the duty of enforcing all provisions of this Article. 
B.  Compliance and Permits: No person shall erect, place, display or maintain any sign in violation of this Article. To insure compliance with this Article, a sign permit shall be required for any sign, except as provided herein. 
C.  Administrative Interpretations: All interpretations of this Article are to be exercised in light of the City's message neutrality and message substitution policies stated in this Section. Where a particular type of sign is proposed in a permit application, and the type is neither expressly allowed nor prohibited by this Article, or whenever a sign does not qualify as a "structure" as defined in the Redwood City Building Code, then the Director shall approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the application based on the most similar sign type, using physical and structural similarity, that is expressly regulated by this Article. 
D.  Message Neutrality: It is the City's policy and intent to regulate signs in a manner which is consistent with the speech freedoms of both the United States and California constitutions, by enacting regulations which are content neutral, while recognizing the differing levels of protection as to noncommercial and commercial messages. 
E.  Message Substitution: Subject to the property owner's consent, a noncommercial message of any category or content may be substituted, in whole or in part, for any allowed commercial message or any noncommercial message, provided that the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or permitting. In addition, any sign display area which is available but unused, on any particular lot or parcel, may be used for signs displaying noncommercial messages, at any time; such signs are subject to a permit only if the sign qualifies as a "structure" under the Building Code. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. This provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a site; it does not create a right to substitute an off-site commercial message in place of an on-site commercial message; it does not create a right to substitute an off-site commercial message in place of a noncommercial message, no matter where such noncommercial message may be located; it does not affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted; it does not authorize changing the physical method of message display without a permit. 
F.  Purpose of Permitting: All permitting and approval processes required by this Article are intended to insure compliance with this Article and various safety codes, as well as to prevent the loss of time, effort, materials and investment which might otherwise be invested in an illegal sign. 
G.  Noncommunicative Aspects of Signs: All rules and regulations concerning the noncommunicative aspects of signs including, but not limited to, location, size, allowable area, height, illumination, spacing between signs, orientation and density, etc., stand enforceable independently of any permit or approval process. 
H.  Billboard Policy: It is a fundamental land use policy of the City to completely prohibit the construction, erection or use of any and all billboards (as defined herein), other than those which legally exist in the City, or for which a valid permit has been issued and has not expired, as of the date on which this provision, or when a prior version of this Article containing a provision to the same effect, was adopted. In approving this Article, the City Council affirmatively declares that its billboard policy is a fundamental land use policy, and that it would have adopted this billboard policy even if it were the only provision in this Article. The City Council intends for this billboard policy to be severable and separately enforceable even if other provision(s) of this Article may be declared, by a court of competent jurisdiction, to be unconstitutional, invalid or unenforceable. This provision does not prohibit agreements to relocate presently existing legal billboards as encouraged by State law, including, but not limited to, Business and Professions Code section 5412 as that Section may be amended from time to time. 
I.  Property Owner's Consent: No sign may be displayed on private tangible property or other regulated land without the property owner's consent. 
J.  Signage Rights and Duties: As to all signs attached to real property, the signage rights, duties and obligations arising from this Article attach to and travel with the land or other property on which a sign is mounted or displayed. This provision does not modify or affect the law of fixtures, sign-related provisions in private leases (so long as they are not in conflict with this Article or other law), or the ownership of sign structures. This provision does not apply to hand-held signs or other images which are aspects of personal appearance. 
K.  Master Sign Program/Precise Plans: Master Sign Programs for specific developments, planned developments, specific plans, precise plans as well as special sign districts or sign-related overlays, when duly approved by the City, may modify the rules stated in this Article as to the noncommunicative aspects of signs, but may not override or modify any of the Basic Principles stated in this Section. All of the provisions of this Section shall automatically apply to and be deemed a part of any master sign program, precise plan, sign district or sign-related overlay zoning, which is approved after the date on which this provision, or a prior version of this Article containing the same provision, was adopted. 
L.  Mixed Use Zoning Districts: For purposes of this Article in zoning districts allowing both residential and nonresidential uses, all legal residential uses shall be treated as if they were located in a residential district which would allow a residential unit of the same type (i.e., single-family residence and/or multifamily residence), and all legal nonresidential uses shall be treated as if they were located in a nonresidential district allowing nonresidential uses of the same type. 
M.  Severance: If any provision of this Article or the application thereof is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity shall not affect any other provision or application of this Article that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application and, to this end, all of the provisions of this Article are severable. In adopting this Article, the City Council declares that if it had known that certain provisions were legally invalid, it would have adopted the Article without such provisions.

A permit is required whenever there is a change of use or a change of establishment at the property on which the sign is placed, which also involves a change to the signage or copy on a permanent sign. Signage rights and duties apply to specific uses at specific locations and cannot be transferred from one location to another.

Sec. 3.64. - VALIDITY OF PERMIT:

In order to renew action on a permit after expiration, the permittee shall pay a new full permit fee. 
Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of the time within which work may commence under that permit when the permittee is unable to commence work within the time required by this Section for reasons beyond the control of the permittee. The Director may extend the time for action by the permittee for a period not exceeding one year on written request by the permittee showing that circumstances beyond the control of the permittee have prevented action from being taken.

Revocations under this Section shall be heard and appealed in the same manner as any other sign-related decision.

B.  No variance may be granted for signs otherwise prohibited by this Article. 
(Ord. No. 2309, § 2, 5-7-07)  
Sec. 3.98. - REQUIRED FINDINGS: 
In order to prevent or lessen practical difficulties and unnecessary hardship inconsistent with the purpose and objectives of this Article, the Director may grant or conditionally grant variances to the sign regulations contained in this Article, up to a maximum of thirty percent (30%) of the otherwise applicable rule, as they pertain to the noncommunicative aspects of signs, provided each of the following findings are made: 
A.  Special Circumstances: Due to special circumstances applicable to the property including, but not limited to, lot size, shape, topography, location, lot frontage, surrounding uses, existing buildings or the classification of the street from which the sign is intended to be viewed, the strict application of the provisions of this Article would deprive the property owner and/or establishment of privileges enjoyed by other properties and/or establishments in the vicinity.

Sec. 3.100. - GENERAL APPLICATION: 
Any illegal, abandoned or nonconforming sign shall be removed or modified to comply with the requirements of this Article as set forth in this Division. 
(Ord. No. 2309, § 2, 5-7-07)  
Sec. 3.101. - ILLEGAL SIGNS: 
Illegal signs shall be abated by the property owner or person responsible for installing or maintaining the sign. The duty to abate arises upon notice by the Director. Such notice shall give such parties a thirty (30) day opportunity to cure by conformance to current law and/or current permit, to abate by removal or other remedial action. Such notices may be appealed in the same manner as any other sign-related decision. However, when a sign poses a serious and immediate threat to public health or safety by virtue of its physical condition, without consideration of the message thereon, then the threat may be summarily abated by the City, with the reasonable cost of abatement chargeable to the sign owner and/or property owner. 
(Ord. No. 2309, § 2, 5-7-07)  
Sec. 3.102. - ABANDONED SIGNS AND/OR DISPLAY:

Sec. 3.103. - INVENTORY OF ILLEGAL AND ABANDONED SIGNS: 
In connection with the adoption of a prior version of this Article, in 1999 the City conducted an inventory of nonconforming signs and held a public hearing to confirm the 1999 version of the sign ordinance. Because this version of the sign ordinance does not impose new restrictions on onsite commercial signage, it is not necessary to conduct a new inventory or hold a new confirmation hearing. This Section does not apply to signs and structures which are subject to Business and Professions Code section 5412. 
The City of Redwood City validates and reconfirms the inventory of nonconforming signs which was conducted in 1999, except that for amortization purposes under this Article, nonconformance under the 1999 inventory shall be limited to noncommunicative aspects of the subject signs, and not upon message content; however, the on-site/off-site distinction is considered to be based on location, not content. 
(Ord. No. 2309, § 2, 5-7-07)  
Sec. 3.104. - NONCONFORMING SIGNS: 
Any sign which becomes nonconforming as a result of the provisions of this Article, or provisions of a prior version of the sign ordinance which operated to the same effect, shall be considered to be an illegal sign after the amortization period provided in the amortization chart of this Section has expired and conformance has not been accomplished. The City shall order the sign to be abated by the property owner and/or person responsible for its installation and/or maintenance. The use, routine maintenance and repair of any sign that was legally installed but does not conform to the requirements of this Article may be continued during the amortization period subject to the following conditions: 
A.  Relocation and Alteration: No nonconforming sign shall be moved, enlarged in size or raised in height unless such relocation, alteration or enlargement is required by law or brings the sign into conformance with the provisions of this Article. Modification of a nonconforming sign may be permitted through the sign permit application process so long as it is determined that there is an increase in the level of conformity of the subject nonconforming sign. Modifying a nonconforming sign will not change its status in the amortization schedule below. 
B.  Restoration of Damaged Signs: As determined by the Director, whenever fifty percent (50%) or less of a nonconforming sign is destroyed by fire or other calamity (not including intentional acts), the sign may be restored to its nonconforming condition and the use modified as necessary to comply with current safety code requirements, routine maintenance and repair of the sign may be continued for the remainder of the amortization period provided in the amortization chart of this Section. Any nonconforming sign that is destroyed by more than fifty percent (50%) shall not be restored unless it is brought into compliance with the provisions of this Article. The extent of damage to any sign shall be based upon the ratio of the estimated cost of restoring the sign to its pre-damaged condition to the estimated cost of replacing the entire sign with an identical sign, or its nearest current equivalent. Adequate cost estimates for this purpose shall be submitted by the owner of the sign for review by the City prior to commencement of any work to restore a nonconforming sign that has been damaged. 
C.  Building Facade Modifications: If a building permit is issued for major modifications to the exterior of a building facade, as determined by the City, any nonconforming building signs on the facade undergoing modification shall be brought into full conformance with the provisions of this Article prior to the issuance of a final building permit. 
D.  Amortization Chart: Pursuant to the applicable State law, nonconforming signs shall be removed, modified, replaced or otherwise made to comply with the provisions of this Article within the following time periods, which shall commence to run on the effective date hereof: 
Type of Nonconforming 
Sign 	Time for 
Compliance

A sign permit shall not be required from the City for the work that is performed in accordance with the provisions of this Section. 
B.  Other Signs: Any sign, other than a painted sign, shall be abated by removal of the sign or by its modification, alteration or replacement. A sign permit shall be obtained from the City prior to the modification, alteration or replacement of any nonconforming sign.

Any franchise granted under the terms and conditions contained herein shall be consistent with Federal laws and regulations and State general laws and regulations. 
Any franchise granted is hereby made subject to the general ordinance provisions now in effect or hereinafter made effective. Nothing in this franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements of other grantor codes and ordinances regarding permits, fees to be paid or manner of construct.

It shall further apply to the extent permitted by applicable Federal or State law to all existing franchises granted or renewed prior to the effective date of this Article.

The grantee shall comply with all applicable grantor construction codes and procedures. 
Nothing in the agreement shall abrogate the right of the grantor to perform any public work or public improvement of any description, including without limitation all work authorized by applicable law.

In the event that the grantee refuses or neglects to protect, alter or relocate all or any part of the system, the grantor shall have the right in connection with the performance of such public work or public improvement to break through, remove, alter or relocate all or any part of the system without any liability to the grantee except for the grantor's willful misconduct; and the grantee shall promptly pay to the grantor the costs incurred by such breaking through, removal, alteration or relocation.

In the event that the grantee is a corporation, such prior approval of the Council shall be required where there is an actual change in control. The word control as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. 
The grantee shall promptly notify the grantor of any proposed change in or transfer of or acquisition by any transfer or acquisition of control of the grantee which shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the grantor shall have consent thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
In seeking the grantor's consent to any change in ownership or control, the grantee shall be required to show to the satisfaction of the grantor that the proposed transferee is legally, technically and financially qualified to maintain and operate the cable system for the remaining term of the franchise under the existing franchise terms. 
In no event shall a transfer in ownership or control be approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory to the agreement. 
J.  Franchise renewal. Franchise renewal shall be in accordance with applicable law.

CHAPTER 15 - SMOKING REGULATIONS  
ARTICLE I. - LOCAL SMOKING REGULATIONS 
 
Sec. 15.1. - FINDINGS AND PURPOSE: 
The Council of Redwood City hereby finds that: 
A.  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution; 
B.  Reliable studies have shown that breathing smoke exhaled or otherwise produced or caused by others ("secondhand smoke") is a significant health hazard, particularly for certain population groups, including elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease; 
C.  Health hazards induced by breathing secondhand smoke include lung cancer, respiratory infection, decreased respiratory function, bronchoconstriction and bronchospasm; 
D.  Nonsmokers with allergies, respiratory diseases and those who suffer other ill effects of breathing secondhand smoke may experience a loss of job productivity or may be forced to take periodic sick leave because of adverse reactions to the same; 
E.  Numerous studies have shown that a majority of both nonsmokers and smokers desire to have restrictions on smoking in public places and places of employment; and 
F.  Smoking is a documented cause of fires, and cigarette and cigar burns and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures cause economic losses to businesses. 
G.  Accordingly, the Council finds and declares that the purposes of this Chapter are to: 
1.  Protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places, except in designated smoking areas, and by regulating smoking in places of employment; and 
2.  Strike a reasonable balance between the needs of smokers and the need of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air and to recognize that, where these needs conflict, the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority.

Sec. 17.10. - FINDINGS, DECLARATION: 
The Council of Redwood City finds and declares that: access to health care facilities is critical and uniquely important to the public health, welfare and safety; persons desiring or needing access to such services should not be hampered, impeded, harassed or intimidated from obtaining those services; conditions have arisen in this City where persons attempting to obtain access to, or depart from, health care facilities have been particularly subject to harassing or intimidating activity tending to hamper or impede their access to, or departure from, such facilities by persons who approach them at extremely close proximity and shout or wave objects at them; such activity cannot reasonably be avoided by the victims of such harassment without the protection afforded by regulation of the proximity to them of persons conducting such harassing or intimidating activities; adverse physiological and emotional effects are created by such harassing and intimidating activities; such activities undermine a person's right to privacy and interfere with a person's right to seek and obtain legitimate medical advice and treatment; such conditions require the enactment of reasonable time, place and manner restrictions upon the legitimate activities of persons who desire to convey messages or information to persons seeking access to health care facilities; this Article is a necessary time, place and manner restriction intended to reconcile, balance and protect rights of expression, rights of privacy and the right to conduct legitimate economic enterprises; nothing herein contained is intended to preclude protesting, picketing, demonstrating, leafleting or counseling activities in the vicinity of a health care facility, but this Article is intended to preclude those activities which tend to harass, intimidate or intrude upon the right of access of persons to health care facilities. 
(Ord. No. 2061, § 3, 6-14-93)  
Sec. 17.11. - DEFINITIONS: 
For the purposes of this Article, the following terms are defined as herein set forth: 
ACCESS AREA: Any portion of a public street or other public place or any place open to the public within one hundred feet (100') of an exterior wall of a health care facility. 
DEMONSTRATION ACTIVITY: All expressive and symbolic conduct, whether active or passive, which shall include, but not be limited to, protesting, picketing, distributing literature, and engaging in oral or silent protest, education or counseling activities. 
HEALTH CARE FACILITY: Any medical or health facility, hospital or clinic within the City which is licensed under State law or any building, office or other place within the City regularly used by any health care provider licensed under State law to provide medical, nursing or health care or advice to patients. 
(Ord. No. 2061, § 3, 6-14-93)  
Sec. 17.12. - IMPEDING ACCESS PROHIBITED: 
A.  Any person who, in the course of demonstration activity within the access area of a health care facility, acting alone or in concert with others, impedes or hampers the free access to or departure from any health care facility by failing to withdraw immediately to a distance of at least eight feet (8') away from any person who has requested such withdrawal is guilty of an infraction. 
B.  For purposes of this Section, withdrawal may be requested by a person verbally, or by carrying or wearing a visible sign clearly indicating such withdrawal request. Statements by a person, or signs carried or worn by a person displaying words or symbols such as, or similar in effect to, "stop", "stop it", "withdraw", "back off", "get away" or "leave me alone" shall be sufficient to constitute a request to withdraw under this Section. Failure to comply immediately with any such request shall constitute a violation of this Section. Mere statements of opinion or disagreements made in the absence of a request to withdraw shall not be construed to be a request to withdraw under this Section. 
C.  Distance under this Section shall be measured from that part of the closest demonstrator's body that is nearest to the closest part of the requesting person's body. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "body" shall include any natural or artificial extension thereof, including, but not limited to, an outstretched arm or a handheld sign.

Sec. 17.14. - PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION: 
A.  Any person who is seeking or intends to seek access to a health care facility and is aggrieved by an act prohibited in Section 17.12 may bring an action for damages, injunctive and/or declaratory relief, as appropriate, in a court of competent jurisdiction against any person who has violated, has conspired to violate, or proposes to violate its provisions. 
B.  Any person who prevails in such an action shall be entitled to recover from the violator such damages, costs, attorneys fees and such other relief as determined by the court. In addition to all other damages, the court may award to the aggrieved person a civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each violation. 
C.  The remedies provided by this Section are in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies the aggrieved person may have and are not intended to be exclusive.

Upon receipt of an application, the Director shall determine whether the improvements proposed to be acquired from or constructed by the applicant include or require supplemental size, capacity, number, or length for the benefit of property not owned by the applicant or (if applicable) not within an area under subdivision by the applicant. If the Director does determine that such improvements do or shall contain such supplemental size, capacity, number, or length, the director shall further determine whether the appraised or estimated excess costs related to the supplemental improvements equal or exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). If the Director determines that said excess costs do not equal or exceed said amount, the Director shall reject the application, and proceedings under this Article shall thereupon terminate.

(Ord. No. 2045, § 2, 9-16-91)  
Sec. 18.212. - DIRECTOR'S REPORT: 
Upon determining initially that the excess costs related to the supplemental improvements equal or exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), the Director shall prepare a report to the Council which shall include the following: 
A.  The initial determination of the costs of the improvements, including the supplemental improvements; 
B.  A description of each benefited property by legal description, assessor's parcel number, or other description sufficient to identify the same; 
C.  The names and addresses of the owners of each benefited property; 
D.  A general description of the improvements and the portion thereof constituting the supplemental improvements;

(Ord. No. 2045, § 2, 9-16-91)  
Sec. 18.213. - RESOLUTION OF INTENTION: 
Upon consideration of the Director's report, the Council may determine preliminarily to grant the application for a reimbursement agreement by adopting a resolution of intention to acquire or construct the improvements pursuant to the provisions of this Article and to establish a reimbursement charge which shall be imposed upon the owners of benefited property at such time as such owners or their successors in interest apply for a permit or other entitlement to connect to, obtain access to, or use the improvements or which otherwise shall be imposed as a condition of issuance of a building permit, use permit, planned development permit or other entitlement for the use or development of such benefited property. The resolution of intention shall include the formula or formulae upon which the reimbursement charge is proposed to be calculated and imposed throughout the benefit area.

(Ord. No. 2045, § 2, 9-16-91)

No property owned by the City shall be included in a benefit area or be subject to payment of a reimbursement charge; provided, however, that the Council may provide for a contribution to payment of the costs of the improvements in proportion to the benefit to be derived by any City-owned property from such improvements. If any lot or parcel of land belonging to the United States, or to the State, or any county, city (other than the City of Redwood City), district, or other public agency, which property is in use for performance of any public function, is included within a benefit area, the Council may, in its resolution of intention, declare that such lots or parcels of land, or any of them, shall be omitted from the benefit area and not be subject to a reimbursement charge. 
The Director, in his or her report prepared pursuant to Section 18.212, or the Council, may exclude property from a benefit area, and exempt the owner thereof from the payment of a reimbursement charge upon finding that the property is adequately served by existing public improvements which provide substantially the same benefit or benefits to the property as those proposed to be provided pursuant to a reimbursement agreement. Such property may continue to be served by such existing improvements or may be permitted to connect to, obtain access to, or use the improvements constructed pursuant to the provisions of this Article without cost or charge to the owner, as the Director or Council may determine.

Said security shall be in the form of cash, cashier's check, performance bond, letter of credit, or other security instrument, the nature of which shall be subject to the approval of the Director and the form of which shall be subject to the approval of the City Attorney.

If a resolution approving the application for a reimbursement agreement and approving and authorizing the execution of such agreement is adopted pursuant to Section 18.222 and the applicant fails or refuses to enter into said agreement and/or fails or refuses to deposit the full costs of the improvements pursuant thereto, the aforesaid security deposit shall be retained by the City as liquidated damages, it being impracticable or extremely difficult to fix actual damages caused by the applicant's aforesaid default.

If any such modification provides for the inclusion of benefited property not originally included within the benefit area or increases the reimbursement charge payable with respect to any benefited property, the council shall not make a final determination in the matter of such modification unless the matter has been set for hearing at a subsequent meeting of the Council, which it shall call or to which it may adjourn; provided, that the Council shall give notice of the time, place and purpose of said meeting in the same manner in which notice of the original hearing was given at least ten (10) days prior to the subsequent or adjourned hearing. If such modification results in the exclusion of property originally included within the benefit area, results in the reduction of any reimbursement charge or charges, or pertains to a change in the formula or formulae upon which reimbursement charges are based without any resultant increase in any reimbursement charge, no further hearing need be held. 
(Ord. No. 2045, § 2, 9-16-91)  
Sec. 18.220. - MAJORITY PROTEST:

ARTICLE XV. - TRANSPORTATION IMPACT FEE 
 
Sec. 18.244. - FINDINGS: 
The Council of Redwood City determines and declares that: 
A.  Traffic conditions in the City, particularly at "peak hours," have reached a high level of congestion which, if not alleviated by construction of capital facilities and implementation of traffic reduction measures, will reach an intolerable level, detrimental to the public safety, health, and welfare. 
B.  Revenues necessary to the construction of capital facilities and traffic reduction measures to alleviate the effect upon traffic of new residential and non-residential development may be obtained by imposition of a transportation impact fee enacted in accordance with Government Code section 66000, et seq. 
C.  The imposition of impact fees is one of the preferred methods of ensuring that new development bears a proportionate share of the costs of capital facilities and traffic reduction measures necessary to accommodate such development. 
D.  This Article describes those types of land development which will generate traffic, necessitating the acquisition of rights-of-way, road construction, road improvements, pedestrian, bicycle and transit improvements, and traffic reduction measures in order to maintain approved levels of transportation service. 
E.  The fees established by resolution pursuant to this Article shall not exceed the costs of providing additional rights-of-way, road construction, road improvements, pedestrian, bicycle and transit improvements, and traffic reduction measures necessitated by the new land developments upon which the fees are levied. 
F.  The fees collected pursuant to this Article shall be used to finance the road improvements and related facilities and measures approved by resolution initially adopted concurrently with the adoption of the ordinance enacting this Article, which resolution may be amended from time to time by subsequent resolutions duly adopted after public hearing on the question of approval of such projects and the corresponding transportation impact fees. 
G.  There shall be a reasonable relationship between the need for the public facilities and traffic reduction measures described in the above-mentioned resolution and the impacts of the types of development for which the corresponding fee shall be levied. 
H.  There shall be a reasonable relationship between the use of the fee and the type of development for which the fee shall be levied. 
I.  There shall be a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee and the cost of the facilities or portion of the facilities attributable to the development for which the fee shall be levied. 
J.  The cost estimates set forth in the above-mentioned resolution shall be reasonable cost estimates for constructing such facilities and providing transportation services and administering the fee; and the fees expected to be generated by future development shall not exceed the total costs identified in said resolution. 
K.  The studies upon which the fee shall be based shall set forth a reasonable methodology and analysis for the determination of the impact of new development upon traffic in the City and corresponding costs for additional rights-of-way, road construction, road improvements and traffic reduction measures necessitated by such development. 
(Ord. No. 2191, § 1, 4-24-00)  
Sec. 18.245. - SHORT TITLE, AUTHORITY AND APPLICABILITY: 
A.  This Article shall be known and may be cited as the "Transportation Impact Fee Ordinance." 
B.  The fees established pursuant to this Article are development fees authorized under California Government Code section 66000 et seq. 
C.  This Article shall apply to the extent permitted by the statutes and laws of the State of California. 
(Ord. No. 2191, § 1, 4-24-00)  
Sec. 18.246. - INTENT AND PURPOSE: 
A.  It is the intent and purpose of this Article to: 
1.  Adopt a program for the purpose of jointly funding, from public and private sources, transportation system improvements necessitated in whole or in part by new development within Redwood City. 
2.  Provide an equitable method for allocating the cost of reasonable and necessary transportation improvements between the public and the private sector. 
3.  Create a methodology to charge and collect transportation impact fees from new development. 
4.  Create a system for the collection and administration of transportation impact fees. 
B.  This Article supplements existing authority of the City to regulate development. This Article shall not be construed or implemented in a manner inconsistent with the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code Section 21000, et seq.; "CEQA"). The transportation impact fees imposed hereunder shall not exceed the proportionate share of the costs of traffic and transportation system improvements that are reasonably related to the development upon which such fees are imposed. The program established by this Article may serve as one means by which a developer may meet, in part or in whole, traffic mitigation requirements under CEQA; provided that a developer required to pay a fee as mitigation, or construct an improvement as mitigation, under CEQA for transportation system improvements shall not be required to pay the transportation impact fee established under this Article for those same system improvements.

Sec. 18.248. - IMPOSITION AND PAYMENT OF TRANSPORTATION IMPACT FEE: 
A.  Impact fees shall be established as set forth in resolution of the Council and maintained on file in the office of the Administrator. The fee shall be collected from every applicant for a development that increases PM peak hour trips. 
B.  Impact fees shall be collected from the applicant for the development prior to the issuance of a building permit, or any other entitlement for the development in the amount calculated in accordance with the impact fee schedule then in effect or in accordance with an independent trip generation calculation study approved by the Administrator pursuant to Section 18.249. 
C.  The Administrator shall establish the impact fee rate for land use that is not listed in the aforesaid impact fee schedule. The applicant shall submit all information requested by the administrator for the purpose of determining an impact fee rate pursuant to Section 18.249. The cost per DUE shall be the basis for establishing the impact fee rate. 
D.  For a change in use of an existing building, or any part thereof, the impact fee shall be the applicable impact fee for the land use category of the new use, less the impact fee for the land use category of the prior use, subject to the conditions specified in Section 18.249. For any development that includes a change of use involving an alteration, expansion, replacement or new accessory building, the impact fee shall be the impact fee for the new use using the total floor area (including the existing floor area plus the additional floor area) less the impact fee for the land use category of the preexisting use, based upon the corresponding preexisting use floor area, subject to the conditions specified in Section 18.249. 
E.  A development that involves the alteration, expansion or replacement of an existing single dwelling unit shall not be subject to the impact fee unless it results in construction of an additional dwelling unit(s) for rent or sale, including an accessory dwelling unit. For a development that involves alteration, expansion or replacement of an existing single dwelling unit resulting in additional dwelling units, the impact fee shall be the applicable impact fee for the land use category of the total dwelling units after development, less the applicable impact fee for the existing single dwelling unit. 
F.  For a mixed-use development, impact fees shall be based upon the proportionate share of the development that each discrete land use bears to the total development using the impact fee corresponding to each such use in the impact fee schedule or pursuant to a fee calculation based on an independent trip generation calculation study approved by the Administrator pursuant to Section 18.249. 
G.  All revenues collected from imposition of impact fees shall be accounted for separately from all other City funds and shall be used solely for the purposes specified in this Article and for the projects or purposes described in the impact fee project list. 
(Ord. No. 2191, § 1, 4-24-00)  
Sec. 18.249. - CALCULATION OF TRANSPORTATION IMPACT FEE: 
A.  Calculation of Impact Fee: 
1.  Impact fees shall be based upon the land use categories and rates specified in the impact fee schedule. References in said schedule to square feet refers to gross square footage or gross leasable square footage as defined for a particular land use category in the "Trip Generation Manual" published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (latest edition), for the purpose of calculating trip generation. 
2.  When more than one land use is proposed within the same development, the impact fee for each land use shall be calculated separately and the total fee of the various uses shall be imposed. If an applicant contends that the mixed-use development will generate less traffic than the sum of the individual land uses, the applicant may submit an independent trip generation calculation study as set forth in subsection B of this Section. The Administrator shall determine the trip generation taking into consideration the independent trip generation calculation study. 
B.  Independent Trip Generation Calculation: 
1.  If a development is for a land use not expressly described in the impact fee schedule, or an impact fee is not clearly ascertainable by reference to said schedule, the Administrator shall select the impact fee for the most nearly comparable type of land use specified in said schedule. The Administrator shall be guided in the selection of a comparable type by the "Trip Generation Manual," published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (latest edition). If the Administrator determines that there is no comparable land use category in said manual, the applicant may submit an independent trip generation calculation study of PM peak hour trip generation rates using a technically and statistically sound methodology (e.g., traffic counts for similarly situated and comparable land uses) prepared by a traffic engineer approved by the Administrator. An independent trip generation calculation study shall be subject to the approval of by the Administrator. After such approval, the Administrator shall determine the impact fee by: 
a.  Using PM peak hour trip generation rate statistics from the independent trip generation calculation study; and 
b.  Applying the following formula: 
Impact Fee = PM Peak Hour Trips × 
Impact Fee per DUE 
Where "PM Peak Hour Trips" is defined in Section 18.247 and the fee per DUE is that specified in the current impact fee schedule. For an independent trip generation calculation study submission, the applicant shall pay an administrative processing fee per impact fee calculation of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for a development, the area of which is equal to or less than five thousand (5,000) square feet and one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for a development, the area of which exceeds five thousand (5,000) square feet. 
2.  Notwithstanding that an independent trip generation calculation study shall be presumed to provide a correct calculation for impact fees, the Administrator shall not approve such study if the Administrator reasonably deems it to be inaccurate or not reliable, and may, in the alternative, require the applicant to submit additional or different information, analyses, and calculations. 
3.  Determinations made by the Administrator pursuant to this Section may be appealed to the Council pursuant to Section 18.252. 
C.  Calculation of Fee Credit for Existing Uses: 
1.  For a development that involves a change in land use, credit for the existing uses shall be determined by the Administrator based on the level of utilization and actual or estimated PM peak hour trips generated by the existing use. The credit shall not necessarily be equivalent to the amount of the impact fee based on the existing uses but calculated with reference to the then current impact fee schedule. The Administrator may require the applicant to bear the cost of existing PM peak hour traffic counts. If a development includes existing, unoccupied, or unused buildings or structures, the credit may be based upon the estimated PM peak hour trips generated by the prior permitted use and occupancy of the structures at the site of the proposed development. 
2.  For a development that involves a change of use or modification of an existing use, the impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fee for the new use as compared with the prior use, subject to the conditions specified above. However, should the change in use result in a calculation of an impact fee less than that paid for the prior use, no refunds or credits therefor shall be paid or given. 
3.  Notwithstanding any provision of the traffic impact fee ordinance to the contrary, if subsection (C)(1) of this Section, as introduced for amendment on March 27, 2006 shall go into the effect no later than May 3, 2006, then where any proposed development includes existing, unoccupied, or unused buildings or structures and impact fees are paid by a developer/applicant between March 28, 2006 and May 3, 2006, any portion of such payment that would qualify for a credit under the provisions of the amended subsection (C)(1) of this Section shall be reimbursed to the applicant. This Section shall remain in effect only until May 4, 2006, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted on or before May 4, 2006, deletes or extends that date. 
(Ord. No. 2191, § 1, 4-24-00; Ord. No. 2298, § 2, 4-3-06)  
Sec. 18.250. - USE OF FUNDS: 
A.  Revenues from impact fees shall be used exclusively for the construction of capital improvements and for the traffic reduction measures listed in the impact fee project list. 
B.  No such revenues shall be used for periodic or routine maintenance of roadways, intersections, or other transportation-related capital improvements. 
C.  In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for construction of capital improvements for which impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service thereon to the extent that the improvements provided are of the type described in subsection A of this Section and are located within the City. 
D.  Annually, the Administrator shall present to the Council a report on the impact fee account showing the source and amount of revenues and capital improvements and traffic reduction measures that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees. 
E.  Impact fee revenues may be used to provide refunds pursuant to Section 18.251. 
F.  Pursuant to section 66001 of the Government Code, in the fifth fiscal year following the first receipt of impact fees, and every five years thereafter, the Administrator shall make the following findings or determinations with respect to the unexpended portion of such fees, whether committed or uncommitted: 
1.  The purpose to which the fees are to be put; 
2.  The relationship between the fee and the purpose for which they are imposed; 
3.  The sources and amounts of funding corresponding to the capital improvements and traffic reduction measures described in the impact fee project list; and 
4.  The approximate dates on which the funding referenced to in subsection (F)(3) of this Section, is expected to be deposited into the impact fee account. 
(Ord. No. 2191, § 1, 4-24-00)  
Sec. 18.251. - REFUND OF FEES PAID: 
A.  If a building permit or other entitlement for a development expires without commencement of construction, then the fee payer shall be entitled to a refund, without interest, of the impact fee paid as a condition for its issuance, except that the City shall retain two percent (2%) of the fee to offset a portion of the costs of collection and refund. The fee payer shall apply in writing for such a refund within thirty (30) calendar days of the expiration of the permit; provided, that the Administrator may extend such period for good cause, not to exceed six (6) months. 
B.  Any funds not expended or encumbered by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following five years from the date an impact fee was paid, upon written application of the then current landowner of the development for which the impact fee was paid, shall be returned to such landowner with interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest earned by the City on deposits of City funds in the local agency investment fund of the State of California during the twelve (12) month period next preceding the date of written application for refund; provided, that the landowner shall have submitted such application to the Administrator within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days from the expiration of the five (5) year period, unless the Council shall have extended the expenditure period. 
(Ord. No. 2191, § 1, 4-24-00)  
Sec. 18.252. - APPEALS: 
A.  An applicant may either file an appeal and pay the impact fee imposed pursuant to this Article under protest, or appeal the impact fee before the building permit or other entitlement for the development to which the fee pertains has been issued. 
B.  An appeal may be filed from the following determinations of the Administrator: 
1.  The applicability of the impact fees under Section 18.248; 
2.  Disapproval, in whole or in part, of an independent trip generation calculation study pursuant to Section 18.249;

Sec. 18.258. - IMPOSITION AND PAYMENT OF PARKS IMPACT FEE: 
A.  The impact fee is hereby imposed as a condition of the issuance of any permit for any Development, unless expressly exempted by this Chapter. The rate of the impact fee shall be calculated pursuant to Section 18.259 of this Code. 
B.  Except as otherwise required by Government Code Section 66007, the impact fee shall accrue when the first discretionary approval is given for a project after the effective date of this Section, or, if no such discretionary approval is required subsequent to the effective date of this Section, when an application is submitted for a building permit for that project. In either case, the impact fee shall be payable when an application is submitted for a building permit for the project. An impact fee shall be calculated at the rate in effect when the impact fee accrues. 
C.  Payment of the impact fee may be deferred to the date of approval of the final building inspection of the development, provided the owner of the real property for which the fees are required enters into a recordable agreement with the City prior to issuance of the building permit for the development, which shall constitute a lien on the property from the date of recordation and shall be enforceable against successors in interest to the property owner. The agreement shall provide that approval of the final building inspection shall not be granted until the impact fee is paid. The agreement shall also provide that, in any action to collect the impact fee or any portion thereof, the City shall be entitled to all of its costs of enforcement and collection, including reasonable attorney's fees. The City Manager may execute such agreements on behalf of the City in a form acceptable to the City Attorney. Any deferral granted pursuant to subsection B of this Section shall be consistent with the requirements of Government Code Section 66007. 
D.  Except to the extent a credit is granted pursuant to Article 12 of Chapter 30 of this Code, a credit against the impact fee may be given for dedications of park improvements constructed or provided at private expense and for the value of land dedicated to the City that is necessary or useful to a park improvement. Such credit will be granted only if, prior to dedication, the City Council determines: (i) that the dedicated land or improvement is included on the Impact Fee Project List, and (ii) that the grant of the credit, in lieu of the fee, will not cause the City to delay the implementation of elements of the program that are of higher priority, in the judgment of the City Council, than the land or eligible facility to be dedicated. At the time the City Council makes these determinations, it must also make a determination of the maximum credit that will be allowed for the dedication, which maximum credit shall not exceed the City Council's reasonable estimate of the fair market value of the park improvement and/or land. The credit shall be applied when the City accepts the land or park improvement. If the City Council has made the determinations required by this subsection, payment of a portion of the impact fee equal to the amount of an expected credit against the impact fee may be deferred to the date of approval of the final building inspection of the development, provided the owner of the real property for which the fee is required enters into a recordable agreement with the City prior to issuance of the building permit for the development, which shall constitute a lien on the property from the date of recordation and shall be enforceable against successors in interest to the property owner. The agreement shall provide that approval of the final building inspection shall not be granted until the impact fee is paid or the credit issued. The agreement shall also provide that, in any action to collect the impact fee or any portion thereof, the City shall be entitled to all of its costs of enforcement and collection, including reasonable attorney's fees. The City Manager may execute the agreement on behalf of the City in a form acceptable to the City Attorney. Any deferral granted pursuant to subsection C of this Section shall be consistent with the requirements of Government Code Section 66007. The amount of any credit granted pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed the lesser of: (i) the actual documented construction costs for the dedicated improvement plus the value of any dedicated land as supported by a professional appraisal produced by an independent consultant selected by the City and paid for by the applicant, or (ii) the maximum credit approved by the City Council pursuant to this subsection. 
(Ord. No. 2318, § 3, 10-22-07)  
Sec. 18.259. - CALCULATION OF PARKS IMPACT FEE: 
A.  The impact fee imposed upon a development shall be calculated by subtracting any pre-existing impact credits for that development (calculated pursuant to subsection C of this Section) and any affordable housing credit (calculated pursuant to subsection D of this Section) from the sum of the base amounts (calculated pursuant to subsection B of this Section) for all uses constituting that development. If the pre-existing impact credits for a development exceed the base amounts for that development, then the fee shall be zero. 
B.  A base amount shall be calculated for each residential use included in a development. With respect to any residential use, the base amount shall be calculated by multiplying the planned number of dwelling units (after the completion of the project) on the parcels comprising the development by the then-applicable rate for that use as set forth in the Impact Fee Schedule. 
C.  The existing impact credit for a development shall be the sum of the base amounts that would be imposed on a project comprised of the structures that existed on the parcels comprising the development prior to the construction proposed in connection with the development. 
D.  The affordable housing credit for a development shall be the equal to: (i) the base amounts that would be imposed upon a project comprised of only the low income housing units that are a part of the development; plus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of the base amounts that would be imposed upon a project comprised of only the moderate income housing units that are a part of the development; minus (iii) the existing impact credit for the development as calculated pursuant to subsection C of this Section. If this calculation yields an amount less than zero, then the affordable housing credit for the development shall be zero. 
E.  The rate of the fee shall be established from time to time by resolution or ordinance of the City Council in the manner required by Government Code Sections 66004 and 66018 and other applicable law. 
F.  Beginning July 1, 2008, and on each July 1st thereafter, the rate of the fee shall increase without further action by the City according to the following formula: 
	Most Recent ENR 
Council-Approved Rate * 	_____
	ENR at Council-Approval 
 
Where the "Council-Approved Rate" is the rate most recently adopted Impact Fee Schedule, "Most Recent ENR" is the most recently published Construction Cost Index for the San Francisco Bay Area in the Engineering News Record when the calculation is made and "ENR at Council-Approval" is the Construction Cost Index published for the month in which the Council adopted the Impact Fee Schedule including the "Council-Approved Rate." The Administrator shall calculate the increased fee annually and give notice of that calculation in the manner required by law for the publication of ordinance of the City Council.

Revenues from impact fees shall be used exclusively for the installation, acquisition, construction and improvement of park improvements listed in the Impact Fee Project List, including the acquisition of land necessary for such improvements. 
B.  No such revenues shall be used for periodic or routine maintenance of facilities. 
C.  In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for construction of land or improvements for which impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service. 
D.  At least annually, and as required by Government Code Section 66006, the Administrator shall review the estimated cost of the public improvements to be funded by the fee, the continued need for those improvements and the reasonable relationship between such need and the impacts of pending or anticipated new development. The Administrator shall report his or her findings to the City Council at a noticed public hearing and recommend any adjustment to the impact fee or such other action as he or she may deem appropriate. 
E.  Impact fee revenues may be used to provide refunds pursuant to this Article. 
F.  Pursuant to section 66001 of the Government Code, in the fifth fiscal year following the first receipt of impact fees, and every five (5) years thereafter, the Administrator shall make the following findings or determinations with respect to the unexpended portion of such fees, whether committed or uncommitted: 
1.  The purpose to which the fees are to be put; 
2.  The relationship between the fee and the purpose for which they are imposed; 
3.  The sources and amounts of funding corresponding to the capital improvements described in the impact fee project list; and 
4.  The approximate dates on which the funding referenced to in subsection (F)(3) of this Section, is expected to be deposited into the impact fee account. 
(Ord. No. 2318, § 3, 10-22-07)  
Sec. 18.261. - REFUND OF FEES PAID: 
A.  If a building permit or other entitlement for a development expires without commencement of construction, then the applicant shall be entitled to a refund, without interest, of the impact fee paid as a condition for its issuance, except that the City shall retain two percent (2%) of the fee to offset a portion of the costs of collection and refund. The applicant shall apply in writing for such a refund within thirty (30) calendar days of the expiration of the permit; provided, that the Administrator may extend such period for good cause, not to exceed six (6) months. 
B.  The City Council may additionally authorize refunds as required or permitted by Government Code Section 66001(e).

B.  An appeal may be filed from the following determinations of the Administrator: 
1.  The applicability or amount of the impact fees calculated pursuant to Section 18.259; 
2.  Calculation of a credit, disapproval of a credit, or disapproval of an exemption pursuant to Sections 18.258 and 18.263; 
3.  Any other determination, which the Administrator is authorized to make under this Article.

An appeal shall be in writing and shall be accompanied with the appeal fee established by the Council prior to the issuance of a building permit or other entitlement for the development to which the appeal pertains. The written appeal shall set forth the grounds for the appeal and contain technical information and specific supporting data to the extent applicable to the determination to be made in the appeal.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL 
 
Sec. 18A.1. - PURPOSE AND INTENT:

Accordingly, it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by providing for the orderly regulation of businesses providing massage therapy services, discouraging prostitution and related illegal activities carried on under the guise of massage therapy, and establishing certain sanitation, health, and operational standards for massage businesses. 
B.  Furthermore, it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to address the negative impacts identified in the City Council's findings to reduce or prevent neighborhood blight and to protect and preserve the quality of City neighborhoods and commercial districts; and to enhance enforcement of criminal statutes relating to the conduct of operators and employees of massage businesses. 
C.  It is the Council's further purpose and intent to rely upon the uniform statewide regulations applicable to massage practitioners and establishments that were enacted by the State Legislature in 2008 as Business and Professions Code sections 4600 et seq. by Senate Bill 731, and amended in 2011 by Assembly Bill 619 and in 2014 by Assembly Bill 1147, to restrict the commercial practice of massage in the City to those persons duly certified to practice by the California Massage Therapy Council, and to provide for the registration and regulation of massage businesses for health and safety purposes to the extent allowed by law.

Sec. 20.65. - APPLICATION FOR PERMIT: 
Any person desiring to haul earth materials exceeding three (3) tons, within the City, except on a truck route as so designated in Section 20.52 of this Code, shall file an application in triplicate for a permit to do so with the Director of Public Works, the original of which shall be verified. The application shall set forth the following information: 
A.  A full identification, and the residence and business address of the applicant, including all members of any firm or partnership, and the president and secretary of any corporation applying; if the applicant is the agent or employee of any person for whose benefit the permit is requested, this fact, with the full identification of such person and his business and residence address. 
B.  The facts constituting the necessity for the hauling. 
C.  The amount of material expected to be hauled, in tons. 
D.  The dates on which the hauling is intended to be commenced and completed, and the times of day during which hauling is intended to be done. 
E.  The particular streets over which a permit to operate is requested. 
F.  The time interval between vehicles and the number of vehicles per hour, which will travel over the route for which the permit is applied. 
G.  The location of the place or places of delivery of the materials, provided, however, that if delivery is to be made in small quantities to numerous places, a general description satisfactory to the Director of Public Works of the locations of the contemplated deliveries will be sufficient. 
H.  A specific description of the vehicle or vehicles and load to be operated or moved. 
I.  Whether such permit is requested for a single trip or for continuous operation.

It is found upon investigation that payment of said sum is necessary to protect said street(s) from the actual damages and injury which will occur as a result of such hauling, and that said sum will provide full indemnity for the damages and injury resulting from such hauling; and by reason of the difficulty in computing such damages, the hereinafter specified amount is found in advance to be reasonable compensation for the use of said street(s) as a condition of such hauling. The Director of Community Development is authorized to accept said sum in full satisfaction for all damages and injury to said street(s) to be caused by such hauling. 
B.  The fee for the privilege granted by said permit shall be in an amount set by resolution of the City Council. 
C.  If the amount of earth proposed to be hauled cannot be measured in cubic yards, measurement may be made by weight using the conversion factor hereinafter set forth. For the purposes of the division, one cubic foot of earth material shall be equivalent to one hundred twenty-five (125) pounds; provided, however, that if an applicant submits to the Director of Community Development evidence that such factor of equivalency is not accurate with respect to a certain proposed load, the Director may, in his or her discretion, utilize a different equivalent for the purposes of computing the fee. 
D.  No application for a permit to haul earth shall be subdivided to avoid payment of a fee or any other requirements of this Division.

B.  If the permit is for hauling of more than a month's duration, payment of the permit fee may be made monthly, in advance, in amounts based upon the estimated amount of earth to be hauled in the following month. 
C.  If, upon completion of any month's hauling under said permit, the total fee payable is determined to be greater than the amount actually paid, the amount still owing shall be added to the charge for the next estimated monthly installment. Upon completion of all hauling under said permit the permittee shall pay to the City, at the office of the Director of Public Works, any amount still owing, within thirty (30) days from the date of completion. 
D.  If, at the end of any month's hauling under said permit, the total fee payable is determined to be less than the amount actually paid, the amount of overpayment shall be subtracted from the charge for the next estimated monthly installment. Upon completion of all hauling under said permit, the City shall refund the amount of any overpayment of the permittee within thirty (30) days from receipt by the Director of Public Works of a documented request therefor. 
E.  Any amount deposited pursuant to this Section shall be returned, (less the sum of $30.00 to cover the cost of processing the application) to an applicant if, prior to the commencement of any hauling operation pursuant to such application, applicant shall have notified the Director of Public Works of intention not to engage in such hauling operation and requested return of said deposit.

c.  If the average occupancy within Downtown Meter Zone A between the hours of eleven o'clock (11:00) A.M. and one o'clock (1:00) P.M. on two (2) representative days are between seventy percent (70%) and eighty-five percent (85%), the then existing hourly meter rate shall remain the same. 
d.  If the average occupancy within Downtown Meter Zone A between the hours of eleven o'clock (11:00) A.M. and one o'clock (1:00) P.M. on two (2) representative days are below seventy percent (70%), the then existing hourly meter rate shall be reduced by twenty-five cents ($0.25), provided, however, the hourly parking rate shall in no event go below the approved minimum rate. 
2.  In the Downtown Meter Zone B: 
a.  The hourly parking rate in Downtown Meter Zone B shall at all times be between fifty cents ($0.50) per hour and three ($3.00) dollars per hour. 
b.  If the average occupancy within Downtown Meter Zone B between the hours of eleven o'clock (11:00) A.M. and one o'clock (1:00) P.M. on two (2) representative days are over eighty-five percent (85%), the then existing hourly meter rate shall be increased by fifty cents ($0.50), provided, however, the hourly parking rate shall in no event exceed the approved maximum rate. 
c.  If the average occupancy within Downtown Meter Zone B between the hours of eleven o'clock (11:00) A.M. and one o'clock (1:00) P.M. on two (2) representative days (Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday) are between seventy percent (70%) and eighty-five percent (85%), the then existing hourly meter rate shall remain the same. 
d.  If the average occupancy within Downtown Meter Zone B the hours of eleven o'clock (11:00) A.M. and one o'clock (1:00) P.M. on two (2) representative days are below seventy percent (70%), the then existing hourly meter rate shall be reduced by fifty cents ($0.50), provided, however, the hourly parking rate shall in no event go below the approved minimum rate. 
C.  The new rates shall become effective upon the programming of the parking meter for that rate. The current schedule of meter rates shall be available at the City Clerk's office.

(Ord. No. 2174, § 1, 7-26-1999)  
Sec. 21.19. - TEMPORARY MORATORIUM ON ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF MARIJUANA COLLECTIVES: 
A.  Purpose and Findings. 
1.  The recitals set out in Ordinance No. 2352 are incorporated herein and are each relied upon independently by the City Council for its adoption of this interim ordinance. 
2.  The Redwood City General Plan does not presently contain a goal or policy of textual discussion of the issue of a proposed use of medical marijuana collectives. 
3.  The Redwood City Zoning Code and Municipal Code do not address or regulate the existence or location of medical marijuana collectives, operator licensing, or cultivation of marijuana plants. 
4.  The City has received inquires concerning whether collectives are allowed in Redwood City. Collectives are not listed as permitted or conditional uses and therefore are currently prohibited by omission, but a clear policy statement whether and to what extent collectives are either allowed or not allowed is preferred. 
5.  In cities that have permitted medical marijuana collectives, issues and concerns have arisen related to the establishment of medical marijuana collectives in close proximity to residential properties, schools, and day care facilities. Furthermore, those cities have reported increases in loitering, illegal drug activity, burglaries, robberies, and other criminal activity within and around the collectives, as well as increased pedestrian and vehicular traffic, noise and parking violations. Medical marijuana collectives and/or dispensaries have also resulted in increased demands for police response, as well as maintenance of public streets and sidewalks. 
6.  The use, possession, cultivation, or distribution of marijuana for any purpose remains illegal under federal law. 
7.  There are several open questions of state law regarding the regulation of medical marijuana collectives, including how to interpret the State Attorney General's August 2008 "Guidelines for the Security and Non-Diversion of Marijuana Grown for medical Use." 
8.  To protect residents and businesses from potential harmful community impacts resulting from medical marijuana collectives, City staff needs time to study the legality, potential adverse community impacts, and mechanisms for regulating medical marijuana collectives. 
9.  If medical marijuana collectives are allowed to proceed without appropriate review of location, operation criteria and standards, the collectives could conflict with requirements of the General Plan, the City's Zoning Ordinance, and forthcoming state law and City regulations and result in irreversible incompatibility of land uses and adverse impacts on residents, businesses, and neighborhoods that present a clear and immediate danger to the public health, safety, and welfare. 
10.  This interim ordinance establishing a moratorium on medical marijuana collectives is necessary to avoid the previously identified impacts to the public health, safety, and welfare. 
B.  Interim Moratorium Imposed. 
1.  For a period of twenty-two (22) months and fifteen (15) days, commencing on the date of adoption [January 25, 2010] of this interim ordinance, or until such time as this ordinance may expire, subject to any extension of this ordinance that the City Council may adopt and approve pursuant to Section 65858 of the Government Code, no zoning ordinance interpretation or amendment, amendment to the City's General Plan or Municipal Code, use permit, variance, building permit or any other entitlement for use shall be approved or issued for the establishment or operation of, and no person shall otherwise establish, a medical marijuana collective, as that term is defined below. 
2.  For the purpose of this ordinance, "medical marijuana collective" includes any site, facility, location, use, cooperative, dispensary, center, or business which distributes, sells, exchanges, processes, delivers, gives away, or cultivates marijuana for medical purposes to qualified patients, health care providers, patients' primary caregivers, or physicians pursuant to Proposition 215, Health and Safety Code section 11362.5 et seq. as amended, or any state regulations adopted in furtherance thereof. Marijuana shall also mean cannabis and all parts of that plant. 
C.  Compliance with California Environmental Quality Act. The City Council finds that this ordinance falls under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) exemption found at Title 14 California Code of Regulations section 15061(b)(3) because the temporary prohibition of medical marijuana collectives does not have the potential to significantly impact the environment. 
D.  Effective Date. This ordinance is an interim ordinance and shall take effect and be enforced immediately upon adoption. In accordance with California Government Code section 65858, this ordinance shall be in full force and effect for a period of twenty-two (22) months and fifteen (15) days from and after the date of its adoption on January 25, 2010 and shall be of no further force and effect unless this period is extended by the City Council in accordance with California Government Code section 65858.

where: 
Vi = 	volume of waste or wastewater to be discharged from the commercial, industrial, or institutional structure to be connected to the sewerage facilities, in gallons per day; 
Vr = 	average volume of waste or wastewater per residential structure, in gallons per day (determined to be 270 gallons per day for single-family structures, 220 gallons per unit for duplex structures, and 180 gallons per unit for multi-family structures); 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the wastewater treatment capacity fee for service to any commercial, industrial, or institutional structure shall be not less than two thousand one hundred thirty-five dollars and seventy cents ($2,135.70). 
3.  Exclusions: 
a.  The foregoing fee shall not be applicable to connections to the sewerage facilities or to a sewer lateral with respect to which sewerage treatment capacity included within City's allocation of eleven million four hundred thousand (11,400,000) gallons per day flow in Authority's treatment facilities has been purchased pursuant to agreement entered into between the City and the owner of the property to be served by such capacity or with respect to which sewerage treatment capacity has been otherwise purchased or provided by, or on behalf of, such owner, as determined by City's Director. 
b.  The foregoing fee shall not be applicable to connections made to public sewers maintained by the West Bay Sanitary District or the Fair Oaks Sewer Maintenance District within the City. 
c.  The foregoing fee shall not be applicable to connections made to the sewerage facilities for the purpose of drawing down the ground water table to excavate for the foundation of a structure or for removal of contaminated soils for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days. 
d.  The foregoing fee shall not be applicable to connections made to the sewerage facilities for the purpose of ground water cleanup. The fee for a permit to connect to the sewerage facilities for the purpose of ground water cleanup shall be the facilities fee calculated under the formula set forth in subsection (B)(2)(c) of this Section. 
4.  Additional Dwelling Units: In the event additional dwelling units are to be constructed which would increase the number of dwelling units being served by a single sewer connection, a wastewater treatment capacity fee shall be paid for such additional dwelling units in accordance with subsection (A)(1) of this Section. The fee payable shall be the amount by which the wastewater treatment capacity fee calculated upon the number of dwelling units after such construction exceeds the wastewater treatment capacity fee calculated upon the number of dwelling units prior to such construction. 
5.  Additional Industrial Volume: In the event the volume of waste or wastewater to be discharged into the sewerage facilities from a commercial, industrial, institutional, or other nonresidential structure is increased by installation of additional plumbing fixtures or enlargement, expansion, or reconstruction of said structure, and such structure is to be served by an existing sewer connection, a wastewater treatment capacity fee shall be paid for such additional volume in accordance with subsection (A)(2) of this Section. The fee payable shall be the amount by which the wastewater treatment capacity fee calculated upon the total volume after the increase exceeds the wastewater treatment capacity fee calculated upon the volume prior to such increase. 
B.  Facilities Fee: 
1.  Established: A facilities fee is hereby established to provide for the use and construction of existing and future sanitary sewerage system capital facilities in accordance with a capital improvements program duly approved by the City Council. Said fee shall be collected concurrently with the wastewater treatment capacity fee specified in subsection A of this Section, and shall be in addition to all other fees and charges specified in this Chapter or otherwise provided for the use of the City's sewerage facilities. 
The amount of the facilities fee (the "facilities fee"), per equivalent dwelling unit (hereinafter defined) is nine hundred sixty dollars ($960.00). 
2.  Equivalent Dwelling Unit: The facilities fee hereinabove established shall be calculated on the basis of "Equivalent Dwelling Units" (EDU). One EDU shall equal two thousand (2,000) square feet. 
a.  Multi-Family Residential Structures: The amount payable for multi-family residential structures shall be determined by multiplying the above specified amount times the number of dwelling units contained therein. 
b.  Commercial And Industrial Structures: The amount payable for commercial and industrial structures shall be determined by multiplying the above-specified amount times the square footage of the structure for which calculation is being made divided by two thousand (2,000). 
c.  Ground Water Contamination Cleanup: The amount payable for any premises from which discharge ground water is discharged by extraction wells into the sewerage facilities shall be based upon the anticipated daily discharge. The amount payable shall be calculated by multiplying the authorized daily discharge, expressed in gallons per day (gpd) times the above-specified amount divided by 270 (the allocation of gpd per EDU). 
The foregoing formula is: 
Authorized gpd × $960 = 	Facilities 
270 gpd 	Fee (in dollars) 
 
The Director reserves the right to adjust the facilities fee at any time and from time to time based upon the increase in the volume discharged from the premises to the sewerage facilities. 
d.  Other: Notwithstanding the formula specified in this subsection B2, the amount payable for any industrial premises which are used for the storage or discharge of materials which will be discharged into the sewerage facilities shall be based upon the anticipated discharge from the premises. The amount payable shall be calculated by multiplying the authorized daily discharge, expressed in gallons per day (gpd) times the above specified fee divided by 270 (the allocation of gpd per EDU). 
The foregoing formula is: 
Authorized gpd × $960 = 	Facilities 
270 gpd 	Fee (in dollars) 
 
The Director reserves the right to adjust the facilities fee at any time and from time to time based upon the increase in volume discharged from the premises to the sewerage facilities. 
The facility fees specified under subsections B2a through B2d of this Section are not mutually exclusive. 
3.  Exceptions: Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections B1 and B2 of this Section, exceptions to the amount of the facilities fee and the basis for establishing said facilities fee may be granted by the Council set forth in an agreement or upon application of a user, upon the finding by the Council that the aforesaid facilities fee or the basis therefor is not equitable with respect to a particular premises or user. 
4.  Exclusion: The facilities fee hereby established shall not apply to the premises located within General Improvement District No. 1-64, a general improvement district duly organized and existing under the General Improvement District Ordinance (being Ordinance No. 1128, adopted March 9, 1964, as amended), and all territory annexed to said District. 
C.  Other Fees; Effect Of Nonpayment: The fees provided in this Section are in addition to all other fees pertaining to connection to and/or use of the sewerage facilities. No plumbing permit and no building permit involving the installation of plumbing facilities shall be issued by the Building Official until the applicable fees provided in subsections A and B of this Section, have been paid or provision therefor has otherwise been made. No discharge permit issued pursuant to subsection 27.10B, Section 27.11 or Article IV of this Chapter by Authority's Manager, the issuance of which pertains to the connection of a user's premises to the sewerage facilities, shall be effective unless and until the fees provided in subsections A and B of this Section, have been paid or provision therefor has otherwise been made.

Accordingly, the purpose of this Section is to provide for an administrative procedure for a waiver or modification of a particular provision of this Chapter in the event the strict application of this Chapter would result in the denial of all economically viable use of real property. 
A.  Filing of Waiver Application: An applicant for a waiver of a provision of this Chapter shall file a waiver application with the Director or his/her designee identifying the provision sought to be waived or modified. The applicant shall file a complete form and shall provide all documentation and information required by the Director or his/her designee to determine whether application of the provision in question will prohibit any economically viable use of the land in question or otherwise have an impermissible confiscatory result. 
B.  Director's Approval: The Director or his/her designee may approve, deny or conditionally approve a waiver application upon making all of the following written findings: 
1.  That the City's application of the provision for which a waiver or modification is sought would result in the denial of all economically viable use of the real property in question; 
2.  To the maximum extent feasible, conditions have been placed upon such a waiver or modification in order to achieve the goals of this Chapter as closely as possible while still allowing economically viable use of the real property in question; 
3.  Approval of such a waiver will not result in public nuisance which would constitute a significant and direct threat to public health or safety. 
(Ord. No. 2090, § 1, 6-12-95)  
Sec. 27A.18. - CHARGES:

(Ord. No. 2390, § 3, 1-28-13)  
Sec. 29.11. - TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ALL ENCROACHMENT PERMITS: 
A.  Indemnification. No encroachment permit shall be issued until the permittee has executed and filed with the City an indemnity agreement satisfactory to the City Attorney. The permittee shall be responsible for and indemnify the City from all claims, demands, expenses or liability, including but not limited to, personal injury and property damage arising out of or related to work performed by the permittee under the permit, arising out of the failure on the permittee's part to perform work under the permit, or arising from or caused by the structures or encroachments placed in, on or under the City's right-of-way. If any claim of such liability is made against the City, its City Council, officers, officials or employees, permittee shall defend, indemnify and hold the City, its City Council, officers, officials and employees, harmless from such claim. 
B.  Insurance. No encroachment permit shall be issued until and unless the applicant has filed and maintained on file with the City evidence of self-insurance satisfactory to the City or a certificate of insurance demonstrating sufficient public liability and property damage insurance coverage issued by an insurance carrier authorized to do business in the state, insuring the applicant and the City and its agents, against loss by reason of injuries to, or death of persons, or damages to property arising out of or related to work performed by the applicant, its agents or employees while performing any work under the permit, arising out of the failure on the permittee's part to perform work under the permit, and arising from or caused by the structures or encroachments placed in, on or under the City's right-of-way. Such insurance shall be primary and provide coverage for all liability assumed by the applicant under subsection A of this Section and shall be provided by the permittee in minimum amounts as required by the City's Risk Manager. 
C.  Performance Bonds or Other Financial Security. The Department may require, as a condition of issuing any encroachment permit, applicant to post performance bonds or other approved financial security to ensure satisfactory completion of any work to be performed in, on or under any right-of-way or City property and to insure adequate maintenance of encroachments. 
D.  Commencement of Work. The permittee shall begin the work or use authorized by a permit issued pursuant to this Chapter within one hundred eighty (180) days from date of issuance, unless a different period is stated in the permit. If the work or use is not so begun, then the permit shall become void. The permittee shall complete the work or use authorized by the permit within the time specified in the permit. Where an encroachment involves a permanent installation or obstruction, conditions so specified in the permit, license or other agreement with the City shall remain in effect until the construction or obstruction is removed. 
E.  Term. All permits shall specify the time, not longer than one year, within which work or construction in the right-of-way or on City property must be completed. Permits for continued use of the right-of-way or City property, shall be issued for a specified period of time. All permits may be renewed or extended at the City's discretion and only upon such terms as are consistent with the provisions of this Chapter. 
F.  Relocation. Any encroachment, including but not limited to pipes, conduit, wire, cable, appurtenances or other structures or facilities, installed or maintained in, on or under any right-of-way or City property, shall be relocated, at the sole expense of the permittee, as may be necessary for public necessity or convenience. Such relocations shall be under the same terms and conditions as the initial installation allowed, pursuant to permit. The Department will not exercise the right to require such relocation in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner. 
G.  Assignment. Encroachment permits shall be applied for by and issued to the person or company who will make use of the permit and not exclusively to the contractor, who has been employed to construct the improvements. However, all contractors and subcontractors who will be performing work in the right-of-way or City property shall be named and identified in the encroachment permit application. Permits may be applied for and issued to owners and contractors jointly so that the Contractor's insurance and bonds will protect the City thus not requiring the owner to obtain separate insurance and bonds. In which case, the contractor's insurance and bonds shall name the owner as an additional protected party. The rights granted by the permit shall not be assignable without the express prior written consent of the Department. 
H.  Improvement Agreement. In any case where the City Engineer estimates that the cost of the work will exceed two thousand dollars ($2,000.00), or that a dangerous or hazardous condition will be created by the doing of the work, whether to persons or to property, the Department may require that the applicant enter into an improvement agreement with the City on such terms and conditions as may be approved by the City Council. 
I.  Supplemental. The Department may require additional conditions for the issuance of a permit as are applicable and necessary to meet specific situations, for public safety and to insure compliance with this Chapter and all other City, state or federal regulations. 
J.  Acceptance. Acceptance of any permit granted under the provisions this Chapter shall not become effective until written acceptance thereof shall have been filed by the permittee with the Department. By accepting this permit, the permittee covenants and agrees to perform and be bound by each and all of the terms and conditions imposed by the City of Redwood City, and the permit. 
(Ord. No. 2390, § 3, 1-28-13)  
Sec. 29.12. - TERMS OF CONSTRUCTION: 
A.  All work done, uses made and installations of facilities, under such permits, shall be to the satisfaction of the City and shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the encroachment permit, all adopted regulations, standards and specifications of the City including the regulations and specifications for pavement restoration, all applicable state and federal regulations and the latest edition of applicable industry construction manuals, such as AT&T Manual of Construction (Blue Book) as an example. All work done and use made pursuant to such permits shall be performed in a manner consistent with high industry standards. The Department may require a permittee to retain an approved utility line identification or locator service such as Underground Service Alert or California Digalert. 
B.  In the event of a conflict among construction codes and standards, the most stringent code or standard shall apply (except insofar as that standard, if followed, would result in a system that could not meet requirements of federal, state or local law). Where there is a conflict in construction standards, the City Engineer shall be responsible for making the final determination as to which standard to apply. 
C.  Permittee shall at all times employ reasonable care, within the meaning of applicable law, and shall install and maintain in use, commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the public. Without limiting the foregoing, all permittee's facilities located on public property shall be constructed, operated and maintained in accordance with good engineering practices and performed by experienced and properly trained maintenance and construction personnel. 
D.  All permits issued after the effective date of this ordinance shall require private utilities, telephone, electrical, cable and communications facilities to be installed underground, except for equipment appurtenant to underground facilities, as approved by the City and found to be required to be located above ground, such as surface mounted transformers, pedestal mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets, and concealed ducts. However, in those areas where poles now exist and electric and telephone lines are now overhead, permittee may install facilities overhead if using the same poles. Whenever and wherever the owner of the poles moves its plant from overhead to underground placement in an area, all permittee's facilities must be relocated and moved underground as directed by the City Engineer, at permittee's expense, and in accordance with then-existing City practices, policies and regulations. This exception shall not apply within an underground district where all facilities must be installed underground. 
E.  Permittee shall locate, construct, operate and maintain its facilities in such a manner that they: (1) will not endanger or interfere in any manner with the public rights-of-way; (2) will not interfere with legal rights of any property owner; (3) will not unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic; (4) will not interfere with City facilities; (5) will not interfere with any gas, electric, telephone, telecommunications, water, sewer, or other utility facilities already located in the right-of-way; and (6) will not obstruct or hinder in any manner other entities' previously approved use of any public rights-of-way. 
F.  Permittee shall, to the satisfaction of the City, repair all water and sanitary service lines, streets, sidewalks, curbs, gutters or other public or private property, structures, improvements or facilities disturbed or damaged by construction or operation pursuant to the permit. All such repairs shall be done in accordance with City standard specifications, details and requirements of the Department. 
G.  Construction Signs Required for Work. Whenever any work is being done in the City streets, for which approval by the City of a traffic control plan is required, the person or persons performing such work shall maintain at the site of such work at all times during which any such work is being done, signage meeting the requirements set forth in the City's Engineering Standards. 
H.  A condition of any street cut permit shall be that the permittee reconstruct, renovate and/or repair the damaged street to its prior condition, as if the pavement had not been cut, even if that means complete reconstruction of the entire length of the street recently reconstructed by the City for new or newly surfaced streets, as specifically directed by the City Engineer/designee and all in accordance with City Engineering standards. However, the applicant may elect to pay the Pavement Damage Restoration Fee established by City Council Resolution, in an amount, when pooled with such fees paid by others, sufficient to allow the City to perform final repairs of pavement in streets damaged by street cuts. In the event the applicant chooses to pay the Pavement Damage Restoration Fee, then the permittee need only repair the street as directed by the City Engineer/designee sufficient to perform and endure until the next City resurfacing or reconstruction. All restoration and repair of streets damaged by pavement cuts shall be done in accordance with the City's Engineering Standards and as more specifically directed by the City Engineer/designee. 
(Ord. No. 2390, § 3, 1-28-13)  
Sec. 29.13. - NO PAVEMENT CUTS IN NEW STREETS: 
A.  Permission to excavate in new streets shall not be granted, and no street cut permit shall be issued, for five (5) years after completion of street construction, reconstruction, renovation, or major rehabilitation, including a pavement overlay. Utilities shall determine alternate methods of making necessary repairs to avoid excavating in new streets. Exceptions to the above are as follows: 
1.  Emergency which endangers life or property. 
2.  Interruption of essential utility service. 
3.  Work that is mandated by City, county, state or federal legislation. 
4.  Service for buildings where no other feasible means of providing service exists. 
B.  In the event an exception is granted by the Department pursuant to subsection A above, a condition of such street cut permit for cutting the pavement of a street within such five (5) years after construction, reconstruction or renovation, shall be that the permittee reconstruct such street completely rebuilding, by removing all the pavement and aggregate base course material, re-compacting the sub-base and restoring the base material and then completely re-paving the street, for a minimum of the full width of all lanes impacted by the cut(s) (outside lane includes to the curb) and extending the entire length of the recent reconstruction by the City or for a length determined by the City Engineer to be sufficient to restore the street to its new condition, as if it had never been cut, or as more specifically directed by the City Engineer/designee. For recently renovated streets the City Engineer may allow the permittee to restore the street to its former condition by resurfacing the street to the same extent as was performed by the City, except that the asphalt or surface material installed by the City must first be removed by the permittee to a depth as directed by the City Engineer. Alternatively, a permittee may choose to pay the Pavement Damage Restoration Fee established by City Council Resolution, in which event, the City Engineer shall authorize a repair less than full and complete reconstruction of the entire newly reconstructed street. All permits which are issued pursuant to this Chapter shall be in accordance with the City of Redwood City Engineering Standards and as specifically directed by the City Engineer/designee. 
C.  If a pothole is cut smaller than one square foot, the City Engineer may authorize repairs less than full reconstruction and no Pavement Damage Restoration Fee will be required to be paid by permittee. This exception does not apply when there is more than one pothole or in other situations where full restoration is deemed necessary by the City Engineer.

Permittee shall release the City from all liability or claims resulting from such potholing. 
C.

The first such annual map must be filed by January one year from the effective date of this ordinance. Failure to comply with this section constitutes grounds to deny additional encroachment permits and/or to revoke encroachment permits for facilities not shown on such maps after written request by the City. 
(Ord. No. 2390, § 3, 1-28-13)  
Sec. 29.26. - FEES: 
Persons and entities applying for a permit pursuant to this Chapter shall pay (1) the non-refundable encroachment permit application processing fee which covers the cost of processing the application; (2) the plan check fee which covers the cost of reviewing the plans and submittals to insure compliance with all City regulations; (3) the inspection fee which covers the cost of inspection of the construction, work or installation to insure it meets all City requirements; (4) a fee (or security in the form of completion and payment bonds) to recover all of the reasonable costs associated with removal of permittee's facilities, repair of right-of-way or other City property, maintenance of permittee's facilities in the right-of-way or City property, including but not limited to all reasonable costs associated with damage caused to the right-of-way or City property if City is required to perform such tasks by reason of permittee's failure to do so. In addition to the permit fees, the permittee shall also pay such use fees as set forth in the encroachment permit or in any use agreement with the City required as a condition of the encroachment permit. For encroachment permits authorizing cuts of the pavement in City streets, the applicant may also choose to pay the pavement damage restoration fee to reimburse the City for the increased repaving and reconstruction costs incurred by the City that are reasonably attributable to the impact of excavation in City streets, which fees shall not generate proceeds in excess of the City's costs of street repaving and reconstruction reasonably attributable to the excavation for which the fee is charged. 
Each of the above fees will be established by Council resolution, provided, however that the inspection fee and/or the plan check fee may be established based on actual cost to perform the services, in which case, for complex applications the applicant will be required to deposit an amount for the plan check fee and the inspection fee and may have unused amounts returned or may be required to pay additional amounts as necessary to recover all reasonably related costs including the costs of outside consultants, incurred by the City to perform plan check and inspections services for the application and permit.

(Ord. No. 2455, § 2(Exh. A), 1-28-19)  
Sec. 29.108. - TERMS AND CONDITIONS: 
A.  Generally. In addition to any supplemental conditions imposed by the City Engineer or the City Manager or his or her designee, as the case may be, all permits granted pursuant to this Article shall be subject to the terms and conditions established in Chapter 29, Article II, as well as the following terms and conditions, unless modified by the approving authority. 
1.  Code Compliance. The permittee shall at all times maintain compliance with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, regulations and other rules, including, without limitation, those applying to use of public rights-of-way. 
2.  Permit Duration. A wireless encroachment permit shall be valid for a period of ten (10) years, unless pursuant to another provision of the Code or these conditions, it expires sooner or is terminated. At the end of ten (10) years from the date of issuance, such permit shall automatically expire, unless an extension or renewal has been granted. A person holding a wireless encroachment permit must either (1) remove the facility within thirty (30) days following the permit's expiration (provided that removal of support structure owned by City, a utility, or another entity authorized to maintain a support structure in the right of way need not be removed, but must be restored to its prior condition, except as specifically permitted by the City); or (2) at least ninety (90) days prior to expiration, submit an application to renew the permit, which application must, among all other requirements, demonstrate that the impact of the wireless facility cannot be reduced. The wireless facility must remain in place until it is acted upon by the City and all appeals from the City's decision exhausted. 
3.  Inspections; Emergencies. The City or its designee may enter onto the facility area to inspect the facility upon forty-eight (48) hours prior notice to the permittee. The permittee shall cooperate with all inspections and may be present for any inspection of its facility by the City. The City reserves the right to enter or direct its designee to enter the facility and support, repair, disable, or remove any elements of the facility in emergencies or when the facility threatens imminent harm to persons or property. The City shall make an effort to contact the permittee prior to disabling or removing any facility elements, but in any case shall notify permittee within twenty-four (24) hours of doing so. 
4.  Contact. The permittee shall at all times maintain accurate contact information for all parties responsible for the facility, which shall include a phone number, street mailing address and email address for at least one (1) natural person. 
5.  Adverse Impacts on Adjacent Properties. Permittee shall undertake all reasonable efforts to avoid undue adverse impacts to adjacent properties and/or uses that may arise from the construction, operation, maintenance, modification, and removal of the facility. 
6.  Noninterference. Permittee shall not move, alter, temporarily relocate, change, or interfere with any existing structure, improvement, or property without the prior consent of the owner of that structure, improvement, or property. No structure, improvement, or property owned by the City shall be moved to accommodate a permitted activity or encroachment, unless the City determines that such movement will not adversely affect the City or any surrounding businesses or residents, and the permittee pays all costs and expenses related to the relocation of the City's structure, improvement, or property. Prior to commencement of any work pursuant to a wireless encroachment permit, the permittee shall provide the City with documentation establishing to the City's satisfaction that the permittee has the legal right to use or interfere with any other structure, improvement, or property within the public right-of-way or City utility easement to be affected by permittee's facilities. 
7.  No Right, Title, or Interest. The permission granted by a wireless encroachment permit shall not in any event constitute an easement on or an encumbrance against the public right-of-way. No right, title, or interest (including franchise interest) in the public right-of-way, or any part thereof, shall vest or accrue in permittee by reason of a wireless encroachment permit or the issuance of any other permit or exercise of any privilege given thereby. 
8.  No Possessory Interest. No possessory interest is created by a wireless encroachment permit. However, to the extent that a possessory interest is deemed created by a governmental entity with taxation authority, permittee acknowledges that City has given to permittee notice pursuant to California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 107.6 that the use or occupancy of any public property pursuant to a wireless encroachment permit may create a possessory interest which may be subject to the payment of property taxes levied upon such interest. Permittee shall be solely liable for, and shall pay and discharge prior to delinquency, any and all possessory interact taxes or other taxes, fees, and assessments levied against permittee's right to possession, occupancy, or use of any public property pursuant to any right of possession, occupancy, or use created by this permit. 
9.  RF Exposure Compliance. All facilities must comply with all standards and regulations of the FCC and any other State or Federal government agency with the authority to regulate RF exposure standards. After transmitter and antenna system optimization, but prior to unattended operations of the facility, permittee or its representative must conduct on-site post-installation RF emissions testing to demonstrate actual compliance with the FCC OET Bulletin 65 RF emissions safety rules for general population/uncontrolled RF exposure in all sectors. For this testing, the transmitter shall be operating at maximum operating power, and the testing shall occur outwards to a distance where the RF emissions no longer exceed the uncontrolled/general population limit. 
10.  Modifications. No changes shall be made to the approved plans without review and approval in accordance with this Article. 
11.  Agreement with City. If not already completed, permittee shall enter into the appropriate agreement with the City, as determined by the City, prior to constructing, attaching, or operating a facility on Municipal Infrastructure. This permit is not a substitute for such agreement. 
12.  Records. The permittee must maintain complete and accurate copies of all permits and other regulatory approvals issued in connection with the facility, which includes without limitation this approval, the approved plans and photo simulations incorporated into this approval, all conditions associated with this approval and any ministerial permits or approvals issued in connection with this approval. In the event that the permittee does not maintain such records as required in this condition or fails to produce true and complete copies of such records within a reasonable time after a written request from the City, any ambiguities or uncertainties that would be resolved through an inspection of the missing records will be construed against the permittee. 
13.  Attorney's Fees. In the event the City determines that it is necessary to take legal action to enforce any of these conditions, or to revoke a permit, and such legal action is taken, the permittee shall be required to pay any and all costs of such legal action, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the City, even if the matter is not prosecuted to a final judgment or is amicably resolved, unless the City should otherwise agree with permittee to waive said fees or any part thereof. The foregoing shall not apply if the permittee prevails in the enforcement proceeding. 
B.  Eligible Facilities Requests. In addition to the conditions provided in Section 29.108A of this Article and any supplemental conditions imposed by the City Engineer or his or her designee or the City Manager or his or her designee, as the case may be, all permits for an eligible facility requests granted pursuant to this Article shall be subject to the following additional conditions, unless modified by the approving authority: 
1.  Permit subject to conditions of underlying permit. Any permit granted in response to an application qualifying as an eligible facilities request shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the underlying permit. 
2.  No permit term extension. The City's grant or grant by operation of law of an eligible facilities request permit constitutes a federally-mandated modification to the underlying permit or approval for the subject tower or base station. Notwithstanding any permit duration established in another permit condition, the City's grant or grant by operation of law of a eligible facilities request permit will not extend the permit term for the underlying permit or any other underlying regulatory approval, and its term shall be coterminous with the underlying permit or other regulatory approval for the subject tower or base station. 
3.  No waiver of standing. The City's grant or grant by operation of law of an eligible facilities request does not waive, and shall not be construed to waive, any standing by the City to challenge Section 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act, any FCC rules that interpret Section 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act, or any modification to Section 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act. 
C.  Small Cell Facilities Requests. In addition to the conditions provided in Section 29.108A of this Article and any supplemental conditions imposed by the City Engineer or his or her designee or the City Manager or his or her designee, as the case may be, all permits for a small cell facility granted pursuant to this Article shall be subject to the following condition, unless modified by the approving authority: 
1.  No waiver of standing. The City's grant of a permit for a small cell facility request does not waive, and shall not be construed to waive, any standing by the City to challenge any FCC orders or rules related to small cell facilities, or any modification to those FCC orders or rules.

ARTICLE IX. - DESIGN STANDARDS 
 
Sec. 30.114. - PURPOSE; MODIFICATIONS: 
The design standards herein set forth are hereby declared to be the minimum acceptable design standards for all divisions of land; provided, however, that if the appropriate advisory agency finds that a greater or lesser standard proposed by the subdivider would be in the public interest, said agency may approve such modification to said standards. The burden of proof as to whether the public interest would be so served by a proposed modification from the adopted standards shall lie with the subdivider. 
The purposes of these standards are as follows: 
A.  Promotion of public safety; 
B.  Implementation of applicable general plan goals, principles and standards; 
C.  Promotion of a higher and more uniform quality of living environment throughout the community; and 
D.  Protection of the land purchaser and of the general public from unnecessary expense due to the necessity of correcting substandard and faulty design features. 
(Ord. No. 1774, § 2, 2-5-79)  
Sec. 30.115. - CONFORMITY TO SPECIFIC AREA PLANS: 
The design standards for a division shall be consistent with the design intent of the specific areas plan, if any, which pertains to the area within which the division lies. 
(Ord. No. 1774, § 2, 2-5-79)  
Sec. 30.116. - MISCELLANEOUS STANDARDS: 
A.  Sewage Disposal: The size of mains, laterals, and appurtenances for public sanitary sewers shall be in accordance with City specifications. The Department of Public Works may require the oversizing of such facilities to serve property beyond a proposed division. 
B.  Water Supply: The source of water for all divisions in the City shall be the City water system. The sizing of mains and service lines, and the design of the system shall be in accordance with City specifications and shall be subject to the approval of the Director of Public Works and the Fire Chief. The location of all fire hydrants shall also be subject to the approval of the Director of Public Works and the Fire Chief. 
C.  Fire Alarm Boxes: The location, type and number of fire alarm boxes shall be subject to the approval of the Fire Chief and shall be installed by the subdivider. 
D.  Public Utilities: Utility easements for gas, underground electrical and communications distribution services shall be provided by the subdivider. Unless the subdivision is located within a previously platted area with rear lot line easements, all such easements shall be along the street frontage. All utility distribution service shall be underground in residential and commercial subdivisions, except as follows: 
1.  Pedestal mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets. 
2.  Metal or wooden poles for street lights. 
3.  Electrical distribution lines carrying in excess of 34.5 kv. 
The subdivider shall be responsible for coordination of design and installation standards with the affected utilities. 
E.  Drainage: General requirements for drainage are as follows: 
1.  Drainage structures shall be designed so as to protect lots and streets from a 100-year flood hazard as detailed in the City standard specifications. 
2.  Wherever the topography permits, drainage from individual lots shall be toward the street or toward a natural drainage course. For downhill side lots in hillside divisions, drainage shall be designed to minimize the effect thereof on lots located at lower elevations. 
3.  Wherever a natural or a planned drainage course traverses a subdivision, a maintenance and/or open space easement shall be dedicated by the subdivider for the safe disposal of storm waters. 
4.  Drainage structures shall be designed and installed to a grade to the approval of the Director of Public Works. He may require installation of such access and safety features on such structures as he deems necessary to provide and maintain adequate drainage. 
(Ord. No. 1774, § 2, 2-5-79)  
Sec. 30.117. - LOT DESIGN: 
All divisions shall contain the following lot design features: 
A.  Suitability for Designated Purpose: All divisions shall create lots capable of being built upon in accordance with applicable development regulations. No division shall create lots which are impracticable or hazardous for use due to steepness of terrain, location of water courses, seismic hazards, earth movement, size, shape, or other physical conditions. 
B.  Size, Shape and Frontage: The minimum area and dimensions shall conform to standard requirements of the Zoning Ordinance or to any approved planned development permit. Where unusual topography exists, lot area shall be increased in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. Lot depths shall generally not exceed two and one-half (2 ½) times their average width. 
C.  Angle of Side Lines to Street: The side lines of all lots shall be perpendicular to the street the lot faces, and shall be approximately radial to a street where it is curved. The Planning Director may recommend exceptions to such standards if he determines that strict compliance will be impractical. However, in no event shall any intersecting side lot line form an acute angle with the street of less than seventy degrees (70º). 
D.  Divided Lot Prohibited: No lot created under this Chapter shall be divided by a City boundary line, nor shall it be effectively divided by lots or parcels of land so that the principal parts of the lot are connected by a corridor of less than fifty feet (50') wide. 
E.  Double Frontage Prohibited: No lot created under this Chapter in a residentially zoned district shall have a double frontage except in the case of a corner lot. The Planning Director may recommend an exception to this standard. 
F.  Panhandle Lots: Panhandle lots (i.e., lots for which street frontage or access width is less than the minimum required) will not be approved as part of a division unless the subdivider shows that preexisting development in the vicinity of the division or unusual topography of the division justifies a panhandle lot. Every panhandle lot which may be approved shall have frontage on either a recorded public or private street of not less than thirty five feet (35'), and a building site shall be located within two hundred feet (200') from the street frontage of such lot. 
G.  Lot Line Alignment: Rear and interior lot lines shall be free of excessive jogs in alignment. 
H.  Passive or Natural Heating or Cooling: Consideration shall be given to future passive or natural heating or cooling opportunities in lot design. 
(Ord. No. 1774, § 2, 2-5-79)  
Sec. 30.118. - STREET DESIGN: 
All proposed streets shall comply with the following criteria: 
A.  Street Design: The proposed street or highway design for a division shall conform to the circulation element of the general plan and to any specific plan pertaining to such division, and shall be approved by the Director of Public Works. 
B.  Street Widths: The minimum width of the several classes of streets and highways shall conform to the schedule contained in this Section; provided, however, where a planned development permit for the subject area has been approved, or where the Subdivision Committee, or the Plan Review Committee, as the case may be, finds that it would be in the public interest to provide an exception to the precise standards contained herein such agency shall recommend a modification to such standards to the Planning Commission. Increased widths may be required where streets are to serve commercial or industrial property, or where present or anticipated traffic conditions warrant such increase. 
Schedule of standard street widths: 
1.  Parkway: Six (6) lanes divided—140 foot right-of-way—92 foot roadway width, including 16 foot median. 
2.  Parkway: Four (4) lanes divided—116 foot right-of-way—68 foot roadway width, including 16 foot median. 
3.  Arterial: Four (4) lanes divided—104 foot right-of-way—84 foot roadway width, including 14 foot median and two (2) four foot bike lanes. 
4.  Collector: Two (2) lanes—68 foot right-of-way—48 foot roadway width, including two (2) four foot bike lanes. 
5.  Commercial Street: Two (2) lanes—60 foot right-of-way—40 foot roadway width. 
6.  Industrial Street: Two (2) lanes—60 foot right-of-way—40 foot roadway width. 
7.  Local Street: Two (2) lanes—54 foot right-of-way—34 foot roadway width. 
8.  Hillside Street: Two (2) lanes—40 foot right-of-way—24 foot roadway width from center line to center line of two-foot roll gutter with parking provided on two (2) eight-foot paved shoulders. 
9.  Service or frontage road not exceeding one thousand feet (1,000') in length: Two (2) lanes—48 foot right-of-way—32 foot roadway. 
If, because of adjacent land use, or the type or design of development, on-street parking is determined by the Director of Public Works to be unnecessary on one side of a street, the standard right-of-way width and roadway width may be reduced by six feet (6'). If the Director of Public Works determines no on-street parking is required on either side of the street, the above widths may be reduced by twelve feet (12'). 
C.  Turnarounds: All turnarounds shall have a radius of at least forty feet (40') to face of curb. The minimum radius for turnarounds in commercial or industrial subdivisions may be recommended by the Director of Public Works to be increased because of anticipated traffic usage. The maximum length of cul-de-sac street shall be two hundred fifty feet (250'), unless the Subdivision Committee or the Planning Commission, as the case may be, approves an extension thereof because of topography or preexisting development in the vicinity of the division. 
D.  Grades, Curves, Sight Distances: Grades, curves and sight distances shall be subject to the approval of the Director of Public Works to ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians, and to avoid excessive grading or vegetation removal. Maximum grade for all streets other than local or hillside streets shall be seven percent (7%), the maximum grade for local or hillside streets shall be twelve percent (12%). A grade of fifteen percent (15%) may be permitted by the Director of Public Works if he determines that special topographical conditions or other exceptional circumstances relating to the property within a proposed division justify such grade. 
E.  Street Pattern: Street patterns shall conform to applicable principles in the circulation element of the general plan, and shall, wherever appropriate, provide for the development of adjoining areas. The street pattern shall also conform to the following principles and standards: 
1.  Proposed major arterials and collector streets shall be continuous and in alignment with existing or platted streets with which they are to connect. Center lines of connecting streets not in alignment shall be offset a minimum of one hundred fifty feet (150'). 
2.  Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the division whenever it is determined such extension is necessary for traffic circulation and coordination of the proposed division with adjoining divisions or the development of adjoining properties. 
3.  Where a street must be stubended at a boundary line of the division, a one foot nonaccess easement at the end of the street shall be deeded to the City. Such strip shall not be improved and a barrier shall be erected on such strip subject to the approval of the Director of Public Works. Where four (4) or more lots or dwelling units have their sole access to the street system of the City by means of the street which is stubended, a temporary turnaround within the public right-of-way or a temporary connection to another street shall be provided by the subdivider. 
4.  Proposed streets shall intersect at approximately ninety degree (90º) angles. If the Director of Public Works determines that topography, traffic design, or other factors of such development indicate the need for modifying this standard, such standard may be modified up to fifteen degrees (15º). 
5.  Corners of both curbs and property lines shall be rounded. Minimum radius at the property line shall be twenty feet (20'). Greater radii may be required where necessitated by projected traffic conditions or by intersection of streets at less than ninety degree (90º) angles. 
6.  Excessively long and straight or steep streets in residential areas shall be avoided. 
(Ord. No. 1774, § 2, 2-5-79)  
Sec. 30.119. - STREET NAMING: 
Streets which are continuations of existing streets shall bear the names of such existing streets. Names of new streets shall be submitted to the Planning Director who shall submit them to postal authorities and to the Fire Chief for review to avoid duplication of names within the areas served by the safety services and others. Final approval of all street names shall be the responsibility of the Planning Director. 
(Ord. No. 1774, § 2, 2-5-79)  
Sec. 30.120. - PEDESTRIAN/BICYCLE PATHS: 
A subdivider shall be required to dedicate and develop pedestrian/bicycle paths when necessitated by traffic safety and for the purpose of providing safe access to schools, parks, playgrounds, and other community facilities. Such paths shall be a minimum of ten feet (10') wide. At the option of the City, pedestrian/bicycle paths may be combined with other easements or rights-of-way when such easements are compatible with the purposes of this Chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1774, § 2, 2-5-79)  
Sec. 30.121. - STREET LIGHTING: 
Street lighting shall be appropriate to the proposed intensity of use of the street facility and the character of the area to be served. The amount of street lighting shall be consistent with principles of energy conservation and optimum public safety, and shall be subject to the approval of the Director of Public Works. 
(Ord. No. 1774, § 2, 2-5-79)  
Sec. 30.122. - STREET TREES AND PLANTINGS: 
Street trees of a species approved by the Director of Parks and Recreation shall be planted at a maximum of fifty feet (50') apart, but each lot shall have at least one such tree planted thereon or therefor. Street trees shall be planted in an approved planting easement or an approved planting area within the right-of-way. Final location of each street tree shall be determined by the Director of Parks and Recreation. Where the character and design of a street require, as determined by the Director of Parks and Recreation, plantings in addition to street trees shall be provided by a subdivider. All such planting materials shall be subject to the approval of the Director of Parks and Recreation, and street trees shall be installed by City personnel under his direction. 
(Ord. No. 1774, § 2, 2-5-79)  
Sec. 30.123. - SIDEWALKS: 
Sidewalks shall be installed to the standard specifications of the City.

Such alternatives shall give consideration to providing a reasonable level of public safety. 
(Ord. No. 1774, § 2, 2-5-79)  
Sec. 30.124. - CURBS AND GUTTERS: 
Curbs and gutters shall be installed to the standard specifications of the City. Where unusual site conditions or preexisting development in the vicinity of a proposed division make conformance to such standards impractical, as determined by the Director of Public Works or the Planning Director, either may recommend to the Subdivision Committee or the Planning Commission that either no curb and gutter be required or that an alternate design be approved. 
(Ord. No. 1774, § 2, 2-5-79)  
Sec. 30.125. - RAIL CROSSINGS: 
Additional crossings of main rail lines are to be avoided. Where no feasible alternative to the creation of a new railroad crossing exists because of the need to provide access for major circulation within a proposed division, the subdivider shall provide such crossing at his expense. The subdivider shall be responsible for preparation of all documents necessary for filing an application with the State Public Utilities Commission for a permit to establish and improve such crossing.

B.  It shall be unlawful for any person, as principal, agent, or otherwise, to offer to sell or lease, to contract to sell or lease, to sell or lease, or to finance any parcel or parcels of real property or to commence construction of any building for sale, lease, or financing thereon, except for model homes, or to allow occupancy thereof, for which a parcel map is required by this Chapter until such map thereof in full compliance with the provisions of this Chapter has been filed for record by the Recorder of the County. 
C.  It shall be unlawful for any person to convey any part of a division of real property for which a final map or a parcel map is required by this Chapter by reference to a parcel or block number or numbers, initial or other designation, unless and until such map has been filed for record by the Recorder of the County. 
D.  This Section does not apply to any parcel or parcels of a division offered for sale or lease, contracted for sale or lease, or sold or leased in compliance with or exempt from any ordinance regulating the design and improvement of divisions in effect at the time the division was established. 
(Ord. No. 1774, § 2, 2-5-79)  
Sec. 30.127. - ISSUANCE OF PERMITS PROHIBITED: 
No permit shall be issued nor shall any approval be granted which is necessary to develop any real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of this Chapter if the Advisory Agency or the Council, as appropriate, find that development of such real property is contrary to the public health or public safety. Such denial of the issuance of a permit or granting of approval shall apply whether the applicant therefor was the owner of record at the time of such violation or whether the applicant therefor is either the current owner of record or a vendee of the current owner of record pursuant to a contract of sale of the real property with, or without, actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of his interest in such real property. 
Any permit issued or approval granted for the development of any such real property, may have imposed in connection therewith those conditions that would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the applicant acquired his interest in such real property, and which had been established at such time by this Chapter or any ordinance, except that if a conditional certificate of compliance has been filed for record under the provisions of subdivision (b) of section 66499.35 of the Government Code, only such conditions specified in such certificate shall be applicable.

ARTICLE XI. - CONDOMINIUMS 
 
Sec. 30.130. - PURPOSE: 
Condominium and community apartment projects combining a common ownership interest in a particular project with an ownership or right of occupancy in an individual unit in a particular project are different from conventional and familiar patterns of housing in the City. While condominium and community apartment projects present benefits in the nature of increased amenities, opportunities for dwelling ownership and leisure time, the special nature of such projects creates conditions that may result in neglect, deterioration and lack of maintenance, causing a negative impact upon the public health, safety, welfare and economic prosperity of the City and its citizens. Because of the unique nature of the problems created by condominium and community apartment projects, it is the express intent of the City to treat such projects differently from other types of multiple-family dwellings and to establish rules and standards therefor, regulating the construction of, and conversion to, condominium projects and community apartment projects in the City. 
(Ord. No. 1751, § 1, 5-8-78)  
Sec. 30.131. - DEFINITIONS: 
ASSOCIATION: Association means the organization of persons who own a condominium unit or right of exclusive occupancy in a community apartment.

(Ord. No. 2319, § 2, 10-22-07)  
Sec. 30.144. - REQUIRED DEDICATION: 
A.  Where a park or recreation facility has been designated in the Impact Fee Project List, and such facility is located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision and will serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider may dedicate land for a local park sufficient in size and topography that bears a reasonable relationship to serve the present and future needs of the residents of the subdivision. 
B.  The subdivider shall, without credit, provide site improvements to any land dedicated pursuant to this Section. 
C.  The land to be dedicated and the site improvements to be made pursuant to this Section shall be approved by the Administrator, who shall not grant approval to any proposed improvement that does not meet the standards set forth in the Impact Fee Project List. 
(Ord. No. 2319, § 2, 10-22-07)  
Sec. 30.145. - FEE REQUIREMENT: 
A.  The fee required with respect to a subdivision shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the subdivision, and shall be calculated by first subtracting the acreage dedicated pursuant to Section 30.144 from the parkland requirement for that subdivision and then multiplying the result of that calculation by a per acre land and site improvement cost calculated pursuant to subsection B below. 
B.  The cost per acre of land and site improvements for purposes of subsection A above, shall be one million nine hundred twenty-seven thousand five hundred thirty dollars ($1,927,530.00) per acre, which represents a land cost of one million eight hundred ninety-four thousand eight hundred sixty dollars ($1,894,860.00) and a site improvement cost of thirty-two thousand six hundred seventy dollars ($32,670.00). 
C.  A credit against the fee required by this Section may be given for dedications of park improvements constructed or provided at private expense and for the value of land dedicated to the City that is necessary or useful to a park improvement. Such credit will be granted only if, prior to dedication, the City Council determines: (i) that the dedicated land or improvement is included on the Impact Fee Project List and (ii) that the grant of the credit, in lieu of the fee, will not cause the City to delay the implementation of park improvements that are of higher priority, in the judgment of the City Council, than the land or improvements to be dedicated. At the time the City Council makes these determinations, it must also make a determination of the maximum credit that will be allowed for the dedication, which maximum credit shall not exceed the City Council's reasonable estimate of the fair market value of the park improvement and/or land. The amount of any credit granted pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed the lesser of: (i) the actual documented construction costs for the dedicated improvement plus the value of any dedicated land as supported by a professional appraisal or (ii) the maximum credit approved by the City Council pursuant to this subsection. No credit shall be given pursuant to this subsection for any dedication required by or made pursuant to Section 30.144, as the value of such dedications are already reflected in the calculation made pursuant to subsection A above. 
D.  Beginning July 1st, 2008, and on each July 1st thereafter, each dollar amount set forth in this Article shall increase without further action by the City according to the following formula: 
	Most Recent ENR 
Council-Approved Rate * 	_____
	ENR at Council-Approval 
 
Where the "Council-Approved Rate" is the rate set forth in this Article, "Most Recent ENR" is the most recently published Construction Cost Index for the San Francisco Bay Area in the Engineering News Record when the calculation is made and "ENR at Council-Approval" is the Construction Cost Index published for the month in which the Council adopted the "Council-Approved Rate." The Administrator shall calculate the increased fee annually and give notice of that calculation in the manner required by law for the publication of ordinance of the City Council.

Sec. 30.146. - MISCELLANEOUS CREDITS: 
A.  If a subdivider dedicates land for park purposes pursuant to Section 30.144(A) then, in lieu of any credit available pursuant to Section 30.145(C) and only to the extent required by Section 66477 of the California Government Code, the subdivider may elect to have the value of park and recreational improvements provided by the subdivider to the dedicated land credited against the dedication requirement set forth in Section 30.144(A). 
B.  Common interest developments, as defined in Section 1351 of the California Civil Code, shall be eligible to receive a credit against the amount of land required to be dedicated, or the amount of the fee imposed, pursuant to this Section, for the value of open space within the development which is usable for active recreational uses. For purposes of this subsection, open space shall be deemed "useable for active recreational uses" only if, in the judgment of the City Council, that space meets the following criteria: 
1.  The open space is at least 1.0 acres in size; 
2.  At least twenty-five percent (25%) of the space is developed with amenities that permit active recreation that may include, but is not limited to, swimming pools, basketball, soccer, baseball, volleyball, tennis, football or similar courts, and playground equipment; and 
3.  At least fifty percent (50%) of the open space area consists of smooth grass spaces with a grade of no more than one-foot rise in twenty-five feet (25') that can be divided into rectangles each of no less than five hundred (500) square feet, with the shorter side of each rectangle being no less than twenty feet (20') wide. 
The value of such private open space shall be determined by the City Council, based upon a professional appraisal produced by an independent consultant selected by the City and paid for by the subdivider. Such appraisal shall take into account only the value of such open space in the marketplace if it were restricted to use as open space usable for active recreational uses and sold separately from the remainder of the subdivision. The valuation shall not take into account the amount the City (or any other public entity) might pay for such open space unless, in the opinion of the City Council, the City or another public entity has an established history or policy of purchasing open space in the City of similar size, configuration and use. 
The credited amount shall be as follows: 
i.  One hundred percent (100%) credit for space open to the public during normal City Park hours. 
ii.  Twenty-five percent (25%) credit for space open to the residents of the subdivision only. 
C.  Where a credit granted pursuant to subsection A or B of this Section is applied to a land dedication requirement, as opposed to a fee requirement, the amount of such credit shall be calculated at a rate of one acre of credit for each one million nine hundred twenty-seven thousand five hundred thirty dollars ($1,927,530.00) in value of park and recreational improvements (in the case of a credit pursuant to subsection A of this Section) or private open space useable for active recreational uses (in the case of a credit pursuant to subsection B of this Section). 
(Ord. No. 2319, § 2, 10-22-07)  
Sec. 30.147. - USE OF FEES AND DEDICATED LAND: 
A.  The City shall develop a schedule specifying how, when, and where it will use the land and fees accepted or collected pursuant to this Article to develop park or recreational facilities to serve the residents of the subdivisions for which such dedications or payments have been made. Any fees collected shall be committed within five (5) years after the payment of the fees or the issuance of building permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. If the fees are not committed, they, without any deductions, shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lot bears to the total area of all lots within the subdivision. 
B.  All fees collected shall be deposited into a subdivision park trust fund. Money in that fund, including accrued interest, shall be used only for the purpose of developing new or rehabilitating existing neighborhood or Community Park or recreational facilities that serve the subdivision for which the fees were paid. 
C.  Land and improvements accepted by the City pursuant to this Article shall be used only for the purpose of developing new or rehabilitating existing neighborhood or Community Park or recreational facilities that serve the subdivisions for which the fees were paid. 
D.  There is no requirement that any park or recreational facility fully or partially funded pursuant to this Article or dedicated to the City pursuant to this Article be accessible only to the residents of a specific subdivision, and all such parks and recreational facilities shall be open to the public in the manner specified by the City Council and by City policy. 
E.  Collected fees shall be appropriated by the City or paid for a specific project to serve residents of the subdivision in a budgetary year within five (5) years upon receipt of payment or within five (5) years after the issuance of building permits on one-half (½) of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later.

The agreement shall provide that approval of the final building inspection shall not be granted until the fee is paid or the credit issued. The agreement shall also provide that, in any action to collect the fee or any portion thereof, the City shall be entitled to all of its costs of enforcement and collection, including reasonable attorney's fees.

The applicant shall apply in writing for such a refund within thirty (30) calendar days of the expiration of the permit; provided, that the Administrator may extend such period for good cause, not to exceed six (6) months.

ARTICLE XIII. - CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE 
 
Sec. 30.150. - CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE PROCESSING; GENERAL: 
A.  Any person owning real property or a vendee of such person pursuant to a contract of sale of such real property may submit to the Planning Manager an application for issuance of a Certificate of Compliance, and the Planning Manager shall determine, whether such real property complies with the provisions of this Article and the Subdivision Map Act (California Government Code Section 66410 et. seq., as may be amended). The application shall include all information reasonably necessary to allow the Planning Manager to evaluate whether the real property so complies, including documentation of any prior subdivision approvals, a separate chain of title report for each individual lot, and any other information reasonably requested by the Planning Manager. Within thirty (30) days of application submittal and fee payment, the Planning Manager shall determine whether an application is complete. If an application is incomplete, the Planning Manager shall provide written notification to the applicant listing the information or fees necessary to complete the application. If the Planning Manager determines that such real property complies with the provisions of this Chapter and the Subdivision Map Act, he or she shall issue a certificate of compliance. Upon making such a determination, the Planning Manager shall cause a certificate of compliance to be filed for record with the county recorder. The certificate of compliance shall identify the real property and shall state that the division thereof complies with applicable provisions of this Chapter and the Subdivision Map Act. 
B.  If the Planning Manager determines that such real property does not comply with the provisions of this Chapter or the Subdivision Map Act, he or she shall issue a conditional certificate of compliance, which may impose such conditions as would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the applicant acquired his or her interest therein, and which had been established at such time by this Chapter or the Subdivision Map Act. Except that where the applicant was the owner of record at the time of the initial violation of this Article and such person is the current owner of record of one (1) or more of the parcels which were created as the result of the grant in violation of this Chapter or the Subdivision Map Act, then the Planning Manager may impose such conditions as would be applicable to a current division of the property. Upon making a determination that a Conditional Certificate of Compliance should be issued and establishing such conditions, the Planning Manager shall cause such Conditional Certificate of Compliance to be filed for record with the county recorder. Such certificate shall serve as a notice to the property owner or vendee who has applied for the certificate pursuant to this Section, a grantee of the property owner, or any subsequent transferee or assignee of the property that the fulfillment and implementation of such conditions shall be required prior to subsequent issuance of a permit or other grant of approval for development of the property. Compliance with any conditions imposed by a Conditional Certificate of Compliance shall not be required until such time as a permit or other grant of approval for development of such property is issued. 
C.  A Certificate of Compliance shall be issued for any real property which has been approved for development pursuant to Section 30.127 of this Code. 
D.  A recorded final map or parcel map shall constitute a Certificate of Compliance with respect to the parcels of real property described therein. 
E.  Any determination made by the Planning Manager under this Article shall be documented in a Notice of Final Decision which shall be mailed to all interested parties. A Notice of Final Decision for a Conditional Certificate of Compliance shall also be mailed to owners of property located adjacent to the real property at issue. 
(Ord. No. 2437, § 1, 6-12-17)  
Sec. 30.151. - FEES: 
Every application for a Certificate of Compliance or Conditional Certificate of Compliance under Section 30.150 shall be accompanied by a fee to recover all reasonable costs of application, review, investigation, and processing. The above fee will be established by Council resolution, provided, however, that the fee may be established based on actual costs to perform the services, in which case, for complex applications the applicant will be required to pay additional amounts as necessary to recover all reasonably related costs including the costs of outside consultants, incurred by the City. The payment of the entire fee shall be made prior to the issuance of the Certificate of Compliance.

This Chapter may be cited as the "Redwood City Community Benefit Improvement District Procedural Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 2405, § 2, 4-29-14)

This Chapter is adopted pursuant to Section 3 of the City Charter, which provides that the City shall and may exercise all municipal powers, functions, rights, privileges and immunities of every name and nature whatsoever.

(Ord. No. 2405, § 2, 4-29-14)  
Sec. 31.4. - ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICT:

(Ord. No. 2405, § 2, 4-29-14)  
Sec. 31.5. - INCORPORATION OF STATE LAW: 
This Chapter incorporates the Property and Business Improvement District Law of 1994 (Streets & Highways Code §§ 36600 et seq.), which is referred to in the Chapter as the "PBID Law". In connection with such incorporation, all references in the PBID Law to a "District" or a "Property and Business Improvement District" shall be interpreted as references to a Community Benefit Improvement District. Except where a provision of the PBID Law is inconsistent with a provision of this Chapter, all provisions of the PBID law shall apply to the establishment and operation of any Community Benefit Improvement District established pursuant to this Chapter. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Chapter and those of the PBID Law, the provisions in this Chapter shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 2405, § 2, 4-29-14)  
Sec. 31.6. - RELATIONSHIP OF ASSESSMENT TO ZONING: 
Notwithstanding the requirements of Section 36632 of the PBID Law, any parcel of real property, regardless of the zoning of such parcel, may be included in a Community Benefit Improvement District and subject to an assessment in connection therewith, so long as such parcel specially benefits from the services and improvements funded by that District. 
(Ord. No. 2405, § 2, 4-29-14)  
Sec. 31.7. - ASSESSMENT AGAINST REAL PROPERTY: 
Only assessments against real property may be levied in connection with a Community Benefit Improvement District.

In lieu of the requirements of Section 36621(a) of the PBID Law, the City Council may initiate proceedings to form a Community Benefit Improvement District upon the submission of a written petition, signed by property owners in the proposed district who will pay more than thirty percent (30%) of the assessments proposed to be levied in connection with such district. The amount of assessment attributable to property owned by the same property owner that is in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the amount of all assessments proposed to be levied shall not be included in determining whether the petition is signed by property owners who will pay more than thirty percent (30%) of the total amount of assessments proposed to be levied. 
(Ord. No. 2405, § 2, 4-29-14)  
Sec. 31.9. - FORMATION COSTS: 
If so provided in the management district plan for a Community Benefit Improvement District, the assessment levied in connection with such a District may include amounts sufficient to recover the costs incurred in forming the District, including: 
1.  The costs of preparation of the management district plan required by the PBID Law and engineer's report required by Article XIIID, § 4 of the California Constitution; 
2.  The cost of preparing, circulating and submitting the petition to the City Council seeking establishment of the District; 
3.  The costs of printing, advertising and the giving of published, posted or mailed notices; 
4.  Compensation of any consultant, engineer or attorney employed to render services in proceedings under this chapter or the PBID Law; and 
5.  Costs incurred by the City for public hearings, notices, ballots and other proceedings required by law for approval of a new or increased assessment. 
The management district plan shall specify the formation costs eligible for recovery through assessments, the schedule for recovery of those costs, and the basis for determining the amount of the additional assessment for recovery of costs, including the maximum amount of the additional assessment, expressed either as a dollar amount, or as a percentage of the underlying assessment. 
(Ord. No. 2405, § 2, 4-29-14)  
Sec. 31.10. - ADVANCEMENT OF COSTS: 
The City Council may, in the Resolution of Intention for creating a Community Benefit Improvement District, provide that if the District is established, funds may be advanced from the City's general fund to permit the operation of the District prior to the City's collection of the assessment. Such advance shall occur only after the establishment of the District, and no advance shall be made if the District is not established. Any such advance may not exceed the total anticipated assessment proceeds for the first year of the assessment. Any such advance must be recovered from assessment proceeds as provided in the Resolution of Intention, along with interest calculated at a rate set forth in the Resolution of Intention. The duration of any such advance shall not exceed five (5) years. 
(Ord. No. 2405, § 2, 4-29-14)  
Sec. 31.11. - DURATION: 
The duration of a new Community Benefit Improvement District shall be no greater than specified in the Resolution of Intention for the District, and shall in no event be in excess of twenty (20) years. This Section is intended to supplant any shorter limitation set forth in the PBID Law on the duration of assessments levied in connection with an assessment district. 
(Ord. No. 2405, § 2, 4-29-14)  
Sec. 31.12. - RENEWAL: 
A Community Benefit Improvement District may be renewed for a period of not to exceed twenty (20) additional years by following the procedures set forth in Section 36660 of the PBID Law. 
(Ord. No. 2405, § 2, 4-29-14)  
Sec. 31.13. - DISESTABLISHMENT: 
The City Council may, on its own initiative, at any time adopt a Resolution of Intention to disestablish a Community Benefit Improvement District and shall adopt such a resolution if, during the annual thirty (30) day period set forth in Section 36670(a)(2) of the PBID Law, the City Council receives a written petition requesting disestablishment signed by property owners who pay more than thirty percent (30%) of the assessments levied in connection with the district. This section provides alternative method for the initiation of proceedings to disestablish a Community Benefit Improvement District and shall not be interpreted to preempt the existence of other methods set forth in Section 36670(a)(2) of the PBID Law. A Resolution of Intention adopted pursuant to this section shall have the same effect, and trigger the same notice and hearing requirements, as a Resolution of Intention otherwise adopted pursuant to Section 36670 of the PBID Law. 
(Ord. No. 2405, § 2, 4-29-14)  
Sec. 31.14. - ACTION BY ORDINANCE: 
Any action of the City Council that levies an assessment pursuant to this Chapter, or that changes the method and basis of levying such an assessment, shall be taken by ordinance. Where the PBID Law specifies that action be taken by adoption of a resolution containing certain information and ordering certain actions, the adoption of an ordinance containing that same information and ordering those same actions shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the PBID Law. Adoption of an ordinance of formation pursuant to Section 36625 of the PBID Law shall constitute the levy of an assessment in each of the fiscal years referred to in the management district plan; however, each year's levy shall be conditioned on the approval, by resolution or ordinance, of a report pursuant to Section 36650 of the PBID Law. The approval of such a report is at the discretion of the Council. 
(Ord. No. 2405, § 2, 4-29-14)  
Sec. 31.15. - OWNER'S ASSOCIATION: 
The City may contract with an Owner's Association, as defined in Section 36614.5 of the PBID Law, to provide the improvements and activities described in the management district plan for a Community Benefit Improvement District. Any such contract must be approved by the City Council, but such a contract shall not be subject to the requirements of Article VII of Chapter 2. Any such contract shall require that assessment proceeds be expended by the Owner's Association only in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of this Chapter, the provisions of the management district plan for the Community Benefit Improvement District, and the City Council actions establishing and otherwise relating to the Community Benefit Improvement District. As an Owner's Association is a private entity, independent from the City, any Owner's Association shall be subject to the requirements of its contract with the City, but shall not be treated as a subdivision of the City for the purposes of any provision of this Code or the City Charter.

Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this Section shall govern the construction of this Article: 
HOSTING PLATFORM: A means through which an operator may offer a dwelling unit, or portion thereof, for transient occupancy. A hosting platform includes, but is not limited to, an internet based platform that allows an operator to advertise and potentially arrange for temporary occupation of the dwelling unit, or portion thereof, through a publicly searchable website, whether the transient user pays rent directly to the operator or to the hosting platform. 
HOTEL: Any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof. A hotel also includes a short-term rental as provided for in Section 31.3 of the Redwood City Zoning Ordinance. 
OCCUPANCY: The use or possession, or the right to use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
OPERATOR: The person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this Article and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this Article by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. An operator also includes a person who is a host as provided for in Section 31.3 of the Redwood City Zoning Ordinance. 
PERSON: Except as used in the meaning of "transient" hereof, means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

TRANSIENT: Any individual who exercises occupancy or is, entitled to occupancy of a specific room by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such individual so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty (30) days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy of the room. In determining whether an individual is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this Article may be considered.

For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of twelve percent (12%) of the rent charged by the operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the City which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator.

Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this Article to the same extent and at the time as the rent is collected from every transient.

No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner, hereinafter provided.

Sec. 32.78. - TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE: 
Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of this Article, or with thirty (30) days after commencing business, whichever is later each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register said hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from him a "Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate" to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.

B.  The address of the hotel; 
C.  The date upon which the certificate was issued; 
D.  "This Transient Occupancy Registration certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit."

At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this Article shall be held in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Tax Administrator. 
(Ord. No. 1265, § 1)  
Sec. 32.80. - COLLECTION BY HOSTING PLATFORMS: 
Any hosting platform that assists with arranging transient occupancy may enter into a voluntary collection agreement (or equivalent) with the City for the collection and payment of transient occupancy taxes. Where a hosting platform has entered into such an agreement, the hosting platform shall have the same duties and liabilities of the operator under this Article. Compliance with the provisions of this Article by either the operator or the hosting platform shall be considered to be compliance by both. To comply with Section 32.78, a hosting platform shall register in its own name and post its Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate on its website, if applicable. Operators that only use a hosting platform for providing lodging to transients shall not be required to register separately with the tax administrator or post a Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate on-site so long as such hosting platform used by the operator has registered pursuant to Section 32.78.

As soon as the tax administrator shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this Article and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this Article. In case such determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give a notice of the amount assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address.

At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 32.95.

B.  An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
C.  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by filing a claim in the manner provided in Article IX of this Chapter, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the Tax Administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax Administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
D.  No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this Section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto.

The amount of tax collected in one month shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator, and must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the following month; or, at the option of the person required to collect and/or remit the tax, such person shall remit an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous month or upon the payment pattern of the service user, which must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the following month, provided that such person shall submit an adjusted payment or request for credit, as appropriate, within sixty (60) days following each calendar quarter. The credit, if approved by the Tax Administrator, may be applied against any subsequent remittance that becomes due. 
(Ord. No. 2250 § 1, 6-4-03)  
Sec. 32.504. - GAS USERS TAX: 
A.  There is hereby imposed a tax upon every person using gas in the City, which is transported and delivered through a pipeline distribution system. The tax imposed by this Section shall be at the rate of five percent (5%) of the charges made for such gas, including all services related to the storage, transportation and delivery of such gas. The tax shall be collected from the service user by the service supplier or non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the tax shall not apply to any individual who qualifies, and has been accepted, for the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Program pursuant to California Public Utilities Code Sections 327 and 739.1 et seq., and as it may be amended from time to time. In the event that the CARE Program is repealed or otherwise ceases to exist in a substantially similar form, the exemption granted under this subsection shall automatically terminate. 
B.  As used in this Section, the term "charges" shall apply to all services, components and items for gas service that are: (i) necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of gas service; or (ii) currently are or historically have been included in a single or bundled rate for gas service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. The term "charges" shall include, but is not limited to, the following charges: 
1.  The commodity charges for purchased gas, or the cost of gas owned by the service user (including the actual costs attributed to drilling, production, lifting, storage, gathering, trunkline, pipeline, and other operating costs associated with the production and delivery of such gas), which is delivered through a gas pipeline distribution system; 
2.  Gas transportation charges (including interstate charges to the extent not included in commodity charges); 
3.  Storage charges; provided, however, that the service supplier shall not be required to apply the tax to any charges for gas storage services when the service supplier cannot, as a practical matter, determine the jurisdiction where such stored gas is ultimately used; but it shall be the obligation of the service user to self-collect the amount of tax not applied to any charge for gas storage by the service supplier and to remit the tax to the appropriate jurisdiction; 
4.  Capacity or demand charges, late charges, service establishment or reestablishment charges, transition charges, customer charges, minimum charges, annual and monthly charges, and any other charges which are necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of gas service; and 
5.  Charges, fees, or surcharges for gas services or programs which are mandated by the California Public Utilities Commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whether or not such charges, fees, or surcharges appear on a bundled or line item basis on the customer billing. 
C.  As used in this Section, the term "charges" shall include the value of any other services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the gas or services related to the delivery of such gas. 
D.  The Tax Administrator, from time to time, may survey the gas service suppliers to identify the various unbundled billing components of gas retail service that they commonly provide to residential and commercial/industrial customers in the City, and the charges therefor, including those items that are mandated by State or Federal regulatory agencies as a condition of providing such gas service. The Tax Administrator, thereafter, may issue and disseminate to such gas service suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those components and items which are: (i) necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of gas service; or (ii) currently are or historically have been included in a single or bundled rate for gas service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. Charges for such components and items shall be subject to the tax of subsection A above. 
E.  There shall be excluded from the base on which the tax imposed in this Section is computed (1) charges made for gas which is to be resold and delivered through mains or pipes; (2) charges made for gas to be used in the generation of electrical energy by an electrical corporation; and (3) charges for the use of gas by a gas corporation in the production or distribution of gas. 
F.  The tax on gas provided by self-production or by a non-utility service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this Article shall be collected and remitted in the manner set forth in Section 32.505 of this Article. All other taxes on charges for gas imposed by this Section shall be collected from the service user by the gas service supplier or its billing agent. The amount of tax collected in one month shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator, and must be received by the Tax Administrator, on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the following month; or, at the option of the person required to collect and/or remit the tax, such person shall remit an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous month or upon the payment pattern of the service user, which must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the following month, provided that such person shall submit an adjusted payment or request for credit, as appropriate, within sixty (60) days following each calendar quarter. The credit, if approved by the Tax Administrator, may be applied against any subsequent remittance that becomes due. 
(Ord. No. 2250 § 1, 6-4-03)  
Sec. 32.505. - COLLECTION OF TAX FROM SERVICE USERS RECEIVING DIRECT PURCHASE OF GAS OR ELECTRICITY: 
A.  Any service user subject to the tax imposed by Section 32.503 or by Section 32.504 of this Article, which produces gas or electricity for self-use; which receives gas or electricity, including any related supplemental services, directly from a non-utility service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this Article; or which, for any other reason, is not having the full tax collected and remitted by its service supplier, a non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent on the use of gas or electricity in the City, including any related supplemental services, shall report said fact to the Tax Administrator and shall remit the tax due directly to the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days of such use. In lieu of paying said actual tax, the service user may, at its option, remit to the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days of such use an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous month, or upon the payment pattern of similar customers of the service supplier using similar amounts of gas or electricity, provided that the service user shall submit an adjusted payment or request for credit, as appropriate, within sixty (60) days following each calendar quarter. The credit, if approved by the Tax Administrator, may be applied against any subsequent tax bill that becomes due. 
B.  The Tax Administrator may require said service user to identify its non-utility service supplier and provide, subject to audit: invoices; books of account; or other satisfactory evidence documenting the quantity of gas or electricity used, including any related supplemental services, and the cost or price thereof. If the service user is unable to provide such satisfactory evidence, or if the administrative cost of calculating the tax in the opinion of the Tax Administrator is excessive, the Tax Administrator may determine the tax by applying the tax rate to the equivalent charges the service user would have incurred if the gas or electricity used, including any related supplemental services, had been provided by the service supplier that is the primary supplier of gas or electricity within the City. Rate schedules for this purpose shall be available from the City. 
(Ord. No. 2250, § 1, 6-4-03)  
Sec. 32.506. - RESERVED: 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2337, § 1, adopted Jan. 12, 2009, repealed § 32.506, which pertained to a video users tax and derived from Ord. No. 2250, § 1, adopted June 4, 2003.  
Sec. 32.507. - EFFECT OF COMMINGLING TAXABLE ITEMS WITH NON-TAXABLE ITEMS: 
If one or more non-taxable items are bundled or billed together with one or more taxable items (as provided for by this Article) under a single charge on a service user's bill, the entire single charge shall be deemed taxable. 
(Ord. No. 2250, § 1, 6-4-03)  
Sec. 32.508. - CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS: 
A.  Nothing in this Article shall be construed as imposing a tax upon: 
1.  Any person or service when imposition of such tax upon that person or service would be in violation of a Federal or State statute, the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of California; and 
2.  The City. 
B.  Any service user that is exempt from the tax imposed by this Article pursuant to subsection A shall file an application with the Tax Administrator for an exemption; provided, however, this requirement shall not apply to a service user that is a State or Federal agency or subdivision with a commonly recognized name. Said application shall be made upon a form approved by the Tax Administrator and shall state those facts, declared under penalty of perjury, which qualify the applicant for an exemption, and shall include the names of all utility service suppliers serving that service user. If deemed exempt by the Tax Administrator, such service user shall give the Tax Administrator timely written notice of any change in utility service suppliers so that the Tax Administrator can properly notify the new utility service supplier of the service users' tax exempt status. A service user that fails to comply with this Section shall not be entitled to a refund of utility users' taxes collected and remitted to the Tax Administrator from such service user as a result of such non-compliance. Upon request of the Tax Administrator, a service supplier or non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent shall provide a list of the names and addresses of those customers which, according to its billing records, are deemed exempt from the utility users' tax. 
C.  The decision of the Tax Administrator may be appealed pursuant to Section 32.520 of this Article. Filing an application with the Tax Administrator and appeal to the City Manager pursuant to Section 32.520 of this Article is a prerequisite to a suit thereon.

(Ord. No. 2337, § 1, 1-12-09)  
Sec. 32.509. - MAXIMUM UTILITY USERS TAX PAYABLE: 
No service user shall be required to pay the combined amount of the taxes imposed pursuant to this Article in excess of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) per year. Any service user who pays the maximum utility users tax imposed by the City may, with the permission of the Director, pay the tax in equal quarterly installments directly to the City. The Director shall inform all service suppliers of the names and locations of all service users making payments directly to the City. 
(Ord. No. 2250, § 1, 6-4-03)  
Sec. 32.510. - SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS/MINIMUM CONTACTS: 
For purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax under this Article, "substantial nexus" and "minimum contacts" shall be construed broadly in favor of the imposition, collection and/or remittance of the utility users tax to the fullest extent permitted by State and Federal law, and as it may change from time to time by judicial interpretation or by statutory enactment. 
(Ord. No. 2250, § 1, 6-4-03)  
Sec. 32.511. - DUTY TO COLLECT AND REMIT—PROCEDURES: 
The duty of service suppliers to collect and remit the taxes imposed by the provisions of this Article shall be performed as follows: 
A.  The tax shall be collected insofar as practicable at the same time as, and along with, the charges made in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier. Where the amount paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than the full amount of the charge and tax which was accrued for the billing period, a proportionate share of both the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been paid. In those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of refusal to pay the tax imposed on said charges, Section 32.515 shall apply. 
B.  The duty of a service supplier to collect the tax from a service user shall commence with the beginning of the first regular billing period applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such regular billing are subject to the provisions of this Article. Where a person receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing period. 
(Ord. No. 2250, § 1, 6-4-03)  
Sec. 32.512. - FILING RETURN AND PAYMENT: 
Each person required by this Article to remit a tax shall file a return with the Tax Administrator, on forms approved by the Tax Administrator on or before the due date. The full amount of the tax owed shall be included with the return and filed with the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator is authorized to require such additional information as he or she deems necessary to determine if the tax is being levied, collected and remitted in accordance with this Article. Returns are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. Pursuant to California Revenue and Tax Code Section 7284.6, the Tax Administrator, and its agents, shall maintain such filing returns as confidential information. 
(Ord. No. 2250, § 1, 6-4-03)  
Sec. 32.513. - COLLECTION PENALTIES—SERVICE SUPPLIERS OR SELF-COLLECTORS: 
A.  Taxes collected from a service user, or self-collected by a service user subject to Section 32.505 of this Article, are delinquent if not received by the Tax Administrator on or before the due date. Should the due date occur on a weekend or legal holiday, the return must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the first regular working day following the weekend or legal holiday. A direct deposit, including electronic fund transfers and other similar methods of electronically exchanging monies between financial accounts, made by a service supplier in satisfaction of its obligations under this subsection shall be considered timely if the transfer is initiated on or before the due date, and the transfer settles into the City's account on or before the following business day. 
B.  If a service supplier, or a service user subject to Section 32.505 of this Article, fails to remit any tax collected, on or before the due date, said person shall pay a penalty for such delinquencies at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the total tax that is delinquent in the remittance, and shall pay interest at the rate of three-quarters of one percent (¾%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent, until paid. 
C.  The Tax Administrator shall have the power to impose additional penalties upon persons required to collect and/or remit taxes pursuant to the provisions of this Article for fraud or gross negligence in reporting or remitting at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of the tax collected and/or required to be remitted, or as recomputed by the Tax Administrator. 
D.  For collection purposes only, every penalty imposed and such interest that is accrued under the provisions of this Section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
(Ord. No. 2250, § 1, 6-4-03)  
Sec. 32.514. - DEFICIENCY DETERMINATION AND ASSESSMENT—TAX APPLICATION ERRORS: 
A.  The Tax Administrator shall make a deficiency determination if he or she determines that any person required to collect or self-collect taxes pursuant to the provisions of this Article has failed to collect and remit the proper amount of tax by improperly or failing to apply the tax to one or more taxable services or charges. 
B.  The Tax Administrator shall mail a notice of such deficiency determination to the person required to pay or remit the tax, which notice shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes owed, plus interest at the rate of three-quarters of one percent (¾%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax from the date on which the tax should have been received by the City. 
Within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of service of such notice, the person may request in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the matter. If the person fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time period, the amount of the deficiency determination shall become a final assessment, and shall immediately be due and owing to the City. 
C.  If the person requests a hearing, the Tax Administrator shall cause the matter to be set for hearing, which shall be held within thirty (30) days after receipt of the written request for hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed by the Tax Administrator to such person at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the hearing, and, if the Tax Administrator desires said person to produce specific records at such hearing, such notice may designate the records requested to be produced. 
D.  At the time fixed for the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall hear all relevant testimony and evidence, including that of any other interested parties. At the discretion of the Tax Administrator, the hearing may be continued from time to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of additional evidence. Within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall issue a final assessment (or non-assessment), thereafter, by confirming, modifying or rejecting the original deficiency determination, and shall mail a copy of such final assessment to person owing the tax. The decision of the Tax Administrator may be appealed pursuant to Section 32.520 of this Article. Filing an application with the Tax Administrator and appeal to the City Manager pursuant to Section 32.520 of this Article is a prerequisite to a suit thereon. 
E.  Payment of the final assessment shall become delinquent if not received by the Tax Administrator on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the date of receipt of the notice of final assessment. The penalty for delinquency shall be fifteen percent (15%) on the total amount of the assessment, along with interest at the rate of three-quarters of one percent (¾%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date of delinquency, until paid. The applicable statute of limitations regarding a claim by the City seeking payment of a tax assessed under this Section shall commence from the date of delinquency as provided in this subsection. 
F.  All notices under this Section may be sent by regular mail, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the third (3rd) calendar day following the date of mailing, as established by a proof of mailing. 
(Ord. No. 2250, § 1, 6-4-03)  
Sec. 32.515. - ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY—NONPAYING SERVICE USERS: 
A.  Whenever the Tax Administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or whenever the Tax Administrator deems it in the best interest of the City, he or she may relieve such person of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this Article from certain named service users for specific billing periods. Whenever the service user has failed to pay the amount of tax owed for a period of two (2) or more billing periods, the service supplier shall be relieved of the obligation to collect taxes due. The service supplier shall provide the City with the names and addresses of such service users and the amounts of taxes owed under the provisions of this Article. 
B.  In addition to the tax owed, the service user shall pay a delinquency penalty at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the total tax that is owed, and shall pay interest at the rate of three-quarters of one percent (¾%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the due date, until paid. 
C.  The Tax Administrator shall notify the non-paying service user that the Tax Administrator has assumed the responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes, including penalties and interest. The notice shall be served on the service user by personal delivery or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have a change of address, to his or her last known address. 
D.  If the service user fails to remit the tax to the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days from the date of the service of the notice upon him or her, the Tax Administrator may impose an additional penalty of fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of the total tax that is owed. 
(Ord. No. 2250, § 1, 6-4-03)  
Sec. 32.516. - ACTIONS TO COLLECT: 
Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this Article shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the City. Any such tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the Tax Administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the City by the person required to collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service user. Any person owing money to the City under the provisions of this Article shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount, including penalties and interest as provided for in this Article, along with any collection costs incurred by the City as a result of the person's noncompliance with this Article, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees. 
(Ord. No. 2250, § 1, 6-4-03)  
Sec. 32.517. - ADDITIONAL POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR: 
A.  The Tax Administrator shall have the power and duty, and is hereby directed, to enforce each and all of the provisions of this Article. 
B.  The Tax Administrator may adopt administrative rules and regulations not inconsistent with provisions of this Article for the purpose of interpreting, clarifying, carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the taxes herein imposed. A copy of such administrative rules and regulations shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's office. 
C.  Upon a proper showing of good cause, the Tax Administrator may make administrative agreements, with appropriate conditions, to vary from the strict requirements of this Article and thereby: (1) conform to the billing procedures of a particular service supplier (or service user subject to Section 32.505 of this Article) so long as said agreements result in the collection of the tax in conformance with the general purpose and scope of this Article; or, (2) to avoid a hardship where the administrative costs of collection and remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy of each such agreement shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's office, and are voidable by the Tax Administrator or the City at any time. 
D.  The Tax Administrator may conduct an audit, to ensure proper compliance with the requirements of this Article, of any person required to collect and/or remit a tax pursuant to this Article. The Tax Administrator shall notify said person of the initiation of an audit in writing. In the absence of fraud or other intentional misconduct, the audit period of review shall not exceed a period of three (3) years next preceding the date of receipt of the written notice by said person from the Tax Administrator. Upon completion of the audit, the Tax Administrator may make a deficiency determination pursuant to Section 32.514 of this Article for all taxes, penalties and interest owed and not paid, as evidenced by information provided by such person to the Tax Administrator. If said person is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient records to enable the Tax Administrator to verify compliance with this Article, the Tax Administrator is authorized to make a reasonable estimate of the deficiency. Said reasonable estimate shall be entitled to a rebuttable presumption of correctness. 
E.  Upon receipt of a written request of a taxpayer, and for good cause, the Tax Administrator may extend the time for filing any statement required pursuant to this Article for a period of not to exceed forty-five (45) days, provided that the time for filing the required statement has not already passed when the request is received. No penalty for delinquent payment shall accrue by reason of such extension. Interest shall accrue during said extension at the rate of three-quarters of one percent (¾%) per month, prorated for any portion thereof. 
F.  The Tax Administrator shall determine the eligibility of any person who asserts a right to exemption from, or a refund of, the tax imposed by this Article. 
G.  The Tax Administrator, with the written approval of the City Attorney, may compromise a claim pursuant to this Article where the portion of the claim proposed to be released is less than the amount set by separate resolution of the City Council relating to the settlement of general liability claims against the City and, with the approval of the City Attorney and the City Council, may compromise such a claim where the portion proposed to be released is equal to or greater than the amount set by separate resolution of the City Council relating to the settlement of general liability claims against the City. 
H.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Article to the contrary, the Tax Administrator may waive any penalty or interest imposed upon a person required to collect and/or remit for failure to collect the tax imposed by this Article if the non-collection occurred in good faith. In determining whether the non-collection was in good faith, the Tax Administrator shall take into consideration industry practice or other precedence. 
(Ord. No. 2250, § 1, 6-4-03)  
Sec. 32.518. - RECORDS: 
A.  It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and/or remit to the City any tax imposed by this Article to keep and preserve, for a period of at least three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax that such person may have been liable for the collection of and remittance to the Tax Administrator, which records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect at a reasonable time. 
B.  The City, through its City Council, may issue an administrative subpoena to compel a person to deliver, to the Tax Administrator, copies of all records deemed necessary by the Tax Administrator to establish compliance with this Article, including the delivery of records in a common electronic format on readily available media if such records are kept electronically by the person in the usual and ordinary course of business. As an alternative to delivering the subpoenaed records to the Tax Administrator on or before the due date provided in the administrative subpoena, such person may provide access to such records outside the City on or before the due date, provided that such person shall reimburse the City for all reasonable travel expenses incurred by the City to inspect those records, including travel, lodging, meals, and other similar expenses, but excluding the normal salary or hourly wages of those persons designated by the City to conduct the inspection. 
C.  The Tax Administrator is authorized to execute a non-disclosure agreement approved by the City Attorney to protect the confidentiality of customer information pursuant to California Revenue and Tax Code Sections 7284.6 and 7284.7. The Tax Administrator may request from a person providing transportation or distribution services of gas or electricity to service users within the City, a list of the names, billing and service addresses, quantities of gas or electricity delivered, and other pertinent information, of its transportation customers within the City pursuant to California Public Utilities Code Section 6354(e). 
D.  If a service supplier uses a billing agent or billing aggregator to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax, the service supplier shall: (1) provide to the Tax Administrator the name, address and telephone number of each billing agent and billing aggregator currently authorized by the service supplier to bill, collect, and/or remit the tax to the City; and, (2) upon request of the Tax Administrator, deliver, or effect the delivery of, any information or records in the possession of such billing agent or billing aggregator that, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, is necessary to verify the proper application, calculation, collection and/or remittance of such tax to the City. 
E.  If any person subject to record-keeping under this Section unreasonably denies the Tax Administrator, or the Tax Administrator's designated representative, access to such records, or fails to produce the information requested in an administrative subpoena within the time specified, the Tax Administrator may impose a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) on such person for each day following: (i) the initial date that the person refuses to provide such access; or, (ii) the due date for production of records as set forth in the administrative subpoena. This penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed under this Article. 
(Ord. No. 2250, § 1, 6-4-03)  
Sec. 32.519. - REFUNDS: 
A.  Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid, paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Tax Administrator under this Article, it may be refunded as provided herein and in Article IX of this Chapter. 
B.  A Service Supplier may not file a claim for a refund or credit against taxes collected and remitted unless such Service Supplier establishes in a manner prescribed by the Tax Administrator that (1) the Service Supplier is the person or entity that actually paid the tax to the City; or (2) the amount of the tax sought to be refunded or credited has been refunded by the Service Supplier to the person who paid the tax and the Service Supplier is the person or entity that remitted the tax to the City. 
C.  Notwithstanding other provisions of this Section, whenever a Service Supplier, pursuant to an order of the California Public Utilities Commission, makes a refund to service users of charges for past utility services, the taxes paid pursuant to this Article on the amount of such refunded charges shall also be refunded to service users, and the Service Supplier shall be entitled to claim a credit for such refunded taxes against the amount of tax which is due upon the next monthly return. In the event this Article is repealed, the amounts of any refundable taxes levied under the authority of the repealed ordinance shall be borne by the City.

(Ord. No. 2316, § 1, 11-6-07)  
Sec. 32.606. - BUNDLING TAXABLE ITEMS WITH NON-TAXABLE ITEMS: 
Except as otherwise provided by applicable Federal or State law, if any nontaxable charges are combined with and not separately stated from taxable service charges on the customer bill or invoice of a service supplier, the combined charge is subject to tax unless the service supplier identifies, by reasonable and verifiable standards, the portions of the combined charge that are nontaxable and taxable through the service supplier's books and records kept in the regular course of business, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and not created and maintained for tax purposes. The service supplier has the burden of proving the proper apportionment of taxable and non-taxable charges.

Sec. 32.608. - SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS/MINIMUM CONTACTS: 
For purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax under this Section, "substantial nexus" and "minimum contacts" shall be construed broadly in favor of the imposition, collection and/or remittance of the utility users' tax to the fullest extent permitted by State and Federal law, and as it may change from time to time by judicial interpretation or by statutory enactment.

Where the amount paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than the full amount of the charge and tax which was accrued for the billing period, a proportionate share of both the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been paid. In those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of refusal to pay the tax imposed on said charges, Section 32.612 shall apply. 
2.  The duty of a service supplier to collect the tax from a service user shall commence with the beginning of the first regular billing period applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such regular billing are subject to the provisions of this Section. Where a service user receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing period.

The full amount of the tax collected shall be included with the return and filed with the Tax Administrator.

(Ord. No. 2316, § 1, 11-6-07)  
Sec. 32.611. - ACTIONS TO COLLECT: 
Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this Section shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the City. Any such tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the Tax Administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the City by the person required to collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service user. Any person owing money to the City under the provisions of this Section shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount, including penalties and interest as provided for in this Section, along with any collection costs incurred by the City as a result of the person's noncompliance with this Section, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees.

B.  The Tax Administrator shall mail a notice of such deficiency determination to the person or entity allegedly owing the tax, which notice shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes owed, plus interest at the rate of 75/100 ths (0.75%) percent per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax from the date on which the tax should have been received by the City.

A.  Whenever the Tax Administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or whenever the Tax Administrator deems it in the best interest of the City, he or she may relieve such person of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this Section from certain named service users' for specific billing periods. To the extent the service user has failed to pay the amount of tax owed for a period of two (2) or more billing periods, the service supplier shall be relieved of the obligation to collect taxes due. The service supplier shall provide the City with the names and addresses of such service users' and the amounts of taxes owed under the provisions of this Section. Nothing herein shall require that the Tax Administrator institute proceedings under this Section if, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, the cost of collection or enforcement likely outweighs the tax benefit. 
B.  In addition to the tax owed, the service user shall pay a delinquency penalty at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the total tax that is owed, and shall pay interest at the rate of 75/100 ths (0.75%) percent per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the due date, until paid. 
C.

The notice shall be served on the service user by personal delivery or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have a change of address, to his or her last known address. 
D.  If the service user fails to remit the tax to the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days from the date of the service of the notice upon him or her, the Tax Administrator may impose an additional penalty of fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of the total tax that is owed.

Sec. 32.614. - ADDITIONAL POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR: 
A.  The Tax Administrator shall have the power and duty, and is hereby directed, to enforce each and all of the provisions of this Section. 
B.  The Tax Administrator may adopt administrative rules and regulations consistent with provisions of this Section for the purpose of interpreting, clarifying, carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the taxes herein imposed. The administrative ruling shall not impose a new tax, revise an existing tax methodology as stated in this Section, or increase an existing tax, except as allowed by California Government Code Section 53750(h)(2). A copy of such administrative rules and regulations shall be on file in the Tax Administrator's office. 
C.

Section 6. Apportionment, Levy and Selection of Special Tax Rates 
A Special Tax rate per Developed Commercial Square Foot or Approved Commercial Square Foot allocable to each Taxable Parcel in the CFD shall be established annually by the City Council.

Step 3 	The amount of Debt Service due in such Fiscal Year payable from Annual Tax Revenues collected in the prior Fiscal Year shall be determined. 
Step 4 	The amounts calculated in steps 1 and 3 above shall be added together and the amount determined in step 2 above shall be subtracted from such sum to arrive at the Annual Tax Revenues to be collected in such Fiscal Year. 
Step 5 	The Maximum Annual Special Tax Rate (or rates, as the case may be) applicable to each Taxable Parcel shall be multiplied by the taxable commercial square feet corresponding to such rate(s). 
Step 6 	If the total of the amounts calculated in Step 5 is greater than the Annual Costs, all Special Tax rates shall be decreased by equal proportions of the applicable Maximum Annual Special Tax Rates until the Special Tax rates on all Taxable Parcels produces scheduled Annual Tax Revenue equal to the projected Annual Costs. 
Step 7 	An annual Special Tax shall be determined for each Taxable Parcel by multiplying the Special Tax rate(s) identified in Step 6 above times the number of commercial square feet taxable at such Special Tax rate(s) on each such Taxable Parcel. 
 
After each Parcel has been annually classified, the annual Special Tax and Principal Prepayment Amount for each Taxable Parcel has been calculated, and a Special Tax Report for such Fiscal Year has been approved by resolution of the City Council in July of each Fiscal Year, the City Manager shall forward a Tax Collection Schedule showing the annual Special Tax liability for each Taxable Parcel to the County Auditor, requesting that the Tax Collection Schedule be placed on the secured property tax roll for the applicable Fiscal Year. The Tax Collection Schedule shall be sent not later than August 10 or such other date required by the County Auditor for such placement. 
The City shall make every effort to correctly assign the Special Tax rates and calculate the annual Special Tax liability for each Taxable Parcel and the annual Principal Prepayment Amount for each Taxable Parcel. It shall be the burden of the taxpayer to correct any errors in the determination and classification of the Parcels subject to the Special Tax and their respective Special Tax and Principal Prepayment Amount liabilities. 
Section 7. Prepayment of Special Taxes 
Prepayment Prior to the Initial Sale of Bonds. Prior to the sale of bonds secured by the Special Taxes, the owner of each Taxable Parcel shall have the option to prepay future Special Taxes to be levied against such Taxable Parcel with a single cash payment. The amount of such optional cash payment shall be determined as follows: 
Step 1 	Prior to the sale of bonds, the total number of Developed Commercial Square Feet and Approved Commercial Square Feet allocable to all Taxable Parcels in the CFD shall be determined as of the applicable Classification Date. 
Step 2 	The maximum approved bonded indebtedness of the CFD as specified in Resolution No. 13610 adopted on April 26, 1999 shall be determined. From such amount shall be deducted the following bond financing costs: the projected cost of financing bond debt service reserve funds, interest projected to be capitalized from the proceeds of bonds, and any projected underwriter's discount and bond insurance premiums, all as identified in the revised Report caused to be prepared by the City Manager in connection with the formation of the CFD as required under Sections 53321.5 and 53325 of the Act. All other budgeted costs of creating the CFD and issuing bonds approved by the City shall be included as project costs. 
Step 3 	The net amount determined in step 2 above shall be divided by the total Net Taxable Commercial Square Feet determined in step 1 above. 
Step 4 	The quotient resulting from step 3 above shall, for each Taxable Parcel, be multiplied by the total number of Developed Commercial Square Feet and Approved Commercial Square Feet allocable to each such Taxable Parcel. The product of such multiplication shall be the optional cash payment amount assigned to each such Taxable Parcel. 
 
Notice shall be given by mail to each owner of Taxable Parcels within the CFD of a 30-day period prior to the initial sale of bonds within which cash payments may be made. Only cash payments in whole may be accepted in lieu of the payment of annual Special Taxes. Parcels for which the prepayment of Special Taxes in whole has been made shall be reclassified as Prepaid Parcels and shall no longer be subject to the levy of Special Taxes. 
Prepayment Subsequent to the Initial Sale of Bonds. The owner of any Taxable Parcel may prepay the Special Taxes to be levied against such Parcel through the term to maturity of outstanding bonds and authorized but unissued bonds. Special Taxes may not be prepaid in part. Optional prepayment amounts for each Taxable Parcel subsequent to the sale of bonds shall be determined annually for each Fiscal Year at the same time annual Special Taxes are determined as follows. 
Step 1 	The total number of Developed Commercial Square Feet and Approved Commercial Square Feet allocable to Taxable Parcels in the CFD as of the Classification Date for such Fiscal Year shall be determined. 
Step 2 	The total amount of unpaid bond principal outstanding at the beginning of each Fiscal Year plus authorized and unissued bond principal shall be determined, from which amount shall be subtracted any principal coming due in such Fiscal Year, the payment of which was provided for in the collection of the prior Fiscal Year's Annual Tax Revenues. 
Step 3 	The net amount determined in step 2 above shall be divided by the total Net Taxable Square Feet for such Fiscal Year as determined in step 1 above to arrive at the unpaid authorized bond principal per Net Taxable Square Foot for such Fiscal Year. 
Step 4 	For each Taxable Parcel, the unpaid authorized bond principal per Net Taxable Square Foot for such Fiscal Year as determined in step 3 above shall be multiplied by the total number of Net Taxable Square Feet allocable to such Taxable Parcel to arrive at the Principal Prepayment Amount allocable to each such Taxable Parcel. 
 
In each Fiscal Year, the owner of a Taxable Parcel may prepay the future Special Tax obligations of such Parcel by paying in cash the sum of i) the amount of any delinquent and unpaid installments of Special Taxes levied against such Parcel, together with any penalties, interest and costs due thereon, ii) the Special Taxes levied against such Parcel in such Fiscal Year, iii) the Principal Prepayment Amount allocable to such Taxable Parcel in such Fiscal Year, iv) a prepayment premium in an amount equal to the prepayment premium required under the fiscal agent agreement to be paid on outstanding bonds to be called on the next permissible call date times the ratio that such Parcel's number of taxable commercial square feet bears to the total taxable commercial square feet in such Fiscal Year times the unpaid bond principal outstanding at the beginning of such Fiscal Year, v) a reasonable fee, fixed by the City, for the cost of administering the prepayment and the advance redemption of bonds, and vi) a credit for such Taxable Parcel's pro rata share of the reserve fund balance (if any) established under the fiscal agent agreement. 
Section 8. Application of Surplus Tax Revenues 
Any amounts collected in excess of Annual Costs shall be applied as stipulated in the fiscal agent agreement securing outstanding bonds of the CFD. 
Section 9. Administrative Changes 
The City Manager has the authority to make necessary administrative adjustments to the Rate and Method of Apportionment in order to remedy any portions of this Rate and Method of Apportionment that require clarification, provided that no such adjustment shall result in a tax levy on any Taxable Parcel in excess of the applicable Maximum Annual Special Tax Rate for such Taxable Parcel. 
Any taxpayer that believes that the amount or formula of the Special Tax is in error may file a written notice with the City Manager appealing the Special Tax. Any such notice of appeal must be filed by January 1 of the fiscal year for which the Special Tax in question has been levied. The City Manager or his designee will then promptly review all such timely-filed appeals, and if necessary, meet with the appellant. If the findings of the City Manager verify that the Special Tax should be modified, a recommendation at that time will be made to the City Council and, as appropriate, the Special Tax shall be corrected and, if applicable, a refund shall be granted from such fund or account established under the fiscal agent agreement securing outstanding bonds of the CFD for which the payment of such refunds is authorized. The City Manager, in his sole discretion, may review appeals filed after the January 1 deadline, regardless of the merit of any such appeals. Under no circumstances will the City be obligated to grant refunds for a fiscal year extending beyond the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which an appeal was filed. 
Interpretations may be made by resolution of the City Council for purposes of clarifying any vagueness or ambiguity as it relates to the Special Tax or the Maximum Annual Special Tax Rates, the method of apportionment, the classification of properties, or any definition applicable to the CFD.

The Commission need not disapprove an application for a permit to carry out any proposed work in a historic district, or on a historic landmark or a historic site, if the applicant presents clear and convincing evidence of facts demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Commission that such disapproval will work immediate and substantial hardship on the applicant because of conditions peculiar to the person seeking to carry out the proposed work, whether this be the property owner, tenant, or resident, or because of conditions peculiar to the particular improvement, building, or structure or other feature involved, and that failure to disapprove the application will be consistent with the purposes of this Chapter. In determining whether extreme hardship exists, the Commission shall consider, among others, the following criteria: 
A.  Whether denial of the applicant will diminish the value of the subject property so as to leave substantially no value. 
B.  Whether reasonable utilization of the property is prohibited or impractical. 
If a hardship is found to exist under this Section, the Commission shall make a written finding to that effect, and shall specify the facts and reasons relied upon in making such finding. Such finding may be appealed to the City Council pursuant to the provisions of Section 40.11. 
(Ord. No. 1815, § 1, 3-10-80; Ord. No. 1923, § 9, 1-6-86)  
Sec. 40.16. - RETROACTIVE APPLICATION: 
The provisions of this Chapter shall be inapplicable to the construction, alteration, demolition or removal of any structure or other feature on a designated historic landmark or historic site or within a designated historic district, where a permit for the performance of such work was issued prior to initiation of proceedings for such designation, and where such permit has not expired or been cancelled or revoked, provided that construction is started and diligently prosecuted to completion in accordance with the City Building Code.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 
 
Sec. 41.1. - TITLE: 
This Chapter shall be known as the "Floodplain Management Ordinance of the City of Redwood City." 
(Ord. No. 2277, § 1, 1-10-2005)  
Sec. 41.2. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION: 
The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560 and 65800 conferred upon local government authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Redwood City does hereby adopt the following floodplain management ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2277, § 1, 1-10-2005)  
Sec. 41.3. - FINDINGS OF FACT: 
A.  The flood hazard areas of Redwood City are subject to periodic inundation which results in the loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increases flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. No. 2277, § 1, 1-10-2005)  
Sec. 41.4. - STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: 
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize the expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
G.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 2277, § 1, 1-10-2005)  
Sec. 41.5. - METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES: 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this Chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
A.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
D.  Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 2277, § 1, 1-10-2005)  
ARTICLE II. - DEFINITIONS

A breakaway wall shall have a safe design-loading resistance of not less than ten (10) and no more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions: 
A.  Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and 
B.  The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood. 
BUILDING: See "structure." 
COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREA: Means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. It is an area subject to high velocity waters, including coastal and tidal inundations or tsunamis. The area is designated on a flood insurance rate map (FIRM) as Zone V1-V30, VE or V. 
DEVELOPMENT: Means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.

LOWEST FLOOR: Means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "basement" definition). 
A.  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable nonelevation design requirements as included in this Chapter and includes, but is not limited to: 
1.  Wet floodproofing; 
2.  Anchoring; 
3.  Standard construction materials and methods; 
4.  Standards for utilities. 
B.  For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
MANUFACTURED HOME: Means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or SUBDIVISION: Means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for sale or rent. 
MARKET VALUE: Shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting the cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the Floodplain Administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence.

Sec. 41.15. - DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR: 
The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
A.  Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine that: 
1.  Permit requirements of this Chapter have been satisfied; 
2.  All other required State and Federal permits have been obtained; 
3.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and 
4.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this Chapter, "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point. 
5.  All Letters of Map Revision (LOMR's) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building Permits must not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
B.  Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 41.8, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal or State Agency, or other source, in order to administer Article V. Any such information shall be submitted to the City Council for adoption. 
C.  Notification of Other Agencies. In alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
1.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
2.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
3.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
D.  Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
1.  Certification required by Section 41.18(C)(1) (lowest floor elevations). 
2.  Certification required by Section 41.18(C)(2) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures). 
3.  Certification of elevation required by Section 41.18(C)(3) (wet floodproofing standard). 
4.  Certification of elevation required by Section 41.20 (subdivision standards). 
5.  Certification required by Section 41.23 (floodway encroachments). 
6.  Information required by Section 41.24(F) (coastal construction standards). 
7.  Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
E.  Map Determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard. Where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, grade and base flood elevations shall be used to determine the boundaries of the special flood hazard area. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Article V. 
F.  Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this Chapter as specified in Section 41.9. 
G.  Base Flood Elevation Changes Due to Physical Alterations. Submit or assure that, within six (6) months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the permit applicant submits technical and/or scientific data to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to issuance of permits. Permits will not be issued based on Conditional LOMRs. Approved Conditional LOMRs allow for construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
H.  Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Procedures. 
1.  Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "Market Value." 
2.  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff.

(Ord. No. 2410, § 10, 1-26-15)  
Sec. 41.23. - FLOODWAYS: 
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 41.8, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B.  If subsection A of this Section is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article III. 
(Ord. No. 2277, § 1, 1-10-2005) 
(Ord. No. 2410, § 11, 1-26-15)

The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable State or local building standards. 
B.  All new construction and other development shall be located on the landward side of the reach of mean high tide. 
C.  All new construction and substantial improvement shall have the space below the lowest floor free of obstructions or constructed with breakaway walls as defined in Article II of this Chapter. Such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation and will be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. 
D.  Fill shall not be used for structural support of buildings. 
E.  Manmade alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage is prohibited. 
F.  The Floodplain Administrator shall obtain and maintain the following records: 
1.  Certification by a registered engineer or architect that a proposed structure complies with subsection A of this Section;

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2410, § 12, adopted January 26, 2015, renumbered art. VI, § 41.22 as art. IV, § 41.24.  
Sec. 41.25. - NATURE OF VARIANCES: 
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. The variance criteria set forth in this Article VI are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to specific parcels of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this Chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or to surrounding properties. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristics must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants or the property owners. 
It is the responsibility of the City Council to help protect its citizens from flooding. The need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this Chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2410, § 13, adopted January 26, 2015, renumbered art. VI, § 41.23 as art. IV, § 41.25.  
Sec. 41.26. - APPEAL BOARD: 
In passing upon requests for variances, the City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this Chapter, and the: 
A.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
B.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
C.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
D.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
E.  Necessity to the facility of waterfront location, where applicable; 
F.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
G.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
H.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
I.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
J.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of floodwaters expected at the site; and 
K.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.

Sec. 41.27. - CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES: 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Articles IV and V of this Chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (½) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Article II of this Chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this Chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this Chapter. 
E.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the Administrator that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and 
2.  Such construction below the base flood level increases the risk to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the San Mateo County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affect parcel of land. 
F.  The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
G.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
1.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in "exceptional hardship" (as defined in Article II of this Chapter) to the applicant; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Article II, "Public Safety and Nuisance") cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Article II) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
H.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections A through E of this Section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
I.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 41.26(A) and for the purposes of this Chapter, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Chapter.

CHAPTER 42 - RELOCATION ASSISTANCE[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2450, § 1, adopted July 23, 2018, repealed ch. 42, §§ 42.1—42.10, in its entirety; and enacted a new ch. 42 to read as set out herein. Former ch. 42 pertained to "Residential Relocation Benefits," and was derived from Ord. No. 2048, § 1, adopted May 11, 1992 and Ord. No. 2374, § 37, adopted January 9, 2012. 
 
Sec. 42.1. - SHORT TITLE, AUTHORITY, AND APPLICABILITY: 
A.  This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Relocation Assistance Ordinance." 
B.  The requirements established pursuant to this Chapter are adopted under the authority of California Constitution Article XI, Section 7, which provides: "A county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws," and in accordance with the purpose set forth in the ordinance codified in this Chapter. 
C.  This Chapter shall apply to the extent permitted by the statutes and laws of the State of California. 
(Ord. No. 2450, § 1, 7-23-18)  
Sec. 42.2. - PURPOSE: 
The primary purpose for relocation assistance is to minimize disruption to tenants and their families caused by a need for relocation by addressing financial impacts. Securing replacement housing generally requires a significant amount of money for expenses related to a physical move, such as first and last month's rent and security deposits. Projects assisted with Federal and State funds are subject to requirements to provide relocation assistance to households displaced by those projects. There is currently no state mandate for landlords to assist displaced tenants by compensating for relocation costs. While an unanticipated move may be challenging for any tenant, it is especially difficult for extremely low, very low and low income households. 
(Ord. No. 2450, § 1, 7-23-18)  
Sec. 42.3. - DEFINITIONS: 
The following words and terms as used in this Chapter shall have the meaning respectively ascribed thereto: 
A.  Application. Any application required to be submitted to the City for discretionary or ministerial approval of a land use change or improvement of real property that will result in a permanent displacement of a residential household. 
B.  Displace or Displacement. The vacating of one (1) or more rental units on properties with five (5) or more units by residential households upon notice from the landlord as the result of or to enable any of the following: 
1.  The landlord seeks to withdraw all rental housing units from the rental housing market as provided in Government Code Section 7060, et seq.; 
2.  The landlord seeks to recover possession to demolish or otherwise remove a residential rental housing unit from residential rental housing use after having obtained all proper permits from the City, if any such permits are required; 
3.  The landlord seeks to recover possession to remodel, renovate or rehabilitate the unit(s) resulting in permanent displacement of tenants; 
4.  The landlord seeks the conversion of a building into a condominium, community apartment or stock cooperative, as those terms are defined in California Government Code and Business and Professions Code; or 
5.  A change of use of real property from a residential use to a nonresidential use that requires a permit from the City. 
C.  For the purposes of this Chapter, a displacement does not include a vacation of a rental unit as the result of the following: 
1.  A conversion of any portion of a mobile home park regulated and processed pursuant to Chapter 28; 
2.  A landlord's compliance with an enforcement order of the City chief building official for which the property owner has been ordered to pay relocation expenses pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 17975, et seq., or any other state or federal law; 
3.  The residential household is required to vacate the rental unit due solely to damage resulting from an earthquake, fire, flood, natural disaster, civil disturbance, or accident outside the control of the landlord; or 
4.  Temporary displacement where tenants have been provided with alternative housing on site or nearby provided that such displacement shall be for a period of no more than one (1) year. 
5.  Expiration of a lease that was not extended by the operation of Civil Code Section 1945. 
D.  Eligible residential household. A displaced residential household whose annual household income does not exceed eighty (80) percent of the area median household income for San Mateo County as adjusted for household size according to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, as may be adjusted from time to time, and whose rental payments to the landlord remain current through the date of displacement. The presumption of eligibility specified in the preceding sentence shall not apply where the landlord provides evidence of any of the following circumstances: 
1.  The residential household's occupancy ended due to the expiration of a term lease or termination of a month to month rental agreement and the tenancy was not extended by the operation of Civil Code Section 1945; or 
2.  The residential household (a) is in the process of being evicted pursuant to the terms of the rental agreement for failure to pay rent or other breach of the rental agreement; or (b) has been found guilty of unlawful detainer pursuant to Subdivisions 2, 3, 4 or 5 of Section 1161 of the Code of Civil Procedure as evidenced by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction; or (c) has entered into a stipulated agreement in an unlawful detainer action which requires vacation of the premises; or 
3.  The residential household received written notice, prior to entering into a written or oral agreement to become a tenant, that an application to convert their rental unit to another use was on file with the City or had already been approved and would result in their displacement. 
E.  Landlord. An owner, lessor or sublessor of property (including any person, firm, corporation or other entity) who receives or is entitled to receive rent for the use of any rental unit, or the agent, representative or successor of any of the foregoing. 
F.  Lease. Any form of rental agreement, whether written or oral.

B.  The public health, safety, welfare, and convenience require that, in connection with the use, maintenance and placement of newsracks, interference with vehicular, bicycle, wheelchair, or pedestrian traffic must be avoided, obstruction of sight distance and views of traffic signs and crosswalks must be eliminated, damage done to sidewalks or streets must be minimized and repaired, good appearance of the public streets and grounds must be maintained, trees and other landscaping must be allowed to grow without disturbance, access to emergency and other public facilities must be maintained, and ingress and egress from properties adjoining the public rights-of-way must be protected; 
C.  The placement and maintenance of newsracks on or within public rights-of-way are historically associated with the sale and distribution of newspapers, periodicals, and other publications and that such use shall not be denied;

(Ord. No. 2225, § 1, 5-6-2002)  
CHAPTER 45: - PUBLIC ART 
 
Sec. 45.010. - FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
The City Council finds and declares the following: (a) public art is a valuable means of promoting vibrancy, defining cultural uniqueness, building community, and improving the quality of life in the City; (b) the environment, image, and character of the City would be improved by public art; (c) public art helps make cities more livable and more visually stimulating; (d) the presence of and access to public art enlivens the public areas of buildings and their grounds and makes them more welcoming; (d) public art can illuminate the diversity and history of a community, create/nurture/promote positive community interactions and conversation, and foster the economic development of the community. 
To realize these benefits of public art, the City Council believes that the Art in Public Places Fund established in Section 2.38 of this Code should be used to fund art in public places within the City. In providing for funding for art in public places, it is not the intent of the City to establish a designated public forum. Art receiving funding from the Art in Public Places Fund shall communicate the City's own messages and themes, including but not limited to, encouraging and promoting awareness of the City's ethnic, social and cultural diversity; showcasing historic heritage; enlivening an area; inspiring creativity; and reflecting a sense of community. 
The City Council also finds that the environment, image, and character of the City would be improved by art and that the impacts associated with new development projects would be offset, in part, by provision of art in compliance with this chapter. To ensure that public art is present and sustained throughout the community, this Chapter requires the inclusion of art in commercial developments over a certain size. 
(Ord. No. 2424, § 2, 6-27-16)

Sec. 45.050. - APPROVAL PROCESS FOR ART FUNDED BY THE ART IN PUBLIC PLACES FUND. 
Recognizing that professional expertise is desirable in artistic matters, such as the selection of artists for a project, the selection of particular works of art, and the approval of designs and plans for works of art, the City Council declares that: 
A.  With respect to art funded by the Art in Public Places Fund, initial decisions on artistic matters will, as a matter of course, be made by City staff, and the Arts Commission. The City Council will refer questions, suggestions, requests, complaints, and similar items pertaining to the art in public places program to appropriate City staff and/or the Arts Commission for their review and response. 
B.  The Arts Commission shall review any proposed art work to be funded by the Art in Public Places Fund. Such review will include any sketches, designs, photographs, precise plans, art examples, and similar items. Following its review of any proposed art, the Arts Commission shall submit a written recommendation to the City Council regarding whether such art should be acquired and/or installed. The Arts Commission shall also review and make recommendations concerning other legitimate expenditures from the Art in Public Places Fund. 
C.  After receiving the recommendation of the Arts Commission, the City Council shall approve or disapprove the acquisition and/or installation of any proposed art. The City Council shall also approve or disapprove other legitimate expenditures from the Art in Public Places Fund. If City Council approves an installation, it shall determine the duration of such installation, provided however, that the City Council may delegate the right to extend the duration of any installation to the City Manager (or designee). The previous sentence notwithstanding, no permanent installation of art in public places shall be removed, altered, or changed without the prior review and advice of the Arts Commission and the approval of the City Council.

Sec. 45.060. - STANDARDS FOR REVIEW. 
In evaluating proposed art in public places to be funded by the Art in Public Places Fund, the Arts Commission and City Council shall give special attention to the following: 
A.  The artist is required to have experience in and/or knowledge of the type of art proposed for installation and public viewing. The artist's qualifications will be evaluated and examples of past work may be reviewed to determine whether or not the artist has appropriate experience for the project; 
B.  Appropriate locations may include, but are not limited to, vehicular entryways to the property, plazas, greenbelts and building façades. The location selected should allow reasonable accessibility to the art. The location shall be exterior and installation of the art piece shall enhance the art and allow for unobstructed public viewing from as many angles as possible; 
C.  The art shall be proportional to the scale of the development and designed to create an artistic, visual, and aesthetic impact upon observers. Particularly in locations on major thoroughfares and major intersections, the art should be of such size and nature as to strengthen the urban design and aesthetic quality of life in the community; 
D.  The art shall be conceptually compatible with the immediate environment of the site; appropriate to the function of the site; and compatible within any unified design character or historical character of the site; 
E.  Appropriateness of the materials, textures, colors, and design to the expression of the design concept; 
F.  Representation of a broad variety of tastes within the community and the provision of a balanced inventory of art in public places to insure a variety of style, design, and media throughout the community that will be representative of the eclectic tastes of the community; and

Except as provided in this Section, all capital projects shall be subject to this policy, including but not limited to buildings, shelters, parking garages and lots, restrooms, small structures, parks, medians, landscaping, plazas, gateways, bridges, walls, tunnels, waterways, and street and road construction. Salaries and benefits of public employees supporting capital projects shall not be included in the capital outlay fund budget subject to this ordinance. 
The following capital projects are excluded from this policy: 
1.  ADA compliance projects (not including projects where ADA compliance is a portion of a larger project). 
2.  Road, path and sidewalk repairs, including: traffic signals and upgrades, curb and gutter repairs, sign reflectivity, road and parking signage, resurfacing of roads or other existing hardscape areas.

Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the City Council from adopting an ordinance or resolution establishing a public art contribution for any project otherwise excluded from this policy or setting the public art contribution for any project at greater than one (1) percent of the Capital Outlay Fund budget. 
C.  The City Manager or designee, in consultation with the Arts Commission, as appropriate, shall determine public or publicly-accessible sites for art funded by the one (1) percent for art policy. Funds may be expended on public art at any appropriate site within the City pursuant to the approval procedures set forth in Section 45.050 above. Funds from two (2) or more capital projects may be pooled to fund a single work of art. Funds may be used for permanent or temporary public art. 
D.  City staff may use reasonable efforts to obtain appropriate approvals from any funding source for any capital improvement project to allow use of one (1) percent of such funds for the acquisition of public art as provided in this title. Such efforts may include, without limitation, identifying public art in grant applications for capital improvement projects, efforts to include expenditures for public art in developer funded infrastructure projects, and efforts to include public art in developer-constructed infrastructure and public facilities. 
E.  If the terms of a contract, federal or state grant, law, rule or regulation prohibit or restrict the collection or use of funds in connection with a city capital improvement project for expenditures upon public art, or if the eligible uses of the funding are limited and specified and do not include public art, then the amount equal to one (1) percent of the funding from such source shall be subtracted from the one (1) percent total allocated from the Capital Outlay Fund to the Art in Public Places Fund, so as to exclude from the Art in Public Places Fund any funds that are so prohibited or restricted. For example and without limitation, the one (1) percent total allocated from the Capital Outlay Fund to the Art in Public Places Fund shall not include any money collected by the City as a Mitigation Fee on private development subject to the Mitigation Fee Act (Government Code Section 66000 et seq.).

Development projects to the extent they have received a vested right to proceed without providing on-site art pursuant to state law, including those that are the subject of development agreements currently in effect with the City, if such development agreements were approved prior to the effective date of this Section 45.090 and where such agreements expressly preclude the City from requiring compliance with this Section 45.090. 
12.  Development projects for which applications have been deemed complete prior to the effective date of this Section 45.090. 
(Ord. No. 2424, § 2, 6-27-16)  
Sec. 45.100. - SUBMITTAL OF LETTER OF INTENT. 
Prior to the development application being deemed complete, an applicant must submit a letter of intent stating whether they intend to comply with Section 45.090 by (a) providing publicly visible art on-site; (b) paying the in-lieu fee; or (c) providing publicly visible art on-site in combination with paying an in-lieu fee. This letter shall indicate the proposed locations of any publicly visible art on-site, and such locations shall be included in the project plans. 
(Ord. No. 2424, § 2, 6-27-16)  
Sec. 45.110. - PUBLIC ART PERMIT APPLICATION.

The Director shall then submit the completed application and approval recommendation to the Arts Commission. 
C.  Commission Recommendation. The Arts Commission shall recommend approval or denial to the City Manager (or designee), based on the following factors: 
1.  The budget for the proposed publicly visible art ensures that only eligible expenditures pursuant to Section 45.090 are proposed and that such expenditures (including any in-lieu fee paid) total the amount of the public art contribution; 
2.  The proposed publicly visible art, its installation and maintenance is consistent with the standards and the purpose of this chapter, and with the criteria set forth in Sections 45.060(A) through 45.060(D); 
3.  Artistic Preference. The determination of artistic preferences is a function of the owner or developer of the property. It is the intent of this Chapter to provide for the public display of private art on private property without substituting the artistic preferences of the City for those of the owner or developer of the property. In reviewing a public art permit, the Arts Commission shall not consider the artistic preferences of the developer other than as explicitly set forth herein. The Arts Commission may not rule upon artistic content when considering the plans. All financial arrangements related to the publicly visible art are negotiated between the artist and the developer as contracting parties and shall be verified by a written agreement. 
D.  City Manager Approval. Upon receiving recommendation from the Arts Commission, the City Manager (or designee) shall approve, deny, or approve with conditions the application. The decision of the City Manager (or designee) shall be based on the same factors described in Section 45.110(C) above.

(Ord. No. 2424, § 2, 6-27-16; Ord. No. 2459, § 5, 5-6-19)  
Sec. 45.120. - INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS. 
A.  Timing of Installation. Issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a development project providing publicly visible art pursuant to Section 45.090 will be conditioned on completion and full installation of the publicly visible art at the development site in accordance with the public art permit approved by the City, and confirmation by the City that the developer expended the publicly visible art contribution in full on the publicly visible art and in accordance with this Chapter. However, if art installation is impracticable prior to the anticipated date of building occupancy, the City may allow building occupancy provided that the public art permit has been issued and the applicant has filed with the city adequate security to guarantee installation of the art. The security may take the form of a cash deposit along with an agreement to install the required publicly visible art in such amount and form as is acceptable to the City within a date certain or, if the publicly visible art is not installed by such date, the cash deposit shall be immediately transferred into the Art in Public Places Fund. 
B.  Permanence. The publicly visible art shall be a permanent, fixed asset to the property. The composition of the art shall be of permanent materials requiring a low level of maintenance. Materials used shall be durable and weather resistant. 
C.  Maintenance. The developer and subsequently the property owner shall continuously maintain the publicly visible art in good condition after its installation for the life of the project, and shall perform necessary repairs and maintenance to the satisfaction of the City. Maintenance of the art includes related landscaping, lighting and the identification plaque. The repair and maintenance obligations of the property owner shall be contained in a covenant and recorded against the property and shall run with the property. 
D.  Plaque Required. Each piece of publicly visible art shall provide an appropriate identification plaque or monument measuring at least eight (8) inches by eight (8) inches. The plaque shall be made of cast metal and be placed near the art piece. Information is limited to the date, title and artist. The requirement of this Section 45.120(D) may be waived by the City if determined in a particular circumstance to be unnecessary or inconsistent with the intent of this chapter. 
E.  Removal. Removal of required publicly visible art is prohibited without the City's approval. The City may require replacement of the art as a condition of approval for its removal. Any removal, relocation, or replacement of the publicly visible art must be consistent with the California Preservation of Works of Art Act and the Federal Visual Artists' Rights Act and any other relevant law. Developer or owner shall execute a restrictive covenant in a form acceptable to the City Attorney enforceable by the City, which shall be recorded against the project site and shall run with the land for a period of time equal to the life of the project. 
(Ord. No. 2424, § 2, 6-27-16)  
Sec. 45.130. - VIOLATIONS. 
In addition to assessing fines, penalties or administrative citations provided by state or municipal law for violation of this Chapter, the City may revoke or suspend any permit granted to any developer and/or owner who violates the provisions of this Chapter. The violation of the construction and maintenance obligations of this Chapter is hereby declared to be a public nuisance which may be abated as provided by law.

Employer shall mean any person, including corporate officers or executives, as defined in Sec. 18 of the California Labor Code, who directly or indirectly through any other person, including through the services of a temporary employment agency, staffing agency, or similar entity, employs or exercises control over the wages, hours, or working conditions of any employee and who is either subject to the City's business license requirements or maintains a business facility in the City. 
d.  Learner shall mean an employee who is a Learner as defined by California Welfare Commission Order No. 4-2001. 
e.  Minimum Wage shall mean the minimum wage set forth in Section 46.030 of this Chapter.

Sec. 46.030. - MINIMUM WAGE: 
a.  Employers shall pay Employees no less than the minimum wage set forth in this Chapter for each hour worked within the geographic boundaries of the City. 
b.  On January 1, 2019, the Minimum Wage shall be an hourly rate of thirteen dollars and fifty cents ($13.50). On January 1, 2020, the Minimum Wage shall be an hourly rate of fifteen dollars ($15.00) plus an amount corresponding to the prior year's increase, if any, in the cost of living. (For example, if the cost of living increases by five percent (5%) in the prior year, then on January 1, 2020, the Minimum Wage will be $15.00 + ($15.00 x .05), or $15.75.) To prevent inflation from eroding its value, beginning on January 1, 2021, and each year thereafter, the Minimum Wage shall increase by an amount corresponding to the prior year's increase, if any, in the cost of living. The increase in the cost of living for any year shall be measured by the percentage increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index for San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose (or its successor index) as published by the U.S. Department of Labor or its successor agency (CPI). The increase shall be calculated by using the August to August change in the CPI. A decrease in the CPI shall not result in a decrease in the Minimum Wage. 
c.  An Employee who is a Learner shall be paid no less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the applicable Minimum Wage for the first one hundred sixty (160) hours of employment. Thereafter, the Employee shall be paid the applicable Minimum Wage. 
d.  An Employer may not deduct an amount from wages due an Employee on account of any tip or gratuity, or credit the amount or any part thereof, of a tip or gratuity, against, or as part of, the wages due the Employee from the Employer. 
e.  No Employer may fund increases in compensation required by this Chapter, nor otherwise respond to the requirements of this Chapter, by reducing the wage rate paid to any Employee, nor by increasing charges to them for parking, meals, uniforms or other items, nor by reducing the citation or other non-wage benefits of any such Employee, nor by increasing the share any Employee pays towards her/his benefits, except to the extent such prohibition would be pre-empted by the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act. 
f.  A violation for unlawfully failing to pay the Minimum Wage shall be deemed to continue from the date immediately following the date that the wages were due and payable as provided in Part 1 (commencing with Section 200) of Division 2 of the California Labor Code, to the date immediately preceding the date the wages are paid in full. 
(Ord. No. 2443, § 6, 4-9-18)  
Sec. 46.040. - EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS: 
a.  State, federal, and county agencies, including school districts, shall not be required to pay minimum wage when the work performed is related to their governmental function. However, for work that is not related to their governmental function, including, but not limited to: booster or gift shops, non-K-12 cafeterias, on-site concessions and similar operations, minimum wage shall be required to be paid. Minimum wage shall also be required to be paid by lessees or renters of facilities or space from an exempt organization. 
b.  Any organization claiming "auxiliary organization" status under California Education Code Sec. 89901 or Sec. 72670(c) shall not be required to pay minimum wage. The organization, upon request of the City, shall provide documentary proof of its auxiliary organization status. 
(Ord. No. 2443, § 6, 4-9-18)  
Sec. 46.050. - WAIVER THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING: 
All or any portion of the applicable requirements of this Chapter may be waived in a bona fide collective bargaining agreement, provided that such waiver is explicitly set forth in such agreement in clear and unambiguous terms and provided that the waiver may not be applied retroactively. The waiver allowed by this provision does not apply to Employees in the property services industry (e.g. janitors, landscapers, groundskeepers, and security guards). 
(Ord. No. 2443, § 6, 4-9-18)  
Sec. 46.060. - NOTICE, POSTING AND PAYROLL RECORDS: 
a.  By November 1 of each year, the City shall publish and make available to Employers a bulletin announcing the adjusted Minimum Wage rate for the upcoming year, which shall take effect on January 1 of each year. In conjunction with this bulletin, the City shall, by November 1 of each year, publish and make available to Employers a notice suitable for posting by Employers in the workplace informing Employees of the current minimum wage rate and of their rights under this Chapter. Such notice shall be in English and other languages as provided in any regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 46.080(a). 
b.  Every Employer shall post in a conspicuous place at any workplace or job site where any Employee works the notice published each year by the City informing Employees of the current Minimum Wage rate and of their rights under this Chapter. Every Employer shall post such notices in English and other languages as provided in any regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 46.080(a). Every Employer shall also provide each Employee at the time of hire with the Employer's name, address and telephone number in writing. 
c.  Employers shall retain payroll records pertaining to Employees for a period of three (3) years, and shall allow the City access to such records, with appropriate notice and at a mutually agreeable time, to monitor compliance with the requirements of this Chapter. Where an Employer does not maintain or retain adequate records documenting wages paid or does not allow the City reasonable access to such records, the Employee's account of how much he or she was paid shall be presumed to be accurate, absent clear and convincing evidence otherwise. 
(Ord. No. 2443, § 6, 4-9-18)  
Sec. 46.070. - RETALIATION PROHIBITED: 
a.  It shall be unlawful for an Employer or any other party to discriminate in any manner or take adverse action against any person in retaliation for exercising rights protected under this Chapter. Rights protected under this Chapter include, but are not limited to: the right to file a complaint or inform any person about any party's alleged noncompliance with this Chapter; and the right to inform any person of his or her potential rights under this Chapter and to assist him or her in asserting such rights. Protections of this Chapter shall apply to any person who mistakenly, but in good faith, alleges noncompliance with this Chapter. 
b.  Taking adverse action against a person, including, without limitation, terminating employment, within one hundred twenty (120) days days of the person's exercise of rights protected under this Chapter shall raise a rebuttable presumption of having done so in retaliation for the exercise of such rights. 
(Ord. No. 2443, § 6, 4-9-18)  
Sec. 46.080. - IMPLEMENTATION: 
a.  Regulations. The City Manager may promulgate regulations for the implementation and enforcement of this Chapter.

Any regulations may establish procedures for ensuring fair, efficient and cost-effective implementation of this Chapter, including supplementary procedures for helping to inform Employees of their rights under this Chapter, for monitoring Employer compliance with this Chapter, and for providing administrative hearings to determine whether an Employer or other person has violated the requirements of this Chapter. 
b.  Reporting violations. An Employee or any other person may report to the City in writing any suspected violation of this Chapter. The City shall encourage reporting pursuant to this subsection by keeping confidential, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, the name and other identifying information of the Employee or person reporting the violation, provided, however, that with the authorization of such person, the City may disclose his or her name and identifying information as necessary to enforce this Chapter or other Employee protection laws. In order to further encourage reporting by Employees, if the City notifies an Employer that the City is investigating a complaint, the City shall require the Employer to post or otherwise notify its Employees that the City is conducting an investigation, using a form provided by the City.

REDWOOD CITY, CALIFORNIA ZONING CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the Zoning Ordinances of
Redwood City, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 7,
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Redwood City Zoning Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Tom Passanisi, principal planner. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the article and section. Thus, Section 10.12 is Section .12, located in Article 10. To accommodate future provisions, a decimal followed by the appropriate number is added to the prior section (Ex: 10.12 becomes 10.12.1). 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 7, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 1130-376, passed August 27, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the article and section. Thus, Section 10.12 is Section .12, located in Article 10. To accommodate future provisions, a decimal followed by the appropriate number is added to the prior section (Ex: 10.12 becomes 10.12.1). 
Tables of Contents 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and adoption date. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 3-1-1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross-referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Insertion Guide 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Insertion Guide. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Electronic Submission 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
    The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omitted." 
    In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

2.  Safety of homes, both structurally and from fire danger, is of particular concern in the hillside areas; 
3.  Ensuring that homes are integrated with hillside slopes and scaled to the size of the property contributes towards overall compatibility; and 
4.  Allowing reasonably-sized homes and additions can further the goals of neighborhood quality and accommodate diverse family and multi-generational needs. 
B.  Definition of Sloping Lots. For the purposes of this section, "sloping lots" is any lot in the R-1 or RH Zoning District that has an average slope of 15 percent or more. 
C.  Underfloors. Exterior building surfaces between the lowest floor and finished grade shall be comprised of fire-retardant materials to prevent exposure to wildfire hazard. The building official shall determine compliance with this standard. 
D.  Parking Front Setback Adjustment. In order to reduce grading, required parking (including a private garage) may be located, at the discretion of the Director, as close as 5 feet to the street property line; provided that portions of the dwelling and accessory structures other than the garage shall comply with the setback requirements of the base zoning district. Driveway aprons of 10 to 18 feet are prohibited as they would allow a car to protrude into the sidewalk or street. 
E.  Review Process. As required per Article 45 (Architectural Permits).

The number of bedrooms in the affordable units shall be comparable to the average number of bedrooms in the market-rate units, include comparable square feet by unit size and the affordable units shall be reasonably dispersed within the residential development, with unit locations comparable to those of the market-rate units, subject to review and approval by the Community Development Director. 
4.  The affordable units shall have access to the same amenities as the market rate units included within the affordable ownership cost or affordable rent for the affordable unit. For example, residents of the affordable units shall not be excluded from common open space, parking, storage, and other community facilities or amenities in the residential development project, nor shall households residing in affordable units be charged more than an affordable rent or an affordable ownership cost as defined in Section 29.2 (Definitions) for the use of such facilities and amenities. 
B.  Availability for Occupancy. Affordable units required by this Article shall be made available for occupancy concurrently with the market-rate units. For the purposes of this subsection, "concurrently" means that the City may not issue building permits for more than fifty (50) percent of the market-rate units until it has issued building permits for all of the affordable units, and the City may not approve any final inspections or certificates of occupancy for more than fifty (50) percent of the market-rate units until it has issued final inspections or certificates of occupancy for all of the affordable units. 
C.  Duration of Affordability.

D.  Eligibility. No household may occupy an affordable unit until the Community Development Director or designee has approved a Below Market Rate Tenant Selection and Management Plan prepared by the developer, which plan shall include eligibility requirements specific to the project. 
E.  Principal Residence. Any household that occupies an affordable unit must occupy that unit as its principal residence, unless otherwise approved in writing for rental to a third party for a limited period of time due to household hardship, as determined and approved by the City in advance. 
F.  Guidelines. The Community Development Director may from time to time adopt guidelines for determining household income and affordable housing cost, determining buyer eligibility, monitoring, and relevant administrative provisions. 
G.  Conflict of Interest. Officials, employees, or consultants of the City and members of City boards and commissions shall comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies relating to conflicts of interest as to their eligibility to develop, construct, sell, rent, lease, occupy, or purchase an affordable unit.

Affordable housing plans are not required if the developer is only paying an affordable housing impact fee, in compliance with City requirements. 
B.  Submittal and Review. The affordable housing plan must be submitted prior to the first planning permit application being deemed complete. The affordable housing plan shall be processed concurrently with all other permits required for the residential or nonresidential development project.

2.  The affordable units will mitigate the impact of the project on the need for affordable housing if the units are being provided under the Affordable Housing Impact Fee program. 
D.  Approval of Off-Site Affordable Units. If a developer proposes off-site affordable housing units or any other alternative in the affordable housing plan, the review authority may approve such a proposal if it is able to make the above findings in section C (Approval of On-Site Affordable Units) and the proposal meets all of the following conditions: 
1.  Financing or a viable financing plan, which may include public funding sources, is in place for the proposed affordable housing units; and 
2.  The proposed location is suitable for the proposed affordable housing, is consistent with the Housing Element, general plan, and zoning, and will not cause residential segregation. 
E.  Amendments. The approved affordable housing plan may be amended prior to issuance of any building permit for the residential or nonresidential development project. A request for a minor modification of an approved affordable housing plan may be granted by the Community Development Director if the modification is substantially in compliance with the original affordable housing plan and conditions of approval. Other modifications to the affordable housing plan shall be processed in the same manner as the original plan. 
F.  Agreements. As a condition of approval, affordable housing agreements acceptable to the Community Development Director shall be recorded against the residential or nonresidential development project prior to approval of any final or parcel map, or issuance of any building permit, whichever occurs first. The affordable housing agreement shall specify the number, type, location, size, and phasing of all affordable units, provisions for income certification and screening of potential purchasers or renters of units, and resale control mechanisms, including the financing of ongoing administrative and monitoring costs, consistent with the approved affordable housing plan, as determined by the Community Development Director.

1.  The City Council may adopt by resolution the percentage of affordable units needed to mitigate the impact of residential or nonresidential development projects on the need for affordable housing. 
2.  Any affordable rental or for-sale units proposed as an alternative to the payment of the housing impact fee shall be subject to the requirements described in Section 29.6 (Standards for Affordable Housing). 
B.  Alternatives Available to Projects Requiring On-Site Construction of Affordable Units. 
1.  Payment of an In-Lieu Fee. The City may accept payment of an in-lieu fee in place of construction of on-site units if all of the following findings can be made:

    Pursuant to this section, the off-street parking requirements contained within Article 30.2 may be satisfied partially or in full through the payment of an In-Lieu Parking Fee. The In-Lieu Parking Fee program shall be administered as follows: 
A.  Establishment of Amount of Fee. The amount of the In-Lieu Parking Fee shall be set by separate resolution of the City Council.

C.  Determination of Eligibility. The Zoning Administrator may allow a payment into the In-Lieu Parking Fund as an alternative to providing all or a portion of the required parking spaces on-site if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator that one (1) or more of the following conditions apply: 
1.  It is infeasible to provide the required parking spaces on-site due to the size, shape, or topography of the site, or other special circumstances pertaining to the property; 
2.  Providing the required parking spaces on-site is detrimental to the pedestrian nature of Downtown; 
3.  The uses proposed for the project do not require parking to be on the project site; 
4.  Encouraging users of the project site to walk from off-site parking to the project site would be beneficial to the Downtown; or 
5.  The existing and planned parking supply in the vicinity of the project site is adequate. 
D.  Payment of Fee. In the event that the Zoning Administrator approves an In-Lieu Parking Fee request, such payment shall be made to the City in one (1) lump sum prior to the issuance of a building permit or if a building permit is not required, within forty-five (45) days of request by City for payment. The In-Lieu Parking Fee shall be a one (1) time only, non-refundable payment and shall be considered full satisfaction of the off-street parking requirement for the number of parking spaces for which the fee was paid. All required parking spaces which are satisfied by payment of the in-lieu fee shall count as two (2) spaces toward the fulfillment of the minimum requirement. 
E.  Effect of Payment. In-Lieu Parking Fees shall be used exclusively to make available additional parking spaces for public use within the Downtown Parking Zone and does not guarantee the construction of spaces in any particular area of the Downtown Parking Zone or within any particular period of time. If allowed, In-Lieu Parking fees are solely an alternative means of satisfying the applicant's obligation to provide off-street parking as required by this Article and payment of the In-Lieu Fee does not carry any other guarantees, rights, or privileges to the applicant. The location, type, and configuration of parking spaces funded by In-Lieu Parking Fees are at the City's sole discretion.

Every off-street parking and loading facility in existence upon the effective date of this article, and every off-street parking and loading facility constructed and used on and after said effective date, shall be improved, constructed, maintained, and operated in accordance with the following minimum requirements: 
1.  The surface of every such parking and loading facility shall be designed and graded to provide adequate drainage, and such surface shall be constructed with a compacted base paved or surfaced with plant mix, asphalt pavement, concrete or other equivalent surfacing, approved by the City's Engineering and Construction Division. Permeable paving materials may be used subject to the determination by the Engineering and Construction Division that such materials will support anticipated vehicle weights and traffic and are constructed such that the surface will not erode or cause other maintenance problems. 
2.  Every such parking and loading facility not separated by a fence or similar barrier from any sidewalk, street, alley, or right-of-way which abuts thereto, shall have constructed thereon, and securely attached thereto, a barrier, not less than two (2) feet from such sidewalk, street, alley, or right-of-way, to prevent any portion of any motor vehicle parked or stored on such facility from extending into such sidewalk, street, alley, or right-of-way.

7.  Parking lots shall be improved with landscaping, and permanently maintained by the property owner, in accordance with the following standards: 
a.  Landscaping shall be installed as determined by the following schedule: 
Number of 
Parking Spaces Minimum % Parking Lot 
in Landscaping 1-5 5% 6-74 10% 75+ 15%  
b.  Landscaped areas shall be distributed throughout the parking lot or as appropriate, based on the lot configuration, to minimize the amount of directly connected impervious areas. Concave (rather than convex) landscape forms are encouraged to receive runoff from impervious areas and to allow for infiltration and/or detention; 
c.  Landscaping and shade trees shall be contained in planters and tree wells bordered by a six (6)-inch high concrete curb or equivalent approved by the City, so as to be protected from automobile overhang; 
d.  Shade trees shall be required at the rate of one (1) tree per each required five (5) parking spaces. Trees shall be a minimum of fifteen (15)-gallon can size and be of a variety that will provide shade upon reaching maturity; 
e.  Landscaped areas and planters shall be developed with a permanent irrigation system approved by the City; and shall be maintained permanently, and kept free of all weeds, debris, and litter. 
8.  Permeable surfaces and drainage: Parking lot design shall provide measures to enhance stormwater treatment by maximizing permeable surfaces and incorporating site design, source control and stormwater treatment measures to the extent feasible, as determined by the City's Engineering and Construction Division in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 27A, as may be amended from time to time. Criteria to be considered in the design of parking lots shall include the following: 
a.  All parking in excess of the minimum parking spaces required shall be designed and constructed of permeable surfacing materials. Materials that may be considered include, but are not limited to, permeable pavements, decomposed granite, gravel, grasscrete and turfblock. Final approval of any surface is subject to the approval of the Engineering and Construction Division; 
b.  Parking areas and access drives may be designed and constructed of permeable materials and permeable perimeter parking spaces are encouraged, subject to the approval of the Planning Division and Engineering and Construction Division; 
c.  Where possible, drainage from parking areas and other impervious surfaces on a site shall be directed to landscape areas or other permeable surfaces for infiltration and/or detention of stormwater flows; 
d.  Where possible, best management practices shall be incorporated into parking and landscape design to facilitate infiltration of stormwater prior to discharge from a site. Techniques to treat stormwater include, but are not limited to, using wheel stops rather than curbs to disperse drainage discharge, providing vegetated swales between rows of parking and/or at the perimeter of parking lots, use of permeable parking materials (hybrid parking lots) and creating parking groves within a parking lot. These and other best management practices are outlined in stormwater manuals, such as the "Start at the Source Handbook," prepared by the Bay Area Stormwater Management Agencies Association (BASMAA). 
C.  No person shall park or store, or cause or permit the parking or storing of any vehicle upon any off-street parking and loading facility for the purpose of displaying such vehicle for sale, lease, or rental unless such use of such facility is otherwise permitted pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance, any permit issued pursuant thereto, or pursuant to the provisions of any other ordinance.

32.3 - Supplemental Setback Requirements. 
A.  Setback Measurement. Setbacks are measured at the closest distance from any point on a building or architectural feature to the adjacent property line. 
B.  Second Story Side Setbacks. In residential zoning districts, second-stories must be set back a minimum of six (6) feet from the side property line. Additional setback is required for portions that exceed thirty-five (35) feet in length or twenty-five (25) percent of the adjacent lot line length , whichever is less. This additional setback is one-half (1/2) the wall height along the setback. 
C.  Setbacks above Second Story. Any structure exceeding two (2) stories in height shall comply with the minimum district setbacks for the first and second stories. The third story and above shall have a minimum setback of 1/2 the wall height at the base of the third story. 
D.  Distance between Main Buildings. Whenever a lot has more than one main building, each of the main buildings shall be separated by a minimum setback of 6 feet. The buildings must also comply with all required setbacks of the zoning district. 
E.  Architectural Features. 
1.  Definition. Architectural features. Architectural features include cornices, eaves, bay windows, canopies, fireplaces, chimneys, and unenclosed portions of buildings. Decks, landing places, stairways and balconies qualify as architectural features if they remain unenclosed and do not have a roof or any supporting structural members. Bay windows qualify as an architectural feature if they are cantilevered 24 inches above ground level and do not provide for additional floor area. 
2.  Architectural features may encroach up to 3 feet into any required yard provided they are set back a minimum of 3 feet from the property line. 
F.  Front Yard or Corner Lot Setbacks on a Final Recorded Subdivision Map. If the final recorded subdivision map provides for greater front yard setbacks or side yard setbacks on the street side of a corner lot or side yard setbacks than required in this ordinance, the most restrictive setbacks are required. 
G.  Side Yard Exceptions. 
1.  Angled Lots. One corner of the first floor of a main structure may have a minimum setback of 4 feet in a residential zoning district when adjacent to, but not parallel with, an angled lot line. The remainder of the building must meet the minimum setback of the zoning district. 
2.  Nonconformity. Any single family dwelling which is in compliance with the yard setback requirements in effect at the time it was constructed may be enlarged so long as the side yard setbacks are a minimum of 5 feet, and the front and rear yard setbacks are a minimum of 20 feet.

32.12 - Stormwater Treatment. 
A.  Purpose: The purpose of the requirements set forth in this section is to provide zoning standards that minimize the quantity of runoff and associated pollutants in stormwater runoff from developed sites to creeks, the stormdrain system and, ultimately, to the San Francisco Bay. Enhanced stormwater quality can be achieved through reduction of impervious surfaces, the protection of watercourses and riparian vegetation, providing for infiltration of stormwater on-site through vegetation and soils, and with engineered treatment systems. 
B.  Applicability and compliance with Article 27A: All new development, additions and reconstruction as outlined below are subject to the provisions of this Section and of Chapter 27A (Stormwater Treatment Measures and Maintenance Program) of the Municipal Code, as that Chapter may be amended from time to time, which outlines technical requirements for stormwater control. Chapter 27A assures engineering review of all applicable plans for compliance with the requirements of the San Mateo County City/County Nationwide Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, as approved by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board. The following development is subject to this section and its applicable subsections: 
1.  All new development that proposes a net increase in impervious area on a site or that removes and replaces more than fifty (50) percent of the existing impervious area on a site (but not less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet) shall comply with the provisions of Subsection C (Minimum Pervious Areas) of this Section. Compliance is not required when no net increase in impervious area is proposed and replacement of existing impervious area comprises no more than fifty (50) percent of the existing impervious area or less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of impervious area. 
2.  All new development that proposes an increase in impervious area and/or replacement of impervious area of more than ten thousand (10,000) square feet on a site, and the total of which comprises fifty (50) percent or more of the existing impervious area of the site shall comply with the provisions of Subsections D (Infiltration of Stormwater) and E (On-Site Treatment of Runoff) of this Section for the entire site. 
3.  All new development that proposes an increase in impervious area and/or replacement of impervious area of more than ten thousand (10,000) square feet on a site, and the total of which does not comprise more than fifty (50) percent of the existing impervious area of the site, shall comply with the provisions of Subsections D (Infiltration of Stormwater) and E (On-Site Treatment of Runoff) of this Section for the portion(s) of the site where impervious area is added or replaced. 
4.  All new development shall comply with the provisions of Subsection F (Creek Protection and Setbacks). 
5.  Notwithstanding the above provisions, any project that adds and/or replaces impervious area of one (1) acre or greater shall comply with the provisions of all Subsections C, D, E and F of this Section. 
6.  Increases in impervious area and replacement of existing impervious area shall include all (cumulative) development of a site over any five (5) year period, as determined by the Zoning Administrator, to assure compliance in the event of multiple phases of development. 
C.  Minimum pervious areas: All development as outlined in Subsection (B)(1) of this section shall comply with the minimum pervious area requirements for the pertinent zoning district within which the site is located, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  Pervious area may be comprised of pervious landscape area, vegetated open space or pervious paving materials, subject to the Engineering and Construction Division's determination of the appropriate permeability ratio for such materials. The Engineering and Construction Division shall maintain a listing of acceptable materials and assumed permeability ratios, which may vary depending on site factors. 
2.  Areas in park strips in the public right-of-way (between the sidewalk and the roadway) or in an easement may be included as pervious area for the site if: (a) the park strip area is paved or is barren (without vegetation) prior to development; and (b) the area is converted to landscaping and is used to capture and treat a portion of the drainage from the site, subject to approval of the Engineering and Construction Divisions. 
3.  Where the replacement of impervious area comprises greater than fifty (50) percent of the existing impervious area on the site, but no net increase in impervious area is proposed, the Zoning Administrator may allow the use of engineering on-site treatment (in-line filtration or similar means) for stormwater management in lieu of pervious area requirements, subject to approval by the Engineering and Construction Division. 
4.  For land uses that require a high percentage of impervious surface area and that have a potential to generate significant quantities of surface pollutants such as service stations, car washes, automobile repair services or similar uses, the Zoning Administrator may require the use of grease traps, water recycling systems, and/or other means of stormwater protection in lieu of or in addition to pervious area limitations. 
D.  Infiltration of stormwater: Drainage from development sites, and particularly from parking lots, shall be directed to landscape, vegetated swales or other permeable areas for filtration of runoff prior to discharge from the site, unless the Zoning Administrator, with the approval of the Engineering and Construction Division, allows for alternate methods of treatment including, but not limited to, infiltration basins and in-line filtration. Drainage from parking garage surfaces shall be collected and treated prior to discharge from the site or may be directed to permeable areas of the site for treatment, subject to approval by the Engineering and Construction Division. 
E.  On-site treatment of runoff: All treatment of runoff, whether through site design, source control or stormwater treatment measures, shall require approval by the Engineering and Construction Division consistent with the requirements of Chapter 27A of the Municipal Code, as that Chapter may be amended from time to time. Applicants are advised to review and incorporate stormwater management concepts outlined in relevant publications, such as the "Start at the Source Handbook" and the "Start at the Source Tools" prepared by the Bay Area Stormwater Management Agencies Association (BASMAA). Special treatment measures may be required to assure protection of Sensitive Areas, consistent with the Countywide Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program (STOPPP). 
F.  Creek protection and setbacks: All areas within thirty (30) feet of the centerline or twenty-five (25) feet of the top of the bank, whichever is greater, of a protected watercourse shall be subject to the following regulations: 
1.  Existing structures shall be maintained so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical integrity of the watercourse; 
2.  The stream banks or other land within such setback area shall not be filled, graded or disturbed, and no riparian vegetation shall be removed, except for normal maintenance of vegetation and protective restoration or maintenance to prevent flooding, reduce siltation or otherwise provide for the public health or safety, if approved by the City Engineer or his or her designee; 
3.  No development of structures and no addition of new impervious surfaces are allowed within the setback area except for: (1) unpaved trails, or (2) paved trails if approved by the Zoning Administrator and Engineering and Construction Division, unless a Use Permit is approved by the Zoning Administrator, consistent with the findings outlined in Article 42 of the Redwood City Zoning Code and the following additional findings: 
a.  The development will not disturb riparian vegetation; 
b.  The development will maintain the stability of the slopes of the creek bank; 
c.  The development will be designed to avoid discharge of pollutants directly to the watercourse and will assure that the discharge of runoff will be filtered over a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet of vegetation or through other equivalent means to the satisfaction of the Engineering and Construction Division; 
    All existing structures and impervious surfaces may remain, subject to the provisions of Article 33 (Nonconforming Lots, Uses, Structures and Parking) of the Zoning Ordinance. Structures within the creek setback may be modified only in accordance with Article 33 and the Use Permit provisions of subsection (F)(3) of this section.

B.  Definitions. 
1.  "Affordable Housing Unit" means an ownership or rental dwelling unit affordable to households with extremely-low, very-low, low or moderate incomes as published periodically by the California Department of Housing and Community Development for households in San Mateo County or equivalent as approved by the Community Development Director. 
2.  "Base Units" means the maximum residential density at the project site allowed under the zoning ordinance and land use element of the General Plan prior to the application of the State Density Bonus law. If a range of density is permitted, the maximum allowable density in the range is applicable. Where the density allowed under the zoning ordinance is inconsistent with the density allowed under the land use element of the General Plan, the General Plan density shall prevail. 
3.  "Bonus Units" means additional units granted by the State Density Bonus law. Bonus units may exceed local zoning and General Plan densities. 
4.  "Concession or Incentive" means a modification in development standards, zoning code requirements, architectural design requirements, parking requirements, or other concessions or incentives identified in Government Code Section 65915(k) or any successor provision that result in identifiable and actual cost reductions, in order to provide for affordable housing. 
5.  "State Density Bonus law" means Sections 65915 through 65918 of the California Government Code. 
6.  "Waiver" means a modification of development standards that would otherwise physically preclude the construction of a development meeting the criteria of this Section at the density permitted under State Density Bonus law or with the concessions and incentives granted under this Section and State Density Bonus Law. 
C.  Applicability. This Section 32.19 applies to all residential or mixed-use development projects with a net increase of five (5) or more dwelling units or a project that otherwise meets the applicable requirements of the State Density Bonus law. The requirements summarized in Section 32.19 are for informational purposes only; the requirements of the State Density Bonus law shall prevail in the event of any conflict. 
D.  Submittal Requirements and Review Process. 
1.  To apply for a State Density Bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, or parking modification, the applicant shall submit a letter of intent to the City along with the first application for approval of a residential or mixed-use development project that demonstrates the project's eligibility for the requested State Density Bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, or parking modification. 
2.  The letter of intent shall specify the density permitted by the zoning and general plan, the affordability levels to be provided, tenure (for-sale or rental), number and location of affordable housing units or senior housing provided, description of all dwelling units existing on the site in the five-year period preceding the date of submittal, number of bonus units requested, number of concessions or incentives requested, and what specific incentives, concessions, waivers, or parking modifications would be sought. 
3.  The letter of intent shall include sufficient information for the review authority to determine whether the application conforms with the following requirements and shall contain any additional information specified in Section 32.19(F) and (G): 
a.  Replacement of Units. The development provides sufficient units to account for the replacement of units currently rented or rented to low and very low income households in the past five (5) years, as required by Government Code Section 65915(c)(3). 
b.  Concessions and Incentives. Except as provided in Section 32.19(F)(3) (Concessions and Incentives), evidence that any requested concession or incentive will reduce the cost of the housing development to provide for affordable housing costs or rents; except that, if a mixed-use development is requested, the application must instead meet all of the requirements of Government Code Section 65915(k)(2). 
c.  Waiver. Evidence that the development standards for which a waiver is requested would have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted by Government Code Section 65915. 
d.  Parking Modification. If a parking modification is sought, evidence that the project is eligible for the parking reduction allowed by Government Code Section 65915(p). 
e.  Donation of Land. If the density bonus is based all or in part on donation of land, all of the requirements included in Government Code Section 65915(g) have been met. 
f.  Child Care Facility. If the density bonus or incentive is based all or in part on the inclusion of a child care facility, all of the requirements included in Government Code Section 65915(h) have been met. 
g.  Condominium Conversion. If the density bonus or incentive is based all or in part on the inclusion of affordable units as part of a condominium conversion, all of the requirements included in Government Code Section 65915.5 have been met.

e.  Floor area. 
f.  Parking. 
g.  Standards relating to architectural bulk and mass, including upper story step-backs. 
h.  Minimum distance between buildings. 
i.  Maximum building length. 
j.  Duration of permit effectiveness. 
4.  Concessions and Incentives with Financial Analysis. Other regulatory incentives or concessions not listed above which are proposed by the developer that result in identifiable and actual cost reductions to provide for affordable housing costs/rent costs may be granted if the review authority finds all of the following: 
a.  An actual cost reduction is achieved through the concession or incentive. 
b.  Evidence demonstrates that the cost reduction allows the builder to provide affordable rents or affordable sales prices. 
c.  The developer has provided all information as may be requested by the Community Development Director to ensure that the findings can be made and supported by substantial evidence. 
5.  Parking Modifications. The State Density Bonus law provides alternative parking requirements that may potentially be lower than City parking requirements. Parking reductions specified in Government Code Section 65915 are not counted as concessions, incentives, or waivers. However, the applicant may request additional concessions, incentives, or waivers related to parking. 
6.  Denial of Concessions and Incentives. The review authority shall grant a requested concession or incentive unless the review authority makes any of the following findings, in writing and supported by substantial evidence: 
a.  The concession or incentive does not result in identifiable and actual cost reductions to provide for affordable rents or affordable ownership costs. 
b.  The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2), upon the health, safety, or the physical environment with no feasible method to satisfactorily avoid or mitigate. 
c.  The concession or incentive would have an adverse impact on a real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources with no feasible method to satisfactorily avoid or mitigate. 
d.  The concession or incentive would be contrary to State or federal law. 
G.  Waivers. Developers of State Density Bonus eligible projects may seek a waiver of any development standard that would physically preclude the construction of a housing development with the density bonus and incentives for which the applicant is entitled. The applicant shall bear the burden of demonstrating that the development standards that are requested to be waived will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of the housing development with the density bonus and incentives. There is no limit to the number of waivers that can be granted. A request for a waiver must be submitted in writing as part of the application process specified in Section 32.19(D) (Submittal Requirements and Review Process). Granted waivers shall be identified by staff in entitlements. The City shall grant a waiver unless the review authority makes any of the following findings in writing and supported by substantial evidence: 
1.  The waiver would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2), upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to lower and moderate income households. 
2.  The waiver would have an adverse impact on a real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources with no feasible method to satisfactorily avoid or mitigate. 
3.  The development standard for which a waiver is requested would not physically preclude the construction of the housing development with the density bonus and incentives or would otherwise be contrary to State or federal law. 
H.  Affordability and Development Standards. All Affordable Housing Units must comply with the standards specified in Section 29.6 (Standards for Affordable Housing). 
I.  Commercial Density Bonus. 
1.  A "commercial density bonus" is a modification of development standards mutually agreed upon by the City and an applicant for a nonresidential development project that is eligible for such a bonus under Government Code 65915.7. Examples of a commercial density bonus include an increase in floor area ratio, increased building height, or reduced parking. 
2.  Developer shall enter into an Affordable Housing Plan and Agreement with the City that meets the requirements of Section 29.7 (Affordable Housing Plan and Agreement) and that demonstrates how the developer intends to provide the affordable housing required to qualify for a commercial density bonus under Government Code 65915.7. An Affordable Housing Plan and Agreement under this section may take the form of a "partnered housing agreement." For purposes of this section, a partnered housing agreement is an agreement between the developer, the City, and a third-party housing developer who will provide the affordable units on behalf of the developer. 
3.  Any approved housing agreement for a commercial density bonus shall be described in the City's Housing Element annual report as required by Government Code Section 65915.7(k) and shall require the following: 
a.  At least thirty (30) percent of the total units in the housing development project shall be made available at affordable ownership cost or affordable rent for low-income households, or at least fifteen (15) percent of the total units in the housing development project shall be made available at affordable ownership cost or affordable rent for very low-income households. 
b.  The nonresidential development project developer must agree either to directly build the affordable units; donate a site consistent with Section 32.19(I)(4) for the affordable units; or make a cash payment to the housing developer for the affordable units. 
4.  Housing Site. Housing development shall be at the same site as the nonresidential development project or on a site within the City that is within a quarter-mile of the site, or within one-half (1/2) mile of a major transit stop and is located in close proximity to public amenities, including schools and employment centers. 
5.  Eligibility for State Density Bonus. The housing development project shall remain eligible for any State Density Bonus, incentives, concessions, waivers, or parking modifications for which the housing development project would otherwise be eligible and that are provided by this Section 32.19.

Article 53 - MIXED-USE CORRIDOR ZONING DISTRICT 

53.1 - Intent and Purpose. 
A.  Overall Vision and Intent. The Mixed-Use Corridor (MUC) zoning district is composed of five (5) sub-districts, as established in Section 53.1.B. The five (5) MUC zoning sub-districts implement the Mixed-Use - Corridor land use category in the General Plan and provide opportunities for development that supports major transit and complementary land uses, with the goal of facilitating transit use, bicycle use, and pedestrian activity. The purpose of the MUC zoning sub-districts is to provide areas for a variety of activities, including commercial, office, and high-density residential uses, or a mixture thereof. Mixed-Use means that residential and nonresidential uses may be integrated vertically or mixed horizontally. Single-use residential and nonresidential buildings are permitted in the MUC zoning sub-districts as well. Convenient transit access, innovative housing options, sensitivity to lower-intensity adjacent uses, on-site amenities, and pedestrian and street-oriented design are key considerations. This designation allows for the highest residential densities in Redwood City, with the exception of the Downtown Precise Plan. 
B.  Sub-Districts: Establishment and Intent. 
1.  Sub-District Establishment. Five (5) Mixed-Use Corridor zoning sub-districts are established: 
a.  Mixed-Use Corridor - El Camino Real, 
b.  Mixed-Use Corridor - Veterans Boulevard, 
c.  Mixed-Use Corridor - Redwood Creek, 
d.  Mixed-Use Corridor - Streetcar Broadway, and 
e.  Mixed-Use Corridor - Gateway Broadway. 
2.  Sub-District Intent. Each of these sub-districts implements the General Plan Mixed-Use - Corridor designation and provides for more specific regulations for distinct areas of Redwood City. Any parcel zoned Mixed-Use Corridor shall be located in one (1) of the following sub-districts: 
a.  Mixed-Use Corridor - El Camino Real (MUC-ECR): Purpose. Redwood City is committed to the revitalization of El Camino Real as a grand, multimodal, and attractive boulevard. The MUC-ECR sub-district represents a continuation of the Grand Boulevard Initiative vision and the Downtown Precise Plan design goals. The purposes of the MUC-ECR sub-district are to: 
i.  Transform El Camino Real into a remarkable, walkable, and exciting corridor, home to a variety of residential and nonresidential uses. 
ii.  Facilitate a pedestrian-scaled environment with buildings that emphasize active and street-oriented frontages, well-scaled and designed buildings, and engaging outdoor spaces and landscaping. 
iii.  Allow for higher-intensity residential, commercial, and mixed-use buildings to provide the appropriate height relative to the width of the street. 
iv.  Provide increased opportunities in Redwood City for residents to live near goods, services, transit, and entertainment. 
v.  Ensure that consideration and proper transition is provided to adjacent lower-density residential uses. 
vi.  Encourage additional pedestrian and transit amenities along El Camino Real and the development of a consistent street front, with ample public right-of-way to facilitate pedestrian environment. 
b.  Mixed-Use Corridor - Veterans Boulevard (MUC-VB): Purpose. Veterans Boulevard provides a primary entrance gateway into Redwood City from U.S. 101 and neighboring jurisdictions. The purposes of the MUC-VB sub-district are to: 
i.  Encourage signature buildings that accentuate the gateway and boulevard features of Veterans Boulevard at appropriate locations that serve as entrances to Redwood City. 
ii.  Facilitate circulation interconnectedness and maximize walkability within sites and between adjacent developments, including connections across Veterans Boulevard to link the bayfront of Redwood City with Downtown. 
iii.  Ensure that consideration and proper transition is provided to adjacent lower-density residential uses. 
iv.  Encourage the implementation of street patterns of a similar scale to adjoining historic areas. 
c.  Mixed-Use Corridor - Redwood Creek (MUC-RC): Purpose. Redwood Creek is a significant visual and environmental resource that flows through Redwood City. The purposes of the MUC-RC sub-district are to: 
i.  Reorient development towards Redwood Creek to feature this natural amenity while also providing for active and engaging street frontage along Main Street, Walnut Street, and Veterans Boulevard. 
ii.  Encourage development that fosters a linkage between Downtown and the bayfront area via Redwood Creek. 
iii.  Provide opportunities for residential and nonresidential uses in close proximity to transit, the San Francisco Bay, and Redwood Creek. 
iv.  Facilitate public access to Redwood Creek, and foster active and engaging open spaces. 
d.  Mixed-Use Corridor - Streetcar Broadway (MUC-SB): Purpose. Broadway in Downtown Redwood City is known for its historic buildings and events in Courthouse Square that create a lively and stimulating atmosphere. The purposes of the MUC-SB sub-district are to: 
i.  Continue the vibrancy of Broadway heading toward Woodside Road outside of the Downtown Precise Plan area. 
ii.  Connect the major employment districts of Downtown and South Broadway and enhance mobility for pedestrians, transit riders, bicyclists, and drivers. 
iii.  Provide opportunities for residential, commercial, and mixed-use development at intensities that could support a potential streetcar line. 
iv.  Facilitate the transition of the corridor from an auto-oriented commercial strip to a comprehensive multiuse corridor complementary to Downtown. 
v.  Ensure that new construction is respectful of existing historic structures in terms of scale, design, and transition. 
e.  Mixed-Use Corridor - Gateway Broadway (MUC-GB): Purpose. The large parcels on Broadway at Woodside Road provide opportunities for signature development. Appropriate commercial uses include destination uses, hospitality businesses, large-scale commercial centers, and high-quality office spaces with associated amenities. The purposes of the MUC-GB sub-district are to: 
i.  Facilitate a positive impression and identifiable gateway to Redwood City through the use of signature architecture, inviting public plazas, and development that supports a walkable environment. 
ii.  Provide opportunities for destination uses in concert with residential uses. 
iii.  Foster comprehensive development plans that accommodate the pedestrian on large-scale sites and encourage an appropriately scaled street grid. 
C.  Applicability. The building design standards, site design standards, and any and all other land use and development requirements, standards, regulations, or other provisions set forth in this Article 53 shall apply to all development within the geographic boundaries established by and for the Article, notwithstanding any other provision of the Redwood City Zoning Ordinance to the contrary. Whenever the requirements, standards, regulations, or other provisions of this Article conflict with the requirements, standards, regulations or other provisions set forth in the Redwood City Zoning Ordinance or the Redwood City Municipal Code, the requirements, standards, regulations, or other provisions in this Article 53 shall govern.

2.  Residential Use - Specific Regulations. 
a.  Freeway Separation. No new residential units shall be permitted within five hundred (500) feet of the outermost lane of a freeway. 
i.  Exception to the residential location requirement. The responsible review authority may approve an exception to the residential location requirement, subject to the issuance of a conditional use permit, and subject to the following: 
(1)  Screening analysis. The project applicant shall conduct a screening analysis to indicate whether new receptors will be exposed to roadway Toxic Air Contaminant (TAC) emissions at concentrations exceeding the threshold of significance as determined and periodically updated by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD). The screening analysis shall be submitted to Redwood City Community Development Services for review. If the results of the screening analysis indicate thresholds of significance would be exceeded by the project, a quantitative health risk assessment shall be required to identify exposure levels to TACs below those recommended by the BAAQMD. 
(2)  Findings. The responsible review authority, in approving an exception to the residential location requirement, must make findings that any such project includes measures to mitigate air quality impacts associated with TACs to a less-than-significant level. 
b.  Residential Noise Notice. Residents of new residential or mixed-use development projects in the Mixed-Use Corridor Zoning Sub-Districts, whether owners or tenants, shall be notified in writing before taking up residence that they will be living in an urban-type environment and that the noise levels may be higher than a strictly residential area. 
The covenants, conditions, and restrictions of a residential or mixed-use project shall require that prospective residents acknowledge the receipt of the written noise notification. Signatures shall confirm receipt and understanding of this information. 
3.  Mixed-Use Development - Specific Regulations. Mixed-Use that is vertically integrated into one (1) building or horizontally integrated on the same site shall comply with the development standards listed in Tables 53-2 and 53-3 as they pertain to Mixed-Use, in addition to the standards below. 
a.  Limitations on Use. The nonresidential component of a mixed-use project shall be a use allowed within the applicable zone by Section 53.2 (Use Regulations), subject to the following additional limitations. 
i.  Prohibited uses. The following uses and activities shall not be permitted within any mixed-use development: 
(1)  Vehicle maintenance or repair (e.g., body or mechanical work, including boats and recreational vehicles), vehicle detailing and painting, upholstery, or any similar use. 
(2)  Storage of flammable liquids or hazardous materials beyond that normally associated with a residential use. 
(3)  Manufacturing or industrial activities, including but not limited to welding, machining, or any open flame work. 
(4)  Any other activity or use, as determined by the responsible review authority to not be compatible with residential activities and/or to have the possibility of affecting the health or safety of live/work unit residents due to the potential for the use to create dust, glare, heat, noise, noxious gases, odor, smoke, traffic, vibration or other impacts, or would be hazardous because of materials, processes, products, or wastes. 
ii.  Changes in use. After approval, a mixed-use building shall not be converted to entirely residential use. 
b.  Entrances. When nonresidential and residential uses are located in the same building, separate pedestrian entrances shall be provided for each use. The entrances for nonresidential uses shall be designed to be visually distinct from the entrances for residential uses. 

c.  Loading and Unloading Activities. Where applicable, the covenants, conditions, and restrictions of a mixed-use development shall indicate the times when the loading and unloading of goods may occur on the street, provided that, in no event, shall loading or unloading take place after 10:00 p.m. or before 7:00 a.m. on any day of the week.

The purpose of the MUN district is to provide areas for a variety of activities, including commercial, office, and moderate-density residential uses, or a mixture thereof. Single-use residential and nonresidential buildings are permitted in the MUN district as well. Sensitivity to lower-intensity adjacent uses, a focus on pedestrian and street-oriented design, and uses that serve the immediate neighborhoods are key considerations. 
B.  Applicability. The building design standards, site design standards, and any and all other land use and development requirements, standards, regulations, or other provisions set forth in this Article 54 shall apply to all development within the geographic boundaries established by and for this Article, notwithstanding any other provision of the Redwood City Zoning Ordinance to the contrary. Whenever the requirements, standards, regulations, or other provisions of this Article conflict with the requirements, standards, regulations or other provisions set forth in the Redwood City Zoning Ordinance or the Redwood City Municipal Code, the requirements, standards, regulations, or other provisions in this Article 54 shall govern.

Article 55 - MULW (MIXED-USE LIVE/WORK) DISTRICT 

55.1 - Intent and Purpose. 
A.  Overall Vision and Intent. The Mixed-Use Live/Work (MULW) district implements the Mixed-Use Live/Work land use category in the General Plan. The MULW district provides opportunities for a mix of live/work, light industrial, technology, creative industry, and limited office, and complementary uses. Live/work environments combine residential occupancy with commercial or light industrial activity in the same building space, generally with the resident using the combined or adjacent workspace for his or her business. Typical uses include artist lofts, studio spaces, small offices, and similar low-intensity uses. Residential uses are permitted only as live/work (stand-alone residential development is not permitted), either in new developments or as adaptive reuse of existing structures. Stand-alone commercial or industrial workspace areas are permitted, provided that activities limit or confine noise, dust, and vibration impacts, are low impact in nature, and are compatible with any nearby existing or allowed residential uses. Development generally is low to moderate in scale. 
B.  Applicability. The building design standards, site design standards, and any and all other land use and development requirements, standards, regulations, or other provisions set forth in this Article 55 shall apply to all development within the geographic boundaries established by and for the Article, notwithstanding any other provision of the Redwood City Zoning Ordinance to the contrary. Whenever the requirements, standards, regulations, or other provisions of this Article conflict with the requirements, standards, regulations or other provisions set forth in the Redwood City Zoning Ordinance or the Redwood City Municipal Code, the requirements, standards, regulations, or other provisions in this Article 55 shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 1130-359, § 12(Exh. K), 4-8-13)
