PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Prattville, Alabama. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1992 Code as supplemented through July 6, 1993, and ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1992 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Colleen Dalton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. David A. McDowell, City Attorney, Ms. Gina Smith, City Clerk, and Mr. Rod Morgan, Finance Director, for cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(1)  The taxpayer must demonstrate the continuing existence of an actual facility located outside the police jurisdiction in which its principal business office is located, such as a retail store, outlet, business office, showroom, or warehouse, to which employees and/or independent contractors are assigned or located during regular normal working hours. 
(2)  The taxpayer must maintain books and records, which reasonably indicate a segregation or allocation of the taxpayer's gross receipts to the particular facility. 
(3)  The taxpayer must provide proof that separate telephone listings, signs, and other indications of its separate activity are in existence. 
(4)  Billing and/or collection activities relating to the business conducted at the branch office or offices are performed by an employee or other representative, of the taxpayer who has such responsibility for the branch office. 
(5)  All business claimed by a branch office or offices must be conducted by and through said office or offices. 
(6)  The taxpayer must supply proof that all applicable business licenses with respect to the branch office or offices have been issued. 
(d)  Nothing herein shall be construed as exempting businesses from payment of a license on the basis of a lack of physical location. 
(Ord. No. 2007-027, § 6-4, 11-6-2007)  
Sec. 38-305. - Restriction on transfer of license. 
No license shall be transferred except with the consent of the city council or of the finance director or his or her designee, and no license shall be transferred to reflect a physical change of address of the taxpayer within the city more than once during a license year and never from one taxpayer to another. Provided that a mere change in the name or ownership of a taxpayer that is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other form of legal entity now or hereafter recognized by the laws of the state shall not constitute a transfer for purposes of this article, unless: 
(1)  The change requires the taxpayer to obtain a new federal employer identification number or department of revenue taxpayer identification number; or 
(2)  In the discretion of the city, the subject license is one for the sale of alcoholic beverages. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city from requiring a new business license application and approval for an alcoholic beverage license.

(Ord. No. 2007-027, § 6-7, 11-6-2007)  
Sec. 38-308. - Duty to file report. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of every person subject to such license tax to render to the city on such forms as may be required, a sworn statement showing the total business done, amount of sales, gross receipts and gross sales, stock, value of furniture and other equipment, capital invested, number of helpers or employees, amount of space occupied, or other factor described in the schedule, one or several, as the case may require, for the ascertainment of the classification of such person for license taxation purposes and the correct amount of license tax to which he is subject. 
(b)  If the city determines that the amount of business license tax reported on or remitted with any business license remittance form is incorrect, if no business license remittance form is filed within the time prescribed, or if the information provided on the form is insufficient to allow the taxing jurisdiction to determine the proper amount of business license tax due, the city shall calculate the correct amount of the tax based on the most accurate and complete information reasonably obtainable and enter a preliminary assessment for the correct amount of business license tax, including any applicable penalty and interest. 
(c)  The city shall promptly mail a copy of any preliminary assessment to the taxpayer's last known address by either first class U.S. mail or certified U.S. mail with return receipt requested, or, in the sole discretion of the city, deliver the preliminary assessment to the taxpayer by personal delivery. 
(d)  If the amount of business license tax remitted by the taxpayer is undisputed by the city, or if the taxpayer consents to the amount of any deficiency or preliminary assessment in writing, the city shall enter a final assessment for the amount of the business license tax due, plus any applicable penalty and interest. 
(e)  (1)  If a taxpayer disagrees with a preliminary assessment as entered by the city, the taxpayer shall file a petition for review with the revenue officer within 30 days from the date of entry of the preliminary assessment setting out the specific objections to the preliminary assessment. If a petition for review is timely filed, the revenue officer shall schedule a conference with the taxpayer for the purpose of allowing the taxpayer or its representatives and the representatives of the city to present their respective positions, discuss any omissions or errors, and to attempt to agree upon any changes or modifications to their respective positions. 
(2)  If a petition for review is not timely filed, or is timely filed, and upon further review the revenue officer determines that the preliminary assessment is due to be upheld in whole or in part, the city may make the assessment final in the amount of business license tax due as computed by the revenue officer, with applicable interest and penalty computed to the date of entry of the final assessment. The revenue officer shall, whenever practicable, complete his or her review of the taxpayer's petition for review and applicable law within 90 days following the later of the date of filing of the petition or the conference, if any. 
(3)  A copy of the final assessment shall promptly be mailed to the taxpayer's last known address by certified U.S. mail with return receipt requested. At the option of the taxing jurisdiction a copy of the final assessment may be delivered to the taxpayer by personal delivery. The final assessment shall include a statement informing the taxpayer of his or her right to appeal the final assessment to circuit court within 30 days from the date of the entry of the final assessment. 
(Ord. No. 2007-027, § 6-8, 11-6-2007)

(2)  To furnish information during reasonable business hours, at the licensee's place of business, in the city, all books of account, invoices, papers, reports and memoranda containing entries showing amount of purchases, sales receipts, inventory and other information from which the correct license tax classification of such person may be ascertained and the correct amount of license tax to which he is subject may be determined, including exhibition of bank deposit books, bank statements, copies of sales tax returns to the state, copies of state income tax returns and federal income tax returns.

Sec. 38-312. - Failure to file assessment. 
(a)  In any case where a person subject to paying a license tax as provided herein fails to do so, the city designee shall be authorized to assess and determine the amount of license taxes due using the best information available either by return filed or by other means. 
(b)  The taxpayer shall be notified by registered or certified mail, or by personal service, of the amount of any such assessment, and of his right to appear before the finance director on a day named not less than 20 days from the date of notice and to show cause why such assessment shall not be made final. Such appearance may be made by agent or attorney. 
(c)  If no showing is made on or before the date fixed in such notice, or if such showing is not sufficient in the judgment of the city, such assessment shall be made final in the amount originally fixed, or in such other amount as is determined by the city to be correct. If upon such hearing the city designee finds a different amount due than that originally assessed, he shall make the assessment final in the correct amount, and in all cases shall notify the taxpayer of the assessment as finally fixed. 
(d)  A notice by the United States mail, addressed to the taxpayer's last known place of business, shall be sufficient. Any assessment made by the designee of the city shall be prima facie correct upon any appeal. 
(Ord. No. 2007-027, § 6-12, 11-6-2007)

Sec. 38-315. - Civil penalties. 
In addition to the remedies provided by Code of Ala. 1975 , § 11-51-150 et seq., the continued or recurrent performance of any acts for which a license may be revoked or suspended under this article is hereby declared to be detrimental to the health, safety, comfort and convenience of the public and is a nuisance. The city, as an additional or alternative remedy, may institute injunctive proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to abate the same. 
(Ord. No. 2007-027, § 6-15, 11-6-2007)  
Sec. 38-316. - Penalties and interest. 
(a)  All licenses not paid in full within 30 days from the date they fall due shall be increased by 15 percent for the first 30 days they shall be delinquent and shall be measured by an additional 15 percent for a delinquency of 60 or more days, but this provision shall not be deemed to authorize the delay of 30 days in the payment of the license due, which may be enforced at once. 
(b)  In the case of persons who began business on or after the first day of the calendar year, the license for such new business shall be increased by 15 percent for the first 15 days they shall be delinquent, and shall be measured by an additional 15 percent for a delinquency of 45 days or more.

(a)  The revenue officer or finance director shall have the authority to investigate all applications and may, at his sole discretion, refer any application to the city council for a determination of whether such license should or should not be issued. 
(b)  If the city council denies the issuance of any license referred to it, the city clerk shall promptly notify the applicant of the city council's decision.

(d)  Upon receipt of said notice the city clerk shall promptly schedule a hearing, to be held within 15 days from the date of receipt of such notice, before the city council and shall give the notice of the date, time and place of said hearing to the applicant. 
(e)  The applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear personally, or through his counsel, or both, and the city council shall proceed to hear any evidence which may be presented both for and against the issuance of said license. 
(f)  If the city council determines from the evidence presented that in order to either provide for the safety, preserve the health, promote the prosperity, or improve the morals, order, comfort and convenience of the inhabitants of the city said license should not be granted, it shall enter an order to that effect; otherwise, said license shall be ordered issued upon payment of any required license fees.

(b)  The conditions set forth in subsection (a) of this section as grounds for the revocation of a license shall also constitute grounds for refusing to renew a license.

Sec. 38-319. - Refunds on overpayments. 
(a)  Any taxpayer may file a petition for refund with the city for any overpayment of business license tax erroneously paid to the city. If a final assessment for the tax has been entered by the city, a petition for refund of all or a portion of the tax may be filed only if the final assessment has been paid in full prior to or simultaneously with the filing of the petition for refund. 
(b)  A petition for refund shall be filed with the city within two years from the date of payment of the business license tax, which is the subject of the petition. 
(c)  The city shall either grant or deny a petition for refund within six months from the date the petition is filed, unless the period is extended by written agreement of the taxpayer and the city. The taxpayer shall be notified of the city's decision concerning the petition for refund by first class U.S. mail or by certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested, sent to the taxpayer's last known address. If the city fails to grant a full refund within the time provided herein, the refund petition shall be deemed to be denied. 
(d)  If the petition is granted or the city or a court otherwise determines that a refund is due, the overpayment shall be promptly refunded to the taxpayer by the city, together with interest to the extent provided for in Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-51-92. If the city determines that a refund is due, the amount of overpayment plus any interest due thereon may first be credited by the city against any outstanding tax liabilities due and owing by the taxpayer to the city, and the balance of any overpayment shall be promptly refunded to the taxpayer. If any refund or part thereof is credited to any other tax by the city, the taxpayer shall be provided with a written detailed statement showing the amount of overpayment, the amount credited for payment to other taxes, and the resulting amount of the refund. 
(e)  A taxpayer may appeal from the denial in whole or in part of a petition for refund by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the circuit court of the county in which the city is located. Said notice of appeal must be filed within two years from the date the petition was denied.

If an appeal is not filed with the appropriate circuit court within two years of the date the petition was denied, then the appeal shall be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 2007-027, § 6-20, 11-6-2007)  
Sec. 38-320. - Delivery license. 
(a)  In lieu of any other type of license, a taxpayer may at its option purchase for $100.00 plus the issuance fee, a delivery license for the privilege of delivering its merchandise in the city if the taxpayer meets all of the following criteria: 
(1)  Other than deliveries, the taxpayer has no other physical presence within the city; 
(2)  The taxpayer conducts no other business in the city other than delivering merchandise and performing the requisite setup and installation of said merchandise; 
(3)  Such delivery and setup and installation is performed by the taxpayer's employees or agents, concerns the taxpayer's own merchandise in the city, and is done by means of delivery vehicles owned, leased, or contracted by the taxpayer; 
(4)  The gross receipts derived from the sale and any requisite setup or installation of all merchandise so delivered shall not exceed $75,000.00 during the license year; 
(5)  Any setup or installation shall relate only to (i) that required by the contract between the taxpayer and the customer or as may be required by state or local law, and (ii) the merchandise so delivered; 
(6)  If at any time during the current license year the taxpayer fails to meet any of the above-stated criteria, then within ten days after any of said criteria have been violated or exceeded, the taxpayer shall purchase all appropriate business licenses from the city for the entire license year and without regard to this section. 
(b)  Mere delivery of the taxpayer's merchandise by common carrier shall not allow the city to assess a business license tax against the taxpayer, but the gross receipts derived from any sale and delivery accomplished by means of a common carrier shall be counted against the $75,000.00 limitation described in the preceding section if the taxpayer also during the same license year sells and delivers into the taxing jurisdiction using a delivery vehicle other than a common carrier. 
(c)  A common carrier, contract carrier, or similar delivery service making deliveries on behalf of others shall not be entitled to purchase a delivery license. 
(d)  The delivery license shall be calculated in arrears, based on the related gross receipts during the preceding license year. 
(e)  The purchase of a delivery license shall not, in and of itself, establish nexus between the taxpayer and the city for purposes of the taxes levied by or under the authority of Code of Ala. 1975, title 40, or other provisions of law, nor does the purchase of a delivery license conclusively determine that nexus does not exist between the taxpayer and the city.

(1)  Maintain all parts of its system in good condition and in accordance with standards generally observed by the cable television industry. Sufficient employees shall be retained to provide safe, adequate and prompt service for all of its facilities. 
(2)  Maintain a conveniently located business office and service center to which subscribers may telephone without incurring added message units or toll charges. This office shall be open during all usual business hours and be so operated that complaints and requests for repairs or adjustments may be received by telephone at any time when any television signals are being broadcast. 
(3)  Dispatch personnel to investigate all service complaints and equipment malfunctions within 24 hours and strive to resolve such complaints as promptly as possible. Planned interruption of service shall be only for cause. Insofar as possible, planned service interruption shall be preceded by notice, be of brief duration, and occur during minimum viewing hours. 
(4)  Maintain a complete list of all complaints received and the measures taken to resolve them in form to be approved by agency. This list shall be available to the agency upon request. 
(5)  Permit the agency to inspect and test the systems' technical equipment and facilities upon reasonable notice during normal business hours.

Sec. 58-28. - Rates charged to subscribers. 
(a)  Any franchise issued shall set forth the initial rates which the grantee may charge its subscribers upon commencing service.

(2)  Support its credit and attract necessary capital under efficient and economical management; and 
(3)  Provide a return to equity owners commensurate with current returns on investments and other enterprises having corresponding rights. 
(c)  No rate established shall afford any undue preference or advantage among subscribers, but separate rates may be established for separate classes of subscribers and rates may reflect the increased cost of providing service to isolated or sparsely populated areas. In no event shall rates be established so low for any class of subscriber or for any geographical location as to prevent, discourage, restrict, or diminish competition in the furnishing of cable services. 
(d)  The city council shall have only the power, authority, and right to regulate the rates and charges made by the grantee pursuant to the franchise agreement in accordance with the terms and provisions of Public Law 98-549, cited in the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 approved and enacted by the United States Congress on October 30, 1984.

(a)  Any pavement, sidewalk, curbing or other paved area taken up or any excavation made by a grantee shall be done under the supervision and direction of the agency under permits issued for work by the proper officials of the city, and shall be done in such manner as to give the least inconvenience to the inhabitants of the city. A grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, and in a manner approved by the agency, replace and restore any such pavements, sidewalks, curbing or other paved area in as good condition as before the work involving such disturbance was done, and shall also make and keep full and complete plats, maps and records showing the exact locations of its facilities located within the public streets, ways and easements of the city. These maps shall be available for inspection at any time during business hours by the agency. 
(b)  A grantee shall, at its expense, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove any of its property when required by the city by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, road construction, change of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracts, or any type of municipal improvements; provided, however, that the grantee shall, in all such cases, have the privilege of abandoning any property in place. 
(c)  A grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of a building. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting same, and the grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The grantee shall be given not less than 72 hours' advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
(d)  A grantee shall have authority to trim the trees upon and overhanging the public streets so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires and cables of the grantee, except at the option of the city such trimming may be done by it or under its supervision and direction at the expense of the grantee. 
(e)  In all sections of the franchise area where the cable wires, or other similar facilities of public utilities are placed underground, the grantee shall place its cables, wires or other like facilities underground to the maximum extent that existing technology reasonably permits the grantee to do so.

(5)  Complete construction of 40 percent of its proposed system, measured in terms of total linear strand miles, within two years after receiving certification from the FCC, and complete an additional 20 percent each year thereafter so that after five years the entire system shall be substantially constructed, and the grantee capable of providing service, no more than 60 days after receiving an application for service, to every dwelling unit within the franchise area except to the extent that density of homes, adverse terrain, or other factors render making service available impracticable. For the purposes of determining compliance with the provisions of this subsection, and to provide for a reasonable policy requiring extension of energized trunk lines of the cable system within the franchise area so as to achieve compliance with the obligations imposed by this section, the grantee shall extend such lines to all areas of the franchise areas having a minimum of 50 homes per street mile. 
(6)  File a map and progress report with the agency at the close of each calendar year showing the exact areas of the city being served by the cable television system and the location and identification of major component parts of the system. 
(b)  Failure on the part of a grantee to commence and diligently pursue each of the foregoing requirements and to complete each of the matters set forth herein, shall be grounds for termination of its franchise pursuant to the terms of section 58-63(b) hereof; provided, however, that the city council may, at its discretion, extend the time for the commencement and completion of construction and installation for additional periods in the event the grantee, acting in good faith, experiences delays by reasons of circumstances beyond its control. 
(c)  Upon the failure of a grantee to satisfactorily complete any work upon the public streets as may be required by law or the terms of its franchise within the time prescribed, the city, at its option, may cause such work to be done, and the grantee shall pay to the city the cost thereof within 30 days after receipt of an itemized report.

Sec. 58-31. - Public service requirements. 
A grantee shall:

Any additional service outlets to such facilities shall be charged on the basis of labor and material cost plus a reasonable overhead thereon. 
(2)  Make its facilities immediately available to the city, upon request, during the course of any emergency or disaster; and allow for installation of an emergency or disaster warning system to be installed in conjunction with normal cable operation. 
(3)  Provide, in accordance with FCC requirements, channels for local government, education, and public access use. No charge except as may be permitted by FCC rules shall be made for such use, but such use shall be subject to reasonable terms and conditions established by the grantee in accordance with the rules of the FCC. 
(4)  Construct and maintain local production facilities to serve the needs of the entities utilizing public service channels, the use of which shall also be subject to reasonable terms and conditions established by the grantee in accordance with the rules of the FCC.

Sec. 58-58. - Application procedures. 
This division itself grants no authority to operate a cable television system to any person. Such grants are only made by the adoption of a separate ordinance awarding a specific franchise to an applicant who has complied with the provisions of this article. 
(1)  Any person interested in obtaining a franchise to operate a cable television system in the franchise area shall submit a written application to the city council, together with a nonrefundable application fee of $100.00, which shall contain the following information: 
a.  The name, address and form of business of the applicant. 
1.  If the applicant is a corporation, it shall also state the names, addresses and occupations of its officers, directors and major stockholders, and the names and addresses of any parent or subsidiary companies; 
2.  If the applicant is a corporation controlled by another corporation, the names, addresses and occupations of the officers, directors and major stockholders of the controlling corporation shall also be stated; 
3.  If the applicant is a partnership or other unincorporated association, the name and address of each member, whether active or inactive, shall be set forth; and 
4.  If one or more partners are corporations, the names, addresses and occupations of such corporation's officers, directors and major stockholders shall also be stated. 
b.  A list of all other cable television systems, if any, in which the applicant, or any partner or major stockholder, has a substantial interest, stating the location, approximate number of homes served, and the name and address of the local franchising body. 
c.  A thorough description of the proposed cable television system to be installed and operated; the manner in which the applicant proposes to construct, install, maintain and operate the same; and the extent and manner in which existing or future poles or other facilities of public utility companies will be used in the proposed system, together with a map delineating proposed service areas if the applicant proposes to serve less than the entire city. 
d.  A schedule of proposed rates and charges to all classes of subscribers for both installation and monthly service, and a copy of the proposed service agreement between the applicant and its proposed subscribers. 
e.  A copy of any contract which may exist between the applicant and any public utility providing for the use of such utility's property, such as poles, lines or conduits. 
f.  A statement setting forth all agreements and understandings, whether written, oral, or implied, between the applicant and any other person with respect to the proposed franchise or the proposed cable television operation. If a franchise should be granted to a person posing as a front or representative of another undisclosed person, such franchise shall be voidable by the city. 
g.  An estimate of the cost of constructing the applicant's proposed system, and a financial statement prepared in form satisfactory to the city council showing applicant's financial status and its financial ability to meet these proposed costs. 
h.  A sworn statement acknowledging the applicant's familiarity with and eligibility under the provisions of this division and the rules of the FCC and its intention to abide by the same. 
i.  Any such supplementary information as the city council shall at any time demand in order to reasonably determine whether the requested franchise should be granted. 
(2)  An application that has satisfied the criteria in subsection (1) of this section shall be accepted by the city for consideration and notice published of its acceptance. Such notice shall specify the place where a copy of the application can be viewed, and that the city will accept written comments relative to the application until the third meeting of the city council following the date of the notice. The notice shall specify that a copy of all written comments is also to be served on the applicant. 
(3)  The city council shall then: 
a.  Specify a date, not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days following the expiration of the filing period, upon which all bona fide applicants (i.e., those paying the prescribed fee, filing complete applications and responding to all proper inquiries) shall participate in a public hearing before the city council; and 
b.  Specify a public place where interested parties may inspect all bona fide applications. 
(4)  After hearing the evidence, opinions and representations of all interested parties including members of the public, the city council shall then render a decision awarding a franchise to one or more applicants, or rejecting all applicants if none is found qualified, based upon its findings as to the relative qualifications of the applicants, under satisfactory CATV service.

(Code 1992, § 6-168; Ord. of 7-3-1990, § 18)  
Sec. 58-59. - Limitations of franchise. 
(a)  Any franchise granted under this division shall be nonexclusive, and nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the city council from granting identical or similar franchises to more than one person, within all or any portion of the city. 
(b)  A grantee shall, at all times during the life of its franchise, be subject to the lawful exercise of the city's police power, strictly adhere to the city laws and ordinances, and such reasonable regulations as the city council may subsequently promulgate thereunder. No franchise issued pursuant to the provisions of this article shall be deemed, expressly or impliedly, to authorize the grantee to utilize its cable television system to provide any service in such a manner as to unlawfully damage any business competitor or other third party or violate any statutes or regulations of the United States or the state. Nor shall any grantee, by act or omission, engage in any anti-competitive practice in violation of any statutes or regulations of the United States or the state. The provisions of this section shall be enforceable in courts of competent jurisdiction against a grantee by any party who alleges injury as a result of an alleged violation thereof. 
(c)  All privileges prescribed by such a franchise shall be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy of the public streets, and the city council reserves the right to reasonably designate where a grantee's facilities are to be placed within the public ways. 
(d)  A franchise shall be a privilege that is personal to the original grantee. It shall not be sold, transferred, leased, assigned, or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, without prior consent of the city council expressed by resolution, and then only under such conditions as may therein be prescribed. 
(1)  Any such transfer or assignment shall be made only by an instrument in writing, which shall include an acceptance of all terms and conditions of the franchise by the transferee, a duly executed copy of which shall be filed with the agency within 30 days after such transfer or assignment. 
(2)  Consent of the city council shall not be granted until it has examined the proposed assignee's legal, financial, technical, character and other qualifications to construct, operate and maintain a cable television system in the city and has afforded all interested parties notice of an opportunity to be heard on the question. 
(3)  Consent of the city council shall not be arbitrarily refused; provided, that the proposed assignee possesses the requisite qualifications and agrees, in writing, to comply with all provisions of the franchise and this article. 
(4)  Transfer of 20 percent or more of the voting securities of a corporate grantee to a person not presently a stockholder shall be deemed to be a transfer of control. 
(5)  No such consent shall be required for a transfer: 
a.  In trust, of system assets by mortgage by other hypothecation, to secure an indebtedness; 
b.  To a parent or subsidiary of a corporate grantee; 
c.  To a corporation where stock is held by the same stockholders as a grantee; 
d.  Of less than 20 percent of the voting securities of a corporate grantee unless such transfer also results in a transfer of voting control; 
e.  Of stock from one present stockholder to another stockholder or unless such transfer also results in a transfer of voting control. 
(Code 1992, § 6-155; Ord. of 7-3-1990, § 1)  
Sec. 58-60. - Liability and indemnification. 
(a)  A grantee shall pay, and by its acceptance of a franchise specifically agrees to pay, any and all damages or penalties which the city may be legally required to pay as a result of grantee's installation, operation or maintenance of a franchise cable television system under this article whether or not the acts or omissions complained of are authorized, allowed or prohibited by the city. 
(b)  Grantee shall at all times indemnify the city and save the city harmless from any all claims, demands, and/or suits, whether for damages to person or property or for any reason whatsoever which the city shall be required to pay arising proximately, consequentially or otherwise by reason of the installation, operation or existence of such cable television station, or from the maintenance, continuation or use thereof or the abandonment thereof. 
(c)  A grantee shall also pay all expenses incurred by the city in defending itself with regard to any and all damages and penalties mentioned in subsection (a) of this section. These expenses shall include all out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and the reasonable value of services rendered by any employee of the city. 
(d)  The grantee shall maintain, throughout the term of the franchise, liability insurance insuring the city and the grantee with regard to all damages mentioned in subsection (a) of this section, caused by grantee or its agents, in the minimum amounts of: 
(1)  Workers' compensation insurance as provided by the laws of the state. 
(2)  $500,000.00 for bodily injury or death to any one person within the limit, however, of $1,000,000.00 for bodily injury or death resulting from any one accident. 
(3)  $100,000.00 for property damage resulting from any one accident. The insurance policies obtained by a grantee in compliance with this section shall be issued by a company acceptable to the city, and a current certificate of insurance, along with written evidence of payment of all required premiums, shall be filed and maintained with the agency during the term of the franchise. Such policies shall name the city as an additional insured and shall contain a provision that a written notice of cancellation or reduction in coverage of such policy shall be delivered to the city ten days in advance of the effective date thereof. 
(Code 1992, § 6-156; Ord. of 7-3-1990, § 6)  
Sec. 58-61. - Indemnity bond. 
(a)  Concurrently with the acceptance of its franchise, a grantee shall deposit with the agency, cash or acceptable negotiable securities fully guaranteed by the United States, in the amount of $50,000.00 to guarantee to the city the grantee's performance. In the event the grantee fails to comply with one or more of the provisions of its franchise, then the city shall retain such sum as damages for grantee's breach of its obligations. At such time as the grantee shall certify to the city council that construction of the system is substantially complete, and service available to substantially all residents of the city, such cash or securities may be replaced by a bond, written by an acceptable surety, in such amount to indemnify the city against any loss it may suffer in the event the grantee fails to comply with one or more provisions of its franchise. The grantee and its surety shall be jointly and severally liable under the terms of the bond for any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result of the grantee's nonperformance, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal of any property of the grantee in the event of default, plus a reasonable allowance for attorney's fees and costs, up to the full amount of the bond. The bond shall provide 30 days' prior written notice to the city council of any intention on the part of the grantee to cancel, fail to renew, or otherwise materially alter its terms. 
(b)  Neither the deposit or cash, nor the filing of an indemnity bond with the agency, nor the receipt of any damages recovered by the city thereunder, shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by the grantee or limit the liability of the grantee under the terms of its franchise for damages, either to the full amount of the bond or otherwise. 
(Code 1992, § 6-162; Ord. of 7-3-1990, § 12)  
Sec. 58-62. - Franchise payments. 
(a)  Any person awarded a franchise under this division shall pay to the city, each year during the life of the franchise, a franchise fee in the amount of five percent and/or the maximum allowed by the FCC of its gross subscriber revenues and five percent and/or the maximum allowed by the FCC of its auxiliary services revenues derived from its operation of the franchised cable television system within the franchised area limits. The amount of any application fee should be credited against the franchise fees thereafter becoming due. The franchise fee of five percent and/or the maximum allowed by the FCC shall become the effective rate upon passage of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
(b)  A grantee shall file with the city, within 90 days after expiration of any calendar year or portion thereof during which its franchise is in force, a financial statement certified by a responsible officer of the grantee, showing in detail the gross subscriber revenues, as defined herein, of the grantee during the preceding calendar year or portion thereof. It shall be the duty of the grantee to pay the city within 15 days after the time for filing such statement, the sum prescribed above or any unpaid balance thereof for the calendar year covered by such statements. 
(c)  The city shall have the right to inspect the grantee's records showing the gross subscriber revenues from which its franchise payments are computed and shall also have the right of audit and recomputation of any and all amounts paid under this article. No acceptance of payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for further or additional sums payable under this article or for the performance of any other obligation hereunder; however, an accounting rendered to the city and to which no exception is made within three years after the receipt by the city shall be deemed to be accurate and shall not thereafter be subject to question or made the basis of any claim by the city against the grantee. 
(Code 1992, § 6-163; Ord. of 7-3-1990, § 13)  
Sec. 58-63. - Term of franchise. 
(a)  Any franchise granted by the city council shall be for a term of 15 years following the date such franchise is accepted by the grantee and, upon application of the grantee and review of the performance of grantee in a pubic hearing, the city council may renew the franchise for successive 15-year periods, with such modification of terms as the city council may determine. 
(b)  The city council may terminate any franchise in the event the grantee shall refuse, or neglect to comply with, any material requirement or limitation contained in this article. 
(c)  Should the city council determine that the grantee is not, in its opinion, in compliance with this article and any franchise issued thereunder, it shall so notify the grantee, and the grantee shall within 30 days bring the franchise system into compliance, reporting corrective action taken to the city council. 
(d)  If the city council is not satisfied that compliance has been achieved, or that good faith progress is being made toward compliance, it may schedule a pubic hearing to determine whether the franchise should be revoked. The grantee and the public shall be given at least 30 days' notice of such a hearing, and all interested parties shall be heard in an open hearing. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the city council shall determine whether the franchise should be terminated and shall set forth, in writing, the facts and reasons upon which its decision is based. 
(Code 1992, § 6-154; Ord. of 7-3-1990, § 4)  
Sec. 58-64. - Renewal procedures. 
(a)  A franchise may be renewed by the city council for a period of up to 15 years upon the written request of the grantee without soliciting additional applications. Such a renewal request shall be filed at least six, but not more than 18, months prior to the expiration of the franchise and shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee of $1,000.00. A renewal request may propose modifications in the terms of a grantee's franchise that shall be considered by the city council, but in any case the city council may, upon its own motion, modify the terms of a grantee's franchise subject to the conditions set forth in subsection (b) of this section. 
(b)  Upon receipt of a request for a renewal of a franchise, the city council shall schedule a public hearing on the matter, giving at least 30 days' notice of such hearing and any franchise modifications proposed by either the grantee or the city council. After hearing all of the evidence, opinions and representations, the city council shall then render a decision to renew or not to renew the grantee's franchise, and if the former course is taken, whether or not its franchise should be modified in any way. A grantee shall file its acceptance of a renewal franchise within 30 days after it is offered by the city council and, upon failure to do so, shall be conclusively presumed to have consented to the expiration of its franchise.

Sec. 66-359. - Industrial user surcharge. 
(a)  Industrial discharge. Any industrial user (as defined by EPA in the General Pretreatment Regulations published in the June 26, 1978 Federal Register titled Part 403 General Pretreatment Regulations and any revision thereof) subject to, or that hereafter shall become subject to, the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or that requires a state indirect discharge permit issued by ADEM shall not connect or remain connected to the City of Prattville (city) sewer system without the prior written approval of the city. 
The city reserves the right to refuse and/or terminate service to any high strength industrial waste at its sole discretion. 
(b)  Industrial pollutant discharges. A wastewater treatment surcharge shall be assessed against any user whose discharge characteristics exceed the following pollutant strength in milligrams ("mg/L") per liter: 
Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) above 250 mg/L 
Total suspended solids (TSS) above 250 mg/L 
Chemical oxygen demand (COD) above 500 mg/L 
Fats, oils, and grease above 50 mg/L 
Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) above 60 mg/L 
Total dissolved solids (TDS) above 500 mg/L 
Total phosphorus above 4 mg/L 
If an industrial wastewater discharge contains excessive loading for both BOD and COD, the imposed surcharge will be based on one of the two parameters as determined by the city in its sole discretion. 
At the discretion of the director of public works and at such times when data has been compiled and established, additional or modified waste surcharge elements shall be imposed. Surcharges will be based upon the higher cost of treatment of the pollutant. 
Pollutant pounds shall be computed by multiplying a factor (to determine pounds from one mg/L for a liquid volume in hundreds of cubic feet) of 0.006242 times the volume of the wastewater (in hundreds of cubic feet) times the mg/L of wastewater as described in the table above. 
(c)  Surcharge rates. The rate at which the excess pollutants as identified in subsection (b) of this section shall be charged shall be determined on a periodic basis by the director of public works. The fee schedule may be obtained from the public works department. 
(d)  Sampling and analysis. Sampling and analysis charges shall be calculated and assessed as follows: 
(1)  Round trip mileage shall be charged per mile at the currently published Internal Revenue Service Standard Mileage Rate. 
(2)  Crew cost: $100.00 per hour (charged in ¼ hour segments at sampling site, each segment = $25.00). 
(3)  Laboratory analytical cost: Billed by wastewater characteristic, as defined in the laboratory fee schedule, which may be obtained from the Pine Creek CWF at 334.595.0888. 
(4)  Technical and administrative fees including data collection, calculations, entry, report dispersal and billing per sampling cycle: Flat rate of $50.00 per month. 
(e)  Fees . Cost incurred by the city for sampling, analysis and monitoring of industrial wastewater not otherwise provided for in this division shall be charged to the monitored industry on an actual cost basis. 
(f)  Sampling and flow measurement structures. Any person discharging or desiring to discharge an industrial waste mixture into the sewers or sewer works of the city, or any sewer connected therewith, shall provide and maintain in a suitable, accessible position on his premises, or such premises occupied by him, an inspection chamber or manhole, near the outlet of each sewer, drain, pipe, channel, or connection which communicates with any sewer or sewer works of the city, or any sewer connected therewith. 
Every such manhole, or inspection chamber, shall be of such design and construction which will prevent infiltration by ground and surface waters or introduction of slugs of solids by the installation of screens with maximum openings of one inch but of sufficient fineness to prevent the entrance of objectionable slugs of solids to the discharging wastes so that any authorized representative or employee of the city may readily and safely measure the volume and obtain samples of the flow at all times. Plans for the construction of control manhole, or inspection chambers, including such flow measuring devices as may be hereinafter required, shall be approved by the city prior to the beginning of construction. 
(g)  Volume of waste for surcharge calculations . When the public water supply is used exclusively, the water consumption during the previous month, as determined from the meter records of the city, shall be the valid basis for computing a sewage flow, to be used in calculation of the surcharge, unless actual sewage flow is measured by a recording meter of a type to be approved by the city.

Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damages occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of the building should be (i) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (ii) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means that the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in the Code of Federal Regulations (44 CFR §§ 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5)) and corresponding parts of this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in a hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal and state emergency management agencies upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the building code board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions; 
b.  So as not to violate the lowest-floor criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; 
(5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including duct work), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring must comply with 44 CFR §§ 60.3 (b)(8), (c)(6), and (c)(12). This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
(7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
(9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. No. 2005-019, § 16-65, 4-19-2005; Ord. No. 2009-009, § 16-65, 6-2-2009)  
Sec. 109-88. - Specific standards. 
In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with estimated BFE), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 109-87. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any nonresidential structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 109-61(6). 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on: (i) individual lots or parcels, (ii) in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (iii) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (iv) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 60 inches in height above grade. 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system designed by a registered engineer to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, fully licensed and ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions; or 
2.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (1) of this section. 
(4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 109-24, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
b.  Where no regulatory floodway has been designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE, as designated on the effective FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
c.  Only if subsections (4)a and (4)b of this section are satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
(Ord. No. 2005-019, § 16-66, 4-19-2005; Ord. No. 2009-009, § 16-66, 6-2-2009)  
Sec. 109-89. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A zones). 
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 109-24, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (approximate A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 109-24, then the administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this division. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the provisions in subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall apply: 
(1)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  All development in zone A must meet the requirements of sections 109-87 and 109-88(1) through (3). 
(3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 109-87. 
The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(Ord. No. 2005-019, § 16-67, 4-19-2005; Ord. No. 2009-009, § 16-67, 6-2-2009)  
Sec. 109-90. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
Areas of special flood hazard established in section 109-24, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot above the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 109-87. 
(2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus two feet, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above. 
(3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
(Ord. No. 2005-019, § 16-68, 4-19-2005; Ord. No. 2009-009, § 16-68, 6-2-2009)  
Sec. 109-91. - Standards for subdivisions and developments. 
The following standards for subdivisions shall apply: 
(1)  All subdivision and development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
(2)  All subdivision and development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All subdivision and development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
(4)  All subdivisions and development proposals, including manufactured home parks of any number of units, of which any portion is located in an area of special flood hazard within the city limits shall provide base flood elevation data with the preliminary plat or development plan submission. The special flood hazard area and the corresponding base flood elevations shall be included on final subdivision plats prior to presentation to and approval by the city planning commission.

ARTICLE III. - PRATTVILLE HISTORIC DISTRICT 
 
Sec. 113-51. - Findings. 
The city council has determined and hereby finds and declares the following facts are true and correct: 
(1)  The Daniel Pratt Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 recognizing the unique industrial and architectural heritage found in downtown Prattville. National Register designation provides protection from actions by the federal government, but no protection from action by state or local governments and private entities. 
(2)  Code of Ala. 1977, title 11, ch. 68 (Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-68-1 et seq.), permits cities, upon recommendation by their historic preservation commission, to designate and protect historic districts and properties. 
(3)  The Prattville Historic Preservation Commission has completed detailed surveys of historic properties in downtown Prattville in accordance with Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-68-6, and determined that the Daniel Pratt Historic District and additional areas of downtown Prattville are worthy and eligible for designation as a local historic district. The commission further finds that the area represents a significant aspect of the cultural, political, economic and social history of Prattville and contains structures which contribute to city's overall character and sense of place. 
(4)  The Prattville Historic Preservation Commission conducted a public hearing on November 29, 2007, at 6:00 p.m. to receive comment concerning the proposed district as required by Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-68-7. 
(5)  Notice of said public hearing was given in the November 24, 2007, issue of the Prattville Progress. Written notice of the hearing was provided to all of the owners of properties within the proposed historic district 20 days prior to the hearing. 
(6)  Based on the commission's report and recommendation, it is advisable and in the public interest that the city council designate the area generally known as downtown Prattville as a historic district as permitted by Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-68-6. 
(Ord. No. 2008-002, § 1, 1-3-2008)  
Sec. 113-52. - Designation of historic district.

DIVISION 2. - POST CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER REQUIREMENTS 
 
Sec. 117-111. - Findings. 
It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  Development and redevelopment alters the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge; 
(2)  These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology, which are harmful to public health and safety, as well as to the natural environment; 
(3)  These impacts may be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development and redevelopment sites; and 
(4)  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 ("Clean Water Act") and federal phase II stormwater rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management promulgated in response to federal phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas, including the City of Prattville, to adopt the minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this article. 
( Ord. No. 2018-008, 6-5-2018 )  
Sec. 117-112. - Purpose. 
(a)  General . The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of construction-related and post construction stormwater runoff can safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare; minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure; and protect water and aquatic resources. 
(b)  Specific . This article seeks to meet its general purpose through the following specific objectives and means: 
(1)  Establish standards for development and redevelopment that protects the integrity of watersheds and preserves the health of water resources; 
(2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-construction hydrologic response in their post construction state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm(s) in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, point and nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establish minimum post construction stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establish design and review criteria for the construction, function, and use of structural BMPs that may be used to meet the minimum post construction stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encourage the use of low impact site design practices, such as the use of vegetated stormwater conveyances and the preservation of green space and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable; 
(6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of the stormwater management systems to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no threat to public safety or public health; 
(7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, and approval of stormwater management systems, for the inspection of approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance; 
(8)  Assign responsibility and processes for approving the creation and maintenance of adequate drainage and flood damage prevention.

Section 35. - Uses-on-appeal. 
a.  The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide requests for approval of uses permitted on appeal as defined by Article 1, Section 4 and non-conforming uses as defined by Article 1, Sections 4 and 5. 
b.  Uses-on-Appeal shall require the submission of an application to the Board. The application shall be filed according to rules and submission requirements published by the Board. 
c.  Notice of the scheduled hearing shall be to the applicant and other interested parties in accordance with board rules. 
d.  The Board shall review the application for compliance with this ordinance and all other applicable codes and ordinances of the city. The Board shall make written findings determining that the proposed use-on-appeal will not: 
1.  Be contrary to the public interest and will insure that the spirit of this ordinance is observed; 
2.  Permit the establishment of a use prohibited in the zoning district; or 
3.  Cause a substantial adverse impact on property or improvements in the vicinity or in the district in which the proposed use is located. 
e.  The Board may impose such conditions for approval that it deems necessary in the particular case to protect the public interest and the intent of the Comprehensive Plan and this ordinance. Such conditions shall apply to the land, structure, and use for which the use-on-appeal is granted and not to a particular person. Violations of conditions lawfully attached to any use-on-appeal shall be deemed to be violations of this ordinance. 
f.  Any approval granted by the Board for a use-on-appeal shall pertain solely to that specific use at the location specified in the application. Such approval shall not be transferable to another use at that location or the same use at another location. 
g.  A use-on-appeal granted by the Board shall lapse and be of no effect if, after the expiration of one (1) year from the date of such action by the Board, no construction or change in use pursuant to such use-on-appeal has taken place. The Board may, for good cause shown, specify a longer period of time in conjunction with its approval to grant the use-on-appeal. 
( Ord. No. 2017-011, 6-20-2017 )  
Section 36. - Variances. 
a.  The Board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variances from the terms of this ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done. 
b.  A variance may be granted in such individual cases upon a finding by the Board that an unnecessary hardship does, in fact, exist. In no case shall the Board grant a variance that permits the land, building or structure to be occupied by a use prohibited within the zoning district in which the land, building or structure is located. 
c.  It is the intent of this ordinance that a variance be issued only to mitigate a physical condition of a parcel of land which poses a practical barrier to its development and use conformance with this ordinance. Variances shall be limited to the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land. 
d.  Before any variance is granted, the Board shall make written findings certifying the existence of the following standards. 
1.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands structures, or buildings in the same district. 
2.  That a literal interpretation of the ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of the ordinance. 
3.  That special conditions do not result from actions of the applicant (self-imposed hardship); 
4.  That granting of the variance will not confer any special privilege on the applicant that is denied by this ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; 
5.  That granting of the variance is in harmony with the intent and purposes of the ordinance; 
6.  That the variance will not adversely affect surrounding property, the general neighborhood, or the community as a whole; 
7.  That no non-conforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district, and no permitted or non-conforming use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts were considered as a basis for the issuance of a variance; 
8.  That the variance will not allow the establishment of a use not permissible under the terms of the ordinance in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of the ordinance in said district; 
9.  The variance requested is the minimum adjustment necessary to enable the legal use of the land, building or structure. 
e.  A variance granted by the Board shall lapse and be of no effect if, after the expiration of one (1) year from the date of such action by the Board, no construction pursuant to such variance has taken place. The Board may, for good cause shown, specify a longer period of time in conjunction with its action to grant the variance. 
( Ord. No. 2017-011, 6-20-2017 )  
Section 37. - Decisions and rehearing. 
a.  All decisions rendered by the Board of Zoning Adjustment shall be final and binding upon all parties. 
b.  No appeal of an administrative decision shall be reheard by the Board. 
c.  Once the Board of Adjustment has rendered a decision on a request for a variance or a use-on-appeal on parcel of property or portion of a parcel of property, no new application for a variance or use-on-appeal on the same property or portion thereof shall be accepted by the Board for a 365-day period. 
d.  However, during the 365-day period, the owner, or other party owning a legal interest in the property, may request a hearing before the Board of Zoning Adjustment to present facts or evidence demonstrating that conditions, as they existed at the time of the previous request, have changed substantially to warrant consideration of a request for a variance or a use-on-appeal prior to the end of the 365-day period. 
1.  Any applicant requesting a waiver of the 365-day period shall appear before the Board in accordance with the regular application and hearing procedure. 
2.  If the Board finds, by the affirmative vote of four members, that conditions have substantially changed and a waiver warranted, the applicant may submit a new application. Such new application shall be heard at a subsequent meeting, and shall be subject to all regular advertising and procedural requirements. 
3.  Allowing a new application and hearing does not obligate the Board to grant the requested action. 
( Ord. No. 2017-011, 6-20-2017 )  
Section 38. - Appeals. 
Final judgments or decisions by the Board of Zoning Adjustment may be appealed as specified by Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-52-81, as amended. Written notice of appeal must be filed with the Board within fifteen (15) days following the decision by the Board.

Section 41. - Procedure. 
The regulations and the number, area and boundaries of districts established by this ordinance may be amended, supplemented, changed, modified or repealed by the municipal governing body, but no amendment shall become effective unless it is first submitted to the Municipal Planning Commission for its recommendation. The Municipal Planning Commission upon its own initiative may hold public hearings, public notice of which shall be given, for the consideration of any proposed amendment to the provisions of this ordinance or the zoning map and report its recommendation to the municipal governing body.

(Ord. of 4-1-1975)  
Section 43. - Reapplication. 
If a parcel of property or portion of a parcel of property has been considered by the Prattville City Council for rezoning, neither the City Council nor the Prattville Planning Commission may consider another application to change the zoning district classification of the same parcel of property or a portion of that same parcel of property for a period of 365 calendar days from the day the City Council takes action on the rezoning. During the 365-day period, the owner, or other party owning a legal interest in the property, may request a public hearing before the Prattville Planning Commission to present facts demonstrating that conditions, as they existed at the time of the previous request, have changed sufficiently to warrant consideration of a rezoning request prior to the expiration of the 365-day period. Such public hearing must be advertised in the legal section of a paper of local circulation at least seven (7) days before the date of the hearing. The Planning Commission may grant a waiver by resolution of the Commission. Such resolution must be approved by six affirmative votes and contain a statement detailing what conditions that have changed since the previous rezoning request.

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note An Ord. of March 16, 1999, has been treated by the editor as superseding the previous site and off-street parking area landscaping requirements enacted by the uncodified Ord. of Dec. 1, 1998. The provisions of the Ord. of March 16, 1999, have been renumbered by the editor to avoid conflicts in section numbering. 
 
Section 141. - Purpose. 
This article is adopted to: 
(a)  Establish criteria for landscaping off-street parking areas in order to protect and preserve the appearance, character and value of surrounding properties, and thereby promote the general health, safety and welfare and overall quality of life for the City of Prattville citizens; 
(b)  Require planting and preservation of trees and other landscape elements to improve the appearance of commercial, industrial and multi-family residential off-street parking areas and promote the city as an attractive trade and service center; 
(c)  Preserve private property values through careful public investment in the appearance of rights-of-way and other public properties; 
(d)  Insulate public rights-of-way and adjoining residential properties from noise, glare, overall visual impact and other distractions originating from off-street parking areas; 
(e)  Partition large off-street parking areas with planting islands and peninsulas; 
(f)  Provide safer vehicle and pedestrian circulation within off-street parking areas and along public rights-of-way; 
(g)  Protect streams and watercourses from excessive storm water runoff and soil erosion, and to replenish underground water aquifers by using natural drainage and infiltration systems. 
(Ord. No. 98-027, 12-21-1998; Ord. No. 99-009, § 131, 3-16-1999)  
Section 142. - Scope of application. 
The provisions of this article shall apply to all commercial, industrial, multi-family residential and public developments within the corporate limits of the city. 
(a)  General requirements: Any off-street parking area (or system of parking areas) shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of this article. The landscaping criteria shall be as defined in the following table: 
	Type of Landscaping 
Number of Spaces 
in; Parking Lot 	Foundation 	Frontage 	Perimeter 	Interior 
20 or fewer spaces 	X 	X 		
2139 spaces 	X 	X 	X 	
40 or more spaces 	X 	X 	X 	X 
Site abutting a residential district (in addition to number of spaces) 			X 
(See Section 135.b.) 	
 
It is the policy of the City of Prattville that large shade trees should be planted wherever feasible in or near all off-street parking areas. 
(b)  Tree Replacement: Any heritage tree, as defined in this article, removed shall be replaced with either a Type 1, 2 or 3 tree, as defined in Section 136, Table 1 of this article according to the following schedule. Trees to be replaced may not be removed until after the Administrator approves the proposed landscaping plan. 
Diameter of Trees to be 
Removed 	Minimum Number of 
Replacement Trees 	Height 	Caliper 
48" or greater 	6 	6' 	1" 
37"47" 	5 	6' 	1" 
24"36" 	4 	6' 	1" 
 
(c)  Existing off-Street parking areas: An off-street parking area that is in existence at the time this article is adopted and does not conform to the provisions of this article shall be a legal non-conforming use. The parking area may continue as a legal non-conforming use until such time as concrete or asphalt is added to increase its parking capacity to greater than that on the adoption date of this article. At that time, the entire off-street parking area must be brought into conformity with the requirements of this article. However, the requirements of this article shall not be used to reduce the amount of parking required by the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Prattville. Where a legal non-conforming use must be brought into compliance with this article and the lot size does not permit the amount of required parking and landscaping, the Administrator shall approve a landscaping plan that as closely as possible meets the requirements of this article. The Administrator may reduce the required landscaping components defined in Section 145 in the following order: interior, foundation, perimeter and frontage. Reductions below fifty (50) percent of required landscaping shall require a variance from the Board of Zoning Adjustment. 
(d)  Parking decks: Only perimeter and frontage landscaping will be required for parking decks. The total number of spaces in the first floor of the lot shall determine the amount of perimeter landscaping required. 
(e)  Minimum compliance: The requirements of this section shall be considered minimum standards. The developer may use higher standards. 
(f)  Single-family dwellings: Single-family dwellings are specifically exempt from the provisions of this article, however, the provisions of this article shall apply to the parking areas for swimming pools, parks, clubhouses and other common areas in single family residential development maintained by a private homeowners association or any public entity. 
(g)  Alternative landscaping standards: It is recognized that some sites and developments may not or should not be landscaped to the exacted provisions of this article due to unique topographic features or in order to preserve unique natural features. In such instances, the Administrator may approve a landscaping plan which differs from the exact provisions of this article as long as the plan provides the same minimum landscaped area and provides the majority of the landscaping in the front and side yards of the site. Alternative plans shall not be used to grant variances from the required amount of landscaping or the total area to be landscaped.

Section 145. - General site and off-street parking area landscaping requirements. 
Landscaping of development sites and off-street parking areas shall be of four (4) types as described below and shall conform to landscape plans submitted and approved in accordance with the requirements of this section. 
(a)  Frontage landscaping and foundation planting requirements. Frontage landscaping shall require a landscaped strip with a minimum ten-foot depth along all adjacent public rights-of-way. Frontage landscaping shall include a minimum of one (1) tree and six (6) shrubs per full forty (40) linear feet of the frontage strip; shrubs are optional in areas where a berm at least four (4) feet in height is used, Trees and shrubs shall be well distributed, though not necessarily evenly spaced. 
A lot with less than one hundred fifty (150) feet frontage and adjacent to a right-of-way shall have a frontage strip depth of ten (10) feet; a lot with one hundred fifty (150) feet to two hundred fifty (250) feet frontage shall have a frontage strip depth of twenty (20) feet; a lot with over two hundred fifty (250) feet frontage shall have a frontage strip depth of thirty (30) feet 
For developments of two (2) or more acres with frontage of to two hundred fifty (250) feet or more, the frontage strip shall be bermed in order to minimize the visual impact of the off-street parking area, unless the Administrator determines that the natural topography does not require site to be bermed. The berm shall not have a slope of greater than one (1) foot of rise per three (3) feet of run, and shall not be less than four (4) feet in height at its apex. Landscaping of bermed perimeter strips shall be in accordance with all requirements as outlined in this section 
Frontage landscaping, at driveways and street intersections, shall have an area of visibility between the heights of two and one-half (2.5) feet and 6 feet above the street grade to afford a clear line of sight in the interest of vehicular traffic safety. This area at street intersections is a visibility triangle as defined in this Section 133. 
Foundation planting shall require a landscaped bed with a minimum depth of five (5) feet along the front of the primary structure. The bed shall contain shrubs, or other greenery with a minimum height of twenty-three (23) inches and a maximum spacing of four (4) feet. Greenery shall be planted within a bed of mulch or ground cover other than turf grass, and be protected by some barrier from damage by vehicles and maintenance equipment. Greenery shall be well distributed through not necessarily evenly spaced. 
(b)  Perimeter landscaping requirement. Perimeter landscaping must be provided within the property lines between the off-street parking area, adjoining properties. Planting areas existing in the public rights-of-way or on adjoining property shall not count toward the required perimeter landscaping area. Perimeter landscaping areas adjacent to adjoining properties shall be at least ten (10) feet in depth, excluding walkways, measured perpendicularly from the adjacent property to the back of curb. 
Should the parking area abut any Residential District as defined by Article 7 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Prattville, a higher perimeter landscaping criteria shall apply. The perimeter landscaping area along the common property line shall have a twenty (20) foot landscaped buffer area consisting of a solid unbroken visual screen, eight (8) feet high within two (2) years of planting, and in sufficient density to afford protection to the residential districts from the glare of lights, from blowing paper, dust and debris, from visual encroachment and to effectively reduce the transmission of noise.

The procedures for review and approval of a subdivision plat consist of three (3) separate steps. 
(1)  The initial step is the preparation and submission of a sketch plan of the proposed subdivision to the planning and development department to coordinate review of the plan. 
(2)  The second step is the preparation and submission of a preliminary plan of the proposed subdivision for planning commission acceptance. 
(3)  The third and final step is the preparation and submission to the planning commission of a final plat together with all required certificates. The final plat becomes the instrument to be recorded in the office of the judge of probate when duly signed by the planning commission secretary.  
Section B. - Sketch plan review. 
(1)  The purpose of this review is to give the subdivider and/or the agent an opportunity to confer with the planning commission and their technical advisors on the subdivision committee prior to drawing up detailed plans of the subdivision. 
(2)  Acceptance of a sketch plan is based upon general information rather than in-depth review; therefore, acceptance of a sketch plan is not binding toward preliminary plan acceptance. 
(3)  However, it is the prerogative of the planning commission to waive the sketch plan procedure should the subdivider and/or the agent formally request such action. 
(4)  Steps in obtaining acceptance: 
a.  Submission of plan: The subdivider or agent shall submit eight (8) copies of the sketch plan to the city planner for coordination of review by the subdivision committee and presentation to the planning commission. The sketch plan must be submitted at least thirty (30) days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting of the planning commission. 
b.  Review for plan: The sketch plan is reviewed for conformance to subdivision regulations, zoning, city departmental regulations, and other applicable ordinances and regulations. 
c.  Subdivision committee: This committee is made up of representatives of pertinent city departments, county agencies, and utilities. Membership is selected by the planning commission and the chairman shall be the city planner. The subdivision committee will review the sketch plan as submitted or as last modified and each member shall recommend acceptance, acceptance with stated conditions or reservations, or rejection with their reasons therefor in writing. It is not necessary for the committee to meet as a group. Each member of the committee may transmit their review directly to the city planner who shall transmit the committee's recommendations to the planning commission at their next regular meeting. 
d.  Action by the planning commission: The planning commission will consider only those sketch plans that have been reviewed by the subdivision committee and shall accept, accept with conditions or reservations or reject the plan. All commission action shall be recorded in the planning commission minutes. At the planning commission's discretion, a public hearing may be held on the sketch plan. The subdivider and/or agent will be notified of the action taken by the planning commission. 
(5)  The following information is required for sketch plan layouts: 
a.  General information: 
1.  Existing covenants, if any. 
2.  Available water and sewer, if public water is available, line size and estimated flow must be stated on the plan. 
3.  Number of residential lots. 
4.  Typical lot width, depth, and area. 
5.  Proposed protective covenants. 
6.  Proposed utilities and street improvements. 
b.  Sketch plan shall show the following: 
1.  Name of subdivision or other identification. 
2.  Topography at intervals of no less than ten (10) feet. 
3.  Boundary lines of the proposed subdivision. 
4.  Location of all proposed and existing streets in the subdivision boundary. 
5.  Adjoining development, property lines, streets, and water courses. 
6.  A sketch vicinity map showing the location of the proposed subdivision to the surrounding area. 
7.  A north point. 
(Res. of 3-6-2008)  
Section C. - Preliminary plan acceptance. 
(1)  General procedure: After conclusions have been reached about the sketch plan and acceptance granted, the subdivider must formally make application for preliminary acceptance, which is mandatory before the subdivision can be reviewed for final plat acceptance. Lot layouts may bear the seal of a registered surveyor or engineer; streets, water, and sewer layouts must bear the seal of a registered engineer. 
(2)  Preliminary acceptance tentative: Preliminary acceptance shall be tentative in nature and shall in no way constitute a waiver of the requirements to be met for final plat acceptance. Preliminary acceptance shall lapse if final plat acceptance is not obtained within one (1) year, unless such period is extended by the planning commission. Requests for any such extension shall be made to the commission in writing. 
(3)  Work prior to acceptance not authorized: Any grading or other improvements done prior to preliminary plan acceptance shall be at the risk of the subdivider. The planning commission shall not consider the cost of such unauthorized work as justification for variances of the subdivision regulations. 
(4)  Steps in obtaining preliminary acceptance: 
a.  Submission of preliminary plans: At least thirty (30) days prior to the planning commission meeting at which the plan is to be considered, the subdivider or his agent shall submit six (6) copies of the complete engineering plans and an additional six (6) copies of the lot layout to the city planner for distribution and coordination with the subdivision committee and planning commission. Certificates of approval from the various reviewing agencies shown in Appendix A-1 [to this Appendix B] shall be placed on a master file copy of the plat. 
b.  Review of the preliminary plan: The members of the subdivision committee will review the plan for conformance with the specific standards and specifications of their departments. Each reviewer shall recommend acceptance, acceptance with conditions or reservations, or rejection with the reasons therefor in writing. The city planner will review the plan for conformance to the approved sketch plan, the subdivision regulations, zoning ordinance, master plan, and other land use policies and plans of the planning commission. 
c.  Transmission of recommendations: Recommendations must be returned to the city planner by the date specified. After the receipt of recommendations from the subdivision committee, the city planner shall record all recommendations and submit them along with the preliminary plan to the planning commission for review. 
d.  Public hearing: The planning commission shall hold a public hearing regarding the proposed subdivision. Public hearings shall not be required for one (1) lot sell-offs, as addressed elsewhere in these regulations, or for replats affecting five (5) lots or less in an existing subdivision. Changes in accepted preliminary plans shall require a new public hearing if the changes affect more than ten (10) lots, create a new entrance onto a public street, create a new drainage outlet, or result in an expected increase in run-off from any proposed outlet by more than ten (10) percent. 
e.  Notice required: The planning commission shall give notice of all public hearings by publication of said notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the city and by sending notice by registered or certified mail of the time and place of such hearing not less than five (5) days before the date fixed for the hearing. Such notice shall be mailed to the owners of land immediately adjoining the proposed subdivision, as their names appear upon the tax roles in the county tax assessor's office. 
f.  Action by planning commission: The commission will consider only those preliminary plans which have been reviewed by the subdivision committee or which have been otherwise reviewed in accordance with these regulations. The commission may accept, accept with conditions or reservations, or reject the proposed plan or any parts thereof. The planning commission shall act upon the subdivision within thirty (30) days of the public hearing.

d.  Certificates of Acceptance: Upon approval by the planning commission, and completion of all items required by the preliminary plat, as determined so by the planning and engineering departments, the city planner will obtain the signatures of all required city departments. The subdivider or agent must obtain any signatures required from non-city officials. 
e.  Recording of plat: Within thirty (30) days following a signed final plat being returned from the city planner, the subdivider or his agent shall have the accepted plat recorded in the office of the judge of probate of the appropriate county. The subdivider or agent shall return at least one (1) copy of plat bearing an original stamp of the judge of probate office to the city planner who shall keep a file for use by the city.

(6)  Development prerequisite to final plat acceptance: A properly proposed and recorded subdivision plat means little to a prospective buyer until the actual physical transformation of raw land into lots suitable for building purposes can be seen. Improvements made by the subdivider spare the community a potential tax liability and ensure that lot buyers get that for which they have paid. The following tangible improvements or security and guarantee provisions shall be required before final plat acceptance can be made: 
a.  Required improvements: Every subdivision developer shall be required to grade and improve streets and alleys, and to install curbs, sidewalks, monuments, sewers, storm water sewers, fire protection systems, and water mains in accordance with engineering specifications established by ordinance, by these regulations, or as approved by the city's engineer and/or director of planning and development. 
1.  Monuments. 
(a)  Concrete monuments four (4) inches in diameter four (4) inches square, three (3) feet long, containing iron pipe or pin, and having a flat top, shall be set at all major corners in the exterior boundaries of the subdivision or sections thereof and at all points where the street right-of-way lines intersect the exterior boundaries of the subdivision or sections thereof. The top of the monument shall have an indented cross to identify properly the location and shall be set flush with the finished grade. 
(b)  All other lot corners and points of curve in street rights-of-way shall be marked with an iron pipe not less than three-fourths of an inch in diameter and twenty-four (24) inches long, driven so as to be flush with the finished grade. 
2.  Grading: All streets, roads, and alleys shall be graded so that pavement and sidewalks can be constructed to the required cross section. Fill placed upon building lots shall be properly compacted. A compaction report shall be furnished whenever fill on any portion of the lot exceeds three (3) feet in depth. 
3.  Storm drainage: An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water. On-site retention shall be provided for where required. 
4.  Streets, curbs and gutters, and sidewalks: All streets, curbs and gutters, and sidewalks shall be prepared and tested in conformance with any city ordinances or engineering specifications. 
5.  Sanitary sewers: All sewers shall be installed in such a manner as to allow connection of all platted lots. Where public sewerage is not available, a private sewage treatment system is required which shall meet the specifications of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management and/or the appropriate county health department. 
6.  Water Supply System: In subdivisions that connect with a public water system, water mains in the subdivision shall be constructed according to the latest standards adopted by the Prattville Water Works Board. Fire hydrants shall be installed according to Section 10-18 [26-100] of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Prattville. The Prattville Water Works Board or the appropriate water authority with jurisdiction over the subdivision shall approve of the completed system before acceptance by the Prattville Planning Commission. Even if the Prattville Water Works Board or the appropriate water authority with jurisdiction over the subdivision cannot provide the fire protection flows and water pressure required under Section 10-18 [26-100] of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Prattville to the subdivision on the date of preliminary plat approval by the planning commission, water and fire protection facilities in the subdivision must be constructed according to the above referenced standards 
7.  Street signs: The subdivider shall provide all street and regulatory signs within the subdivision. The signs shall be of the type and number and located according to the submitted and approved preliminary plat. Two (2) street signs are required for each four-way intersection and one (1) street sign is required at each three-way intersection, unless the planning commission sets other requirements. 
8.  Oversized facilities: The City of Prattville may participate in the cost of "oversized" improvements within subdivisions but serving a larger area (i.e. streets, sewer mains, drainage facilities, etc.) if the planning commission recommends such improvements and the city council authorizes them. 
9.  Screening provisions: Decorative walls, fencing, landscape screening, or a combination of these shall be required at the rear of double frontage lots and between properties with dissimilar uses to control access, afford safety, and protect or enhance the affected properties. 
b.  Performance and maintenance guarantee: It shall be a strict requirement of final plat approval that all improvements and utilities required herein or as may have been required at the preliminary plan stage, have been satisfactorily completed and installed in accordance with plans and specifications approved at the preliminary plan stage. Proof of compliance shall be evidenced by the certificate of the city department or other agency having jurisdiction. However, the planning commission may, in its sole discretion, and provided all other requirements of these regulations are met, accept, in lieu of the completion of such improvements and utilities; a performance bond with sufficient surety satisfactory to the city attorney, to secure to the city the actual construction and installation of such improvements and utilities at a time to be set by the planning commission and according to the plans and specifications approved therefor. 
c.  Maintenance guarantee: The subdivider shall be responsible for materials and workmanship of pavement, curb and gutter, sidewalks, sewer systems, drainage systems in the subdivision for a period of seven hundred thirty (730) days (2 years) following the date of acceptance of improvements for maintenance by the Prattville City Council if the subdivision is inside the city limits, or the Autauga County Commission or Elmore County Commission if the subdivision is outside the city limits. In addition, the subdivider shall be responsible for soil stabilization and maintenance of erosion control devices during the maintenance period. A maintenance bond, in an amount not to exceed ten (10) percent of the contract price of the subdivision and approved by the City Engineer, shall be posted before the final plat is signed by the City Planner. The City Engineer may require a higher bond as needed. If completed structures occupy 80% of the lots in the subdivision before the end of the maintenance period as listed above, the subdivider may request that the Prattville Planning Commission waive the time remaining and close the maintenance period. 
d.  It shall be the responsibility of the developer to assure that the loss of soil cover during construction and the one-year maintenance period does not result in deposition upon other properties, public roads, streams or drainage ways. The developer shall be responsible for cleaning mud, soil, debris, etc., from subdivision roads during the one-year maintenance period.

ARTICLE IV. - VARIANCES AND SPECIAL SUBDIVISIONS 
 
Section A. - Subdivision by certificate. 
(1)  Purpose. The procedure for plat approval contained in Articles III and IV may be waived by the planning commission in the case of a property owner who desires to convey a part or parts of a lot or tract of land, if it is the opinion of the planning commission that compliance with the foregoing procedure would cause an unnecessary hardship to the property owner and that by reference to existing maps or plats the planning commission can determine that the conveyance of such part or parts of a lot or tract is in harmony and conformity with the general requirements and minimum standards of design for the subdivision of land by these regulations. 
(2)  Request required: The property owner desiring approval for the conveyance of a part or parts of any lot or tract without complying with the provisions of Articles III and IV hereof may make a formal request to the city planner for such approval by the planning commission. All such requests shall include a survey map or plat. If the property is to be for commercial, industrial or multifamily housing uses, a site plan as required by the zoning ordinance, shall also be included with the request. If the property is to be used for single-family residential use and the property is in an accepted subdivision, a true copy of that plat may be substituted for the required survey. 
(3)  Action by planning commission: The planning commission shall consider such request and shall have authority to require such property owner to furnish such information as the planning commission shall deem necessary in order to pass upon such request. If, upon consideration of such request and evidence or information furnished by the subdivider, the planning commission is of the opinion that the land in the request may be conveyed without destroying the intent of these regulations, it may issue to the property owner a written certificate of acceptance containing any restrictions and conditions that the planning commission attaches. 
(4)  Style of certificates: The certificate of acceptance provided for in the above paragraph shall be executed and acknowledged by the chairman, vice-chairman, or secretary of the planning commission, and may be recorded in the appropriate probate office as evidence of compliance with these subdivision regulations.  
Section B. - Hardship. 
Where the planning commission finds that extraordinary hardships may result from the strict compliance with these regulations, it may vary the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided that such variation will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the comprehensive community plan or these regulations.  
Section C. - Conditions. 
In granting variances, modifications, and acceptance for experimental subdivisions, the planning commission may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objective of the standards or requirements, so varied, modified, or accepted. These may include, without being limited to: Personal security, performance or maintenance bonds, affidavits, covenants, or other legal instruments.  
Section D. - Experimental subdivisions. 
The planning commission may waive, vary, or modify the standards and requirements of these regulations, if in its judgment an unusual or experimental subdivision provides adequate public spaces and improvements for circulation, recreation, light, air, and service needs of the tract when fully developed, and which also provides such covenants or other legal provisions as will assure conformity to an achievement of the community plan.  
Section E. - Miscellaneous subdivision or tract development. 
Other types of subdivision or tract developments may be allowed by the planning commission when such subdivisions or developments come under the provisions of these regulations and are in keeping with their purpose and intent, and meet the general requirements specified in Article V, Section A. 
(1)  Large tracts or parcels: When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of streets in the future and for logical future resubdivision. 
(2)  Group housing development: A comprehensive housing development, including the large scale construction of housing units together with necessary drives and access ways, may be approved although the design of the project does not include standard streets, lot and subdivision arrangements, if departure from the foregoing standards of Article V can be made without destroying their intent. 
(3)  Commercial and industrial subdivision: Subdivision of land for commercial or industrial purposes shall conform to the provisions of these regulations and street development shall conform to the major street plan. Lot sizes shall be large enough to provide for necessary off-street parking and loading requirements. All commercial and industrial parking lots fronting on any of the streets in Appendix B shall be paved with a minimum of one (1) inch of asphalt. 
(4)  One lot sell-off provision: When a single residential lot is being subdivided out of a large tract of land, the secretary of the planning commission may approve such subdivision if the following conditions are met: 
a.  Only one (1) lot is being subdivided and no other lots have previously been sold from the tract. 
b.  No conflict exists between the proposed subdivision and the major street plan. 
c.  Two (2) copies of a plat meeting the requirements of Article III.D(5) a through i, and those portions of j as deemed necessary are presented. 
(5)  Mobile home subdivisions: The subdivision of a parcel of land into lots for mobile homes which are intended for sale or transfer shall be subject to the provisions and intent of these regulations, the zoning ordinance, and other regulatory policies or plans. 
(6)  Mobile home court or trailer park development: A parcel of land intended for development as a mobile home court, trailer park, or other similar development, shall be developed in accordance with all applicable zoning laws. Such developments are not considered subdivisions unless lots are sold. 
(7)  Planned unit or open space subdivisions: The regulations of Articles III and V may be modified by the planning commission to allow greater design flexibility in the case of subdivisions being developed pursuant to the planned unit or open space provisions of zoning ordinance.  
ARTICLE V. - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS 
 
Section A. - Conformity to general community plan. 
(1)  All proposed subdivisions shall conform to the city zoning ordinance and the community plan.

Section B. - Streets. 
(1)  General regulations: 
a.  Arrangement of streets: The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and locations of all streets shall conform to the community plan and shall be considered in relations to existing and proposed streets, topographical conditions, the public convenience and safety, and their appropriate relation to proposed land uses served by such streets. 
b.  Streets not shown on plan: Where such is not shown in the community plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either: 
1.  Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing major streets in surrounding area; or 
2.  Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the planning commission. 
c.  Minor streets: Minor streets shall be so laid out so that their use by through traffic is discouraged. 
d.  Buffering along arterials: Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the planning commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service access, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
e.  Access along linear barriers: Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, stream way or drainage way; the planning commission may require a street approximately parallel to or on each side of such right-of-way or feature. The location of any such road shall be determined with due regard for the proper use of land and for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
f.  Tangent requirements: A minimum tangent of one hundred (100) feet shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets or greater as determined necessary by the city engineer. 
g.  Sight distances: When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point by more than ten (10) degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to ensure a sight distance of not less than two hundred (200) feet for minor and collector streets and of such greater radii as the city engineer shall determine for other streets. 
h.  Angle of intersection: All streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. If the angle of intersection is greater than five (5) degrees from the vertical, the intersection must be approved by the city engineer.

*Major streets 
**The amount of right-of-way deemed reasonable to be required by dedication shall not exceed 120 feet in width. It is also deemed reasonable that an additional 20-foot setback be required along proposed arterial highways and streets, in addition to the setback required in the zoning ordinance. 
(5)  Minimum roadway widths: 
Pavement Width from Curb Faces 
Street Type 	(in feet) 
Arterial boulevard 	60 
Arterial street 	51 
Collector street 	42

*Vertical curves shall be such as to prevent abrupt change and shall be as approved by the city engineer. 
(8)  Gutter grades: The minimum grade of any gutter shall not be less than five-tenths (0.5) percent unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. Cross drains are not permitted on streets of collector level or above unless recommended by the city engineer. 
(9)  Horizontal curves: Where a deflection angle of more than ten (10) degrees in the alignment of a street occurs, a curve of reasonably long radius shall be introduced. On streets sixty-five (65) feet or more in width, the centerline radius of curvature shall be not less than three hundred (300) feet; and on other streets, not less than one hundred (100) feet. 
(10)  Vertical curves: Every change in grade shall be connected by a vertical curve constructed so as to afford a minimum sight distance of two hundred (200) feet, said sight distance being measured from the driver's eye, which is assumed to be three and one-half (3½) feet above the pavement surface to an object six (6) inches high on the pavement. Profiles of all streets showing natural and finished grades drawn to a scale of not less than one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet horizontal, and one (1) inch equals twenty (20) feet vertical, may be required by the planning commission. Delta, T, and R shall be noted on the vertical profiles. On major streets greater sight distance may be required by the city engineer. 
(11)  Cul-de-sacs (dead end streets): 
a.  Turn-arounds required: Minor terminal streets or courts designed to have one end permanently closed shall be no more than one thousand (1000) feet long unless greater length is necessitated by topography. All such streets shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around having an outside roadway diameter of at least eighty (80) feet and a street right-of-way of at least one hundred (100) feet. 
b.  Temporary turn-arounds: Where, in the opinion of the planning commission, it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of the subdivision. Such streets shall have a right-of-way of at least fifty (50) feet and be provided with a temporary turn-around having a roadway diameter of at least eighty (80) feet (Not required if stub out is only one (1) lot in depth). 
(12)  Alleys: 
a.  Where required: Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial subdivisions. The planning commission may waive this requirement where other definite and assured access is provided. 
b.  Where optional: Provisions for alleys along the rear of residential lots is optional except where, in the opinion of the planning commission, such alleys are advisable. 
c.  Alignment: At all intersections, changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe vehicle movement. 
d.  Dead ends: Dead end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, shall be provided with an adequate turn-around as required by the city engineer. 
(13)  Alternative street standards: Subdivisions not located within the corporate limits of the City of Prattville, in which public streets shall be accepted and maintained by a county government, may be developed to such standards and using such surfaces as the county shall direct, provided that: 
a.  Right-of-way widths and curb and gutter requirements shall not be less than those required by these regulations for comparable city road types. 
b.  All public roads shall be paved. 
(14)  Curb and gutter requirements: Curbs and gutters shall be required for all streets except those on which no lot is less than one and one-half (1½) acre in size, and no lot dimension fronting on a street is less than one hundred fifty (150) feet. Curb and gutter may still be required if, in the opinion of the city engineer, they are required for proper drainage. 
(Res. of 7-15-1999)  
Section C. - Sidewalks. 
(1)  Sidewalks required: Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of arterial and collector streets. Sidewalks are required on one (1) side of all other streets except alleys, cul-de-sacs upon which twenty (20) or fewer lots front, and loop streets upon which forty (40) or fewer lots front. The planning commission may make exceptions to this requirement in special cases where walks would serve no purpose or where the continuity of walks is not essential. Sidewalks shall not be less than sixty (60) inches in width on arterial and collector streets and forty-eight (48) inches on other streets. 
(2)  Location: Sidewalks shall normally be placed on the public right-of-way one (1) foot in from the property line. Under special conditions of terrain or other factors, the planning commission may approve alternate designs.  
Section D. - Easements. 
(1)  Location: Easements shall be located on rear, front, or side lot lines, as required and to the width specified by their prospective users. Drainage easements shall be as required by the city engineer. 
(2)  Major drainages: Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream or if such a proposed drainage way is shown on an adopted drainage plan, there shall be provided a storm water drainage easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such existing or planned drainage way. The width of such drainage easement shall be sufficient to contain the ultimate channel and maintenance way for the tributary area upstream. 
(3)  Alignment: Lots and easements shall be arranged in such a manner as to eliminate unnecessary easement jogs or offsets and to facilitate the use of easements for power distribution, telephone service, drainage, water, and sewer services.  
Section E. - Blocks. 
(1)  General requirements: The length, width and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
a.  Provisions of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use intended. 
b.  Zoning ordinance and health department requirements as to lot size and dimensions. 
c.  Need for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of street traffic. 
d.  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
(2)  Length: Blocks shall not be less than four hundred (400) feet nor more than twelve hundred (1,200) feet in length, except as the planning commission considers necessary to secure efficient use of land or desirable features of street pattern. 
(3)  Width: Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two (2) rows of lots, except where reverse frontage on a major street is provided or where prevented by topography or size of the property, in which case the planning commission may approve a single row of lots of suitable depth.  
Section F. - Lots. 
(1)  Layout: Lot sizes, width, depth, shape, and orientations, together with minimum building setback lines, shall be appropriate to the location of the subdivision, the zoning, and to the type of development or use intended. 
(2)  Size: Minimum lot dimensions must meet the requirements of the zoning ordinance and the health department. In such cases where requirements conflict, the larger requirement shall govern. 
(3)  Depth and width: Depth and width of properties laid out for commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate for off-street parking and loading. All lot depths shall be adequate for the use intended. 
(4)  Corner lots: Corner lots for residential use shall have sufficient width to permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets. 
(5)  Connection to public street required: Each new lot shall front upon a street whose right-of-way is not less than fifty (50) feet in width and which is connected with the public street system. 
(6)  Double frontage lots: Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries, or so as to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. The subdivider shall put in a planting screen easement of not less than ten (10) feet in width, and across which there shall be no right of access, along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other linear feature. 
(7)  Side lot lines: Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to streets except on curves where they shall be radial.  
Section G. - Preservation of natural features. 
In all subdivisions, due regard shall be given to the preservation of all natural features such as tree cover, natural groves, watercourses, scenic points, historic points, and similar community assets which will add attractiveness and value to the property.  
Section H. - Names. 
(1)  Street names not to be duplicated: No street names shall be used which will duplicate by spelling or sound or otherwise be confused with the names of existing streets, except where a proposed street is an extension of an existing street, in which case the proposed street shall bear the name of the existing street. Street names are subject to the approval of the fire department and the planning commission. 
(2)  Subdivision and development names not to be duplicated: Subdivision names and development names shall not be duplicated or be confusing with existing names. Such names are subject to the approval of the fire department and the planning commission.  
Section I. - Public sites and open spaces. 
Where a proposed park, playground, school, or other public use shown in the community plan is located in whole or in part in a subdivision, the planning commission shall request that an option to buy such land be extended to the appropriate public agency or body and that such land be reserved from development pending the action of the appropriate public agency or body. Failure of a public body or agency to exercise such option within sixty (60) days of notification shall be deemed nonacceptance.  
Section J. - Drainage and inundation. 
(1)  Plan required: A drainage plan shall be made for each subdivision by a registered engineer which shall take into account the ultimate or saturated development of the tributary area in which the proposed subdivision is located. Adequate provision shall be made within each subdivision to provide drainage facilities needed within the subdivision taking into account the saturated development of the tributary area. The storm and sanitary sewer plan shall be made prior to other utility plans. Engineering considerations in subdivisions and other development shall give preferential treatment to storm sewer improvements over other utilities and improvements. 
(2)  On-site retention: Where development will materially increase downstream flows, on-site retention of water may be required. 
(3)  Spillage agreements required: Off-premises drainage easements and improvements may be required by the Planning Commission, after consultation with the City Engineer, to handle the run-off of subdivisions into an appropriate drainage channel. If requested by the city engineer, the Planning Commission shall require that the subdivider provide the City of Prattville with a hold-harmless spillage agreement for all drainage from the subdivision. Such agreement shall be submitted on forms provided by the City Planner. 
(4)  Development restricted in flood areas: Low areas below the federally established 100-year flood level shall not be developed or subdivided unless and until the city planner may establish that the area may be developed in accordance with the city's flood damage prevention ordinance. 
(5)  Other information required: The city planner or the planning commission may require whatever additional engineering information is deemed necessary to make a decision on subdivision and other development in an area of questionable drainage. 
(6)  Conditions of acceptance of water bodies: Lakes, ponds, and similar areas will be accepted for maintenance only if sufficient land is dedicated as a public recreational area or park, or if such area constitutes a necessary part of a surface drainage control system as determined by the city engineer. 
(7)  Design: Storm sewers shall be designed in accordance with good, accepted engineering practice. In the case of questionable practices, the opinion of the city engineer will prevail. 
(Res. of. 7-15-1999)  
Section K. - Sewer and water standards. 
Subdivisions shall be designed to accommodate public water and sewer if it is available. Water and/or sewer will be considered available if lines of the proper size and flow, with pumping not required, are located within twelve hundred (1,200) feet of the property. Installation of all lines shall be the responsibility of the developer. If water and/or sewer is not available, private water supply and sewage disposal may be used subject to the approval of the appropriate county health department, and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.  
Section L. - Other utilities. 
Subdivisions shall be designed to accommodate electrical, gas, telephone, and if available, cable television utilities. The subdivider shall contact each of these utilities prior to submission of the preliminary plan and obtain necessary standards or other information which will allow service to the subdivision.  
ARTICLE VI. - SEVERABILITY AND SEPARABILITY 
Should any article, section, subsection, or provision of these subdivision regulations be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity or constitutionally of these subdivision regulations as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be invalid or unconstitutional.  
ARTICLE VII. - ENFORCEMENT 
All provisions of this regulation may be enforced in accordance with the provisions of Article II, Title 11, Chapter 52, Section 33 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended [Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-52-33].  
ARTICLE VIII. - EFFECTIVE DATE 
These subdivision regulations shall take effect and be in force from and after the date of publication in a newspaper of general circulation. Subdivision regulations heretofore adopted are hereby repealed.
