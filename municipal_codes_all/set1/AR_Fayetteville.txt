PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a publication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were Titles I-XIII of the City Code, adopted on August 3, 2004, as supplemented through Ordinance No. 5797, approved September 15, 2015; and Title XV, Unified Development Code, adopted on June 3, 2003, as supplemented through Ordinance No. 5818, approved October 20, 2015. 
The Code was republished in 2016 in two volumes with the inclusion of uncodified ordinances through Ordinance No. 5829, approved December 15, 2015. Volume I contains Titles I-XIII (General Ordinances), and Volume II contains Title XV (Unified Development Code) of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas. 
The Code has been organized into titles relating to a general subject and then divded into more specific chapters. The various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. 
Title and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a period. The figure before the period refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the period refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 10 is numbered 10.02, and the first section of chapter 50 is 50.01. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
(Title I) Chapter 10 CD10:1 (Title IX) Chapter 96 CD96:1 Code Comparative Table CCT:1   
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

33.065 - Findings 
The City of Fayetteville hereby finds and determines: 
(A)  There exists within and near the city, including the city's projected growth areas and the city's extraterritorial planning areas, a shortage of decent, safe and sanitary residential housing facilities available for rehabilitation, construction, or purchase on terms that persons and families of low and moderate income can afford to pay. 
(B)  Existing economic conditions including high rates of interest on residential mortgage loans, and a shortage of funds within lending institutions in the state for residential mortgage loans are operating to: Further restrict the rehabilitation, construction, and purchase of residential housing by persons of low and moderate income at reasonably affordable costs; create unemployment and hardship within the residential construction industry, adversely affecting residents of the city; and reduce and limit the value of property within the city; all of which adversely affect the city's tax revenues and which, if not alleviated, will lead to further urban blight and decay and result in disproportionately large expenditures for services by the city. 
(C)  The availability of mortgage financing to assist such persons and families in the rehabilitation, construction or purchase of decent, safe, and sanitary residential housing facilities will be aided by the providing of funds for mortgage financing of residential housing facilities by the creation of a Public Facilities Board pursuant to the provisions of Act No. 142 of the General Assembly of 1975. 
(D)  The providing of financial assistance in order to enable persons and families of low and moderate income to finance the costs of decent, safe and sanitary residential housing facilities is a proper public purpose as declared by the act, and by this determination of the City Council. 
(E)  The public purpose of financing residential housing facilities may best be served by establishing a Public Facilities Board to purchase mortgages on such residential housing facilities or make loans to mortgage lenders to provide financing for residential housing facilities as provided in the act. 
(F)  In addition to all other findings and public purposes stated in this ordinance, the development of housing, health care, and related facilities for elderly persons, regardless of income, serves a substantial public purpose and there is a significant need in the city for such facilities.

(1)  Without waiving its statutory sovereign immunity, the city establishes the following voluntary policy governing the permissible payment of reasonable compensation for property damage claims proximately caused by a failure of the municipally owned water or wastewater infrastructure system that results in a trespass into and damage to private property. 
(B)  Requirements for Property Damage Claims To Be Eligible for Compensation. 
(1)  The cause of the damage must be directly attributed to a failure of municipal infrastructure owned and operated by the Fayetteville Water and Wastewater utility, and cannot be associated with or caused by a private sewer or water connection or service line. 
(2)  The failure must not be caused by factors beyond the city's control such as loss of electrical service; flooding of its infrastructure; acts of third parties; failure of claimants to properly maintain protective devices (back flow valves, check valves, clean out caps, etc.); acts of God; and other circumstances beyond the city's control. 
(3)  A claim form must be completed in writing and submitted to the Mayor's Office within thirty (30) days of property damage occurrence. Claim forms may be supplemented later with additional information, bills, etc. as allowed by the Utilities Director of the City of Fayetteville. Failure to submit the initial claim form within thirty (30) days of the incident terminates the claimant's opportunity to request compensation. 
(4)  When a possible water leak claim has been promptly called to the attention of water and sewer staff who initially could not detect or determine the cause of such leak which then caused the property owner to invest in sump pumps and/or other reasonable measures to protect its property, compensation for such property damage prevention efforts may be paid pursuant to this article if a compensable water leak is later discovered or confirmed by city staff. 
(C)  Limitation of Any Compensation That Might Be Paid. 
(1)  Because the City of Fayetteville is protected by sovereign immunity, the city shall pay no compensation for any alleged damage associated with or related to any alleged personal injury (except a medical insurance deductible or co-payment) or any other damage except for property damage. 
(2)  Compensation which may be paid for damage to property shall be limited to the cost of cleaning or repair of the damage or, in the event that the cost of cleaning or repair exceeds the fair market value of the subject property, less salvage value, compensation shall be limited to the fair market value of the damaged property less any salvage value. No compensation shall be paid for inconvenience, loss of use, loss of profits or rents, consequential damages, or anything other than cleaning, repair or replacement of property, and, in extreme cases, dislocation expenses not to exceed three (3) days. 
(3)  No payment by the city may accrue to the benefit, directly or indirectly, of an insurance carrier, nor for any damage if such is covered by any insurance policy. If the insurance company waives any subrogation right, the city may pay an amount equal to the deductible already paid by the claimant for a property damage claim. Claimants shall be required to provide documents satisfactory to the city establishing their insurance coverage or lack thereof for any claim. 
(4)  The Utilities Department Director may not authorize any payment greater than $8,000.00 for any claim pursuant to this section. The Mayor may request the City Council to authorize an amount greater than $8,000.00 by resolution, but in no case shall the city pay more than $20,000.00 pursuant to this claims procedure for a damage claim related to a water or wastewater utility infrastructure occurrence unless in an extraordinary case the Mayor recommends and the City Council by two-thirds ( 2/3 ) majority approves an exemption from the $20,000.00 damage cap and approves a payment up to $40,000.00. 
(5)  This subsection does not pertain to nor affect in any manner the motor vehicle liability insurance requirements of A.C.A. §21-9-303 nor the claims procedure and limitations to comply with that state law. 
(D)  Discretion of the City. 
(1)  The city acting through its Utilities Department Director has complete and sole discretion whether or not to pay any compensation pursuant to this section if the claimant has properly and timely submitted the claim form and all necessary documentation. This section provides no right to compensation for any claimant, nor any right to appeal to the Mayor or City Council. 
(E)  Release Required if Compensation Paid. 
(1)  If the city offers to pay any compensation pursuant to this section, the claimant must sign a full release to receive the compensation offered by the city. 
(Ord. No. 5504, 6-5-12; Ord. No. 5938 , §1, 12-20-16) 
39.11 - Damage Claims Other Than Water And Wastewater Damage Claims 
(A)  Establishment of Property Damage Claim Compensation Policy. 
(1)  Without waiving its statutory sovereign immunity, the city establishes the following voluntary policy governing the permissible payment of reasonable compensation for property damage claims (other than water and wastewater) proximately caused by uninsured city vehicles, equipment, infrastructure, or personnel activities. Claims relating to city vehicles which are insured shall be handled by the city's insurance adjustor (currently the Municipal League) except that very small property damage claims may be voluntarily paid by the city if a full release is obtained. 
(B)  Requirements for Property Damage Claims to Be Eligible for Compensation. 
(1)  The cause of the damage must be directly attributed to a malfunction of such uninsured vehicle or equipment, neglect or misuse of such equipment by city personnel, dangerous disrepair of city infrastructure, or other similar situation. 
(2)  Any problem with the city's infrastructure that causes damage must not have been caused by factors beyond the city's control such as floods, tornados, ice storms or other acts of God, nor by acts of third parties, nor by the failure of a claimant to act in a reasonably prudent manner. 
(3)  A claim form must be completed in writing and submitted to the Mayor's Office within thirty (30) days of damage occurrence. Claim forms may be supplemented later with additional information, bills, etc. as allowed by the Chief of Staff of the City of Fayetteville. Failure to submit the initial claim form within thirty (30) days of the incident terminates the claimant's opportunity to request compensation. 
(C)  Limitation of Any Compensation That Might Be Paid. 
(1)  Because the City of Fayetteville is protected by sovereign immunity, the city shall pay no compensation for any alleged damage associated with or related to any alleged personal injury (except a medical insurance deductible or co-payment) or any other damage except for property damage. 
(2)  Compensation which may be paid for damage to property shall be limited to the cost of repair of the damage or, in the event that the cost of repair exceeds the fair market value of the subject property, less salvage value, compensation shall be limited to the fair market value of the damaged property less any salvage value. No compensation shall be paid for inconvenience, loss of use, loss of profits or rents, consequential damages, or anything other than repair or replacement of property. 
(3)  No payment by the city may accrue to the benefit, directly or indirectly, of an insurance carrier, nor for any damage if such is covered by any insurance policy. If the insurance company waives any subrogation right, the city may pay an amount equal to the deductible already paid by the claimant for a property damage claim. Claimants shall be required to provide documents satisfactory to the city establishing their insurance coverage or lack thereof for any claim. 
(4)  The Chief of Staff may not authorize any payment greater than $8,000.00 for any claim pursuant to this section. The Mayor may request the City Council to authorize an amount greater than $8,000.00 by resolution, but in no case shall the city pay more than $20,000.00 pursuant to this claims procedure for a damage unless in an extraordinary case the Mayor recommends and the City Council by two-thirds ( 2/3 ) majority approves an exemption from this $20,000.00 damage cap and approves a payment up to $40,000.00. 
(5)  This subsection does not pertain to nor affect in any manner the motor vehicle liability insurance requirements of A.C.A. §21-9-303, nor the claims procedure and limitations to comply with that state law. 
(D)  Discretion of the City. 
(1)  The city acting through its Chief of Staff has complete and sole discretion whether or not to pay any compensation pursuant to this section if the claimant has properly and timely submitted the claim form and all necessary documentation. Only the Mayor may request City Council consideration for an amount in excess of $8,000.00. This section provides no right to compensation for any claimant, nor any right to appeal to the Mayor or City Council. 
(2)  The city does not waive its sovereign immunity by considering whether or not to voluntarily pay any portion of a damage claim submitted for review under this section. The decision of the city is final and unappealable to any court. 
(E)  Release Required if Compensation Paid. 
(1)  If the city offers to pay any compensation pursuant to this section, the claimant must sign a full release to receive the compensation offered by the city.

Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable by the city before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. 
(B)  Additional Pretreatment Measures. 
(1)  Whenever deemed necessary, the city may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocated and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the WRRF and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(2)  The city may require any person discharging into the WRRF to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(3)  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the city, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users.

Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at the user's expense. 
(4)  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(5)  At the city's discretion and when deemed necessary the industrial user shall have a licensed wastewater treatment operator on duty at all times when treating and discharging regulated wastewater to the city's collection system. Said operator shall meet the license or level of operator qualifications deemed necessary for proper treatment per Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission's Regulation #3. 
(C)  Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans. The city shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan or other action to control slug discharges. The city may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the city may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the city of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by §51.079(F) of this article. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would violate any of the prohibited discharges in §51.075(B) of this article; and 
(4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(D)  Hauled Wastewater. Hazardous waste will not be accepted by truck or liquid waste hauler at the WRRF. 
(1)  Domestic waste haulers are required to submit an application to discharge liquid wastes. This application must be accompanied by a fee in accordance with §51.137(G). Hauled domestic waste may be introduced into the WRRF only at locations approved by the city and at such times as are established by the city. Such wastes shall not violate §51.075 of this article or any other requirements established by the city. A fee must be paid for each domestic waste load in accordance with §51.137(G). The city may require the domestic waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits. 
(2)  The city may require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The city may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The city also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this article. 
(3)  If the industrial waste is from a categorical user, the hauled wastewater must include waste analysis proving it meets the required limitations of its respective category. 
(4)  Domestic waste haulers and industrial waste haulers may only discharge loads at locations designated by the city. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the city. The city may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The city may require the hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. 
(5)  Domestic waste and industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. For industrial waste, the form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes. 
(6)  Any waste not deemed domestic by the city will be handled on a case by case basis at the discretion of the city.

For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §51.077(F) of this article. 
(D)  Periodic Compliance Reports. 
(1)  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the city but in no case less than every six (6) months, submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the city or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §51.077(F) of this article. 
(2)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(3)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the city, using the procedures prescribed in §51.079(J) and §51.079(K) of this article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(E)  Report of Changed Conditions. Each user must notify the city of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the change. 
(1)  The city may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §51.077(E) of this article. 
(2)  The city may issue a wastewater discharge permit under §51.077(G) of this article or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under §51.078(D) of this article in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow changes of 20% or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(F)  Reports of Potential Problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the WRRF (including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in §51.075(B) of this article), the user shall immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five (5) business days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the city, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the WRRF, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(3)  If required by the city, a notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (A), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(4)  Significant industrial users are required to notify the city immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
(G)  Reports from Unpermitted Users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports as may be required by the city. 
(H)  Notification of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. 
(1)  If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the city as soon as possible but no later than twenty-four (24) hours after becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also immediately repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within the time period specified by the city but at no time later than thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The user may not be required to resample if the city samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(2)  If the city performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the city will perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat sampling and analysis. 
(I)  Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste. 
(1)  Any person who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the City, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities (in writing) of any discharge into the WRRF of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the WRRF, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications to the city must be made prior to the commencement of the discharge. Notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section §51.079(E) of this ordinance. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections §51.079(A), (C), and (D) of this ordinance. 
(2)  In the case of any new regulations under §3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the city, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(3)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(4)  This reporting provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(J)  Certification of Permit Applications and User Reports. The following certification statement is required to be signed and submitted by users submitting permit applications in accordance with section §51.077; users submitting baseline monitoring reports under section §51.079(A); users submitting reports on compliance with the categorical pretreatment standard deadlines under section §51.079(C); users submitting periodic compliance reports required by section §51.079(D) (1)-(3). The following certification statement must be signed by an authorized representative as defined in section §51.074: 
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations. 
(K)  Analytical Requirements. 
(1)  All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. 
(2)  All independent laboratories performing analyses for users, including, but not limited to, self-monitoring, periodic reports on continuing compliance, baseline monitoring reports and/or split sample verification, shall be certified by the ADEQ Laboratory Certification Program for the specific analysis being performed. The city reserves the right to reject any analysis performed by an independent laboratory that is not duly certified for a particular analysis. 
(L)  Sample Collection. 
(1)  Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(2)  Except as indicated in subsection three (3) and four (4), below, the user must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four (24) hour flow-proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the city may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(3)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(4)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety (90) day compliance reports required in §§51.079(A) and (C), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the City may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by §51.079(D), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(M)  Date of Receipt of Reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date post-marked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(N)  Record Keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with best management practices established under 51.075(D). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the City, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the U.S. EPA, state, or city.

All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at least annually by a certified technician to ensure their accuracy. Calibration records shall be made available to the city upon request. 
(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the city and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article. 
(B)  Search Warrants. If the city has been refused access to a building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the city may seek issuance of a search warrant from the City District Court. 
(Code 1991, §51.080; Ord. No. 5739, 2-17-15) 
51.081 - Confidential Information 
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the city's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(Code 1991, §51.081; Ord. No. 5739, 2-17-15) 
51.082 - Publication Of Users In Significant Noncompliance 
The city shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the city's WRRF, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be applicable to all significant industrial users (or any other industrial user that violates paragraphs (C), (D) or (H) of this section) and shall mean: 
(A)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined in 51.074; 
(B)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by 51.074 multiplied by the applicable criteria: 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH; 
(C)  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by 51.074 (daily maximum, long term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the city determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of city or WRRF personnel or the general public; 
(D)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(E)  Failure to meet within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(F)  Failure to provide within forty-five (45) days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(G)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(H)  Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best management practices, which the city determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Code 1991, §51.082; Ord. No. 3965, §§2, 3 (Exh. A), 5-7-96; Ord. No. 4088, §8, 4-7-98; Ord. No. 5739, 2-17-15) 
51.083 - Administrative Enforcement Remedies 
(A)  Notice of Violation. When the city finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city shall serve upon such user either an informal warning or a written notice of violation. Within five (5) business days of the receipt of the notice of violation, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing an informal warning or a notice of violation. 
(B)  Consent Orders. The city may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §51.083(D) and §51.083(E) of this article and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(C)  Show Cause Hearing. The city may order a user which has violated or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the city and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least five (5) business days prior to the hearing. Such notice shall be served on a representative of the user who meets the criteria of an authorized signatory. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(D)  Compliance Orders. When the city finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance ordinances may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a national pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(E)  Cease and Desist Orders. When the city finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
(3)  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(F)  Administrative Charges. 
(1)  When the city finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may charge such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. The city may add the costs of administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the charge. 
(2)  Users desiring to dispute such charges must file a written request with the city clerk within ten (10) working days of being notified of the charge. The Sewer Committee shall convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the charge is upheld by the Sewer Committee, the city may also add the costs of the appeal, such as notices and orders, to the charge. 
(3)  Issuance of an administrative charge shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(G)  Emergency Suspensions. The city may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the WRRF, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection or water service, to prevent or minimize damage to the WRRF, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in §51.083(H) of this article are initiated against the user. 
(2)  If necessary, severance of the sewer connection or water service may occur without notice. 
(3)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city within five (5) business days. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(H)  Termination of Discharge. Any user that violates the conditions in §51.078(F) of this article is subject to discharge termination. Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §51.083(C) of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Code 1991, §51.083; Ord. No. 3965, §§2, 3 (Exh. A), 5-7-96; Ord. No. 5739, 2-17-15) 
51.084 - Judicial Enforcement Remedies 
(A)  Injunctive Relief. When the city finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may petition the appropriate court through the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The city may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(B)  Civil Penalties. 
(1)  A user which has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of violation. 
(2)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(3)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(C)  Criminal Penalties. 
(1)  A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than one $1,000.00 per violation, per day. 
(2)  A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the WRRF which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
(3)  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law.

(E)  Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The city may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan within the city's pretreatment program. However, the city may take other action against any user, including but not limiting to, misdemeanor and felony fines and imprisonment when the circumstances warrant. 
(Code 1991, §51.084; Ord. No. 3965, §§2, 3 (Exh. A), 5-7-96; Ord. No. 5739, 2-17-15) 
51.085 - Affirmative Defenses To Discharge Violations 
(A)  Upset. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (3) are met. 
(3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(a)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(b)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(c)  The user has submitted the following information to the city as soon as possible but no later than twenty-four (24) hours after becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) business days: 
(i)  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
(ii)  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; 
(iii)  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance; and 
(iv)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(4)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(5)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(B)  Prohibited Discharge Standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in §51.075(B)(1) of this article or the specific prohibitions in §51.075(B)(2)(c) through (r), except for §51.075(B)(2)(h), if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable biosolids use or disposal requirements. 
(C)  Bypass. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section: 
(a)  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(b)  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (C) and (D) of this section. 
(3)  Notice. 
(a)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city, at least ten (10) business days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(b)  A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards as soon as possible but no later than twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) business days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The City may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(4)  Bypass Prohibited; Exceptions. 
(a)  Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
(i)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(ii)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(iii)  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (3) of this section. 
(b)  The city may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (4)(a) of this section.

51.087 - Surcharge 
(A)  Any significant industrial user generating discharge which exhibits none of the characteristics of wastes prohibited in §51.075 but which has an average concentration of surcharge parameters in 51.137(E) in excess of the allowed strengths in 51.137(E) during a 24-hour period, may be required to obtain a discharge permit. Such discharge may, however, be accepted by the WRRF for treatment in accordance with extra strength surcharge requirements in 51.137(E). 
(B)  The city reserves the right to review and approve any waters or industrial waste entering the city's sewer system or proposed to be discharged into the system having an average daily flow greater than 10% of the design flow capacity of the plant which will treat the waste. In the event the city's measurement discloses such flow in excess of such capacity, the city shall be under no obligation to receive such flow in excess of 10% of designed capacity and the city's published rate shall not apply to such excess. An owner affected hereby shall be promptly notified of such determination by the city. A special contract, at the city's option, may be made with the user to accommodate such excess flow.

(1)  If a current customer has had water shut off for failure to pay city bills, the customer must pay a $35.00 reconnect fee plus the full amount of the back bill to receive water service. The Business Officer Supervisor may also require double the normal deposit if this is a recurring problem. 
(2)  If a new customer seeks to have water turned on at an address or residence which was shut-off for non-payment within the preceding sixty (60) days, the new customer must pay the back water bill before the water may be turned on. A new security deposit may also be required. 
(3)  The Business Office Supervisor or designee may waive the reconnect fee after taking into consideration the consumer's property ownership, credit experience with the consumer, payment record of the consumer, and status of current service deposit(s) the consumer presently has active with the city on other utility accounts. 
(4)  The Mayor may, in cases of extreme hardship (unknown water leak in customer's line, excusable neglect, etc.), authorize continued or beginning water service with extended payment terms for past due bills, reduction of amounts due, or other compromises. No compromise or settlement may violate the terms of any bonds for which water or sewer revenue is pledged. 
(D)  Government Consumers. Federal, state, county, and other local government consumers shall not be required to make a service deposit. 
(E)  Private Residential Consumers. A private residential consumer shall be required to make a minimum service deposit of $50.00 unless waived pursuant to subsection B. For the purpose of this division, a private residential consumer is defined as any single-family unit without regard to property ownership or a single apartment occupied by no more than four unrelated persons for which an individual meter is required. 
(F)  Other Residential Consumers. All other residential consumers, whether apartment houses, boardinghouses, fraternity houses, sorority houses, or other multiple-family dwellings where master meters are used shall be required to make a service deposit of $200.00. 
(G)  Impact Fee Requirements. All customers obtaining a new water service including building contractors obtaining water for construction purposes shall be required to comply with §159.02 of the Unified Development Code of Fayetteville Regulating Collection and Disbursement of Water and Wastewater Impact Fees. Individual deposits for each new water and sewer service are required. 
(H)  Commercial Customers. Commercial customers such as owners of hotels, motels, cafeterias, restaurants, service stations, car washing establishments, supermarkets, laundries, and industrial consumers shall be required to make a minimum service deposit of $100.00, or that equal to the highest one (1) month bill, whichever is greater. 
(I)  Rental Cleanup Deposits. Rental property owners obtaining water for rental cleanup purposes must sign the property owner's agreement which lists all properties to be covered under this section and states rental property owners will be billed for all of the services provided (water, wastewater and solid waste). At such time as an individual dwelling is occupied, the deposit required by subsection (B) of this section shall be made for that unit. Failure of property owners to pay billings as presented will result in cancellation of the property owner's agreement and all future service orders shall require a deposit equal in amount as set forth in subsection (E). The signed agreement, between the city and property owners must be executed prior to turn on service being provided and must contain a listing of individuals authorized to initiate service under the provision of this subsection. 
(J)  Water For Irrigation Purposes. All customers requesting water service for irrigation purposes shall be required to make a minimum service deposit of $50.00 for service whereas the water meter is sized one inch or less, $100.00 whereas the water meter is sized over 1 inch, or that equal to the highest one (1) month bill, whichever is greater. 
(K)  Delinquent Payment History. For all customer types, the service deposit amount required may be increased up to two and one-half (21/2) times the estimated maximum bill, as determined by the Business Office Supervisor or designee, if the customer has a history of delinquent payment or nonpayment of his bill. Increased service deposits may be required of all consumers whether residential, commercial, industrial, or irrigation services. 
(L)  Time of Payment. The Business Office Supervisor or designee shall determine with each application for water service whether the service deposit shall be paid at the time of application, or if said deposit may be billed to the consumer, in part or in whole, on the first month's billing or spread over several month's billings. 
(1)  In determining the required method of payment for the service deposit, the Business Office Supervisor or designee shall take in consideration property ownership, credit experience with the consumer, payment record of the consumer, and status of current service deposit(s) the consumer presently has active with the city on other utility accounts. 
(M)  Inactive Meter Use. In the event of water consumption on an inactive meter when no service deposit has been made, the water meter shall not be reconnected until the customer pays the required service deposit and pays a $35.00 reconnection charge plus the back bill.

(4)  When a common facility/building is served by multiple water meters and the water usage is for the same purpose, customers may petition the Water & Wastewater Director and/or the Finance & Internal Services Director to have the water consumption aggregated and have the tiered rates apply to the aggregated quantity. 
(5)  Water used for flushing and sampling of newly constructed water lines, Fire Department training and equipment calibration, and other similar uses requiring a large volume and/or high velocity of water movement shall employ a fire hydrant meter of the appropriate size for the use. If a fire hydrant meter cannot be used due to high flow or volume requirements, then the volume of water used shall be measured by using a pitot gauge to determine the gallons per minute and by timing the flow of water to be able to calculate total volume. In the cases of fire department training and equipment calibration, sewer line washing, street sweeping, and other uses where the equipment employed has a built-in water meter, these built in water meters may be used. All such meters other than those on fire trucks must be evaluated by the Meter Superintendent. These water uses shall be billed at the same rates as non-residential customers. 
(6)  Monthly wholesale treated water rates outside city limits are based on Cost of Service Methodology.

Cost of Service Methodology required by contract. 
(2)  Beginning January 1, 2012, all monthly sewer service charges shall be increased by 3% per year. 
(C)  Determination of Sewer Quantity Charge for Residential Customers. 
(1)  In the case of residential customers residing in a single family home, duplex, triplex, and/or fourplex, the average monthly water consumption for the preceding months of December, January, and February shall be computed separately for each customer, and a uniform monthly charge for each customer shall be determined by applying the schedule of rates set out in subsection (A) of this section to such average monthly water consumption. In the case of a residential user for whom a uniform monthly charge has been established and who moves to a new location the same uniform monthly charge shall apply at the new location. In the case of new residential customers, sewer averages shall be established based on the number of individuals residing within the dwelling unit, at a rate of 2,100 gallons per customer per month. This methodology of sewer averaging shall not apply to multi-family structures containing five (5) or more units in a contiguous building. 
(2)  In the case of sewer customers who do not have a water meter provided by a public water utility, the sewer usage volume billed shall be the average volume of all users in the sewer system in like dwellings from the most recent system-wide sewer average calculation. 
(D)  Determination of Charge for Non-residential and Major Industrial Customers. In the case of non-residential and/or major industrial customers, the monthly sewer charge shall be determined by applying the schedule of rates prescribed in subsection (A) of this section to the monthly water usage of such customers. In the event that a non-residential or major industrial customer discharging waste into the city's sanitary sewer system produces evidence to the Water and Wastewater Director demonstrating that a substantial portion of the total amount of water from all sources used for all purposes does not reach the sanitary sewer which is in excess of the factors used in establishing the rates in subsection (A) of this section, an estimated percentage of total water consumption to be used in computing charges may be established by the Water and Wastewater Director. The factors used in establishing said rates are on file in the office of the Water and Wastewater Director and are incorporated herein by reference thereto. Any rate so adjusted by the Water and Wastewater Director shall be effective for a twelve (12) month period beginning with the billing for the month when rates adjudged hereby go into effect. 
(E)  Extra Strength Surcharge. 
(1)  For all significant industrial users as defined in §51.074, whose wastewater discharge is greater than 300 mg/l of BOD 5 and/or TSS, the city shall levy an Extra Strength Surcharge for each parameter in accordance with the following unit charges: 
Table F3 Extra Strength Surcharges After 12/1/2011 Extra Strength BOD 5 $0.3145 per pound Extra Strength TSS $0.2209 per pound  
  
(2)  Starting after December 31, 2011, Extra Strength Surcharges shall be increased by 3% per year. 
(3)  Extra Strength Surcharges shall be billed monthly and shall be computed on the basis of water meter reading (wastewater discharge volume). 
(4)  All sampling and analyses of the wastewater characteristics shall be performed in accordance with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 136 approved methods. 
(5)  The volume of flow used in computing surcharge shall be based upon metered water consumption as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the city's business office. In the event that a user discharging waste into the city sanitary sewer system produces evidence to the city demonstrating that a portion of the total amount of water used for all purposes is not discharged into the sanitary sewer, a separate meter or meters or other approved flow measuring device may be installed at the user's expense, upon its request, to measure only that portion of the total flow being discharged into the city sewer system. If a surcharge is assessed by the city, it shall be shown separately on the monthly billing. 
(6)  Any person discharging industrial waste into the sanitary sewers of the city who procures any part or all of the user's water supply from sources other than the city, all or part of which is discharged into the sanitary sewer, shall install and maintain at the user's expense water meters of the type approved by the city for the purpose of determining the proper volume of flow to be used in computing sewer service charges. Such meter will be read monthly and tested for accuracy when deemed necessary by the city. Where it can be shown that a portion of the water measured by the aforesaid meter or meters does not enter the sanitary sewer system of the city, a separate meter or meters or other approved flow measuring device may be installed at the user's expense, upon its request, to measure only that portion of the total flow being discharged into the city sewer system. If a surcharge is assessed by the city, it shall be shown separately on the monthly billing. 
(7)  Computation of extra strength surcharges shall be based on the following formula: 
(a)  Extra strength surcharge: 
S = V × 8.34 × [BOD Unit Charge (BOD - 300) + SS Unit Charge (TSS - 300)]  
(b)  Where: 
S = Surcharge in dollars V = Sewer volume in million gallons 8.34 = Pounds per gallon of water BOD Unit 
Charge = Unit charge for BOD in dollars per pound BOD = BOD strength in parts per million 300 = Allowed BOD strength in parts per million TSS Unit 
Charge = Unit charge for suspended solids in dollars per pound TSS = Suspended solids strength in parts per million 300 = Allowed TSS Strength in parts per million  
(F)  Elkins Sewer Charges. 
(1)  Elkins' payment for wastewater treatment shall be based on 85% of the metered water purchased. The volume of wastewater received by Fayetteville at the "Point of Connection" shall be measured by the installed wastewater meter. Volumes of wastewater below or above the agreed upon percentage (85%) of metered water, as measured by the wastewater meter, shall be recorded on a monthly basis, with a reconciliation of the net difference to occur semiannually in June and December. If the reconciliation volume is over the agreed upon percentage, this amount shall be billed to Elkins in June and December at the actual computed cost of wastewater collection to and treatment at the Noland Wastewater Treatment Plant, not including the calculated rate of return and not including depreciation charges, but including any capacity surcharge, based on the most recent rate as determined in paragraph B of this contract. If the reconciliation volume is below the agreed upon percentage, the actual amount billed for the difference shall be refunded to Elkins in June and December 
(2)  Elkins Impact Fee Charges. The City of Elkins shall pay an additional $0.25 per 1,000 gallons of wastewater, for all wastewater volume charges including both the 85% of metered water volume and for wastewater in excess of the 85% of the metered water purchased billed volume.

(B)  Termination of Service. The city shall disconnect utility service in accordance with the following policies: 
(1)  When it becomes necessary for the city to discontinue utility service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only after all bills for service then due have been paid and deposit required has been made. It is the policy of the city to terminate service to customers for reason of nonpayment of bills only after they have been given notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The city's form for application for utility service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the title, address, room number, and telephone number of the official in charge of billing, clearly visible and easily readable provisions to the effect: 
(a)  That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set forth on the bill; and

DONOR RECOGNITION SIGNS 
PURPOSE 
The purpose of this directive is to provide policies which will govern the naming of park facilities currently owned or acquired by the City of Fayetteville. This policy statement takes precedence over any previous policies and guidelines which may have governed the naming of these facilities. 
POLICY 
In order to provide important capital facilities in Fayetteville Parks, it is pragmatic in a time of shrinking public dollars to seek outside funding. It is essential to have specific boundaries and criteria in establishing fair and proper recognition of significant facility donations. This policy sets guidelines for donations within parks as well as on trails. All sign and plaque designs must be incorporated into the design of the facility. Donor recognition signs shall adhere to the aesthetic values and design of the park. 
Donor recognition in parks is based upon the type of facility donated. Donor recognition on trails is limited on the trailheads unless there is an educational and/or art feature that is appropriate to be displayed along the trail. Recognition signs may not be predominant within the educational and/or art component. 
Recognition for each donation will be determined pursuant to the Recognition for Parks and Trails Facilities Policy. Any exceptions to this policy must be approved by City Council. Park Planners have the latitude to design signs recognizing donations based on site location and donor specific criteria. Naming of facilities donated must meet the Naming Park Facilities Operational Policy unless accepted under City Council resolution. The naming proposal will be presented to the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board for their recommendation to City Council. City Council has final approval of the park facility name, including the right to approve a different name. The option for naming facilities is only permitted under the Park Facility Diamond, Platinum, Gold and Silver categories. Minor items such as trash receptacles and flower beds cannot be named.

NAMING PARK FACILITIES 
PURPOSE 
The purpose of this directive is to provide policies which will govern the naming of park facilities currently owned or acquired by the City of Fayetteville. This policy statement takes precedence over any previous policies and guidelines which may have governed the naming of these facilities. 
POLICY 
Upon acquisition of a new park, the Director of Parks and Recreation will assign a nondescript temporary working name or subdivision name for the park facility to be used until park development begins. 
Once park development begins, the Parks and Recreation Department will receive and forward park facility name suggestions to the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board for review. The Parks and Recreation Advisory Board will discuss and approve the recommendations at their monthly meeting. Once a recommended name has been selected, the Parks and Recreation staff will forward the name to the City Council for its final park name selection including a potentially different name. 
The following items should be considered when proposing names for any park facilities: 
  Geographic location of the facility 
  Outstanding features of the facility 
  Commonly recognized historical event, group, or individual 
  Individual or group who contributed significantly to the acquisition or development of a facility 
  Individual who provided an exceptional service in the interest of the park system 
For an individual to be considered, the recommended name must be accompanied by a biographical sketch which provides evidence of historical significance or contributions to the Parks and Recreation Department or City of Fayetteville. 
The naming of plaques, markers, and memorials within park facilities must follow the policies as stated above. 
Note: A name recommendation from the Active Transportation Committee for trail facilities will be required prior to forwarding to the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board.

The City Council of the City of Fayetteville, Arkansas determines and finds that the operation of a rock quarry would be a nuisance to the citizens and City of Fayetteville, Arkansas if operated or used other than as prescribed in §113.02 and, therefore, should be abated by the reasonable regulations required by this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 5280, 10-20-09) 
113.02 - Regulations To Abate Nuisance

(4)  Upon timely request by the rock quarry operator, the Director of Development Services or designee is empowered to grant a variance of the time limitations for rock blasting if inclement weather or other condition beyond the reasonable control of the operator has caused a safety issue that requires rock blasting outside the 10:00 a.m. until 3:00 p.m. permitted period. Re-notification is not required unless the blasting is moved to another day. 
(5)  The rock quarry operator shall notify by telephone the Director of Development Services and any Fayetteville neighbor within a mile of his quarry who has requested such notification at least two hours prior to rock blasting. 
(B)  Operation of Rock Quarry.

All rock quarries within the city limits of Fayetteville shall only be allowed to operate with the following safeguards and measures to ensure that dust, dirt, mud, loose rock and gravel, and all other possible irritants or nuisance substances do not adversely affect Fayetteville residents. It is the express continuing duty of the licensed rock quarry operator to ensure all of these safeguards, requirements and measures are constantly enforced. 
(1)  Dust Control Measures. Water or other substances or measures must be fully effective during the operation of the rock quarry to ensure the quarry is in full and continual compliance with the requirements of the Arkansas Water and Air Pollution Control Act as administered by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality. A violation of the permit conditions required by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality can be grounds for a suspension or revocation of the City's Rock Quarry Operating License. (See §133.05) 
(2)  Loose Rock and Gravel. The rock quarry operator is responsible to ensure that all dump trucks leaving the rock quarry site that may utilize any city street and are carrying more than half a truck load of gravel, rocks or dirt have their load fully and properly covered. 
(D)  Control of Dump Truck Tailgate Banging. 
(1)  It is the express duty of the rock quarry operator to prevent a dump truck delivering anything to the quarry or receiving rock from the quarry to engage in dump truck tailgate banging as defined in §113.04 (E) at any time upon its property.

156.03 - Development, Parking And Loading 
Certain variances of the development, parking and loading regulations may be applied as follows: 
(A)  General Requirements. 
(1)  Undue Hardship . If the provisions of Development, Chapter 166, or Parking and Loading, Chapter 172 are shown by the developer to cause undue hardship as they apply to this proposed development (including, but not limited to financial, environmental, or regulatory) and that the situation is unique to the subject property, the City Planning Commission may grant a variance, on a temporary or permanent basis, to the development from such provision, so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided that the variation will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the development or parking and loading regulations. No variance shall be granted for any property which does not have access to an improved street. 
(2)  Conditions and Safeguards. In granting variances, the Planning Commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards to secure substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements so varied. 
(B)  Consideration by the City Council-Park Land Dedication . Any variation in the land dedication ratios or contribution formulas set forth in §166.04(B) shall be considered a variance and requires approval of the City Council. Upon recommendation of the Planning Commission after consultation by the commission with the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board, the City Council, upon determination that enforcement of §166.04(B) would cause unnecessary hardship, or that the problems or merits of the development reflect unique circumstances, may grant a variance of the requirements, provided: 
(1)  Consistent with Parks Plan. Any dedication of land or contribution in lieu of land or combination thereof shall adequately provide for the park and recreational needs of the proposed development and be consistent with the Fayetteville Parks Plan. 
(2)  Contributions of Services, Facilities, Etc. If the developer proposes to contribute services, facilities, or equipment in lieu of a cash contribution, such a contribution shall not be accepted by the city unless the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board has been consulted and provides a recommendation as to the appropriateness and safety of such contribution. 
(C)  Consideration by the Planning Commission. 
(1)  General Design Standards. 
(a)  Undue Hardship. If the provisions of these standards are shown by the developer to cause undue hardship as they apply to his proposed development, the City Planning Commission may grant a variance to the developer from such provisions, so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided that the variation will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of development regulations. 
(b)  Conditions. In granting variances, the Planning Commission may impose such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objective of the standards or requirements so varied. 
(2)  Commercial, Office and Mixed Use Design and Development Standards. A variance of the exterior appearance and design standards may be granted by the Planning Commission if it is determined that strict compliance with the code would result in an adverse safety impact, or if the standard should not apply due to a unique situation. In granting the variance the Planning Commission may require principal façades without a prominent entry-way to be designed with distinctive architectural details (such as changes in wall plane, glazing, human scale elements such as canopies, awnings, small scale lighting, or other feature) to ensure the intent of the code is met. 
(3)  Required Off-Site Improvements. 
Grounds. A developer may petition the Planning Commission for a variance of off-site improvement requirements in whole or in part on one or more of the following grounds: 
(a)  No City Plans. The city has no plans for upgrading the substandard street or road on which off-site improvements are proposed to be required by the developer. 
(b)  Unfair Imposition. The proposed development has primary access to improved streets or roads and the portion of the development which fronts on a substandard street or road is so small or remote from anticipated future traffic patterns as to cause an unfair imposition on the development. 
(c)  Alternate Off-Site Improvements. The developer proposes alternative off-site improvements which will protect the health, safety, and welfare of persons residing in the proposed development and the surrounding area and equally benefit said persons. 
(d)  Improved Streets or Roads. The developer does not propose access to the proposed development from an existing substandard street or road, and proposes to provide access by streets or roads improved to current city or county standards. 
(4)  Buffer Strips and Screening.

The Planning Commission's approval of said variance must be affirmed by the City Council to become effective, and a denial of the requested variance may be appealed to the City Council. 
(7)  Flood Damage Prevention Code. The Planning Commission shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirement of this ordinance.

(b)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures identified in the remainder of this ordinance. Variances may only be issued for such repair, or rehabilitation if strict enforcement of the ordinance would preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(c)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (1) through (11) of §168.03(A) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(d)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(e)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(f)  Floodplain variances shall only be issued if: 
(i)  There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved or to the intended use of the property, which do not apply generally to other property in the same flood zone; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and, 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with the other provisions of the Code of Fayetteville. 
(g)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of §168.03(A) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(h)  Upon consideration of the factors in this section, and the purpose of this ordinance, the Planning Commission may impose conditions to the granting of floodplain variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this ordinance. 
(i)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the regulatory flood elevation surcharge and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the Washington County Clerk and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
(8)  Outdoor Lighting Plan. 
(a)  Undue Hardship. So that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, a developer may petition the Planning Commission for a variance from the requirements of Chapter 176: Outdoor Lighting, by showing that their strict application would cause undue hardship as applied to the proposed development; provided that such variance shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the chapter. 
(b)  Conditions. In granting variances, the Planning Commission may impose such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the requirements so varied. 
(9)  Bicycle rack variance. The Planning Commission may modify the design standards or the requirement for a bicycle rack. 
(10)  Streamside Protection Zones. 
(a)  Undue Hardship. If the provisions of the Streamside Protection Ordinance are shown by the owner or developer to cause undue hardship as strictly applied to the owner or developer's property because of its unique characteristics, the Planning Commission may grant a variance on a permanent or temporary basis from such provision so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest protected, provided that the variance will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the Streamside Protection regulations. 
(b)  Consideration of Alternative Measures. The applicant for the variance shall establish that a reasonable rezoning by the City Council or variance request from the Board of Adjustment will not sufficiently alleviate the claimed undue hardship caused by the Streamside Protection regulations. 
(c)  Conditions and Safeguards. In granting any variance, the Planning Commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards to substantially secure the objectives and purpose for the regulations so varied and to mitigate any detrimental effects the variance may cause. The Planning Commission should consider the Streamside Protection Best Management Practices Manual and any mitigation recommendations from the City Engineer.

(3)  It is not the intent of this ordinance that any monies collected for the water impact fee and the wastewater impact fee ever be commingled or ever be used for a type of facility different from that for which the fee was paid. 
(C)  Time of Collection. 
(1)  Water and wastewater impact fees shall be paid at the time of installation of the water meter serving the property or of the connection to the wastewater system, whichever comes first. 
(2)  Development projects which have obtained building permits prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall not have to pay impact fees if the building is completed with water and sewer hook-ups installed and Certificate of Occupancy issued no later than six (6) months from the effective date of this ordinance.

(2)  Redevelopment, Reconstruction, Change of Use. In the event of a redevelopment, reconstruction or change of use from an existing development or use, the fee shall be the difference between what the fee would be for the entire redevelopment or reconstruction project and what the fee would have been for the existing development or use. Existing development must be connected to the water or wastewater system at the time of redevelopment in order to apply this credit. 
(3)  Mixed Use. If the proposed development includes a mix of the residential land uses and/or nonresidential meter sizes that are listed in the impact fee schedule, the fee shall be determined by adding up all the water and wastewater impact fees that would be applicable for each residential land use type and/or nonresidential meter size as if it was a freestanding land use type. 
(4)  Fire Suppression/Low Pressure. It is the intent of this ordinance to base water and wastewater impact fees on the typical usage in a new building or other facility. Extinguishing of fires is not a part of typical usage; to allow adequate fire flow to sprinklers and internal hydrants at some large and at-risk properties, it may be necessary for fire protection purposes to install a larger water meter than would be necessary to meet day-to-day needs of that facility. In addition, a larger meter may be required in areas of low water pressure than in areas of normal water pressure for the same type of use. In those cases, it is the policy of the city that the impact fee for water and wastewater should be based on the meter size needed by that facility for its typical usage, without regard to fire-flow or unusual pressure conditions. 
(5)  Irrigation. Any separate water meter installed for irrigation purposes only shall not be included in the calculation of the wastewater impact fee. 
(6)  Affordable Housing Exemption. 
(a)  Single family and non-profit multi-family supportive housing. Construction of single family and non-profit multi-family supportive housing funded wholly or primarily by federal Community Development Block Grants, non-profit service organizations such as Habitat for Humanity, Housing and Urban Development housing loans and similar programs designed to provide affordable, owner-occupied, single family residences to low income individuals and non-profit multi-family supportive housing shall be exempted from payment of impact fees pursuant to this ordinance by the Impact Fee Administrator. 
(7)  Master Meters. In the event that a water master meter is utilized for any development including multi-family or mixed use, the fee shall be based on the Master Meter size. 
(E)  Use of Fees. 
(1)  Establishment of Accounts. An Impact Fee Fund that is distinct from the General Fund of the city is hereby created, and the impact fees received will be deposited in the following interest-bearing accounts of the Impact Fee Fund: 
(a)  Water Impact Fee Account; and 
(b)  Wastewater Impact Fee Account. 
(2)  Water Impact Fee Accounts. The Water Impact Fee Account shall contain only those water impact fees collected pursuant to this ordinance plus any interest which may accrue from time to time on such amounts. 
(3)  Wastewater Impact Fee Account. The Wastewater Impact Fee Account shall contain only those wastewater impact fees collected pursuant to this ordinance plus any interest which may accrue from time to time on such amounts. 
(4)  Order of Use. Monies in each impact fee account shall be considered to be spent in the order collected, on a first-in/first-out basis. 
(5)  Use of Fees. The monies in each impact fee account shall be used only for the following: 
(a)  Acquisition. To acquire land for and/or acquire or construct water or wastewater system improvements of the type reflected in the title of the account and as described in the Impact Fee Study as well as extension of service to new development paying an impact fee. 
(b)  Debt Service. To pay debt service on any portion of any current or future general obligation bond issue or revenue bond issue used to finance water or wastewater system improvements of the type reflected in the title of the account that created or will create capacity to serve new development. 
(c)  As described in subsection F, Refunds. 
(F)  Refunds. 
(1)  The City of Fayetteville shall refund the portion of collected development impact fees, including the accrued interest that has not been expended seven (7) years from the date the fees were paid. Interest shall be based on a 4% annual rate. 
(2)  A refund shall be paid to the present owner of the property that was the subject of new development and against which the fee was assessed and collected. 
(3)  Notice of the right to a refund, including the amount of the refund and the procedure for applying for and receiving the refund, shall be sent or served in writing to the present owners of the property no later than thirty (30) days after the date which the refund becomes due. The sending by regular mail of the notices to all present owners of record shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirement of notice. 
(4)  The refund shall be made on a pro rata basis, and shall be paid in full no later than ninety (90) days after the date certain upon which the refund becomes due. 
(5)  At the time of payment of the water or wastewater impact fee under this ordinance, the Impact Fee Administrator shall provide the applicant paying such fee with written notice of those circumstances under which refunds of such fees will be made. Failure to deliver such written notice shall not invalidate any collection of any impact fee under this ordinance.

164.06 - Minimum Buildable Street Frontage 
(A)  Purpose . The purpose of minimum buildable street frontage regulations is to ensure traditional town form by locating buildings and structures in the build-to zone adjacent to the street. 

(B)  Lot with one street frontage . 
(1)  Calculated by measuring the linear distance of the street adjacent to the lot and applying the minimum buildable street frontage requirement of the underlying zoning district. 
(2)  The minimum buildable street frontage requirement shall be met by locating the principal façade of the primary structure in the build-to zone. 
(3)  If the minimum buildable street frontage requirement cannot be met by locating the principal façade of the primary structure in the build-to zone, supplemental elements shall be required and shall not exceed 10% of the minimum buildable street frontage requirement. 

(C)  Through Lot . 
(1)  Calculated by measuring the linear distance of the higher functional classification street adjacent to the lot and applying the minimum buildable street frontage requirement of the underlying zoning district. When the two (2) adjacent rights-of-way of a through lot are of an equal functional street classification, the applicable street frontage to be measured shall be established by the property owner. 
(2)  The minimum buildable street frontage requirement shall be met by locating the principal façade of the primary structure in the build-to zone measured for the purposes of a through lot. 
(3)  If the minimum buildable street frontage requirement cannot be met, supplemental elements shall be required and shall not exceed 10% of the minimum buildable street frontage requirement. 

(D)  Corner Lot. 
(1)  Calculated by summing the linear distance of two (2) intersecting streets adjacent to the lot and applying the minimum buildable street frontage requirement of the underlying zoning district to the total. 
(2)  The minimum buildable street frontage requirement shall be met by locating the principal façades of the primary structure in the build-to zone at the intersection of the two streets measured for the purposes of a corner lot. 
(3)  If the minimum buildable street frontage requirement cannot be met supplemental elements shall be required and shall not exceed 25% of the minimum buildable street frontage requirement. 
(E)  Standards for Auto-Oriented Facilities. The intent of this section is to provide design standards for auto-oriented facilities in urban zoning districts. Auto-oriented developments such as fueling stations with convenience stores and drive-thru restaurants and banks utilize site development patterns that allocate a large percentage of the site area for vehicular movement and a necessarily smaller portion for the business structure. Urban zoning districts are designed to require traditional town form and the following standards are provided in an effort to achieve an improved development form for auto-oriented facilities. 
(1)  Drive-Thru Facilities. 
(a)  Auto-oriented developments that generate the majority of their business from a drive-in/drive-thru format shall make every effort but shall not be required to meet the minimum buildable street frontage requirement of the underlying zoning district. 
(b)  These facilities shall locate the building's principal façade within the build-to zone. Supplemental elements shall be utilized to make up the remaining minimum buildable street frontage requirement for the development site. 
(2)  Fueling Stations with Convenience Stores. 
(a)  These facilities shall locate the convenience store's principal façade within the build-to zone, but shall not have to meet the minimum buildable street frontage requirement of the underlying zoning district with the building. Supplemental elements shall be utilized to make up the remaining minimum buildable street frontage requirement for the development site. 

(b)  The preferred layout of a fueling station places the pumps near the rear of the lot while having the convenience store out in front near the street. This helps to highlight the building, shield the utilitarian pumps and canopy and pulls the curb cuts away from the intersection, creating safer and easier access. 
(c)  Fueling Station Canopy. 
(i)  Fueling station canopies should be designed as an cohesive part of the station architecture whenever possible, and are encouraged to be integrated with the overall roof structure of the convenience store. 
(ii)  The canopy structure shall be set back a minimum of 20 feet from the master street plan right-of-way; pump islands, compressed air connections and similar equipment shall be set back a minimum of 25 feet from the master street plan right-of-way line. 
(iii)  The canopy structure and supports shall be consistent with the design of the primary structure with respect to materials and design. Metal support columns must be clad (with brick, stone, wood etc.) to aesthetically complement the primary structure and provide greater variety in materials, unless they are architecturally designed for aesthetic interest. 
(iv)  Canopy supports shall have a minimum width to height ratio of 1:10. 
(v)  Canopy height, as measured from the finished grade to the lowest point on the canopy fascia, shall not exceed 13 feet 9 inches. 
(vi)  Canopy downspouts and related hardware shall be integrated into the structure to reduce visibility. 
(vii)  Canopy ceiling shall be textured or have a flat finish; glossy or highly reflective materials are not permitted. 
(viii)  Light fixtures mounted under canopies shall be completely recessed into the canopy with flat lenses that are translucent and completely flush with the bottom surface (ceiling) of the canopy. The sides (fascias) of the canopy shall extend at least 12 inches below the lens of the fixture to block the direct view of the light sources and lenses from adjacent property line. Lights shall not be mounted on the top or sides of the canopy. 
(ix)  When visible from the street, fueling station bays/pump islands shall be screened on the street side with articulated masonry walls 32 inches-42 inches in height, as least as wide as the pump island or bay; or 
(x)  A masonry screen wall 32 inches-42 inches in height shall be constructed between the drive aisle serving the fueling station pumps and the public sidewalk, within the build-to zone; or 
(xi)  A hedge row 32 inches-42 inches in height shall be installed between the drive aisle serving the fueling pumps and the public sidewalk, within the build-to zone, so long as a maintenance guarantee is provided that covers the installation and care of the hedge until it is grown to sufficient height and density to screen as intended.

164.12 - Nonconforming Structures, Uses And Lots 
It is the intent of this section to regulate nonconforming structures, uses or lots that are created when zoning designations or regulations are created or changed such than an existing lawfully established structure, use, or lot no longer conforms to the regulations of the Unified Development Code. It is also the intent of this section to permit nonconformities to continue as they exist presently and to guide future uses and development to be consistent with the city's planning policy and regulations. 
(A)  Nonconforming Structures. 
(1)  Nonconforming structures are permitted to exist for continued and creative reuse to contribute to the surrounding character, diversity, and services in the neighborhood until such structures are removed. 
(2)  Repairs to nonconforming structures or portions thereof are permitted, so long as the nonconforming portion of the structure is not enlarged in volume, area or footprint. 
(3)  Reconstruction of nonconforming structures or portions thereof amounting to less than 50% of the existing square feet are permitted so long as the nonconforming portion of the structure is not enlarged in volume, area or footprint. 
(4)  Voluntary removal, damage or destruction of a nonconforming structure or portion thereof amounting to 50% or more of the existing square feet shall require either complete removal of the structure or its reconstruction in conformance with existing regulations. 
(5)  Involuntary damage to or destruction of a nonconforming structure (from fire, winds or other calamity) shall permit the owner to rebuild, reconstruct or restore the structure on the same footprint of the original structure plus any addition or expansion that is allowed by the underlying zoning district. Such reconstruction is permitted as long as it begins within eighteen (18) months of the loss and complies with all other applicable zoning, development and building codes. 
(6)  For nonconforming structures located in a zoning district utilizing conventional building setbacks, building additions/expansions are permitted so long as the addition is in compliance with all current setbacks, building area and building height requirements of the underlying zoning district, along with all other applicable zoning and development ordinances. 
(7)  For nonconforming structures located in zoning districts utilizing build-to zones and requirements for a minimum buildable street frontage, all new construction that increases the existing building(s) footprint or volume of habitable space by 50% or more shall comply with the standards of the underlying zoning district. Building additions/expansions that increase the existing building(s) footprint or volume of habitable space on a property by less than 50% may be located outside of the build-to zone, so long as they are compliant with all other applicable zoning and development ordinances. 
(8)  Should a nonconforming structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
(9)  A structure or portion thereof within any zoning district may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
(10)  Owners of nonconforming structures are encouraged to keep such structures in good condition by regular maintenance and prompt repairs when necessary. If the city's Building Official notifies the owner of any unsafe or unlawful condition of the building, the owner must repair such unsafe or unlawful condition promptly. The Building Official may impose a reasonable time limit for the repairs to be complete. Failure of the owner to promptly and satisfactorily complete the necessary repairs may result in the City Council ordering a raze and removal of the structure. 
(11)  A nonconforming structure may be brought into conformity by way of an approved variance from the Board of Adjustment, a rezoning action, or by altering the structure to comply with the standards of the underlying zoning district. A structure constructed unlawfully shall not be considered a nonconforming structure for the purposes of this chapter and is a prohibited structure unless it is brought into compliance as provided herein. 
(B)  Nonconforming Uses. Nonconforming uses are declared by the underlying zoning district to be incompatible and are regulated to further restrict actions that would make the uses more permanent in their location or expand their nonconformity. 
(1)  Nonconforming uses of Land, Structures or of Structures and Land in Combination. Where a permitted or otherwise lawful use of land or of structure and land in combination exists which would not be permitted by subsequent regulations imposed by the Unified Development Code, the use may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions. 
(a)  Enlargement. No use of land or an existing structure devoted to a use not permitted in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the land or structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located or as required by other ordinances. 
(b)  Extending Use. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of the building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such buildings. 
(c)  Change of Use. Any nonconforming use of land, structure, or structure and land in combination may as a conditional use be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Planning Commission, either by general rule or by making finding in the specific case, finds that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change the Planning Commission may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of the Unified Development Code. 
(d)  Conditional Use Provisions Not Nonconforming Uses. Any use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under the terms of this chapter and has been approved by the Planning Commission (other than a change through Planning Commission action from a nonconforming use to another use not generally permitted in the district) shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall be without further action considered a conforming use. 
(e)  Superseded by Permitted Use. Any land, structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
(f)  Abandonment of Use. When a nonconforming use of land, a structure, or structure and land in combination is discontinued or abandoned for six (6) consecutive months, (except where government action impedes access to the premises), the land, structure, or structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(g)  Destruction. Removal or destruction of a structure with a nonconforming use shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50% of the existing gross square feet of the structure. 
(2)  A nonconforming use may be brought into conformity through a rezoning action by the City Council or by Conditional Use Permit by the Planning Commission, as applicable. A use established unlawfully shall not be considered a nonconforming use for the purposes of this chapter and is a prohibited use unless it is brought into compliance as provided herein. 
(C)  Nonconforming Lots . Lots that do not fully meet the requirements of the Unified Development Code to be considered a conforming lot for development, and thus are considered nonconforming lots, may be utilized for development in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  A proposed structure must meet all applicable building setbacks, height and lot coverage requirements and other applicable zoning and development codes, with the specific exception of the reason for which the lot is nonconforming. 
(2)  Such lot shall have frontage onto a public street, and water and sewer shall be provided to the lot at the time of development. 
(3)  Such lot shall have at least 50% of the required lot width and area of the underlying zoning district. 
(4)  A nonconforming lot that does not meet the provisions above may be brought into conformity by way of an approved variance from the Board of Adjustment, a rezoning action, or by combining a lot(s) in order to meet the standards of the underlying zoning district. A lot that was established unlawfully shall not be considered a legal lot of record for the purposes of this chapter and no building or development permit may be granted until the lot is legally established as provided herein.

(ii)  Required common open space shall be divided into no more than two (2) separate areas per cluster of dwelling units. 
(iii)  Common open space shall be improved for passive or active recreational use, garden/food production, social gathering spaces or landscaped areas. Examples may include but are not limited to courtyards, orchards, landscaped picnic areas, plazas or gardens. A detailed site plan of the common open space depicting the design and amenities of the space shall be reviewed with the site plan for approval. 
(iv)  Amenities such as permanent or movable seating, landscaping, trails and paths, barbeque or eating facilities, covered shelters or water features shall be included within the common open space. Low Impact Development stormwater management facilities may be placed within the common open space when they are integrated with the amenities listed above. 
(b)  Each cluster housing unit shall be provided with a private open space of 250 square feet with no dimension of less than ten feet. Private open space should be contiguous to each dwelling unit, for the exclusive use of each respective resident. In multi-family zones in which at least 75% of the planned units are attached dwellings, private open space shall not be required where the development exceeds the minimum open space requirements of (G)(3)(a) by at least 20% and it can be demonstrated that each unit has easily available access to open space amenities. 
(c)  Parking areas and driveways shall not be counted as open space. 
(4)  Fences. Fencing located between a cluster housing unit and a public street or trail or the common open space shall not exceed 48 inches in height. 
(5)  Parking Requirements and Standards. Parking areas should be located within the cluster housing development in such a way as to maintain the character along the public street and to minimize the noise and light impacts on private residences and public spaces. Reductions in parking space allowances are permitted in cluster housing developments as described in Chapter 172, Parking and Loading. Permitted on-street parking spaces adjacent to a project's frontage may count towards the parking requirements of the development. Parking standards for cluster housing developments shall be as follows: 
(a)  The owner/developer may choose to supply one (1) parking space per bedroom for his or her entire cluster housing development. Otherwise, the required number of parking spaces shall be determined according to the square footage of the cluster housing unit as described below:

(10)  Community Buildings. Indoor or covered common areas less than 2,000 square feet are permitted by right in cluster housing development. These structures shall be architecturally integrated with the architectural style of the cluster housing development. 
(11)  Recycling and Trash Collection Service. For the purposes of recycling and trash collection cluster housing developments are considered a residential use and should receive residential recycling and trash collection service (individual carts and recycling bins) where possible. In certain instances, it may be necessary to service cluster housing developments with commercial trash collection equipment (dumpsters). This may occur when a project is located in a predominately commercial area serviced by commercial trash pickup. It is incumbent on the developer to design recycling and trash collection facilities into the cluster housing development plan early in the process. The final determination of recycling and trash collection service and pick-up areas will be made at the time of development review by the city. Specific requirements for residential and commercial trash and recycling pick-up shall be as follows: 
(a)  Residential trash and recycling collection service requires a designated location near the street curb for trash carts and recycling bins. This location shall be kept clear of obstructions on the designated pick-up day. If this location is also used for on-street parking it shall be clearly marked and a sign posted restricting use for the designated pick-up day. An appropriate linear distance is required to accommodate each cluster housing unit's trash cart and recycling bin, subject to city approval. 
(b)  Commercial trash collection service requires a dumpster location that is freely accessible for front end loading and screened from public view. 
(c)  Recycling and trash facilities shall be located behind the front building setback line and shall be screened from the right-of-way and adjacent property owners by either architectural treatments or vegetative screening. 
(H)  Building Design Standards. 
(1)  Variety in Detached Cluster Housing Units Floor Plans and Architectural Treatments. These standards are intended to avoid the overly repetitive use of the same building design, structural features, detailing or finishes among detached units within the cluster housing development. In cluster housing developments no two (2) structures shall be identical in terms of exterior finishes. All cluster housing units shall differ from each other by utilizing at least two (2) of the following options: 
(a)  Variations in building material finishes such as clapboard, shake shingles, stone, brick, etc., and building color; 
(b)  Variations in adjacent cluster housing unit floor plans that alter the location of exterior windows and doors; 
(c)  Variations in the size of main floor area and/or building height of adjacent structures; or 
(d)  A front porch with a minimum width no less than 50% of the front building façade. Front porches shall have a minimum depth of six feet. No structurally identical front porches shall be located on adjacent cluster housing units. 
(e)  Variations in roof shapes or gables between adjacent structures. 
(f)  Other variations as approved by the Zoning and Development Administrator. 
(2)  All attached cluster housing units shall comply with §166.23, Urban Residential Design Standards. Where a cluster housing unit fronts onto a public trail or open space, the façade facing the public trail or open space shall be considered a principal façade, for the purposes of meeting this section. 
(I)  Variances From the Minimum Cluster Housing Development Requirements. Variances of this section, Cluster Housing Development, shall be administered as normal development regulations for variances of General Design Standards, except that (E) Zoning Regulations shall be administered as zoning regulations for variance purposes.

164.23 - Small Lot Design Standards 
(A)  Purpose. The purpose of these standards is to better maintain visibility, security, safety and aesthetics for pedestrians, drivers and the residents of homes built on relatively narrow lots. 
(B)  Applicability. These standards apply to new detached single-family homes with street frontage of 50 feet or less. 
(1)  Each home shall have a clearly defined front door and windows on the façade facing the street. This is only required on one (1) side of a home where there is more than one (1) street frontage. 
(2)  Garage openings that are on the same side of the home as the front door shall not protrude forward past the edge of the principal façade. 
(3)  The garage opening shall be less than 50% of the principal façade length unless the house has a second story with windows facing the street or has a balcony, deck, or similar feature which projects at least flush with the garage opening toward the street.

CHAPTER 165: - AIRPORT ZONE 

165.01 - Airport Zones; Establishment 
There are hereby created and established zones, which zones include all the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces as they apply to the municipal airport. Said zones are shown on the airport zoning map consisting of one sheet, which shall be made a part hereof by reference. An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(A)  Runway Larger Than Utility Visual Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(B)  Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(C)  Transitional Zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces. 
(D)  Horizontal Zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii for all runways designated utility or visual and 10,000 feet for all others from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones. The radius used shall be the longest determined for either end. 
(E)  Conical Zone. The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. 
(Code 1965, App. B., §III; Ord. No. 2697, 1-20-81; Code 1991, §150.03; Ord. No. 4100, §2 (Ex. A), 6-16-98) 
165.02 - Airport Zone Height Limitations 
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
(A)  Runway Larger Than Utility Visual Approach Zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline. 
(B)  Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. Slopes 50 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline; thence slopes upward 40 feet horizontally for each foot vertically to an additional horizontal distance of 40,000 feet along the extended runway centerline. 
(C)  Transitional Zones. Slopes 7 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation which is 1,251 feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping 7 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and the same elevation as the approach conical surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are established height limits sloping 7 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90° angles to the extended runway centerline. 
(D)  Horizontal Zone. 150 feet above the airport elevation; 1,401 feet above mean sea level. 
(E)  Conical Zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation. 
(F)  Excepted Height Limitation. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure, or the growth of any tree, to a height up to 25 feet above the surface of the land; provided, the 25 foot height limitation prescribed hereby shall not apply where the Federal Aviation Administration has approved a greater height limitation. 
(G)  Primary Surface Elevation. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline.

CHAPTER 166: - DEVELOPMENT 
Sections : 

166.01 - Development Categories 
(A)  Property Line Adjustment. A property line adjustment is a transfer or adjustment of a property line or lines between adjoining property owners which does not create a separate, new lot. A property line adjustment cannot dedicate new easements or right-of-way. 
(B)  Subdivision of Land. 
(1)  Lot Split. When a property is to be subdivided into two (2), three (3) or four (4) lots, the application may be processed as a lot split. Except for lot splits created pursuant §164.22 Cluster Housing Development (C) Development Review Process , after the creation of more than four (4) lots from an original parent tract, any subsequent subdivision of the parent or resulting tracts is required to be processed as a preliminary/final plat or concurrent plat. A lot split may dedicate new easements or right-of-way, and may be combined with an easement plat. 
(2)  Preliminary Plat. When a property is to be subdivided into more than four (4) lots, or when a parent or resulting tract has been subdivided three (3) or more times and is proposed to be further subdivided, the application shall be processed as preliminary plat. A preliminary plat establishes the preliminary location of lot lines, streets, and utility infrastructure, and allows for the applicant to request construction plan approval and install required improvements. 
(3)  Final Plat. After completion of the required infrastructure (water, sewer, storm drainage, utilities, street improvements, etc.) for a preliminary plat, the subdivider may submit an application for approval of the final plat. The final plat application may not be submitted until the final inspection for the required infrastructure has been scheduled with City Engineering staff.

At the time the Planning Commission or Planning Division (where applicable for administrative approval) grants development approval, the Planning Commission or Planning Division shall determine whether the proposed development creates a need for off-site improvements and the portion of the cost of any needed off-site improvements which the developer shall be required to bear; provided, that portion of the cost of off-site improvements to roads located outside the city's corporate limits but within the city's planning area shall be determined by the county. In determining that portion of the cost of off-site improvements which the developer shall be required to bear, the Planning Commission or Planning Division (where applicable for administrative approval) shall consider the acreage within the proposed development as a percentage of all the acreage which, when fully developed, will benefit from the off-site improvements; provided, the Planning Commission or Planning Division may use a different method of measurement if it determines that use of the acreage standard will not result in the developer bearing that portion of the cost which bears a rational nexus to the needs created by the development. 
(5)  Determining Necessity for Off-Site Improvements . 
(a)  When a proposed development has access to paved streets or roads only by way of substandard or unimproved roads or streets leading from the development to the paved streets or roads, the developer shall be responsible for contributing this proportionate share of the cost of improving the substandard access roads or streets to existing city or county standards. The developer's proportionate share of said costs shall be determined by the Planning Commission or Planning Division (where applicable for administrative approval) in accordance with the provisions of 166.04(A) above. 
(b)  When a proposed development has direct access to, or fronts on an existing road or street, which is below current standards, the developer shall be responsible for contributing his/her proportionate share of the cost of improving said street or road to existing city or county standards. The Planning Commission or Planning Division (where applicable for administrative approval) shall determine the developer's proportionate share of said costs in accordance with the provisions of 166.04(A) above. 
(c)  Off-site drainage improvements shall be required whenever a proposed development causes the need for such improvements. 
(6)  Delayed Improvements. The Planning Commission or Planning Division may determine a required on-site or off-site improvement shall be delayed or payment-in-lieu contributed instead in accordance with Chapter 158 of the UDC. 
(7)  Variances . A variance of off-site improvements may be granted in accordance with Chapter 156 Variances.

The developer shall be required to install a sidewalk adjacent to that portion of a state highway abutting the proposed development; and provided that the Planning Commission or Engineering Division (where applicable for administrative approval) may waive the sidewalk requirement prescribed by this subsection upon application by the developer and a determination by the Planning Commission or Engineering Division (where applicable for administrative approval) that the topography of the proposed development where it abuts a state highway is such that installation of a sidewalk is not practical. Any other improvements required of the developer by the Planning Commission or Engineering Division (where applicable for administrative approval) shall be coordinated with the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department. 
(B)  Minimum Improvements by Application Type. The property owner/developer shall be responsible for constructing the following minimum improvements. 
(1)  Property Line Adjustment. No improvements are required unless the action would create or exacerbate a nonconforming infrastructure situation such as cutting off a lot from public water, sewer, or street frontage.

Such lesser dedication shall be subject to approval by the City Council. 
(i)  Dedications. The City Council accepts all streets and alleys located in Fayetteville that have been previously approved and accepted as dedications by the Fayetteville Planning Commission/Subdivision Committee. The City Council confirms the acceptance of all such streets and alleys dedicated by developers/owners to the city which have been approved by the Fayetteville Planning Commission/Subdivision Committee. 
(b)  Monuments and Lot Stakes. The surveyor shall cause, preserve, and/or replace monuments and/or lot stakes marking the corners of a parcel to be set in accordance with Section 3.2, general procedures, of the Arkansas Minimum Standards for Property Boundary Surveys and Plats. 
(c)  Water, Sewer, or Street Frontage. Any lot that is created shall have adequate street frontage or street access that meets the minimum requirements of the zoning code, and access to public water and sewer as required by city and state code. If a lot split would create or exacerbate a nonconforming situation (such as cutting off a lot from public water, sewer, street frontage, or street access), the lot split may not be filed of record until the required easement is dedicated and/or the infrastructure is first constructed to city specifications, or a variance or waiver is granted by the Planning Commission. 
(d)  Parkland Dedication. Parks fees shall be assessed for each new residential unit that is constructed on the additional lot(s) in accordance with the parkland dedication requirements outlined in Fayetteville Unified Development Code Chapter 166. Said fees shall be paid prior to issuance of a building permit for construction on the new lot.

(d)  Community Sewage Systems. The construction of community sewage systems or decentralized sewer systems shall be prohibited within the City unless expressly permitted by resolution of the City Council. 
(e)  Annexation of Community Sewage Systems. Where a community sewage system is annexed into the city, then the following shall apply: 
(1)  Unconstructed Systems. The wastewater system shall be designed such that the entire collection system is a traditional-style gravity sewer system that carries all wastewater flow to centralized treatment facilities and shall meet city standards for design construction. The system must also be designed such that there is one single point of connection from which a future gravity connection can be made to the city sanitary sewer system when the latter becomes available. This connection shall be made at the expense of the owner of the decentralized wastewater system. 
(2)  Constructed Systems. Systems constructed prior to annexation into the city must tie to the city sanitary sewer system when a city sanitary sewer main is constructed within 300 feet of the community sewage system and such main is reasonably available to the community sewage system. This connection shall be made at the expense of the owner of the decentralized wastewater system. 
(k)  Trail Linkages/Corridor/Easements. The developer may be required to construct a trail linkage or corridor or grant a multi-use trail easement for trails shown on the Master Transportation Plan that abut, intersect, or traverse the project site, if it is determined that the improvements bear a rational nexus and rough proportionality to the needs created by the development. 
(l)  Parkland Dedication. 
(i)  Applicability. The requirements of this subsection shall apply to residential lot splits, subdivisions, large scale developments, planned zoning districts and large site improvement plans; provided, said requirements shall not apply to a lot split or subdivision which does not create one or more vacant lots on which a structure could be erected under the city's zoning regulations. 
(ii)  Residential Development. 
(a)  Dedication or Fee-in-Lieu. When a proposed residential development does not provide an area or areas for a public park based on the Fayetteville Parks and Recreation Plan, the developer shall be required to make a reasonable dedication of land for public park facilities, or to make a reasonable equivalent contribution in lieu of dedication of land, such contribution to be used for the acquisition and development of park land that serves the subdivision or development. 
(b)  Parks and Recreation Advisory Board . Prior to the submittal of a preliminary plat, large scale development plan, or large site improvement plan the developer shall submit to the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board a concept plat or plan. 
(c)  Planning Commission. The developer and the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board shall make a joint recommendation to the Planning Commission as to the land dedication or contribution in lieu of dedication. In the event that they are unable to agree, the developer and advisory board shall make separate recommendations to the Planning Commission who shall determine the issue. 
(d)  Decision. If the developer proposes to dedicate land for a public park after consultation with the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board which the Planning Commission determines is suitable for park purposes, the proposed dedication shall be accepted. Upon consent and consultation with the developer and the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board, a developer may dedicate a portion of the required park land dedication and make a contribution of money in lieu of land dedication for the remaining park land dedication requirement. With consent of the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board, this monetary contribution may be used to develop the park land in the development or elsewhere within the quadrant consistent with the Fayetteville Parks and Recreation Plan. 
(e)  Approval. The Planning Commission's decision must be incorporated into the developer's preliminary plat, large scale development, or large site improvement plan prior to plat or plan approval. 
(f)  Dedication Ratios. Land shall be dedicated at a ratio of .023 acres of land for each single-family dwelling unit and .014 acres of land for each multi-family dwelling unit. 
(g)  Fee-in-Lieu Formulas. A contribution in lieu of land dedication shall be made according to the following formula: 
$920.00 for each single-family unit 
$560.00 for each multi-family unit based upon actual density. 
The Parks Department shall review the contribution formula every two (2) years and make recommendations to the City Council following such review. 
(h)  Dedication in Excess. If a developer wishes to dedicate park land which exceeds the requirement of this subsection, the developer shall make a written request to the Planning Commission who may grant the developer a credit equivalent to said excess. Said credit shall be applied toward the developer's obligation under this subsection for any subsequent development located in the same park quadrant. 
(iii)  Timing of Dedication and/or Contribution. All dedications of land must be made before the city signs the final plat, or issuance of building permits for a large scale development or large site improvement plan. A final plat shall not be released for recordation until the deed for a land dedication is received. Deeded land is dedicated public park land and not subject to any right of reversion or refund. A cash contribution in lieu of required land development shall be payable before the city signing the final plat, or issuance of building permits for a large scale development or large site improvement plan. With the approval of the planning commission a developer may pay such contribution in three (3) equal installments to be paid in full within one (1) year of final plat approval. If a developer makes a cash contribution in lieu of land dedication, the developer shall be entitled to a pro rata refund, together with the accrued interest therefrom, in the event actual density is less than the density used as the basis for the developer's contribution; provided, no refund shall be made unless application therefore is made in writing to the Zoning and Development Administrator within one (1) year from the date of final plat approval. In the event actual density is more than the density used as the basis for a dedication of land or case contribution the developer must make an additional land dedication or contribution in lieu of dedication. 
(iv)  Zoning Requirements. Lots created for the purpose of park land dedication shall not be required to meet the standards for lot size, bulk and area within any zoning district. Lots created for the purpose of park land dedication to serve the residents of the surrounding area shall not be subject to POA/HOA dues or other fees established for maintenance or other purposes within the neighborhood. 
(v)  Fee-in-Lieu Allocation. All parkland fees received under this subsection shall be deposited in an interest bearing account. This money together with its earned interest shall be expended within five (5) calendar years of the last date of the calendar year in which it was received for the acquisition and/ or development of parkland that services the subdivision or development for which the contribution in lieu of dedication was made. If this money has not been expended within the allowed period, the unexpended money together with any of its remaining earned interest shall be refunded to the present owner of the property that was the subject of the new development and against which the parkland fee was assessed and collected. 
(C)  Other Infrastructure Improvements. Other infrastructure improvements may be required where the need for such improvements is created in whole or in part by the proposed development as determined by the City Engineer.

166.08 - Street Design And Access Management Standards 
(A)  Intent. These standards are intended to ensure that development is designed to be inherently safe, walkable, and efficient for the facilitation of traffic and pedestrian movements. 
(B)  Fitness for Development. Based on topographic maps, soil surveys prepared by the Department of Agriculture and drainage information from the Future Land Use Plan and the Hillside/Hilltop Overlay District, the Planning Commission may require that steep grades, unstable soil and flood plains be set aside and not subdivided until corrections are made to protect life, health, and property. 
(C)  Applicability. The standards set forth herein shall apply to land which is proposed to be developed or redeveloped where the creation of public streets are required, or proposed, or in which new or existing access is created or modified. 
(D)  Street Design Principles. 
(1)  Extensions. All street extensions shall be constructed to minimum street standards. Street extension stub-outs to adjacent properties are required to meet block layout/connectivity standards unless existing development or physical barriers prohibit such. 
(2)  Substandard Widths. Developments that adjoin existing streets shall dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the Master Street Plan. 
(3)  Street Names. Names of streets shall be consistent with natural alignment and extensions of existing streets, and new street names shall not duplicate or be similar to existing street names. Developers shall coordinate the naming of new streets through the GIS Office during the plat review process. 
(4)  Pedestrian. Pedestrian-vehicular conflict points should be controlled through signalized intersections and proven traffic calming design principles. 
(5)  Street Standards. All street requirements shall be met as set forth in the City of Fayetteville Master Street Plan and adopted minimum street standards. 
(E)  Block Layout/Connectivity. 
(1)  Block Length. Block lengths and street intersections are directly tied to the functional hierarchy of the street pattern that exists or is proposed. 
(a)  Principal and Minor Arterial Streets. Signalized intersections should be located at a minimum of one every 2,640 feet (half a mile) along principal and minor arterials and should be based on traffic warrants. 
(b)  Collectors. Intersections should be located at a minimum of one every 1,320 feet (quarter of a mile) along collector streets. 
(c)  Local and Residential. Intersections shall occur at a minimum of one every 660 feet. 
(d)  Variances. Block length standards may be varied by the Planning Commission when terrain, topographical features, existing barriers or streets, size or shape of the lot, or other unusual conditions justify a departure. 
(2)  With the exception of corner lots, double-street frontage lots are prohibited except where such lots front on access restricted or discouraged roadways such as expressways or arterials. Alleys are not considered as frontage. Double frontage lots may also be permitted by the Planning Commission for topographical problems, feasibility issues relating to the parcel's dimensions, or other good cause which must be established and proven by the developer. The Planning Commission may impose additional landscape requirements along the back of such double-frontage lots. 
(3)  Connectivity. Wherever a proposed development abuts undeveloped land, street stub-outs shall be provided as deemed necessary by the Planning Commission to abutting properties or to logically extend the street system. 
(4)  Topography. Local streets should be designed to relate to the existing topography and minimize the disturbance zone. 
(5)  Dead-End Streets. Dead end streets are discouraged and should only be used in situations where they are needed for design and development efficiency, reduction of necessary street paving, or where proximity to floodplains, creeks, difficult topography or existing barriers warrant their use. All dead end streets shall end in a cul-de-sac with a radius of 50 feet, or an alternative design approved by the city and the Fire Department. The maximum length of a dead end street (without a street stub-out) shall be 500 feet. 
(F)  Access Management. Safe and adequate vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian access shall be provided to all parcels. Local streets and driveways shall not detract from the safety and efficiency of bordering arterial routes. Property that fronts onto more than one public street shall place a higher priority on accessing the street with the lowest functional classification, ex. local and collector. In a case where the streets have the same classification, access shall be from the lower volume street, or as determined by the City Engineer. 
(1)  Curb Cut Separation. For purposes of determining curb cut or street access separation, the separation distance shall be measured along the curb line from the edge of curb cut to the edge of curb cut/intersection. The measurement begins at the point where the curb cut and intersecting street create a right angle, i.e., the intersection of lines drawn from the face-of-curb to face-of-curb. The measurement ends at the point along the street where the closest curb cut or street intersection occurs; again, measured to the point where the curb cut or intersecting streets create a right angle at the intersection of face-of-curb. In all cases curb cuts shall be a minimum of 5 feet from the adjoining property line, unless shared. 
(2)  Separation for two (2) family, three (3) family, multi-family and nonresidential development. 
(a)  Principal and Minor Arterial Streets. Where a street with a lower functional classification exists that can be accessed, curb cuts shall access onto those streets. When necessary, curb cuts along arterial streets shall be shared between two (2) or more lots. Where a curb cut must access the arterial street, it shall be located a minimum of 250 feet from an intersection or driveway. 
(b)  Collector Streets. Curb cuts shall be located a minimum of 100 feet from an intersection or driveway. When necessary, curb cuts along collector streets shall be shared between two or more lots. 
(c)  Local and Residential Streets. Curb cuts shall be located a minimum of 50 feet from an intersection or driveway. In no case shall a curb cut be located within the radius return of an adjacent curb cut or intersection. 
(3)  Separation for Single-Family Homes. 
(a)  For all street classifications, curb cuts shall be located a minimum of 10 feet from another driveway. Driveways serving corner lots shall be located as far from the street intersection as possible while still meeting a 5-foot separation from an adjoining property line. In no case shall a curb cut be located within the radius of an adjacent curb cut or street intersection. 
(b)  Arterial and Collector Streets. Individual curb cuts for along arterial and collector streets shall be discouraged. When necessary, curb cuts along arterial and collector streets shall be shared between two (2) or more lots. 
(4)  Variance. In order to protect the ingress and egress access rights to a street of an abutting property owner, a variance to the curb cut minimums shall be granted by the Planning Commission to allow an ingress/egress curb cut at the safest functional location along the property. Such a curb cut may be required to be shared with an adjoining parcel if feasible. If a parcel on the corner of an arterial or collector street provides such short frontage along a major street that there is no safe ingress/egress functional location on that street, the Planning Commission may deny the curb cut or may limit such curb cut to ingress or egress only. 
(5)  Speed. All streets should be designed to discourage excessive speeds. 
(G)  Non-Conforming Access Features. 
(1)  Existing. Permitted access connections in place on the date of the adoption of this ordinance that do not conform with the standards herein shall be designated as nonconforming features and shall be brought into compliance with the applicable standards under the following conditions: 
(a)  When new access connection permits are requested; 
(b)  Upon expansion or improvements greater than 50% of the assessed property value or gross floor area or volume; 
(c)  As roadway improvements allow.

There shall be no land disturbance, grading, or tree removal until an abbreviated tree preservation plan has been submitted and approved, and the tree protection measures at the site inspected and approved. 
(12)  Exemptions. Projects not listed above or not impacting tree canopy are not required to submit a tree preservation plan or review from Urban Forestry. 
a.  Persons seeking to build one (1) single-family dwelling unit, or duplex, are specifically exempt from the provisions of this section except when the land is located within the Hillside/Hilltop Overlay District; then all the provisions of this ordinance shall apply. 
b.  Structural changes to buildings located in the Hillside/Hilltop Overlay District that do not result in an enlargement of the building footprint or roof dripline shall not require an abbreviated tree preservation plan. 
(B)  Tree Preservation Criteria. The Urban Forester shall consider the following factors, and any other relevant information, when evaluating tree preservation plans: 
(1)  The desirability of preserving a tree or group of trees by reason of age, location, size, or species. 
(2)  Whether the design incorporates the required tree preservation priorities. 
(3)  The extent to which the area would be subject to environmental degradation due to removal of the tree or group of trees. 
(4)  The impact of the reduction in tree cover on adjacent properties, the surrounding neighborhood and the property on which the tree or group of trees is located. 
(5)  Whether alternative construction methods have been proposed to reduce the impact of development on existing trees. 
(6)  Whether the size or shape of the lot reduces the flexibility of the design. 
(7)  The general health and condition of the tree or group of trees, or the presence of any disease, injury, or hazard. 
(8)  The placement of the tree or group of trees in relation to utilities, structures, and the use of the property. 
(9)  The need to remove the tree or group of trees for the purpose of installing, repairing, replacing, or maintaining essential public utilities. 
(10)  Whether proposed roads and proposed utilities are designed in relation to the existing topography, and routed, where possible, to avoid damage to existing canopy. 
(11)  Construction requirements of on-site and off-site drainage. 
(12)  The effects of proposed on-site mitigation or off-site alternatives. 
(13)  The effect other chapters of the Unified Development Code, or City policies have on the development design. 
(14)  The extent to which development of the site and the enforcement of this chapter are impacted by state and federal regulations. 
(15)  The impact a substantial modification or rejection of the application would have on the applicant. 
*Note- The above items are not presented in any particular order of importance. The weight each is given will depend in large part on the individual characteristics of each project. 
(C)  Canopy Area. In all proposed developments that are required to submit a tree preservation plan or abbreviated tree preservation plan, trees shall be preserved as outlined in Table 1 under Percent Minimum Canopy, unless the applicant has been approved for on-site mitigation or off-site alternatives as set forth in §167.04(I) and (J) below. The square foot percentage of canopy area required for preservation in new development is based on the total area of the property for which the applicant is seeking approval, less the right-of-way and park land dedications. An applicant shall not be required to plant trees in order to reach the percent minimum canopy requirement on land where less than the minimum exists prior to development.

(30%)  
  
All residential zoning districts and C-1 districts within the Hillside/Hilltop Overlay District shall have their percent minimum canopy requirements increased by 5% to a total requirement of either 30% or 25%. 
(D)  Prior tree removal. 
(1)  If trees have been removed below the required percent minimum canopy within the five (5) years preceding application for a development, the site must be forested to meet the Percent Minimum Canopy requirements set forth in Table 1, plus an additional ten percent (10%) of the total area of the property for which the applicant is seeking approval, less the right-of-way and park land dedications. The number of trees required to be planted shall be calculated using the Base Density for High Priority trees. 
(2)  Waiver. If an applicant is able to demonstrate to the Planning Commission's satisfaction that the trees were removed for a bona fide agricultural purpose, and not with the intent to thwart enforcement of this chapter, the additional 10% reforestation requirement shall be waived. 
(E)  Tree Preservation Priorities. 
(1)  Percent minimum canopy. Proposed designs must meet the percent minimum canopy requirements for the particular zoning designation, emphasizing the preservation and protection of high priority trees on the site. Trees in existing and not to be vacated utility easements shall not be counted toward the percent minimum canopy requirement and such utilities shall be routed, wherever possible, to avoid existing canopy. 
(2)  Existing Natural Features. Each design shall consider the existing natural features of the site, the preservation priorities for the trees, and the impact their proposed removal may have both on and off-site. 
(3)  Preservation Priorities. The list of preservation priorities (See: Table 2) shall guide the review of each development's design. The submittal of designs which do not incorporate preservation priorities for the trees on the site shall result in the denial of the tree preservation plan. 
(4)  High Priority Trees. The preservation and protection of high priority trees shall be enforced most stringently to meet the minimum percentage of canopy preservation. The preservation and protection of lower priority trees shall not be substituted for that of high priority trees, except: 
(a)  When the justification for such a substitution is set forth in the analysis report; and 
(b)  The substitution is approved by the Urban Forester.

*Note- Each of the above is listed alphabetically beneath its respective category. They are not presented in any particular order of importance within that category. 
(F)  Tree Preservation Requirements for Proposed Residential and Non-Residential Developments. 
(1)  Residential Developments. The percent minimum canopy in residential developments shall be located in areas that have the least possibility of impact as public infrastructure and proposed utilities are installed and homes built. The intent is to leave undisturbed as many existing trees as possible for the use and enjoyment of prospective lot owners. Residential developments requesting tree removal below the percent minimum canopy requirement may choose either residential on-site mitigation, or to contribute to the Tree Escrow Account as set forth in §167.04(J)(4)(a). Trees in existing and not to be vacated utility easements shall not be counted toward the percent minimum canopy requirement, and such proposed utilities shall be routed to avoid existing canopy and shall count toward the percent minimum canopy requirement. 
(2)  Nonresidential Developments. Two (2) options are available for establishing a tree preservation plan for the development of nonresidential developments. The Urban Forester shall recommend to the Planning Commission the option that will potentially preserve the largest amount of priority canopy based upon the tree preservation criteria set forth in §167.04(B) above. 
(a)  Preservation Plan for Entire Development. The developer may choose to preserve the percent minimum canopy required for the entire development. With this option, the preserved canopy shall be located in areas that will not be impacted by future development of the individual lots. Canopy to be preserved shall be noted on the final plat, and shall be protected as set forth in §167.04(L) below. Should the entire percent minimum canopy requirement for the site be so protected, the final plat shall include a statement that the individual lots, as represented thereon, shall not require separate tree preservation plans. 
(b)  Preservation Plan for Infrastructure Only. The developer, in consultation with city staff, shall delineate the area required for the construction of the infrastructure and improvements for the development. This area should include street rights-of-way, and utility and drainage easements. Proposed lot lines, streets, and easements shall be located to avoid placing a disproportionate percentage of existing canopy in any one (1) proposed lot. This option shall not allow the removal of trees during the grading of individual lots, unless shown by the developer to be essential to the project's engineering design. The developer will be required to compensate for the canopy removed from defined individual lots by making the appropriate payment into the Tree Escrow Account. On all other areas of the development, the developer shall protect the existing canopy during the construction phase in accordance with §167.05 below. The final plat shall include a statement that the individual lots shall require separate tree preservation plans. 
(3)  Hillside/Hilltop Overlay District. Individual parcels or lots located within the Hillside/Hilltop Overlay District boundary shall submit a tree preservation plan or an abbreviated tree preservation plan as set forth in §167.04(H)(3) indicating the location of the structure and the preservation of the minimum tree canopy requirement. 
(4)  Developers have the option of creating cluster development, such as a Planned Zoning District, which would encourage more open space and tree preservation. In this pattern of development, the trees preserved or open space on each lot can be transferred to a larger Tree Preservation Easement instead of individual lots required to meet minimum percent requirements. The Tree Preservation Easements shall be clearly depicted on easement plats or final plats. 
(G)  Initial Review. 
(1)  Meeting with the Urban Forester . It is strongly recommended that prospective applicants meet with the Urban Forester for an initial review of the proposed tree preservation plan for the site prior to submitting a proposed development to the City. During the initial review, the Urban Forester shall make recommendations to ensure the proposed subdivision or development complies with the requirements of this chapter. These recommendations shall be nonbinding. However, applicants proceed at the risk of higher costs and longer approval times due to changes required by a noncompliant submittal should they choose not to have the initial review or to disregard the recommendations of the Urban Forester. 
(2)  Confirmation. The Urban Forester shall document whether the applicant participated in the initial review meeting in the Tree Preservation and Protection staff report given to applicants going through the development review process. If the applicant chooses to attend an initial review meeting, the staff report shall also document any recommendations made. The Urban Forester shall ensure that a copy of the report or email becomes part of the permanent file for the project. 
(H)  Submittal of Plans. Applicants should bear in mind that all plans will be evaluated according to the tree preservation criteria and percent minimum canopy requirements as set forth under §167.04 (B) and (C). 
(1)  Tree Preservation Plan. On sites with existing tree canopy, the applicant shall conduct a tree preservation analysis to determine the approximate age, health, size and species distribution of the trees, noting each on a tree preservation plan, and clearly showing the locations and types of all natural features on a site, including features 100 feet beyond the property lines. The tree preservation plan shall also specifically depict the applicable preservation priority level for each tree or group of trees on the site. The plan should include, but not be limited to, delineation of the following features as they exist on the site: 
(a)  The existing topography of the site highlighting slopes of 15% or greater, and indicating the natural drainage patterns; 
(b)  The property line boundaries of the site; 
(c)  Soils identified according to the Unified Soil Classification System; 
(d)  Any significant trees, as defined in the City of Fayetteville's Tree Preservation, Protection and Landscape Manual, existing on the site, and the location of trunks, spread of the canopy, species, diameter at breast height (DBH), and the overall health of each significant tree; 
(e)  Groupings of trees, delineating the edges of the overall canopy, noting the predominate species, average height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and general health of the trees. 
(f)  All existing utilities and utility easements; 
(g)  All features, including trees, buildings, perennial and intermittent streams and creeks that exist on the site or within 100 feet of the limits of disturbance; 
(h)  Floodplains and floodways on the site; 
(i)  All existing rights-of-way within and surrounding the project site, including any designated trails or bike paths; and, 
(j)  Any other factors that may impact the design of the site. 
(2)  Additional Tree Preservation Plan Content. The applicant shall indicate all proposed site improvements, and delineate in the tree preservation plan the trees to be retained on-site, and the measures to be implemented for their protection. These measures shall include, but need not be limited to, fencing, limits of root pruning, as well as restrictions on traffic and material storage. The plan shall also clearly depict the limits of soil disturbance to include all areas to be graded both on and off-site, as well as the proposed location of utilities. The applicant should consult the City of Fayetteville Tree Preservation, Protection and Landscape Manual for details, examples and specific checklists. Examples can be provided upon request to the Urban Forester. 
(3)  Abbreviated Tree Preservation Plan. Applicants requesting approval of development projects that require building, grading, or parking lot permits, but that do not fall under the requirements for developments required to go through the development review process of Technical Plat Review Committee, Subdivision Committee and Planning Commission, shall prepare and submit an abbreviated tree preservation plan. The information for an abbreviated tree preservation plan may be combined with the site plan, plat drawing, or grading plan. The applicant is expected to show the general location of all existing groups of trees, individual significant trees, and to clearly depict the limits of soil disturbance to include all areas to be graded, both on and off-site, as well as the proposed location of utilities. Protective measures such as fencing, limits of root pruning, restriction on traffic and materials storage shall be depicted on the plan. A preliminary site visit with the Urban Forester is highly recommended before applying for any of the above-mentioned permits. The applicant should consult the City of Fayetteville Tree Preservation, Protection, and Landscape Manual for details, and specific checklists. Applicants submitting abbreviated tree preservation plans shall not be required to submit an analysis report, nor shall they be required to hire architects, engineers, or landscape architects to prepare the abbreviated tree preservation plan. 
(4)  Analysis Report. The applicant shall submit an analysis report when minimum percent canopy is not met. The report shall detail the design approaches used to minimize damage to or removal of existing canopy that were considered in arriving at the proposed design. Written justification shall be presented as to why individual trees or canopy must be removed. The report shall also detail proposed on-site mitigation options or off-site alternatives, as detailed below. 
(5)  Grading and Utility Plans. All subsequent grading and utility plans shall depict Tree Preservation Areas, preserved trees, and the physical limits of all protective measures on site required during construction. 
(6)  Submittal Requirements. The applicant shall submit a tree preservation plan. Development plans with removal of tree canopy below percent minimum canopy shall submit an analysis report to the Urban Forester, concurrently with their tree preservation plan. Applicants submitting abbreviated tree preservation plans shall not be required to submit analysis report. 
(7)  Tree Preservation Easements. The City of Fayetteville shall encourage the use of Tree Preservation Easements for the added protection of trees preserved to meet percent minimum canopy requirements or trees planted, in those instances where such would be of mutual benefit to the applicant and the City of Fayetteville. 
(I)  Request for On-Site Mitigation. 
(1)  Timing of Request for On-Site Mitigation. Requests to remove trees below the percent minimum canopy requirement must be incorporated with the applicant's tree preservation plan. 
(2)  Plan Requirements. The tree preservation plan must graphically represent the species and location for all existing trees on-site. It shall also include a chart clearly stating the following information: 
(a)  The number of trees requested for removal; 
(b)  The percentage below the percent minimum canopy requirement they represent; and, 
(c)  The species and number of trees to be planted based on the forestation requirements below. 
(3)  Planting Details and Notes. Planting details and notes shall be included on the tree preservation plan or landscape plan as set forth in the City of Fayetteville Tree Preservation, Protection, and Landscape Manual . 
(4)  Forestation Requirements. The number and species of trees required for forestation shall be based upon the quality of the canopy lost: 
(a)  High Priority Canopy. When removing high priority canopy below the percent minimum canopy required, the canopy square footage removed shall be forested at a base density of two hundred (200), 2-inch caliper trees per acre removed. 
(b)  Mid-Level Priority Canopy. When removing mid-level priority canopy required, the canopy square footage removed shall be forested at a base density of one hundred fifty (150), 2-inch caliper trees per acre removed. 
(c)  Low Priority Canopy. When removing low priority canopy below the percent minimum required, the canopy square footage removed shall be forested at a base density of one hundred (100), 2-inch caliper trees per acre removed. 
(5)  Base Density. Compensating for the environmental damage caused by removing tree canopy shall be accomplished by forestation on a per acre basis. The base density formula used above is based on 2-inch caliper trees. However, the urban forester may approve the use of trees with less than 2-inch caliper for the planting of smaller tree species required by spatial constraints on the site. In such cases, the number of trees to be planted may be adjusted in accordance with the species table to be found in the City of Fayetteville Tree Preservation, Protection, and Landscape Manual. 
(6)  Preferred Species. All trees to be planted shall be species native to the Ozark region or native cultivars, when available, or selected from the list of preferred tree species set forth in the City of Fayetteville Tree Preservation, Protection and Landscape Manual. Species selection shall be based upon the amount of space available for proper growth on the site, and must be approved by the Urban Forester. 
(7)  Placement of Trees . The applicant is expected to plant trees in locations on the site where the environmental benefits of canopy cover are most likely to offset the impact of development. Trees shall not be placed within utility easements, or in other locations where their future protection cannot be assured. 
(8)  Residential On-Site Mitigation. Applicants requesting on-site mitigation for residential developments shall comply with all the provisions of §167.04(I), as well as the following: 
(a)  The applicant's mitigation plan shall meet or exceed the required number of mitigation trees based on the forestation requirements as set forth at §167.04(I)(4). 
(b)  All plans requesting residential on-site mitigation shall include a binding three (3) year maintenance and monitoring plan, which shall hold the applicant responsible for the health of all planted trees. 
(i)  Approval of a plan requesting residential on-site mitigation shall be contingent upon the applicant depositing with the city an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount equal to the estimated cost of materials and labor for all trees at the time of planting. The irrevocable letter of credit must cover the entire three (3) year maintenance and monitoring period. Applicant shall submit cost estimates to the Urban Forester for approval. 
(ii)  Upon completion of the three (3) year landscape establishment period, the Urban Forester shall inspect the site and determine whether 90% of the trees are healthy and have a reasonable chance of surviving to maturity. Upon such a finding, the city shall release the letter of credit. 
(iii)  In the absence of such a finding, the applicant shall be notified to replace any unhealthy or dead trees, or take other appropriate action as approved by the Urban Forester. If the applicant does not take remedial steps to bring the property into compliance, the city shall use the necessary moneys from the landscape establishment guarantee to do so. 
(iv)  In the event trees are injured or destroyed by natural disasters, including but not limited to, tornadoes, straight-line winds, ice storms, fire, floods, hail, or lightning strikes, or through the independent actions of third parties, the applicant shall be relieved of the responsibility of replanting the tree or trees so affected. 
(c)  Developers requesting mitigation trees be planted along the street right-of-way of residential developments shall submit a landscape plan that complies with the standards outlined in the City of Fayetteville Tree Preservation, Protection, and Landscape Manual in order to ensure that new trees planted are of the highest quality, require low maintenance, and do not interfere with public safety. The species of trees to be planted shall be selected from the approved street tree species list, or be otherwise specifically approved by the Urban Forester. The applicant's mitigation plan for planting street trees shall describe in detail the method for tracking the development of the individual lots, which shall best ensure that required number and species of mitigation trees are planted. 
(J)  Request for Off-Site Alternatives. 
(1)  Timing of Request for Off-Site Alternatives. Requests for off-site alternatives must be incorporated in, and submitted concurrently with the applicant's tree preservation plan. 
(2)  Off-Site Preservation . The applicant may seek approval of the Urban Forester to preserve an equal or greater amount of canopy cover at a site within the city limits or, with the express approval of the City Council by its resolution, within 1/4 mile of the Fayetteville city limits. 
(3)  Off-Site Forestation. 
(a)  If off-site preservation cannot be achieved, the applicant may seek approval from the Urban Forester to plant the required number of trees on another site owned by the applicant and located within the city limits or, with the express approval of the City Council by its resolution, within one-quarter mile of the Fayetteville city limits. A tree preservation easement must be conveyed concurrently with or prior to submission of a final plat by the applicant to the City to protect any off-site preservation or forestation and the legal description of the tree preservation easement shall also appear on the final plat. 
(b)  An applicant may plant and maintain mitigation trees needed for the applicant's development as to fulfill the obligation set forth in Chapter 167, Tree Preservation and Protection, in a nearby city park or public right-of-way if expressly approved by City Council resolution. The City Council shall seek advice from the Urban Forester, Parks and Recreation Department staff and citizens about the advisability of forestation of the nearby city park and may apply express conditions including requiring irrigation to be installed and regular maintenance to be performed by the applicant. 
(4)  Tree Escrow Account. Tree preservation on-site is always the preferred option, with on-site mitigation, off-site preservation and off-site forestation to be considered in descending order only if the more preferred option cannot be fully achieved. If none of these options can completely fulfill a developer's obligation under this Tree Preservation and Protection Chapter, the developer shall pay into the City Tree Escrow Account $250.00 for each tree required to meet the Base Density requirements which fairly represents the costs of material and labor to plant a tree. The developer shall also pay into the Tree Escrow Fund $425.00 as three (3) years of maintenance costs to ensure each tree survives for that period of time. Tree planting and maintenance costs should be reviewed at least every four (4) years to ensure it remains the fair market costs for tree planting and maintenance for three (3) years. 
(a)  Residential developments which cannot achieve the base density tree requirements through preservation or mitigation shall contribute to the Tree Escrow Account. The city shall use the money paid into the Tree Escrow Account to plant trees within the development along rights-of-ways, detention ponds, common areas or other areas where trees can be protected and have a high probability of survival to a mature tree. This shall be accomplished once the development is built out or as approved by the Urban Forester. 
(b)  Money contributed in lieu of on-site mitigation or off-site forestation shall be paid prior to issuance of a building permit on all commercial, industrial, or multi-family residential buildings and prior to final plat acceptance for all residential and non-residential subdivisions.

(i)  May be used for canopy mitigation, including planting site identification, tree acquisition, planting, and maintenance, utilizing either city staff or contract labor; 
(ii)  Shall not revert to the general fund for ongoing operations. 
(d)  If it is not possible to plant trees within the development, planting locations will be sought in appropriate sites within a 1 mile radius of where the original project is located, but if this cannot be achieved, the moneys shall be used to plant the trees in the park quadrant in which the development took place, or pursuant to §167.04(J)(2) and (3). Data extracted from the urban forest analysis should be consulted when identifying appropriate locations to plant escrow funded trees. 
(e)  The City of Fayetteville shall refund the portion of the money contributed under this section, including the accrued interest that has not been expended seven (7) years from the date of the contribution. Interest shall be based on a 4% annual rate.

This shall be accompanied by a narrative statement describing the nature of the protection afforded, and bearing the signature of the Urban Forester. Lots in residential subdivisions are expressly exempt from these requirements. If it is impractical to include the actual depiction of the canopy in a tree preservation easement on the easement plat, or final plat itself, a note cross referencing an accompanying document shall suffice. 
(2)  The geographic extent and location of tree preservation easements, once recorded, may only be modified, or abolished with the express approval of the City Council. Applicants requesting such action shall bear the burden of proving to the City Council's satisfaction that such modification or abolition is in the best interest of the City of Fayetteville. Such requests shall be submitted to the urban forester, who shall ask the City Clerk to place it on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting. 
(3)  Property owners wishing to remove diseased or dead trees from within a recorded tree preservation easement shall seek prior approval from the Urban Forester, who shall determine if such removal is consistent with sound arboricultural and horticultural practices, as well as the intent of this chapter. Any tree so removed shall be replaced with a tree of like or similar species, unless the Urban Forester determines that natural replacements of sufficient health and vigor are already present in the tree preservation easement.

(2)  Protect natural floodplains against unwise development; 
(3)  Eliminate adverse impacts of necessary floodplain development; 
(4)  Protect, restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the water resources; 
(5)  Reduce pollutants in surface waters by filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants in runoff; 
(6)  Stabilize the banks of streams to reduce erosion and the downstream transport of sediment and nutrients; 
(7)  Maintain tree canopy to shade streams, reduce water temperatures, promote desirable aquatic organisms resulting in ecological integrity with improved fishing, greater scenic value and recreational opportunity; 
(8)  Minimize expenditure of public monies on flood control projects; 
(9)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(10)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions due to flooding events; 
(11)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in Special Flood Hazard Areas; 
(12)  Minimize future flood blight areas to help maintain a stable tax base; 
(13)  Provide for notice to potential buyers when property is in a special flood hazard area; 
(14)  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(B)  This ordinance uses the following methods to accomplish the stated purpose: 
(1)  This ordinance restricts or prohibits structures or uses in special flood hazard areas that adversely impact health, safety or property during flooding events; 
(2)  This ordinance requires protection against flood damage for structures or uses vulnerable to floods at the time of initial construction, or after substantial improvement of the structure, or after substantial damage has occurred; 
(3)  This ordinance controls the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation and transport of flood waters; 
(4)  This ordinance controls floodplain development (structural development, placement of manufactured structures, clearing, grading, mining, drilling, dredging, placement of fill, excavating, watercourse alteration, drainage improvements, roadway or bridge construction, individual water or sewer installations and other activities) which may increase flood damage by increasing flood elevations, flood water velocities, or flood discharge patterns;

Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
State coordinating agency is the agency that acts as a liaison between FEMA and a community for the purposes of floodplain management. The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission is the State Coordinating Agency for Arkansas. 
Stream channels are depressed natural pathways through which water of any quantity routinely flows. 
Streamside protection zones are areas of trees, usually accompanied by shrubs and other vegetation along a stream, river or shoreline that is managed to maintain the integrity of the waterway and to reduce pollution. 
Structural development is a development that includes the placement or construction of a structure. 
Structure, for the purposes of floodplain management, refers to any building with two (2) or more rigid walls and a fully secured roof on a permanent site or to any gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground. 
Top of bank is the point along a streambank where an abrupt change in slope is evident, and where the stream is generally able to overflow the banks and enter the adjacent floodplain during flows at or exceeding the average annual high water stage. 
Uses vulnerable to floods are simply any land or structural uses that may be negatively affected by a flood. 
Watercourse alteration refers to any change that occurs within the banks of a watercourse. 
X risk zones are a special group of insurance risk zones. One (1) type, shown as non-shaded areas on FEMA issued flood maps, indicates a zone where flooding is not expected to occur. The second type, shown as shaded areas of FEMA flood maps, indicates a flood hazard area that is expected to be affected by the five hundred (500) year flood, but not by the one hundred (100) year base flood.

168.10 - Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction 
(A)  General Standards. The following standards apply to all developments in special flood hazard areas, regardless of the type of proposed development or the risk zone of the proposed site. 
(1)  All new and substantial construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
(4)  All critical facilities constructed or substantially improved in special flood hazard areas (SFHA) must be constructed or modified to exceed five hundred (500) year flood protection standards or located outside the SFHA. 
(5)  The placement or construction of all new structures must be in full compliance with the provisions of this Code. 
(6)  For the purposes of this Code, all mixed-use structures are subject to the more stringent requirements of residential structures. 
(7)  A substantial improvement or substantial damage to an existing structure triggers a requirement to bring the entire structure into full compliance with the provisions of this Code. The existing structure, as well as any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement, must meet the standards of new construction in this Code. 
(8)  Any improvement to an existing structure that is less than a substantial improvement requires the improvement, but not the existing structure, to be in full compliance with the provisions of this Code. 
(9)  All manufactured homes to be placed within a special flood hazard area on a community's FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. Screw augers or expanding anchors will not satisfy the requirement of this provision. 
(10)  The design or location of electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment for new structures, or for any improvements to an existing structure, must prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during base flood events. 
(11)  The design of all new and replacement water supply systems must minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system during base flood events. 
(12)  The design of all new and replacement sanitary sewage systems must minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system during flooding events, and must prevent sewage discharge from the systems into floodwaters. 
(13)  The placement of on-site waste disposal systems must avoid impairment to, or contamination from, the disposal system during base flood events. 
(14)  Construction of basement foundations in any special flood hazard area is prohibited. 
(15)  New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas (such as garages and crawlspaces) below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are below the base flood elevation shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
(a)  A minimum of two (2) openings on separate walls having a total net area of not less than 1 square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
(b)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than 1 foot above grade. 

(c)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(16)  The placement of recreational vehicles (RV) in special flood hazard areas must either: 
(a)  Be temporary, as demonstrated by the RV being fully licensed, being on wheels or a jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, having no permanently attached additions, and being immobile for no more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days; or else 
(b)  Meet all provisions of this Code applicable to manufactured home structures. 
(17)  All proposals for the development of a residential subdivision, commercial business park or manufactured home park/subdivision must have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(18)  All proposals for the development of a residential subdivision, commercial business park or a manufactured home park/subdivision must include an adequate drainage plan to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(19)  All proposals for the development of a commercial business park or a manufactured home park/subdivision must include an adequate evacuation plan for the escape of citizens from affected nonresidential structures during flooding events. 
(20)  Standards for Subdivisions: Applications for preliminary, final, and/or concurrent plat approval shall: 
(a)  Identify the special flood hazards areas, including delineation of floodways and the elevation of the base flood. 
(b)  All final plats shall provide the elevation of proposed structure(s) and pad(s). If the site is filled above the base flood, the final pad elevation shall be verified by a registered professional engineer, or surveyor, and provided to the Floodplain Administrator. 

(c)  To the extent practicable, lot boundaries shall be made to coincide with natural and pre-existing man-made drainage ways within subdivisions to avoid the creation of lots that can be built upon in only by altering such drainage ways. (See illustration: Figure 3). 
Any lot platted so that a portion of the lot lies in a special flood hazard area shall contain a minimum of 6,000 square feet of buildable area, including setbacks, outside the special flood hazard area, or if it contains less than 6,000 square feet of buildable area, it shall be platted to contain a minimum of one (1) acre. Any lot platted so that the entire lot lies in a special flood hazard area shall contain a minimum of 1 acre. (See illustration: Figure 4) 

(d)  For subdivisions partially located in special flood hazard areas, minimum lot area requirements may be waived by the director to allow the platting of lots to be clustered outside the special flood hazard area, the density permitted for the zoning district to be averaged over the entire parcel, provided a permanent conservation easement is granted to the city, a land trust, or the property owners association to ensure that the area of special flood hazard will remain undeveloped. 
(e)  In any area that is located outside a special flood hazard area, but where a stream is located, no building or fill may be located within a distance of the stream bank equal to two and one-half (21/2) the width of the stream measured from top of bank to top of bank, or 25 feet on each side, whichever is greater. 
(f)  In all areas designated as a Zone A on the FIRM where a detailed study has not been completed to specify the floodway and base flood elevations, no building or fill shall be located within a distance of two and one-half (21/2) times the width of the stream measured from the top of the bank to the top of bank, or 25 feet on each side, whichever is greater. 
(i)  Provided, the applicant may choose if not required by other provisions of this chapter, to provide a detailed hydrologic and hydraulic study which delineates the floodway, one hundred (100) year floodplain boundary, and base flood elevations. At such time a study is provided and adopted by ordinance, the applicant shall meet all requirements for areas designated with floodway, one hundred (100) year floodplain, and base flood elevations. 
(ii)  If, for some reason, the property owner believes the FIRM to be inaccurate, a letter of map amendment may be submitted to FEMA. If the boundaries of the floodplain are amended by FEMA, setbacks will be enforced pursuant to the amendment.

CHAPTER 169: - PHYSICAL ALTERATION OF LAND 

169.01 - Intent 
(A)  It is the city's intent to safeguard the health, safety, and welfare of Fayetteville citizens by implementing standards and procedures for the physical alteration of land. It is not the city's intent to supersede federal or state regulations such as, but not limited to, the Occupational Health & Safety Act. 
(B)  The purpose of this chapter is to control grading, clearing, filling, excavation, or land alteration of any kind which alone or in combination cause landslides, flooding, degradation of water quality, erosion and sedimentation in storm sewer systems and water storage basins. It is also the intent of this chapter that through the implementation of the guidelines and regulations contained herein, the existing scenic character and quality of the neighborhood and city as a whole not be diminished.

169.04 - Minimum Erosion Control Requirements 
If exempt under §169.03, a grading permit is not required. However, exempt as well as non-exempt activities shall be subject to the following minimum erosion and sedimentation control measures. 
(A)  The City Council hereby adopts by reference the Drainage Criteria Manual, prepared for the City of Fayetteville, and adopted by Ordinance No. 5702 of the City of Fayetteville and as may be amended from time to time by the City Engineer. All minimum erosion and sediment control standards contained therein shall have the same force and effect as if printed word for word in this chapter. Development projects also must comply with their Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality general construction permit. All projects shall follow Chapter 8, Construction Site Stormwater Management, of the Drainage Criteria Manual as well to achieve site compliance. 
(B)  Stabilization . A record of the dates when grading activities occur, when construction activities temporarily or permanently cease on a portion of the site, and when stabilization measures are initiated shall be included in the erosion and sediment control plan. Except as provided in (1) and (2) below, stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable in portions of the site where construction activities have temporarily or permanently ceased, but in no case more than fourteen (14) days after the construction activity in that portion of the site has temporarily or permanently ceased. 
(1)  Where the initiation of stabilization measures by the fourteenth day after construction activity temporarily or permanently ceases is precluded by snow cover, stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable. 
(2)  Where construction activity will resume on a portion of the site within twenty-one (21) days from when activities ceased, (e.g. the total time period that construction activity is temporarily ceased is less than twenty-one (21) days) then stabilization measures do not have to be initiated on that portion of the site by the fourteenth day after construction activity temporarily ceased. 
(3)  Stabilization practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding, mulching, geotextiles, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, protection of trees, and preservation of mature vegetation and other appropriate measures. See Chapter 167 of the UDC for tree protection requirements. 
(C)  Intermittent/Perennial Streams . No intermittent or perennial stream, including a 25-foot perimeter strip measured from the top of the bank, shall be graded, developed, channeled, or physically altered unless adequate guarantees are made for erosion and sedimentation control both during construction and post construction. Likewise, cuts or fills shall be setback sufficiently from intermittent and perennial streams and other stormwater drainage systems to guarantee that there will be no damage from erosion or sedimentation. Final erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be approved by the City Engineer. 
(D)  Excavation Material . Excavation material shall not be deposited in or so near streams and other stormwater drainage systems where it may be washed downstream by high water or runoff. All excavation material shall be stabilized immediately with erosion control measures. 
(E)  Fording Streams . Fording of streams with construction equipment or other activities which destabilize stream banks shall not be permitted. 
(F)  Debris, Mud, and Soil in Public Streets. All necessary modifications to stormwater best management practices should be immediately implemented in order to prevent further track-out. Debris, mud and soil shall not be allowed on public streets but if any debris, mud, or soil from development sites reaches the public street it shall be immediately removed via sweeping or other methods of physical removal. Debris, mud, or soil in the street may not be washed off the street or washed into the storm drainage system. Storm drainage systems downstream of a development site should be protected from debris, mud, or soil in the event that debris, mud, or soil reaches the drainage system.

169.06 - Land Alteration Requirements 
(A)  Applicability. This section shall apply to all land alteration activities, including those that do not require a grading permit. 
(B)  Requirements Varied. Variances of this chapter's requirements may be approved by the City Engineer. The extent to which variations may be made will depend on the soil types encountered, planned slopes, planned vegetation, and investigative engineering reports. In no case shall the City Engineer waive or modify any of the minimum erosion control requirements as given in §169.04. 
(C)  Cut or Fill Slopes. 
(1)  Finish Grade. Cut or fill slopes shall have a finish grade no steeper than 33% (3.00 horizontal to 1 vertical), unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer. Land located within the Hillside/Hilltop Overlay District may have cut or fill slopes with a finish grade no steeper than 50% (2.00 horizontal to 1 vertical) unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer. 
(2)  Maximum Length. The maximum length of any cut or fill slope without a terrace (as described in §169.06(D) and (E) below) shall be 100 feet as measured along the ground. The terrace shall be at least 6 feet wide. 
(3)  Existing Topography. Cut or fill slopes shall be constructed to eliminate sharp angles of intersection with the existing terrain and shall be rounded and contoured to blend with the existing topography. 
(4)  Setback Requirements. The following setback requirements shall be reviewed by the City Engineer for purposes of assessing safety, stability, and drainage problems: (See illustrations). 
(a)  Setback from Top or Toe of Cut or Fill. Buildings shall be setback from the top or toe of a cut or fill in accordance with Zoning, Chapters 160 through 165; Building Regulations, Chapter 173; or the approved grading plan, whichever is greatest. 
(b)  Setbacks from Property Lines. The required setback of retaining walls, cut slopes, and fill slopes from property lines shall be as given in the illustrations. Property lines may be filled over or cut if a grading plan for the cut or fill is submitted jointly by the owner of both properties or with written permission from the adjacent property owner and if no utility easements are involved. If utility easements are involved, approval is required as given in (c) below in addition to the joint submittal requirement. 
(c)  Setbacks from the Edge of an Easement. The required setback of retaining wall, cut slopes, and fill slopes from the edge of easements shall be as given in the illustrations. Where no utilities are present in an easement, or where utilities are planned to be relocated, and where such action is approved by all utilities, in writing, then easements may fall within a cut or fill section. 
(d)  Setbacks from Structures. The required setback of retaining walls, cut slopes, and fill slopes from structures shall be as given in the illustrations. If a structure forms an integral part of the retaining wall, then the setbacks do not apply to that structure. 
(e)  Calculating Setbacks. For the purpose of calculating setbacks, any cut or fill section which is on a slope of one (1) to one (1) or greater shall be considered a retaining wall. 
(f)  Administrative Variance. Setbacks from easement lines and structures may be varied administratively by the City Engineer if geotechnical and/or structural information is provided that in the opinion of the City Engineer justifies the variance. 
(g)  Additional Information Required. The City Engineer may require further geotechnical and/or structural information to show that setbacks greater than those given are not needed to protect property, utilities, or the integrity of property lines. 
(D)  Cuts. 
(1)  Vertical Height. Cuts shall be limited to 10 feet in vertical height unless information demonstrating slope stability, erosion control, and drainage control is provided together with a re-vegetation plan. For nonsolid rock cuts, terraces shall be required for cuts greater than 10 feet in height. It is recommended that terracing be at a maximum ratio of 1 foot of horizontal terrace for every foot of vertical surface. 
(2)  Maximum Vertical Cut. In solid rock, as determined by geotechnical and engineering data approved by the City Engineer, the maximum vertical cut shall be 30 feet. 
(3)  Fill Material. In no case shall a cut be allowed primarily for the purpose of obtaining fill material to a different site, unless the exporting site is located within an extraction district. 
(E)  Fills. 
(1)  Rocks/Fill. All imported fill shall be free of rocks greater than twelve (12) inches in diameter and any detrimental organic material or refuse debris. 
(2)  Compaction. Fill shall be placed and compacted as to minimize sliding or erosion of soil. Fill compaction shall equal the compaction of undisturbed, adjacent soil, except fills covered by Building Regulations, Chapter 173, or other structural fills. The City Engineer may require soil tests during compaction work or upon its completion at the expense of the permittee. 
(3)  Grade. Fill shall not be placed on existing slope with a grade steeper than 15% (6.67 horizontal to 1 vertical) unless keyed into steps in the existing grade and thoroughly stabilized by mechanical compaction. 
(4)  Vertical Height. Fills shall be limited to 10 feet in vertical height unless information demonstrating slope stability, erosion control, and drainage control is provided together with a re-vegetation plan. 
(5)  Terraces. Terraces shall be required for fills greater than 10 feet in height. It is recommended that terracing be at a maximum ratio of one foot of horizontal terrace for every foot of vertical surface. 
(F)  Erosion and Sedimentation Control. 
(1)  Permanent Improvements. Permanent improvements such as streets, storm sewers, curb and gutters, and other features for control of runoff shall be scheduled coincidental to removing vegetative cover from the area so that large areas are not left exposed beyond the capacity of temporary control measures. 
(2)  Phased Construction . The area of disturbance onsite at any one time shall be limited to 20 acres. An additional 20 acres (a maximum of 40 acres of disturbance at any one time) may be stripped with the permission of the City Engineer in order to balance cut and fill onsite. No additional area may be open without the permission of the City Engineer until the previously disturbed areas have been temporarily or permanently stabilized. 
(3)  Stockpiling of Top Soil. Top soil may be stockpiled and protected for later use on areas requiring landscaping. All storage piles of soil, dirt or other building materials (e.g., sand) shall be located more than 25 feet from a roadway, drainage channel or stream (from top of bank), wetland, and stormwater facility. The City Engineer may also require top soil stockpiles to be located up to 50 feet from a drainage channel or stream, as measured from the top of the bank to the stockpile, for designated protected streams; established TMDL water bodies; streams listed on the State 303(d) list; an Extraordinary Resource Water, Ecologically Sensitive Waterbody, and/or Natural and Scenic Waterbody, as defined by Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission Regulation No. 2; and/or any other uses at the discretion of the City Engineer. 
Topsoil piles surfaces must be immediately stabilized with appropriate stabilization measures. Stabilization practices may include: temporary seeding (i.e. annual rye or other suitable grass), mulching, and other appropriate measures. Sediment control measures such as buffer strips, wattles, or silt fence shall be provided immediately for stockpiles and remain in place until other stabilization is in place. Storm drain inlets must be protected from potential sedimentation from storage piles by silt fence or other appropriate barriers. 
Properly stabilized topsoil stockpiles may be used for sedimentation control. 
(4)  Plant/Water. Plant materials shall be watered or irrigated and tended. Where irrigation or regular watering is not available, only native or acclimated plant species shall be used. If the soil cannot properly sustain vegetation, it must be appropriately amended. If re-vegetation is not firmly established and healthy after one (1) year, the urban forester shall require that it be redone in part or total. 
(5)  Permanent Erosion Control. The developer shall incorporate permanent erosion control features at the earliest practical time. Temporary erosion control measures will be used to correct conditions that develop during construction that were unforeseen during the design stage, that are needed prior to installation of permanent erosion control features, or that are needed temporarily to control erosion that develops during normal construction projects, but are not associated with permanent control features on the project. 
(G)  Percentage of Land Disturbance. Land disturbance percentage within the Hilltop/Hillside Overlay District shall be equal to with the percent minimum canopy required on site per Chapter 167, Tree Preservation and Protection. 
(H)  Required Retaining Wall and Rock Cut Design. 
(1)  Design/Inspection. Any retaining wall more than 4 feet in height shall be designed by an Arkansas registered professional engineer, and shall be field inspected by the design engineer. The design engineer shall provide proof of inspection and certify that the wall was constructed in conformance with the design. The City Engineer may require retaining walls less than 4 feet in height to be designed by a professional engineer. 
(2)  Investigation/Report. All proposed rock cuts and any cut or fill 10 feet or greater will require a geotechnical investigation and a formal report submitted by a registered professional engineer qualified to make such investigations. 
(3)  Safety Railings. Safety railings may be required on any retaining wall 2.5 feet or higher. The decision as to whether to require safety railing shall be based on potential pedestrian and public access to the retaining wall and applicable building codes. This requirement for safety rails shall also apply to vertical or near vertical rock cuts and to steep (greater than 3:1) cut or fill slopes.

CHAPTER 170: - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, DRAINAGE AND EROSION CONTROL 

170.01 - Intent 
(A)  Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to protect, maintain, and enhance the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Fayetteville by: 
(1)  Preventing increases in the magnitude and frequency of stormwater runoff to prevent increases in flood flows and associated hazards and costs. 
(2)  Controlling soil erosion and sedimentation to minimize soil deposition in streams and other receiving water bodies and storm drainage systems. 
(3)  Requiring surface and stormwater management practices that comply with requirements of this chapter. 
(4)  Promoting the development of stormwater facilities that are aesthetically desirable. 
(B)  Findings of Fact. The City Council finds that uncontrolled stormwater runoff from developed land adversely affects the public health, safety, and welfare because: 
(1)  Impervious Surfaces/Runoff. Impervious surfaces increase the quantity and velocity of surface runoff, which reduces percolation of water through soil and increases erosion and flooding. 
(2)  Collection and Conveyance of Stormwater. Improper stormwater collection and conveyance adversely affects property and increases the incidence and severity of flooding, which can endanger property and human life. 
(3)  Erosion . Increased erosion leads to sedimentation in stormwater management systems, which decreases the system's capacity 
(4)  Future Problems. Many future problems can be avoided if land is developed in accordance with sound stormwater runoff management practices. 
(Code 1991, §163.03; Ord. No. 3895, 6-20-95; Ord. No. 4100, §2 (Ex. A), 6-16-98; Ord. No. 4855, 4-18-06; Ord. No. 4920, 9-05-06; Ord. No. 5336, 8-3-10; Ord. No. 5702, Repealed & Replaced Chp. 170, 8-5-14)

DIMENSIONAL FACTORS 

(F)  Parking Lot Circulation. 
(1)  Throat Length. The length of driveways or "throat length" shall be designed in accordance with the anticipated storage length for vehicles to prevent them from backing into the flow of traffic on the public street or causing unsafe conflicts with on-site circulation. General standards appear below, but these requirements may vary according to the project volume of the individual driveway. These measures generally are acceptable for the principal access to a property and are not intended for minor driveways. Variation from these standards may be permitted for good cause upon approval of the Zoning and Development Administrator and City Engineer.

*GLA-Gross leaseable area 

Commentary: The throat lengths in Table 2 are provided to assure adequate stacking space within parking lot driveways for general land use intensities. This helps prevent vehicles from stacking into the thoroughfare as they attempt to enter the parking lot. High traffic generators, such as large shopping plazas, need much greater throat length than smaller developments or those with unsignalized driveways. The guidelines here for larger developments refer to the primary access drive. Reduced throat lengths may be permitted for secondary access drives serving large developments. 
(2)  Drive-Through Facilities. All uses that include a drive-up window or are characterized by patrons remaining in their vehicles to receive service shall meet the following on-site stacking requirements in order to alleviate traffic congestions: 
(a)  Restaurant, fast food: a minimum of four (4) spaces as measured from the drive-thru window 
(b)  Vehicular washes: a minimum of two (2) spaces per car wash bay as measured from the bay. 
(c)  Pharmacies and financial institutions: a minimum of four (4) spaces for one (1) drive-thru window, plus three (3) spaces for each additional drive-thru lane or automated teller machine (ATM), as measured from each drive-thru window. 
(d)  Dry cleaning and laundry services: a minimum of two (2) spaces as measured from the drive-thru window. 
(3)  Entrances and Internal Aisle Design for Parking Lots Containing 8 Parking Spaces or Less. The driveway width into parking lots shall meet the following requirements:

(ii)  Two-Way Access to Parking Lots. For two way access, the driveway width shall be a minimum of 12 feet and a maximum of 24 feet. Parking lots shall not be located more than 100 feet from the street right-of-way. This standard shall only apply when a 2-yard dumpster is allowed. 
(iii)  Driveway Width Requirements for Parking Lots Located 100 Feet or More from the Street Right-of-Way. Two (2) drive lanes a minimum width of 10 feet each, up to a maximum combined width of 24 feet, shall be required for adequate parking lot access. 
(iv)  Effective Curb Radius. All driveway entrances serving 8 or less parking spaces shall have a minimum effective curb radius of 10 feet and a maximum of 20 feet. 
(b)  Internal aisle design. 
(i)  Aisles shall be designed so that they intersect at 90 degrees with other aisles and driveways where practical. 
(ii)  Aisles shall be designed to discourage cut-through traffic by use of landscape islands, and shall meet the requirements of Chapter 177: Landscape Regulations. 
(iii)  Aisles shall conform to the dimensional requirements of §172.04(C). 
(c)  Variances. Development proposals which do not meet these standards may apply for a variance from these requirements subject to Planning Commission approval.

177.05 - Street Tree Planting Standards 
(A)  Applicability. All new developments that create or develop along a public or private street shall be required to establish street trees in accordance with the standards and procedures provided for in this section and the adopted policies of the Landscape Manual and Fayetteville's Tree Ordinance. 
(1)  All street tree planting plans shall follow the submittal criteria set forth in Ch. 177.03 Landscape Plan Requirements. 
(2)  Street Tree Planting Requirements. 
(a)  Street trees are intended to be planted in a greenspace strip between the curb and sidewalk or in urban tree wells in accordance with the Master Street Plan. The intent of the street tree planting location is to shade the sidewalk, provide a barrier between vehicles on the street and pedestrians, increase motorized traffic and pedestrian safety, and spatially frame the street. Existing trees within the build-to-zone shall be counted towards the required number of street trees. When there is not adequate greenspace between the curb and sidewalk and urban tree wells are not appropriate, or there are utilities or other structural conflicts in the greenspace strip between the curb and sidewalk, the Urban Forester may permit street trees in greenspace behind the sidewalk and on private property. 
(b)  Plans shall indicate the spacing of trees along all newly created public and private streets within the development site. At the request of the developer, the Urban Forester may exempt specific areas from required tree planting where the terrain or existing trees make the planting of new trees impracticable. Examples include, but are not limited to: 
(i)  Where the finish grade slope in the planting area between the top back of the street curb and the property line is in excess of 30%. 
(ii)  Where bedrock is encountered within 30 inches of finish grade in the planting area between the top back of the curb and the property line. 
(iii)  Where existing healthy trees that are shown to be preserved within the right-of-way are in such close proximity they would prevent a new tree from establishing a full canopy when mature. 
(c)  Plans shall identify the species of trees to be planted, which must be selected from the Landscape Manual or otherwise approved by the Urban Forester. Street trees shall be large species canopy trees. 
(d)  Plans shall identify the size and quality of trees which must meet or exceed the standards adopted in the Landscape Manual. 
(e)  Indicate the location of all points of access (driveways, sidewalks and public & private utilities) within the proposed development. The developer shall ensure that driveways, sidewalks, utilities, etc. will not endanger the livelihood of the proposed trees, and shall plan accordingly. 
(f)  A maintenance agreement and landscape establishment guarantee shall be established. All plans shall include a binding three (3) year maintenance and monitoring plan, which shall hold the developer responsible for the health of all planted trees. 
(g)  Approval of a maintenance agreement and landscape establishment guarantee shall be contingent upon the developer depositing with the City of Fayetteville a surety or contract, as outlined in 177.10. 
(h)  Upon completion of the three (3) year landscape establishment period, the Urban Forester shall inspect the site and determine whether 90% percent of the trees are healthy and have a reasonable chance of surviving to maturity. Upon such a finding, the City of Fayetteville shall release the currency, bond or letter of credit. 
(i)  In the absence of such a finding, the developer shall be notified to replace any unhealthy or dead trees, or take other appropriate action as approved by the Urban Forester. If the developer does not take remedial steps to bring the property into compliance, the City of Fayetteville shall use the necessary monies from the landscape establishment guarantee to do so. 
(j)  In the event trees are injured or destroyed by natural disasters, including but not limited to, tornadoes, straight-line winds, ice storms, fire, floods, hail or lightning strikes, or through the independent actions of their parties, the developer shall be relieved of the responsibility of replanting the tree or trees so affected. 
(k)  Contain such other information as may be required to reflect how the plan addresses the remaining policies within the Landscape Manual. 
(3)  Street tree plantings that are above and beyond the requirements as established herein may count as on-site tree mitigation, with approval of the Urban Forester. 
(4)  Timing of Planting. The Urban Forester shall recommend to the Planning Commission the option that will potentially result in accomplishing the most objectives of this chapter. 
(a)  Street Tree Planting with Infrastructure (Subdivisions Only). The developer may choose to provide a landscape plan that conforms to the regulations herein, with all landscaping along streets to be installed prior to final plat approval and acceptance of public improvements associated with the development. If planted prior to final plat approval, the developer shall provide proper measures to ensure the longevity of health of all planted trees during development of individual lots; or 
(b)  Street Tree Planting with Development (Subdivisions Only). The developer may choose to provide a landscape plan that conforms to the regulations herein only to the extent that future development on lots created by the subdivision shall be responsible for individual landscape plans as each lot develops. 
(c)  Street Tree Planting with Concurrent Development. Where development approval is requested (large scale, building permit, parking lot permit, etc.), the developer shall provide a detailed landscape plan that conforms to the regulation established by this chapter. 
(d)  Street tree planting plans shall be submitted with the plans submitted for development or subdivision approval by the Planning Commission, in accordance with the options listed herein.

CHAPTER 179: - LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT 

179.01 - Purpose 
Some of the existing natural site features typically protected through the use of LID techniques are: wetlands, floodplains, forested areas, hillsides, riparian corridors and existing soils. 
There are a variety of LID design alternatives that allow professionals in the land development field the flexibility to implement LID stormwater design elements. The various LID practices can be used alone or in series to maximize benefits to the site. In most cases, some type of structural drainage systems will also be required to be implemented in conjunction with LID element. 
(A)  Objectives. The objectives of this ordinance are: 
(1)  To establish criteria by which a LID strategy can be measured and implemented through use of the criteria in the LID chapter of the Drainage Criteria Manual. 
(2)  To strive to maintain and restore natural rainwater absorption and infiltration processes; 
(3)  To strive to maintain pre-development hydrologic conditions; 
(4)  To filter pollutants from stormwater runoff thereby improving water quality and positively impacting the region's lakes, streams and groundwater; 
(5)  To reduce stormwater runoff intensity and velocity; 
(6)  To preserve riparian banks and beds, and reduce sedimentation that impairs water quality; 
(7)  To promote the widespread use of LID practices integrated with conventional stormwater engineering; 
(8)  To protect the safety and welfare of citizens, property owners, and businesses by minimizing the negative impacts of stormwater discharge from land development. 
(B)  LID Principles . 
(1)  Define and locate critical resource areas during the project planning stage, such as; wetlands, riparian zones and soils with infiltration capacities. 
(2)  Minimize impervious surfaces such as streets, driveways and parking areas. 
(3)  Minimize direct connection of impervious areas which convey runoff directly to wetlands or water courses. 
(4)  Attenuate stormwater flow through a diverse system of collection and infiltration. 
(Ord. No. 5316, 4-20-10; Ord. No. 5702, Repealed & Replaced Chp. 179, 8-5-14) 
179.02 - Applicability 
(A)  Development Approval . The standards and guidelines contained in Chapter 5 of the Drainage Criteria Manual shall apply in all cases where a land developer chooses to utilize LID to obtain Administrative, Planning Commission or City Council approval for their project. 
(B)  Engineering Approval . The City Engineer, or their designee, will administer this chapter and shall be responsible for final approval of all LID systems and structures. With the approval of the City Engineer, LID systems and structures may be implemented. 
(C)  Drainage Criteria Manual. The Drainage Criteria Manual integrates LID design principles throughout the manual. Submittal requirements for LID projects are found within the submittal requirements for a drainage report. Criteria for the design of specific LID elements, criteria for receiving credit for those elements through reductions in traditional stormwater infrastructure, and maintenance requirements are detailed in Chapter 5 of the DCM.

179.03 - LID Site Design Strategies 
(A)  Definition. For the purposes of this chapter Low Impact Development (LID) is a stormwater management strategy concerned with maintaining, restoring or replicating the natural hydrologic functions of a site, where possible, by employing a variety and combination of natural and built features that reduce the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff, filter out its pollutants, and facilitate the infiltration of water into the ground. 
(B)  Site Design Strategies. Generally, site design strategies will address the arrangement of buildings, roads, parking areas, and other features, and the conveyance of stormwater runoff across the site. LID site design strategies are intended to complement the natural and built environment while minimizing the generation of runoff. Site design strategies should address some or all of the following considerations: 
(1)  Necessary grading and land disturbance should be designed to encourage sheet flow and lengthen stormwater flow paths. 
(2)  Natural drainage divides should be maintained to keep flow paths dispersed. 
(3)  Areas of impervious surfaces should be separated and stormwater should be conveyed across vegetated areas. This assists runoff filtration and encourages infiltration. 
(4)  Distribute small-scale LID strategies across the development site in order to maximize benefits. 
(5)  To the maximum extent possible, treat pollutant loads where they are generated. 
(6)  Preserve naturally vegetated areas and soil types that slow runoff, filter pollutants and facilitate infiltration. 
(7)  LID systems and structures should be integrated into the natural and built landscape with attention to flow paths, infiltration areas and the use of appropriate native plant materials. 
(C)  Site Design Elements. In addition to water quality impacts, LID site design elements when successfully implemented, perform three (3) necessary functions; filtration and infiltration, capture and re-use and reductions in impervious surfaces.

179.04 - Maintenance Of LID Systems And Structures 
(A)  Removal and Modification of LID Systems and Structures . LID systems and structures may only be modified or removed with the approval of the City Engineer, who shall determine the LID system or structure does not function as a part of the stormwater management system. The applicant may be required to provide supporting data and calculations that justify the removal of the LID systems or structures. 
(B)  Exemptions from Maintenance Agreements and Inspections . LID systems and structures that are not designed as part of a development and are instead utilized on a site by site basis (i.e., use of a rain barrel at a single family home, or individual rain gardens or filter strips on a site) shall not be required to submit a formal maintenance and inspection agreement, unless the function of the LID system or structure is found to be essential to accommodating the stormwater needs of the property or surrounding properties by the City Engineer.
