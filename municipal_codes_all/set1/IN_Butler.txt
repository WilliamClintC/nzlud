is necessary or desirable and would not be prejudicial to the person charged
with the violation, the Ethics Board shall grant the extension. If the Ethics
Board determines that the preliminary investigation must be completed in less

or a fire apparatus, including a hazardous material response unit, or a fire
rescue unit dispatched on a fire or hazardous material incident.



      (b)   For each hour or fraction thereof as on-scene assistance.



      (c)   For expendable materials such as absorption materials,

      (d)   For collection of debris, chemicals, fuel, or
contaminated materials resulting from a spill, the actual cost of removal and

      (2)   It is recognized that the duties of fire companies
require specialized fire/safety/emergency/rescue/environmental/ hazardous
material, tools, equipment, materials, supplies and specialized training in
order to provide for the safety of the public served. Such requirements, as
well as the response to emergency situations involving, and/or caused by,
non-resident individuals, places a tremendous financial burden on said fire
companies and the communities that support them. While taxes, if applicable,
may provide the fire companies sufficient financial assistance to exist, in
an  effort to avoid ever-increasing tax burdens on the residents of the City
of Butler and surrounding townships, it is determined that emergency service
cost reimbursement (i.e., response billing) should be authorized in order to
defray the cost of services provided.

Department or any successor company operating in the City of Butler or
surrounding townships the authority to seek reimbursement for all reasonable
costs of responding to such incidents, as well as all reasonable costs to
recoup such costs for apparatus, materials, equipment, tools, and personnel,
as well the ability of its billing agent to collect administrative fees based
upon their calculated percentage of fees.

reasonable costs of the use of emergency fire and/or rescue (including, but
not limited to, vehicle accidents) personnel hours, tools, equipment,
materials and vehicles; hazardous material and/or environmental response
personnel hours, tools, equipment, materials and vehicles; and reasonable
interest on any amount due from the date of the response forward.
Additionally, fire departments are authorized to collect a reasonable
flat-rate fee for any false alarm responses or fire drill responses for which
the fire department did not receive at least 48 hours prior notice.



         (b)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as
limiting any amounts fire departments are authorized to collect under any
applicable state statute or law.



      (2)   The reasonable costs authorized to be billed for under
this section may be recovered directly by the Fire Department or through a
third party billing service as an authorized agent for the collection of such
costs.



      (3)   The reimbursement rates for the aforementioned costs
shall be set by the billing company.



      (4)   If a third party billing service is utilized, said third
party billing service shall be authorized to charge a service charge in
addition to the costs it is recovering for the Fire Department. Said service
charge will be set by the third party billing service.



      (5)   All funds recovered under this section, and due to the
Fire Department, shall be remitted directly to the Fire Department by either
the responsible party or, if a third party billing service is utilized, by
said third party billing service. All funds recovered under this section
shall be exclusively used for the support of the Fire Department.



      (6)   The Fire Department or third party billing service shall
only have the authority to recover the costs authorized under this section
from the applicable insurance company/carrier of the party responsible for
the costs authorized to be billed for under this section. In the event that
collection costs and/or attorney's fees are incurred by the Fire Department
or third party billing service as a result of the efforts required to obtain
full reimbursement for the costs billed for under this section, said
collection costs and/or attorney's fees may be recovered by the Fire
Department or third parry billing service from the applicable insurance
company/carrier of the parry responsible for the costs authorized to be
billed for under this section.



   (C)   All monies recovered by the City of Butler WFST Fire
Department for services provided shall be remitted or paid to the
Clerk-Treasurer for the City of Butler.



   (D)   The Fire Chief or his designee shall be responsible for
collection of all recovered monies and doing all necessary paperwork for the
recovery of said sums and transmitting said funds to the Clerk-Treasurer.



   (E)   All such monies that are recovered for services rendered by
the City of Butler WFST Fire Department shall be deposited in the Fire Cost
Recovery and Reimbursement Fund and dispersed or used for Fire Department
purposes as authorized by the Butler City Council.

CAPITAL ASSET POLICY



§ 34.55  CAPITAL ASSET POLICY.



   (A)   General information.



      (1)   The Capital Asset Policy is being issued effective
January 1, 2008. The new policy will be referred to as the “Capital Asset
Policy.” This Policy is being instituted to set the minimum dollar value of
capital assets as reported on our financial statements (see table below). The
Policy is related to the implementation of the new reporting model,
Government Standards Accounting Board Statement 34. The new reporting model
will require the unit to depreciate certain capital assets.



      (2)   This Policy will provide a higher degree of control over
the city’s considerable investment in capital assets, and allows the city
to demonstrate accountability to its various constituencies: citizens,
taxpayers, oversight bodies and regulators.



      (3)   The purpose of this Capital Asset Policy is:



         (a)   To safeguard the investments of the people of
Butler;



         (b)   To fix responsibility for the custody of equipment;



         (c)   To provide a basis for formulating capital asset
acquisition, maintenance and retirement policies;



         (d)   To provide data for financial reporting;



         (e)   To demonstrate appropriate stewardship
responsibility for public assets.



   (B)   Definitions of capital assets.



   (1)   “CAPITAL ASSETS” include: land, easements, rights-of-way,
land improvements, buildings, building improvements, construction in
progress, machinery and equipment, vehicles and infrastructure. Land,
easements, rights-of-way and land improvements will be capitalized by not
depreciated. Other “CAPITAL ASSETS” with a useful life of more than one
year shall be capitalized and depreciated (including acquisitions by
lease-purchase agreements and donated items - see the table below for
details).



(2) A capital asset meeting these criteria will be reported in the
government-wide financial statements. Assets that are not capitalized will be
expensed in the year of acquisition. For accountability and safeguarding of
assets, an inventory will be kept on all computers and on all items costing
less than the threshold(s) as defined in the table below, but more than $500,
which will be classified as non-capitalized assets.

   (C)   Valuation of capital assets.



      (1)   Capital assets should be recorded at actual cost.
Normally the cost recorded is the purchase price or construction costs of the
asset, but any other reasonable and necessary costs incurred to place the
asset in its intended location and its intended use should also be included.
Such costs could include the following:



         (a)   Legal and title fees, closing costs;



         (b)   Appraisal and negotiation fees, surveying fees;



         (c)   Damage payments;



         (d)   Land preparation costs, demolition costs;



         (e)   Architect, engineering and accounting fees;



         (f)   Insurance premiums during construction;



         (g)   Transportation charges;



         (h)   Interest costs during construction - on utility
funds only.



      (2)   Donated or contributed assets should be recorded at
their fair market value on the date donated or acquired.



   (D)   Asset definitions by major category.



      (1)   It is important to the maintenance of accurate records
that each asset category be precisely defined and that all persons
responsible for records maintenance are fully aware of the categorization
system. This division (D) further clarifies the asset definitions by major
category.



      “BUILDINGS.”



         1.   All structures designed and erected to house
equipment, services, or functions are included. This includes systems,
services and fixtures within the buildings, and attachments such as porches,
stairs, fire escapes, canopies, areaways, lighting fixtures, flagpoles and
all other such units that serve the building.



         2.   Plumbing systems, lighting systems, heating,
cooling, ventilating and air handling systems, sprinkler systems, alarm
systems, sound systems and surveillance systems, passenger and freight
elevators, escalators, built-in casework, walk-in coolers and freezers, fixed
shelving, and other fixed equipment are included with the building, if owned.
Communications antennas and/or towers are not included as buildings. These
are parts of the equipment units that they serve.



      “EQUIPMENT.”



         1.   The definition of “MACHINERY” and
“EQUIPMENT” is as follows: an apparatus, tool, or conglomeration of
pieces to form a tool. The tool will stand alone and not become part of a
basic structure or building. Included within this category are office
equipment and furniture, appliances, furnishings, machinery items,
maintenance equipment, communication equipment, police and fire equipment,
sanitation and water equipment, vehicles and emergency equipment. This list
is not inclusive. All supplies are excluded.



         2.   Improvements or renovations to existing machinery
and equipment will be capitalized only if the result of the change meets all
of the following conditions:



            A.   Total cost exceeds $500;



            B.   The useful life is extended two or more
years; and



            C.   The total costs will be greater than the
current book value and less than the fair market value.



      “IMPROVEMENTS OTHER THAN BUILDINGS.”



         1.   Improvements to land for better enjoyment, attached
or not easily removed, and will have a life expectancy of greater than two
years.



         2.   Examples of unit assets in this category are walks,
parking areas and drives, fencing, retaining walls, pools, fountains,
planters, underground sprinkler systems, and other similar items. Examples of
utility assets in this category are water supply mains, collection sewers,
wells, fences, intake pipes, manholes and fire hydrants.



      “INFRASTRUCTURE.”



         1.   Long-lived capital assets that normally can be
preserved for a significantly greater number of years than most capital
assets and are normally stationary in nature. Examples include roads,
bridges, sidewalks, street lights, traffic signals, street signs, waste water
systems, and water systems. “INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS” can include
structures directly related to the infrastructure. An example would be water
pumping buildings associated with water systems.



         2.   The historical reporting requirement of GSABS 34
allows the unit to only include items put into use from 1980 forward.



      “LAND, EASEMENTS AND RIGHTS-OF-WAY.” Specified land,
easements, rights-of-way, lots, parcels or acreage owned by the unit or its
various departments, boards or authorities, regardless of the method or date
of acquisition.



   (E)   Asset transfers and dispositions.



      (1)   Property should not be transferred, turned in for
auction, or disposed of without prior approval of the appropriate department
head. A capital asset notification form should be sent to the Clerk-Treasurer
in all cases. Invoices for new purchases will not be paid unless this form is
attached. Deletions for any reason must be reported to the Clerk-Treasurer.



      (2)   "TRANSFERS” are defined as any movement of an asset by
virtue of change in location, either by account, department or building. If
an asset is stolen, the department head should ensure that a police report is
promptly filed and that the police report be forwarded to the Clerk-Treasurer
along with the capital asset notification form.



   (F)   Periodic inventories. A physical inventory of capital assets
will be conducted by each department as near as practical to year-end. The
Clerk-Treasurer will provide a list of the inventory on file which will be
sent to each department before each year-end. The department heads will then
compare physical observations of assets to the listing, noting whether the
assets exist, the location if not apparent otherwise, and other relevant
factors. If the condition of the asset has deteriorated to the point that its
useful life has been impaired, that fact should be noted. Assets which are
observed during the physical inventory and are not on the list should also be
noted, and the reasons for such omissions should be documented to the extent
possible. Department heads will be responsible for conducting a physical
inventory for the capital assets charged to their department. The physical
inventory sheet and related documentation will be forwarded to the
Clerk-Treasurer when requested. The Clerk-Treasurer will compare results of
the physical inventory to the capital asset records and make necessary
adjustments to the capital assets.



   (G)   Safeguarding of assets. Accounting controls shall be designed
and implemented to provide reasonable assurances that:



      (1)   Capital expenditures made by the city, its various
departments and utilities are in accordance with management’s authorization
as documented in the minutes.



      (2)   Transactions of the utilities are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted principles.



      (3)   Adequate records are maintained to assure accountability
for city and utility owned assets.



      (4)   Access to assets is permitted in accordance with
management’s authorization.



      (5)    The recorded accountability for assets is compared with
the existing assets at least every year and appropriate action be taken with
respect to any differences.

   (D)   This section applies to all police officers, other than the
Chief of Police.  Members of the Police Department are recognized as salary
employees.  There will arise times during a police officer's shift when
additional compensation is to be paid to the police employee.  The
additional compensation shall be controlled by the following:



      (1)   Types of additional compensation.

police officer, other than the Chief of Police, for all hours worked over 160
hours through 170 hours in a 28-day pay period.



         (b)   Overtime pay.  Overtime constitutes all hours
worked in excess of 171 hours during a 28-day pay period.  The employee
shall be paid pursuant to federal law, l½ times the officer's calculated
hourly rate.

         (a)   For extra hours worked over 160 up to 171 hours in
any 28-day pay period, the extra pay shall be calculated as follows:  The
employee's base hourly rate shall be paid.  The base hourly rate shall be
calculated by taking the employee's base annual salary and dividing it by 13
(the number of 28-day pay periods in a year).  This number shall be the base
salary for a single 28-day pay period.  The base salary for a 28-day pay
period shall then be divided by 171 to determine the base hourly rate.  This
is the rate that will be used for additional compensation for all hours
worked by a member of the Police Department over 160 but less than 171 hours
for any 28-day pay period.



         (b)   Overtime shall be paid at l½ times the base
hourly rate as the same is described in division (A) of this section.



      (3)   Approval of additional compensation or overtime.

by the city; and

statutes.

the Water Department, a deposit of $50 shall be paid to the Water Department
for services to be provided to the property. Services will not be provided to
any renter or contract purchaser unless the owner of the real estate signs

services rendered to his property in the event the renter or contract
purchaser fails to pay the bills for the Utility services provided to the
property.

time during the 12 consecutive month period after payment of the deposit,
then the deposit shall be retained by the Water Department.



   (D)   In the event a customer becomes delinquent in the payment of
charges for water service and their service is discontinued because of late
payment, then any deposit being held by the City shall be applied on
delinquent charges for water, unless the customer makes payment in full of
all delinquencies due the Water Department, including service charges, before
service is resumed. If all of the deposit is applied on delinquent charges,
then a new deposit will be required before service is resumed.



   (E)   No deposit will be required of a customer moving from one
residence within the city to another if their bill has been paid per the

perform any tests required by the well inspection report at any time provided
that they give the owner 24 hours’ notice.



   (I)   Failure to file the required reports shall be a violation of
this chapter, in which event the city shall issue an order, as provided in §
50.043, directing said wells be taken out of service until the reports are
filed.

specifications of the permit issued by the Board. This includes the depth of
the well, the gallons per minute, and the disposal of said water. The city
has the discretion to inspect the installation and operation of the well and
may require the applicant to make such reports, install such metering
devices, or take whatever other action the Board identifies as necessary to
assure that the well is constructed and used within the specifications of the
permit.



   (B)   If at any time the Board determines that the use of the well
exceeds the specifications contained in the application, or that any such
well adversely affects the water supply for the city or the drainage or
wastewater system of the city, then a cease and desist order shall be issued
by the Board. In the event the owner of the well or the owner of the land
upon which the well is located fails to obey the cease and desist order, the
owner shall be responsible for all attorney fees and costs incurred by the
city in enforcing this subchapter either in law or equity.



   (C)   The Board may assess penalties not to exceed $ 1,000 per day
for each day a private well is operated in violation of this chapter and each
day shall be considered a separate offense. The Board shall also assess and
recover all legal costs, including Attorney’s fees for prosecution of the
enforcement action.

§ 50.091  RESIDENTIAL EQUIVALENT UNIT (REU).



   (A)   A residential equivalent unit (REU) shall be calculated for
every new customer (residential, commercial, non-industrial, industrial) in
the city or existing customer who is expanding a facility in the city to form
the basis for comparing different water customers to calculate the capacity
fee as established by this section.



   (B)   One REU represents the volume of water expected to be used by
a single-family residence in the city. The water REU in the city is equal to
300 gallons per day when calculating equivalency on flow basis.



   (C)   The number of REUs for an entity other than a single-family
residence shall be calculated by dividing the actual total daily water
consumption (if known) or the projected total daily water consumption (from
the information provided by the owner or determined by the Utility from the
Table below - Typical Water Use) from the entity by 300 gallons.



      (1)   Example #1. New Commercial Customer “X” - Projected
daily water use of 2,400 gallons per day. (2,400/300 = 8 REUs for water use).



      (2)   Example #2. Existing Customer “Z” - Expanding and
projected daily water use increase by 3,000 gallons per day. (3,000/300 = 10
REUs increase for water).



      (3)   Example #3. New Customer “A” - School with
cafeteria, gym and showers and 600 students (Appendix, Table D: Typical Water
Use Expected - 25 gallons per student per day = 15,000 gallons per day water
use = 15,000/300 = 50 REUs).

   (B)   Within 30 days of the receipt of a NOV, the customer shall
provide the Superintendent a plan and schedule for the satisfactory
correction of the problem causing the NOV to be issued. The plan shall also
include provision describing actions to be taken by the customer to prevent
future violations. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice

§ 51.01  COLLECTION OF GARBAGE.



   (A)   There shall be initiated in the city a municipal system for
the collection of all garbage, cans, glass, crockery, and rubbish. Such
collection of garbage, cans, bottles, glassware, crockery, and rubbish shall
be made at least once per week from the property of all residents of the
city.  All residential property owners must use the garbage pickup service
contracted by the city.



   (B)   All garbage collected in the city shall be securely wrapped in
paper or placed in garbage sacks or bags, and the garbage, wrapped or in
garbage sacks or bags, shall be placed in plastic or metal containers
designed for storing garbage and not exceeding 50 pounds capacity.  However,
if the garbage is securely contained within the garbage bag, it need not be
placed in such a container.  Single-family residences shall be permitted to
put their garbage bags or containers out for collection no sooner than the
night before the collection is scheduled.  The garbage shall be placed in
the location as specified by the garbage contract of the city so as to be of
easy access to the person, persons, or company removing the garbage or trash
from the premises.  The owner or operator of any multi-family dwelling of
more than four units within the city shall provide a central location for the
collection of the garbage of the residents of the multi-family dwelling.  In
no event shall the residents of such a multi-family dwelling be allowed to
accumulate garbage or trash other than in a centrally located place provided
by the landlord.  The centrally located place shall be approved by the
city.  The centrally located place shall be enclosed.  The landlord shall
provide a container or dumpster approved by a company which collects garbage
within the city for the residents of the multi-family dwelling to place their
garbage.  The central location point shall be outdoors and maintained in a
clean and sanitary manner.  The location shall be approved by the city and
enclosed by a fence high enough to hide the container or dumpster from the
view of passerby and affixed with a gate. 



   (C)   All garbage cans shall be placed on the premises so as to be
of easy access to the person or persons removing the garbage from the
premises.



   (D)   Tin cans, glass, crockery ware, bottles, ashes, or any other
substance not fit for  consumption by domestic animals may be placed in
these garbage cans.  The term "GARBAGE" as used in this chapter shall also
include kitchen and table refuse and remains of food substances, but shall
not exclude all other matters and articles.



   (E)   In the event any dispute arises between the owner and occupant
of premises and the person or persons who remove the garbage as to the
location of the cans or the character of the garbage permitted therein, the
dispute shall be referred to the Chief of Police, and his decision shall be
final.

discharged into receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW;



      (5)   To protect the POTW, all POTW personnel and the general
public from unregulated discharge of wastewater whose constituents could
endanger the POTW system, and the health and welfare of POTW personnel or the
general public and / or could contaminate the receiving stream;



      (6)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater
and sludge from the POTW;



      (7)   To establish fees for the equitable distribution of the
cost of operation, maintenance, management and improvement of the POTW;



      (8)   To enable the City of Butler, Indiana to comply with its
national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit conditions,
sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other federal or state laws to
which the POTW is subject; and



      (9)   To establish a pretreatment program for the regulation
and control of industrial discharges through the issuance and enforcement of
industrial wastewater discharge permits that set forth the terms, conditions
and regulations under which non-compatible wastewaters may be discharged into
the city’s POTW.

§ 52.080  SAMPLE COLLECTION.



   (A)   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements of the
permit shall be representative of the user’s discharge and obtained through
appropriate sampling techniques. The data analysis of the samples collected
shall be performed during the period covered by the report, based on data
that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.



   (B)   Except as indicated in divisions (C) and (D) below, the user
shall collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite
collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is not
feasible, the Superintendent may authorize, in writing, the use of time
proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent
being discharged. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation)
specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab
samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the
analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may
be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and
oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite
samples for other parameters unaffected by composting procedures as
documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the
Superintendent, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to
show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.



   (C)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds shall be obtained using grab
collection techniques.



   (D)   Samples for monitoring compliance by categorical industries
should be taken immediately downstream from the pretreatment facilities if
such facilities exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if
no pretreatment facilities exist. If other wastewaters are mixed with the
regulated wastewater prior to treatment, the user should measure the flows
and concentration necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream in
order to evaluate compliance with pretreatment standards. When an alternate
concentration or mass limit has been calculated this adjusted limit along
with the supporting data shall be submitted to the Superintendent.



   (E)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
90-day compliance reports required by this chapter and 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b)
and (d), a minimum of four grab samples shall be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for
facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities
for which historical sampling data are available, the Superintendent may
authorize, in writing, a lower minimum number of samples. For the reports
required by this chapter and 40 C.F.R. 403.12(e) and (h), the industrial user
is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and
assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

§ 52.107  EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.



   (A)   The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user’s
discharge, after verbal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that reasonably appears
to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The Superintendent may also suspend a user’s discharge,
immediately after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present,
an endangerment to the environment.



   (B)   Any user notified of a suspension of its right to discharge
shall immediately stop or eliminate its discharge to the POTW.



      (1)   In the event of a user’s failure to immediately comply

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS



§ 52.120  UPSET.



   (A)   For the purposes of this section, “UPSET” means an
exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors
beyond the reasonable control of the user. An “UPSET” does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed
treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive
maintenance, or careless or improper operation.



   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of division (C) of this section are met.



   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of
upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence that:



      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s)
of the upset;



      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a
prudent, professional and workman-like manner and in compliance with
applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and



      (3)   The user had submitted through verbal communication the
following information to the Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware
of the upset, with a written submission provided within five calendar days of
the upset:



         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause
of noncompliance;



         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates
and times when it began and ended or, if not corrected, the anticipated time
the noncompliance is expected to continue; and



         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce,
eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.



   (D)   The user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall
have the burden of establishing the elements of the upset by a preponderance
of evidence and proof in any enforcement proceeding.



   (E)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination
on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance
with categorical pretreatment standards.



   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of
power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

§ 52.121  PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.



   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in this
chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that
its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources,
would cause pass through or interference and that either:



   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the
user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the
pass through or interference; or



   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge
when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the
case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or
disposal requirements.

§ 52.122  BYPASS.



   (A)   For the purposes of this section, the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.



      (1)   “BYPASS” or “BYPASSING.” The intentional
diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user’s treatment facility.



      (2)   “SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE.” Substantial physical
damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to
become inoperable or ineffective, or substantial and permanent loss of
natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of
a bypass.



      (3)   “SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE” does not mean economic loss
caused by delays in production.



   (B)   A user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation of the process. These
bypasses are not subject to the provision of sections (C) and (D) of this
section.



   (C)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least ten days before the date
of the bypass, if possible. A user shall submit oral notice to the
Superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable
pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the
time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken
or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The
Superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the
oral report has been received within 24 hours.



   (D)   Bypassing is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:



      (1)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;



      (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such
as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes,
or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is
not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which
occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive
maintenance; and



      (3)   The user submitted notices as required under division
(C) of this section.



   (E)   The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in division (D)(1) of this section.

user’s industrial wastewater permit. Sewer use volume rates shall be set
periodically by the City Council as detailed in this chapter.



   (B)   Excessive strength surcharges. Excessive strength wastewater
can cause problems with the treatment processes at the wastewater treatment
plant, which may cause the wastewater treatment plant to be in violation of
the terms and conditions of its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) Permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management (IDEM). Excessive strength wastewater is not desirable and
entities discharging excessive strength wastewater will be surcharged as
outlined below.



      (1)   Excessive strength wastewater containing total suspended
solids (TSS) in excess of 225 mg/l shall be billed at $0.27 per pound, each
month, for the TSS in excess of 225 mg/l.



      (2)   Excessive strength wastewater with a carbonaceous
biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD5) concentration in excess of 200 mg/l shall
be billed at $0.31 per pound, each month, for the CBOD5 in excess of 200 mg/l.



      (3)   Excessive strength wastewater with a chemical oxygen
demand (COD) concentration in excess of 500 mg/l shall be billed at $0.12 per
pound, each month, for the COD in excess of 500 mg/l.



      (4)   Excessive strength wastewater with a total
ammonia-nitrogen (NH4-N) concentration in excess of 20 mg/l shall be billed
at $3.08 per pound, each month, for the NH4-N in excess of 20 mg/l.



      (5)   Excessive strength wastewater with a phosphorous content
in excess of 10 mg/l shall be billed at $6.16 per pound, each month, for the
phosphorous in excess of 10 mg/l.



      (6)   Excessive strength wastewater may be surcharged for CBOD
or COD but not for both.



      (7)   Invoices for excessive strength surcharges will be sent
monthly for each month a surcharge may occur. Payment of the surcharge must
be within 30 days of receipt of the surcharge invoice or a 10% penalty will
be added for each 30 days that the invoice is not paid. The 10% penalty will
be added to the invoice, said 10% penalty shall be calculated on the total
amount due, not just on the initial excessive strength surcharge.

made the deposit, without interest thereupon.



   (C)   If the owner, renter, or contract purchaser fails to pay
charges for wastewater service on time for a 12 consecutive-month period,
then the deposit shall be retained by the Wastewater Department until such
time as all service charges for wastewater have been paid on time, with no
bill becoming past due, for 12 consecutive months.



   (D)   In the event an owner, renter, or contract purchaser of real
estate becomes delinquent in the payment of charges for wastewater, and
service is discontinued because of late payment, then the deposit shall be
applied on delinquent charges for wastewater, unless the owner, renter, or
contract purchaser makes payment in full of all delinquencies due the
Wastewater Departments, including service charges, before service is resumed.
If all of the deposits are applied on delinquent charges, then new deposits
will be required before service is resumed.



   (E)   No deposit will be required of a customer moving from one
residence within the city to another if their bill has been paid promptly for

day of each and every month. In any event, the owner of the property is
ultimately responsible for the payment of all city services, including water
and wastewater, which are furnished to his property, whether or not the owner
actually occupies the property, leases the property, or has sold the property
on contract. The failure of the tenant or contract purchaser to pay any
overdue charges for water and wastewater services shall result in these
services being withheld from his property until the charges have been paid in
full.



   (B)   All charges for wastewater are due and payable on the
fifteenth day of each and every month to the city shall be delinquent if not
paid by the fifteenth day of each and every month. A penalty shall accrue
thereupon as of the sixteenth day of each month, and every month thereafter
for such period of time as the wastewater bill is not paid. Failure to pay
any overdue water and wastewater bill within 30 days of the date the bill is
due shall result in all services to the property being terminated.



   (C)   A 10% penalty shall be charged on all overdue wastewater fees
after the fifteenth day of each and every month. Said penalties are
cumulative.

§ 52.151  STATEMENT OF POLICY.



   (A)   It is the policy of the City Council to provide for the
orderly growth and expansion of the city wastewater systems.



   (B)   All improvements to the city wastewater system shall be
constructed in accordance with construction standards prepared by the
wastewater department and adopted by the Board.



   (C)   The construction of minor improvements shall be at the sole
cost of the applicant for wastewater service. The Board, at its sole
discretion, may require an increase in the capacity of all, or part, of the
improvements when such increased capacity is consistent with the adopted
Wastewater Master Plan. The city shall only pay the incremental cost
associated with increased capacity requirements specified by the Board.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to require the Board or the
Council to increase the capacity of the proposed minor improvements.



   (D)   The construction of major improvements shall be at the sole
discretion of the Board and Council subject to planning considerations and
finance availability. Major improvements made to the water or wastewater
systems may be paid with revenue generated by all customers of the utility

wastewater services outside of the city’s corporation limits, provided that
all of the following conditions are satisfied:



      (1)   The Board and Council has passed a resolution
authorizing the extension of services outside of the city limits which will
contain the terms of service; and



      (2)   The extension of services does not conflict or interfere
with any established service areas for the services requested; and



      (3)   The wastewater service extension does not cause the
wastewater system to exceed its design or rated capacity; and



      (4)   The wastewater improvements constructed to the extension
area are designed and built in compliance with city specifications, and the
plans are reviewed and approved by the city prior to construction; and



      (5)   The proposed service area extension will be governed by
the rules, regulations, ordinances and terms of service that govern all city
customers.



   (F)   Nothing contained herein shall be construed to require the
Board or City Council to approve extending water and/or wastewater service
outside of the city’s corporation limits.



(Ord. 1639, passed 12-19-16)



§ 52.152  RESIDENTIAL EQUIVALENT UNIT (REU).



   (A)   A residential equivalent unit (REU) shall be calculated for
every new customer (residential, commercial, non-industrial, industrial) in
the city or existing customer who is expanding a facility in the city to form
the basis for comparing different water and wastewater customers to calculate
the capacity fee as established by this chapter.



   (B)   One REU represents the volume of wastewater expected to be
discharged by a single-family residence in the city. The wastewater REU in
the city is equal to 300 gallons per day when calculating equivalency on flow
basis. An REU may also be calculated on a situation specific basis on mass
quantity when flow is not representative for calculation.



   (C)   The number of REUs for an entity other than a single-family
residence shall be calculated by dividing the actual total daily flow (if
known) or the projected total daily flow (from the information provided by
the owner or determined by the city from the following Table: Typical
Expected Wastewater Capacity from the entity) divided by 300 gallons.

established at two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of impervious
surface.



      (2)   Multiple residential and non-residential property
(commercial, institutional and industrial) stormwater management fees shall
be calculated as follows:



         (a)   The quarterly stormwater user fee for each
multiple family and all non-residential properties, as defined herein, shall
be calculated by determining and assigning to that property an ERU multiple
based upon the property's individually measured square footage of impervious
area, divided by two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet, which is one
(1) ERU. This division shall be calculated to the first decimal place.



         (b)   The user fee shall be based on the nearest whole
ERU. Rounding necessary to determine the nearest ERU shall be done according
to mathematical convention, zero (0.0) to four-tenths (0.4) rounded down to
the nearest whole ERU and five-tenths (0.5) to nine-tenths (0.9) rounded up
to the nearest whole ERU.



   (B)   Exemptions from the assignment of ERUs shall be as stated
herein.



   (C)   Credits to the stormwater management fee shall be governed by

§ 72.01  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   "PRIMARY SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTES."  Those streets generally traversing
the city and which considered essential to the rapid movement of emergency
vehicles which normally carry the heaviest traffic volumes.



   "ROADWAY."  That portion of a street or highway improved, designed, or
ordinarily used for vehicular travel, exclusive of the berm or shoulder.



   "SECONDARY SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTES."  Those streets which provide access
to primary snow emergency routes and are frequently used by emergency
vehicles.



   "SNOW TIRES."  Tires mounted on drive wheels of motor vehicles which
are especially designed to give effective traction on snow, mud, or
ice-covered streets by means of extra heavy-duty treads with special
high-traction patterns; however, no tire so defined shall be construed to be
a snow tire if it is damaged or worn to the extent that its performance would
be substantially impaired.



   "STREET" or "HIGHWAY."  The entire width between the boundary lines of
every way publicly maintained when any part thereof is open to the use of the
public for purposes of vehicular travel.



   "TIRE CHAINS."  Any metal chains mounted on drive wheel tires of motor
vehicles which cross the tread of each tire laterally in at least three
different places.



(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)



§ 72.02  PARKING ON SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTES.



   (A)   Whenever the Mayor, the Superintendent of Streets, or the
Chief of Police finds on the basis of falling snow, sleet, or freezing rain,
or on the basis of a forecast by the United States Weather Bureau or other
weather service of snow, sleet, or freezing rain that weather conditions will
make it necessary that motor vehicle traffic be expedited and that parking on
city streets be prohibited or restricted for snow plowing and other purposes,
he shall put into effect a parking prohibition on primary snow emergency
routes, as necessary, by declaring it in the manner prescribed in this
chapter. This parking prohibition shall automatically go into effect on any
part of any primary snow emergency route in the city when there has been or
there is predicted an accumulation of snow of four inches or more or ice.



   (B)   Once in effect, a prohibition under this section shall remain
in effect until terminated by announcement of the Mayor or Superintendent of
Streets, in accordance with this chapter.  While the prohibition is in
effect, no person shall park or allow to remain parked any vehicle on any
portion of a primary snow emergency route to which it applies.



(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)  Penalty, see § 72.99



§ 72.03  PARKING ON SECONDARY SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTES.



   (A)   Whenever the Mayor finds on the basis of falling snow, sleet,
or freezing rain, or on the basis of a forecast by the United States Weather
Bureau or other weather service of snow, sleet, or freezing rain that weather
conditions will make it necessary that motor vehicle traffic be expedited and
that parking on city streets be prohibited or restricted for snow plowing,
safety, or other purposes, he shall put into effect a parking prohibition on
secondary snow emergency routes as necessary by declaring it in a manner
prescribed by this chapter.



   (B)   Once in effect, a prohibition under this section shall remain
in effect until terminated by announcement of the Mayor in accordance with
this chapter.  While the prohibition is in effect, no person shall park or
allow to remain parked any vehicle on any portion of a secondary snow
emergency route to which it applies.



(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)  Penalty, see § 72.99



§ 72.04  CONDITION OF MOTOR VEHICLES.



   It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a motor vehicle on a
primary snow emergency route on which there is a covering of snow, sleet, or
ice which shall allow the vehicle to become stalled wholly or partly because
the drive wheels thereof are not equipped with effective tire chains or snow
tires.  It shall be unlawful for any person operating a motor vehicle on a
primary snow emergency route on which there is a covering of snow, sleet, or
ice on which there is a parking prohibition in effect to allow the vehicle to
become stalled because the motor fuel is exhausted or the battery has become
inoperative.



(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)  Penalty, see § 72.99



§ 72.05  STALLED VEHICLES.



   Whenever a vehicle becomes stalled for any reason, whether or not in
violation of this chapter, on any part of a primary snow emergency route
during a declared snow emergency when a parking prohibition is in effect, the
person operating the vehicle shall take immediate action to have the vehicle
pushed or towed off the roadway of the primary snow emergency route.  No
person shall abandon or leave his vehicle in the roadway of a primary snow
emergency route regardless of whether he indicates, by raising the hood or
otherwise, that the vehicle is stalled, except for the purpose of securing
assistance during the actual time necessary to go to a nearby telephone or to
a nearby garage, gasoline station, or other place of assistance and return
without delay.  In no event shall a vehicle be abandoned for the purpose of
getting assistance for more than a period of 30 minutes.



(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)  Penalty, see § 72.99



§ 72.06  DECLARATION OF SNOW EMERGENCY.



   In the event the Mayor determines that because the weather conditions
listed in § 72.02 make it necessary to have motor vehicle traffic expedited
in the city and parking prohibited he may declare a snow emergency.  The
Mayor shall cause each declaration made pursuant to this chapter to be
publicly announced by means of broad- casts or telecasts from stations with a
normal operating range covering the city, and he may cause the declaration to
be further announced in newspapers of general circulation when feasible. 
Each announcement shall describe the action taken by the Mayor, including the
time it became or will become effective, and shall specify the streets or
areas affected.  A designation of primary, secondary, or snow emergency
routes shall be sufficient designation of the streets to be affected.  A
parking prohibition declared by the Mayor shall specify whether it is
applicable to primary snow emergency routes only or both primary and
secondary snow emergency routes, and shall not go into effect until at least
two hours after it has been announced at least two times between 6:00 a.m.
and 11:00 p.m. on any day.  However, one announcement in a newspaper of
general circulation shall be sufficient.  The Mayor shall make or cause to
be made a record of each time and date when any declaration is announced to
the public in accordance with this section.



(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)



§ 72.07  TERMINATION OF PARKING PROHIBITION.



   Whenever the Mayor shall find that some or all of the conditions which
give rise to a parking prohibition in effect because of the snow emergency
declared pursuant to the terms of this chapter no longer exists, he may
declare the prohibition terminated, in whole or in part, in a manner
prescribed by this chapter, effective immediately upon announcement.



(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)



§ 72.08  INTERPRETATION.



   Any provision of this chapter which becomes effective by declaration of
the Mayor or upon the occurrence of certain weather conditions shall, while
temporarily in effect, take precedence over other conflicting provisions of
law normally in effect.  However, it shall not take precedence over
provisions of law relating to traffic accidents, emergency travel of
authorized emergency vehicles, or emergency traffic directions by a police
officer.



(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)



§ 72.09  SIGNS.



   On each street designated by this chapter or by resolution as a primary
or secondary snow emergency route, such street shall be posted with
appropriate signs at intervals not exceeding 400 feet.  Signs posted in
accordance with this section shall be distinctive and uniform in appearance
and shall be plainly visible and readable to persons traveling on the street
or highway.



(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)



§ 72.10  IMPOUNDING VEHICLES.



   Any vehicle parking on any primary or secondary snow emergency route in
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter may be impounded by the
city police and no person shall recover any vehicle removed pursuant to this
section without first paying the cost of removal and the cost of storage. 
Any payments required by this section shall not be construed as a penalty so
as to preclude prosecution for violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter.



(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)



§ 72.11  EVIDENCE.



   In any prosecution with regard to a vehicle parked or left in a place
or in a condition in violation of any provision of this chapter, proof that
the particular vehicle described in the com- plaint was parked or left in
violation of a provision of this chapter, together with proof that the
defendant named and the complaint was at the time the registered owner of the
vehicle, shall constitute prima facie evidence that the defendant was the
person responsible for having the vehicle parked or left in violation of this
chapter.  It is the specific intent of this provision to make the owner of a
motor vehicle responsible for the use and operation of the motor vehicle
regardless of who actually parks the vehicle in violation of this chapter,
for it is the owner who has control over who drives or operates his motor
vehicle.



(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)



§ 72.12  PRIMARY SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTES.

No. 6 (Main Street) south to Walnut Street; Walnut Street from Federal Street
to State Highway No. 1 (Broadway Street); and Liberty Street from Elm Street
west to the Nursing Home.



   (B)   Primary and secondary snow emergency routes may be desig-nated
by resolution of the City Council.



(Ord. 945, passed 4-7-80)



§ 72.99  PENALTY.



   Any person, firm, or corporation violating any provision of this
chapter shall be fined not less than $25 nor more than $500 for each offense;
and a separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day during or on
which a violation occurs or continues.

impounded, may kill the dog.  This type of action, however, shall only be
taken as a last resort.  Observations of the police officer or reports from

dangerous and constitute a threat to any person in any way whatsoever shall
constitute probable cause for destruction of the dog.

specified in § 93.04, plus accrued interest at the rate of 8% per annum from
the date of the completion of the work, such cost shall be charged to the

statement of the actual cost incurred by the city in the removal using the
rates contained in § 93.04.  The statement must be delivered to the owner
of the property by a law enforcement officer of the city or by certified
mail, return receipt requested, and the owner shall pay the amount to the
Clerk-Treasurer.  If the landowner fails to pay the amount within ten days
after receiving the  statement, a certified copy of the statement of costs
shall be filed in the office of the Auditor of DeKalb County.  The Auditor
shall place the amount claimed on the tax duplicate against the property
affected by the work, and the amount shall be collected as taxes are
collected and shall be disbursed to the general fund of the city, all as
provided by IC 36-7-10.1-1 through 36-7-10.1-5. In the event legal action is
necessary to collect the lien or enforce the terms of §§ 93.01 through

§ 93.07  ALTERNATIVES TO LIENS.



   (A)   In lieu of filing a lien as set out in §§ 93.05 and 93.06,
the city may bring an action in City Court or any other court of concurrent
jurisdiction, provided the defendant was notified pursuant to § 93.03. 
Said action may be brought on a uniform traffic ticket (UTT) alleging a
violation of §§ 93.01 through 93.07.  Any person notified pursuant to §
93.03 who fails or refuses to act as directed therein shall, upon conviction,
be fined $25 for each day after the expiration of seven days, plus costs and
attorney fees.



   (B)   Each day after the seven-day period expires shall constitute a
separate offense.  A new UTT need not be issued each and every day in order
for each day to constitute a separate violation.  Evidence may be presented
to the court concerning the condition of the property from the date the UTT
was issued until the date the hearing is held.



   (C)   The court shall determine the number of days said property is
in violation.  Any action brought pursuant to this section shall prohibit a
lien being filed as set out herein for the same acts alleged in the complaint
(UTT) by the city pursuant to this section.  However, in lieu of the
issuance of notices of violation of this subchapter, the city may file a suit
for injunction against the offender seeking an injunction to prohibit such
activity and to comply with the provisions of this subchapter.  The suit may
seek fines as provided for herein.  Further, the city shall be entitled to
recover all costs and expenses including attorney fees if the defendant is
found to be in violation of the provisions of this subchapter.

which the junk car is located and on the owner of the junk car, if known. 
If no occupant of the real estate or owner of the junk car can be found, a
notice affixed to any building on the real estate shall constitute notice to
the owner and occupant of the real estate and to the owner of the junk car. 
If there is no building on the real estate, the notice shall be affixed
elsewhere on the real estate.



   (C)   If the junk car is not removed within the time fixed, the

   (D)   If the order is not obeyed within the time fixed, the owner of
the junk car and the occupant and owner of the real estate on which it is
located shall each, on conviction, be subject to a penalty of $50.  Each day
on which the junk car is permitted to remain on the real estate after the
time fixed in said order shall constitute a separate offense.

§ 153.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.



   The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 granted the power to local
government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore,
the City of Butler does hereby adopt the following floodplain management
regulations.



(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)



§ 153.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Butler are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.



   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated,
flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.



(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)



§ 153.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:



   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;



   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;



   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of flood waters;



   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development
which may increase erosion or flood damage;



   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to
other lands; and,



   (F)   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for
structures and their contents in the City of Butler by fulfilling the
requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.



(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)



§ 153.04  OBJECTIVES.



   The objectives of this chapter are:



   (A)   To protect human life and health;



   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects;



   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;



   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;



   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and
bridges located in floodplains;



   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound
use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize
flood blight areas, and;



   (G)   To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property
is in a flood area.



(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)



§ 153.05  DEFINITIONS.



   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this
chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.



   “A ZONE.” Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of
flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A
zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a
significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE,
Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The
definitions are presented below:



      (1)   “ZONE A.” Areas subject to inundation by the
one-percent annual chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses
have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown.
Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.



      (2)   “ZONE AE AND A1-A30.” Areas subject to inundation by
the one-percent annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods.
Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of
Zones A1-A30.)



      (3)   “ZONE AO.”  Areas subject to inundation by
one-percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood
depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.



      (4)   “ZONE AH.” Areas subject to inundation by
one-percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where
average depths are one to three feet. Average flood depths derived from
detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood
insurance purchase requirements apply.



      (5)   “ZONE AR.”  Areas that result from the
decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is
determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood
protection. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.



      (6)   “ZONE A99.” Areas subject to inundation by the 1%
annual chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon
completion of an under-construction Federal flood protection system. These
are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the
construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to
consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used
when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress
toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory
flood insurance purchase requirements apply.



   “ACCESSORY STRUCTURE” (“APPURTENANT STRUCTURE”). A structure
that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and
the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure.
Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not
be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage
potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports,
storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.



   “ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE).” Any walled and roofed
expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected
by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed
addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent
perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction.



   “APPEAL.” A request for a review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.



   “AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.” means a designated AO or AH Zone on the
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one
to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path
of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may
be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.



   “BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).” means the elevation of the 1% annual
chance flood.



   “BASEMENT.” That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade
(below ground level) on all sides.



   “BUILDING.” - see "Structure."



   “COMMUNITY.”  A political entity that has the authority to adopt
and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.



   “COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS).” A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the
Regular Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management
requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.



   “CRITICAL FACILITY.” A facility for which even a slight chance of
flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited
to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials
or hazardous waste.



   “DEVELOPMENT.” means any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate including but not limited to:



      (1)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a
structure or any addition to a structure;



      (2)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a
site for a manufactured home or installing recreational vehicle on a site for
more than 180 days;



      (3)   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences,
construction of roads, or similar projects;



      (4)   Construction of flood control structures such as levees,
dikes, dams, channel improvements, etc.;



      (5)   Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or
drilling operations;



      (6)   Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or
culverts;



      (7)   Storage of materials; or



      (8)   Any other activity that might change the direction,
height, or velocity of flood or surface waters.



      (9)   “DEVELOPMENT” does not include activities such as
the maintenance of existing structures and facilities such as painting,
re-roofing; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar
agricultural practices that do not involve filling, grading, excavation, or
the construction of permanent structures.



   “ELEVATED STRUCTURE.” A non-basement structure built to have the
lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid
foundation perimeter walls, pilings, or columns (posts and piers).



   “ELEVATION CERTIFICATE.” A certified statement that verifies a
structure's elevation information.



   “EMERGENCY PROGRAM.” The first phase under which a community

home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed before the effective date of the community's first floodplain
ordinance.



   “EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.”
The preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and
either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

have been identified as Zone A.



   “FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM).” An official map of a community,
on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the
risk premium zones applicable to the community.



   “FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS).” The official hydraulic and
hydrologic report provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as
well as the FIRM, FBFM (where applicable), and the water surface elevation of
the base flood.



   “FLOODPLAIN.” The channel proper and the areas adjoining any
wetland, lake or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by
the regulatory flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the
fringe districts.



   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT.” The operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving
and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including
but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works,
floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.



   “FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS.” This chapter and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which
control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state,
or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for
preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management
regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain
ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management
requirements.



   “FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG).” The elevation of the regulatory
flood plus two feet at any given location in the SFHA. (see "Freeboard")



   “FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING).” A method of protecting a
structure that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities
and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All
structural components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated
debris impact forces.



   “FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.” A form used to certify compliance for
non-residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or
above the FPG. This certification must be by a Registered Professional
Engineer or Architect.



   “FLOODWAY.” is the channel of a river or stream and those portions
of the floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to
efficiently carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood
of any river or stream.



   “FREEBOARD.” means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet
above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It
is used to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to
flood heights greater than those calculated for the base flood.



   “FRINGE.” is those portions of the floodplain lying outside the
floodway.



   “FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT FACILITY.” means a facility which cannot be
used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close
proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or
seafood processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage,
manufacture, sales, or service facilities.



   “HARDSHIP.” (as related to variances of this chapter) The
exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested
variance. The City of Butler requires that the variance is exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's
neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All
of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.



   “HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The highest natural elevation of the
ground surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed
walls of a structure.



   “HISTORIC STRUCTURE.” Any structure individually listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of
Historic Sites and Structures.



   “INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).” The cost to repair a
substantially damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that
is required to bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with
the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures
are elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All
renewal and new business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or
after June 1, 1997, will include ICC coverage.



   “LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA).” An amendment to the currently
effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA.
A LOMA is only issued by FEMA.



   “LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMB).” An official revision to the
currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones,
delineations, and elevations.



   “LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F).” An official
revision by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's
determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on
fill above the BFE and excluded from the SFHA.



   “LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The lowest elevation, after completion of
construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure.



   “LOWEST FLOOR.” The lowest of the following:



      (1)   The top of the lowest level of the structure;



      (2)   The top of the basement floor;

for the studied SFHAs of city shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood
profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of DeKalb County and Incorporated
Areas, dated September 29, 2006 and the corresponding FIRM dated September
29, 2006, as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date.



   (B)   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits
for each of the unstudied SFHAs of the city delineated as an "A Zone" on the

(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)



§ 153.09  COMPLIANCE.



   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or
structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms
of this chapter and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within
the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of
this chapter and other applicable regulations.

§ 153.10  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.



   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.



§ 153.11  DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MAPPED FLOODPLAIN AND ACTUAL GROUND
ELEVATIONS.



   (A)   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped
floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation
provided on the profiles shall govern.



   (B)   If the elevation of the site in question is below the base
flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated
accordingly.



   (C)   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is
above the base flood elevation, that site shall be considered outside the
SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner

under state statutes.



(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)



§ 153.13  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.



   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any
liability on the part of the city, the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.

   (A)   In addition to the requirements of § 153.40, all structures
to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from flood damage below the FPG.
This building protection requirement applies to the following situations:



      (1)   Construction or placement of any new structure having a
floor area greater than 400 square feet;



      (2)   Structural alterations made to:



         (a)   An existing (previously unaltered structure), the
cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the pre-altered structure
(excluding the value of the land);



         (b)   Any previously altered structure.



      (3)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure
that are valued at more than 50% of the market value of the structure
(excluding the value of the land) before damaged occurred;



      (4)   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a
site for more than 180 days;



      (5)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new
manufactured home on an existing site. This chapter does not apply to
returning the existing manufactured home to the same site it lawfully
occupied before it was removed to avoid flood damage; and



      (6)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a repetitive loss
structure. (optional)



   (B)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have
the lowest floor; including basement, at or above the FPG (two feet above the
base flood elevation). Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to
elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards
of division (D).



   (C)   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure (or
manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
to or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation). Structures
located in all "A Zones" may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated if
done in accordance with the following:



      (1)   A Registered Professional Engineer or Architect shall
certify that the structure has been designed so that below the FPG, the
structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of
resisting the effects of the regulatory flood. The structure design shall
take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic
pressures, and impacts from debris or ice. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in § 153.27(B)(10).



      (2)   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity.



   (D)   Elevated structures.



      (1)   New construction or substantial improvements of elevated
structures that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other
exterior walls below the base flood elevations shall be designed to preclude
finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of
floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls.



      (2)   Designs for complying with this requirement must either
be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the follow
minimum criteria:



         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total
net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding;



         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than
one foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation
or higher than the exterior foundation grade); and



         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow
of floodwaters in both directions.



         (d)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum
necessary to allow for parking for vehicles (garage door) or limited storage
of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard
exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and



         (e)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall
not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.



         (f)   Where elevation requirements exceed six feet above
the highest adjacent grade, a copy of the legally recorded deed restriction
prohibiting the conversion of the area below the lowest floor to a use or
dimension contrary to the structure's originally approved design, shall be
presented as a condition of issuance of the final Certificate of Occupancy.
(optional)



   (E)   Structures constructed on fill. A residential or
nonresidential structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in
accordance with the following:



      (1)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one
foot deep before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with the
Standard Proctor Test method.



      (2)   The fill should extend at least ten feet beyond the
foundation of the structure before sloping below the FPG.



      (3)   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour
during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative
cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one
vertical.



      (4)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface
drainage from or onto neighboring properties.



      (5)   The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be
at or above the FPG.



   (F)   Standards for structures constructed with a crawlspace. A
residential or nonresidential structure may be constructed with a crawlspace
located below the flood protection grade provided that the following
conditions are met:



      (1)   The building must be designed and adequately anchored to
resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
and



      (2)   Any enclosed area below the flood protection grade shall
have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. A minimum of one opening on each
wall having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one
square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of the openings shall be no more
than one foot above grade; and



      (3)   The interior grade of the crawlspace must be at or above
the base flood elevation; and



      (4)   The interior height of the crawlspace measured from the
interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the foundation wall must not
exceed four feet at any point; and



      (5)   An adequate drainage system must be installed to remove
floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace within a reasonable
period of time after a flood event; and



      (6)   Portions of the building below the flood protection
grade must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; and



      (7)   Utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated
above the flood protection grade.



   (G)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially
improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following
requirements:



      (1)   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This requirement applies to all
manufactured homes to be placed on a site;



         (a)   Outside a manufactured home park or subdivision;



         (b)   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;



         (c)   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision; or



         (d)   In an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as
a result of a flood.



      (2)   The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the
lowest floor of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced
piers or other foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in
height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This
requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not been
substantially damaged by a flood.



      (3)   Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:



         (a)   Be on site for less than 180 days; and



         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use
(defined as being on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site

permanently attached additions); or



         (c)   Meet the requirements for "manufactured homes" as
stated earlier in this section.



(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)



§ 153.42  STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.



   (A)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;



   (B)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;



   (C)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage
provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards, and;



   (D)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks
and subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.



(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)



§ 153.43  CRITICAL FACILITY.



   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent
possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new
critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the
SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access
routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical
facilities to the extent possible.



(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)



§ 153.44  STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.



   (A)   Located within SFHAs, established in § 153.07, are areas
designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to
the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and
has erosion potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any
excavation, deposit, construction or obstruction activity located in the
floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading,
clearing and paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction
of the structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/
improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river
floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of non-substantial
additions/improvements to residences in a non-boundary river floodway without
obtaining a permit for construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department
of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an
addition above the existing grade, prior approval (construction in a floodway
permit) for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)



   (B)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until
a permit (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources granting approval for construction in a floodway. Once a
permit for construction in a floodway has been issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the
local Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in
Article 5 of this chapter have been met. The Floodplain Development Permit
cannot be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway
issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's
more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.



   (C)   No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, will increase the regulatory
flood more than 0.14 of one foot; and



   (D)   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill
(including levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the
Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data.



(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)



§ 153.45  STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFIED FRINGE.



   If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain
Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit provided the
provisions contained in Article 5 of this chapter have been met. The key
provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially
improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.



(Ord. 1465, passed 9-5-06)



§ 153.46  STANDARDS FOR SFHAS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATION
AND/OR FLOODWAYS/FRINGES.



   (A)   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square
mile:



      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the
limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the
drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.



      (2)   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator
until either a permit for construction in a floodway or a floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 100-year flood elevation and the
recommended Flood Protection Grade has been received from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.



      (3)   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the
proper permit for construction in a floodway or floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a
Floodplain Development Permit may be issued provided the conditions of the
Floodplain Development Permit are not less restrictive than the conditions
received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions
contained in §§ 153.40 et seq. of this chapter have been met.



   (B)   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square
mile:



      (1)   If the site is in an identified floodplain where the
limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the
drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an
engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodway, fringe and 100-year
flood elevation for the site.



      (2)   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the
local Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in
§§ 153.40 et seq. of this chapter have been met.



   (C)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not
increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not
increase flood damages or potential flood damages.

1.23 - Damaged, Destroyed or Lost Official Zoning Map - In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret due to the nature or number of changes, the City Council may, by resolution, adopt a new Butler Zoning Map which shall, to the extent possible, duplicate the accuracy of the damaged, destroyed or lost map.

C. District boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of streams, rivers, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines of such features.
D. When the Community Development Office cannot definitely determine the location of a district boundary by center lines, by previous zoning map amendment ordinances, or by scale or dimensions of the Official Zoning Map, because the boundary does not clearly coincide with a property line, the Community Development Office may refuse action and the Plan Commission may interpret the location of the district boundary with reference to the scale of the Official Zoning Map and the purposes set forth in all relevant provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and the City's Comprehensive Plan.
1.25 - Overlay District Applicability - The Overlay District boundaries on the Official Zoning Map shall be interpreted as follows:
A. An overlay district shall be noted on the Butler Zoning Map with a hatch or textured pattern and be noted as such on the map legend.
B. A lot that is fully covered (bounded) by an overlay district shall be interpreted to be applicable to the overlay district standards found in Article Five.
C. A lot that is partially covered (transected) by an overlay district shall be interpreted to be applicable to the extent the lot area is covered by the overlay district.

ARTICLE SIX - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
6.1 - How to Use this Article - Article Six contains development standards which are arranged by category. There are two ways to determine which development standards apply to a specific zoning district. They are:
A. Refer to the two-page layouts in Articles Two, Three and Four for a specific zoning district. In the "Additional Development Standards that Apply" box for that specific Zoning District are listed four-digit codes that determine which development standards apply. Only the four-digit codes noted in the "Additional Development Standards that Apply" section apply to that Zoning District.
(As an example, on page 2-2, the four digit code "DI-01" can be found under the "Additional Development Standards that Apply" section in the Single-Family Residential (SFR) District. Therefore, the Development Standards in the section labeled "DI-01" (on page 6-5) would apply to the Single-Family Residential (SFR) District).
B. Refer to the icons used at the top of each development standard section in Article Six. Each development standard section begins with a four-digit code and introductory sentence followed by icons with zoning district abbreviations (i.e. REC for the Open Space and Recreational District or MFR for the Multifamily Residential District). These district icons note that the development standard written in that section applies to that district.
[As an example, on page 6-3, the SFR icon can be found under the AS-01 development standard section. Therefore, the language in the AS-01 section would apply to the SFR district.]

ARTICLE SEVEN - NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES, LOTS & USES
7.1 - Intent - Upon adoption of the Zoning Ordinance and official zoning map, some buildings, structures, lots, and/or uses may no longer conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which they are located. For this reason, Article Seven has been generated to provide the rules, policies and regulations that apply to these buildings, structures, lots, and uses referred to as legal-nonconforming.
7.2 - Distinction Between Illegal-Nonconforming and Legal-Nonconforming -
A. A building, structure, or lot is considered illegal-nonconforming if it meets the following:
1. It was built, constructed or platted after March 7, 1957, and
2. It does not meet the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, and
3. It has not met the provisions of any previous zoning ordinance, and as a result does not have an approved building permit, improvement location permit or approval from the Board of Zoning Appeals or Plan Commission.
B. An illegal-nonconforming property shall be subject to actions and penalties allowed by the Zoning Ordinance and all other applicable municipal law and shall be altered to conform with all applicable standards and regulations of the Zoning Ordinance. Further, an illegal-nonconforming building, structure, lot or use is created at the fault of a past or the current owner, tenant or property manager.
C. Legal-nonconforming differs from illegal-nonconforming (illegal) in that the reason for the nonconformance is caused by a change to the Zoning Ordinance and/or the zoning map. The building, structure, lot or use has not changed, but due to the ordinance and/or map change, the property no longer conforms to the policies and standards of the zoning district in which the property resides. When this situation occurs, the property is deemed legal-nonconforming or another term commonly used is "grandfathered." The burden to proof a building, structure, lot or use is legal nonconforming rests with the property owner.
7.3 - Nonconforming Buildings and Structures -
A. Any continuously occupied, lawfully established structure or building prior to the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer meets the design standards due to the reasons listed below shall be deemed a legal-nonconforming building or structure.
B. Legal-nonconforming building(s) or structure(s) no longer meet one or more of the following development standards of the Zoning Ordinance:
• Setbacks,
• Lot Coverage,
• Accessory Structures,
City of Butler, Indiana Zoning Ordinance
Full Searchable Edition
City of Butler, Indiana Zoning Ordinance – Full Searchable Version Page 92
• Parking,
• Fences, and any other provision of the Zoning Ordinance that is applicable to the building or structure.
C. A legal-nonconforming building or structure may continue to exist provided that it remains the same or fits within the below described tolerances:
1. Legal-Nonconforming building(s) or structure(s) may be expanded or altered if the Community Development Office determines the proposed expansion or alteration does not exceed the existing building setback lines or impervious surface regulations.
2. Any legal-nonconforming building or structure which is damaged or destroyed by more than 75% of its fair market value by accidental cause, including Acts of God, shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. If the damage is less than or equal to 75% of the fair market value, the building or structure may be replaced provided the following:
a. The elevation of the lowest floor, including the basement floor, shall be at least two feet above the regulatory flood,
b. All necessary permits shall be obtained from the Department of Natural Resources,
c. An application for a building permit shall be made within six months of the date of destruction, and Nonconforming Structures, Lots, and Uses
d. The building or structure is permitted to be rebuilt by either:
i. replacing the exact building or structure that was destroyed; or
ii. constructing a building or structure that is not any more out of conformance with the current Zoning Ordinance as the building or structure destroyed.
D. If a building or structure is moved for any reason, for any distance, it shall thereafter conform to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
7.4 - Nonconforming Lots of Record -
A. All legally established and recorded lots prior to the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer meet the lot standards listed below shall be deemed legal-nonconforming lots of record. A legal-nonconforming lot of record no longer meets one or more of the following lot standards of the Zoning Ordinance:
• Lot Area,
• Lot Width,
• Lot Depth,
• Lot Frontage, or
• Any other provision of the Zoning Ordinance that is applicable to lots.
B. Legal-nonconforming lots of record may be built upon only if the proposed use is permitted and all development standards of the applicable zoning district of the Zoning Ordinance are met.

7.5 - Nonconforming Uses of Structures, Land, or Structures and Land in Combination - Any continuous, lawful use of structures, land, or structures and land in combination established prior to the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance or its subsequent amendments that is no longer a permitted use in the district where it is located shall be deemed a legal-nonconforming use. A legal-nonconforming use may continue provided that it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following conditions:
A. No existing structure devoted to a legal-nonconforming use shall be enlarged, expanded, increased, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered unless it:
1. changes the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located, and
2. meets all the regulations of this Zoning Ordinance.
B. No new building or structure shall be constructed in connection with an existing legal-nonconforming use of land except fences which must meet all the regulations of the current zoning district.

However, if the new use requires more parking area than the previous use, such new use will comply with the appropriate parking standards required in Article Six of the Zoning Ordinance, as determined by the Community Development Office.
E. If a legal-nonconforming use is abandoned or not occupied for 22 of the last 24 months and the water and wastewater utility service has been turned off for 22 of the last 24 months, any subsequent use of such land, structure or land and structure shall conform to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. If a government action impedes access to the premises, this regulation does not apply.
F. When a legal-nonconforming use is changed to a permitted use, it shall thereafter conform to regulations of the district, the legal-nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
G. Where a legal-nonconforming use applies to a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming structure of the land and all structures thereafter shall conform to the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. Destruction is defined as damage of more than 75% of its fair market value at the time of destruction.
7.6 - Nonconforming Signs - Any sign lawfully existing on the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance, or amendment thereto, that does not conform to all the standards and regulations of the Zoning Ordinance is considered a legal-nonconforming sign.

D. All legal-nonconforming signs shall be removed by the owner or lessee of the premises upon which the sign is located when the business which it advertises is no longer conducted on the premises. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign, the Plan Commission or Community Development Office shall give the owner 30 days written notice to remove it.

1. The Community Development Office, subject to the procedures, standards, and limitations of the Zoning Ordinance, may render written interpretations, including use interpretations, of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and of any rule or regulation pursuant to it.
2. The Community Development Office may forward requests for interpretation to the Plan Commission, where, in the opinion of the Community Development Office, the proposed use is not sufficiently similar to a use expressly listed as permitted or as a special exception to allow Community Development Office to make an interpretation.
3. The interpretation authority established by this article is intended to recognize that the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, though detailed and extensive, cannot, as a practical matter, address every specific situation to which they may have to be applied. For example, certain categories of uses are listed as either permitted or special exception uses, but certain specific proposed uses may not clearly fall within the common ordinary meaning of any of the listed uses. Many such situations can be readily addressed by an interpretation of the specific provisions of this Zoning Ordinance in light of the general and specific purposes for which those provisions have been enacted. Because the interpretation authority established is an administrative rather than a legislative authority, an interpretation shall not have the effect of adding to or changing the essential content of this Zoning Ordinance but is intended only to allow authoritative application of that content to specific cases.
B. Procedure - Application for an administrative interpretation shall follow the following procedures.
1. Eligible Petitioners - Applications for interpretations may be filed by any person having a legal or equitable interest in property that gives rise to the need for an interpretation; provided that interpretations shall not be sought by any person based solely on hypothetical circumstances or where the interpretation would have no effect other than as an advisory opinion.
2. Filing of Forms - Applications for interpretations of the Zoning Ordinance shall be filed in writing with the Community Development Office and shall contain information describing the nature of the requested interpretation.
C. Review - The Community Development Office shall review the application for an administrative interpretation and make a determination. The Community Development Office shall inform the applicant in writing of his or her interpretation, stating any specific precedent, the reasons, and the analysis upon which the determination is based. A record of all applications for interpretations shall be kept on file in the Community Development Office.
D. Decision - The Community Development Office shall give the applicant written notice of the approval or denial of the application. If the application is denied, the Community Development Office shall advise the applicant of the procedures for filing a use variance petition with the Board of Zoning Appeals if the interpretation was made regarding a specific use.

All necessary permits shall be obtained and all necessary procedures shall be followed.
2. Limitations On Favorable Use Interpretations - A use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted, or allowed as a special exception use in a particular district, shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use for which it was issued, and such interpretation shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate use interpretation has not been issued.
