§205.010 ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES §205.070
§205 ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES.
205.010 PURPOSE. Administrative offense procedures established pursuant to this
chapter are intended to provide the public and the City with an informal, cost effective, and
expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of certain ordinance
provisions. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on the part of those who have been
charged with administrative offenses. At any time prior to the payment of the administrative
penalty as is provided for hereafter, the individual may withdraw from participation in the
procedures in which event the City may bring criminal charges in accordance with the law.
Likewise, the City in its discretion, may choose not to initiate an administrative offense and
may bring criminal charges in the first instance. In the event a party participates in the
administrative offense procedures but does not pay the monetary penalty which may be
imposed, the City will seek to collect costs of the administrative offense procedures as part
of a subsequent criminal sentence in the event the party is charged and is adjudicated guilty
of the criminal violation.
205.020 ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSE DEFINED. An administrative offense is a violation of
a provision of this code and is subject to the administrative penalties set forth in the schedule
of offenses and penalties referred to in Section 205.090, hereafter.
205.030 NOTICE. Any officer of the White Bear Lake Police Department, or any other
person employed by the City, authorized in writing by the City Manager, and having authority
to enforce this code, shall, upon determining that there has been a violation, notify the
violator, or in the case of a vehicular violation, attach to the vehicle a notice of the violation.
Said notice shall set forth the nature, date and time of the violation, the name of the official
issuing the notice, and the amount of the scheduled penalty.
205.040 PAYMENT. Once such notice is given, the alleged violator may, within seven (7)
days of the time of issuance of the notice, pay the amount set forth on the schedule of
penalties for the violation, or may request a hearing in writing, as is provided for hereafter.
The penalty may be paid in person or by mail, and payment shall be deemed to be an
admission of the violation.
205.050 HEARING. Any person contesting an administrative offense pursuant to this
chapter may, within seven (7) days of the time of issuance of the notice, request a hearing by
a hearing officer who shall forthwith conduct an informal hearing to determine if a violation
has occurred. The hearing officer shall have authority to dismiss the violation or reduce or
waive the penalty. If the violation is sustained by the hearing officer, the violator shall pay
the penalty imposed.
205.060 HEARING OFFICER. A City employee designated in writing by the City Manager
shall be the hearing officer for all administrative offenses except speeding. For speeding
offenses, the hearing officer shall be an impartial, qualified individual appointed by the City
Council of the City of White Bear Lake who has experience in law or court proceedings. The
hearing officer is authorized to hear and determine any controversy relating to administrative
offenses provided for in this chapter. (Ref. Ord. 962, 8/11/98)
§205.070 ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES §205.100
205.070 FAILURE TO PAY. In the event a party is charged with an administrative offense
fails to pay the penalty, a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor charge may be brought against
the alleged violator in accordance with applicable statutes. If the penalty is paid or if an
individual is found to not have committed the administrative offense by the hearing officer,
no such charge may be brought by the City for the same violation. 1/14/99
205.080 DISPOSITION OF PENALTIES. All penalties collected pursuant to this chapter
shall be paid to the Citys Finance Director and may be deposited in the Citys general fund.
205.090 OFFENSES AND PENALTIES. Offenses which may be charged as administrative
offenses and the penalties for such offenses may be established by resolution of the City
Council from time to time. Copies of such resolutions shall be maintained in the office of the
City Manager.
205.100 SUBSEQUENT OFFENSES. In the event a party is charged with a subsequent
administrative offense (except speeding) within a twelve (12) month period of paying an
administrative penalty for the same or substantially similar offense, the subsequent
administrative penalty shall be increased by twenty-five percent (25%) above the previous
penalty except as otherwise provided by resolution. (Ref. Ord. 929, 2/13/96)
205.110 COMPLIANCE WITH MINNESOTA STATUTES. All administrative citations for
traffic offenses shall be issued in compliance with Minnesota Statues Section 169.999. (Ref.

RIGHT-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT
§403.01. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
Subd. 1. General. To provide for the health, safety, and well-being of its citizens, and
to ensure the structural integrity of its streets and the appropriate use of the rights-of-way,
the City strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary
encumbrances. Although the general population bears the financial burden for the upkeep of
the rights-of-way, a primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of its rights-ofway
is frequent excavation.
The City holds the rights-of-way within its geographical boundaries as an asset in trust for its
citizens. The City and other public entities have invested millions of dollars in public funds to
build and maintain the rights-of-way. It also recognizes that some persons, by placing their
equipment in the right-of-way and charging the citizens of the City for goods and services
delivered thereby, are using this property held for the public good. Although such services are
often necessary or convenient for the citizens, such persons receive revenue and/or profit
through their use of public property.
In response to the foregoing facts, the City hereby enacts this new Chapter of this Code
relating to right-of-way permits and administration. This Chapter imposes reasonable
regulations on the placement and maintenance of equipment currently within its rights-ofway
or to be placed therein at some future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory
roles of state and federal agencies. Under this Chapter, persons disturbing and obstructing
the rights-of-way will bear a fair share of the financial responsibility for their integrity.
Finally, this Chapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from persons
using the public rights-of-way.
Subd. 2. Legislative Power. By enactment of this Chapter, the City Council hereby
exercises its lawful police power and common law authority, and all statutory authority which
is available to it, including, but not limited to, the powers conferred on it under Minn. Stat.
§§ 237.162 and 237.163, while preserving all power and authority to further require franchises
from right-of-way users under Minn. Stat. §§ 216B.36, 222.37, 300.03, and 412.11, and other
provisions of law.

Director, or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under Section 403.15.
Subd. 2. Patch and Restoration. Permittee shall patch its own work. The City may
chose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to restore the right-of-way
itself.
(a) City Restoration. If the City restores the right-of-way, permittee shall pay the
costs thereof within thirty (30) days of billing. If, during the thirty-six (36) months following

11
§403.012 DEPARTMENTS §403.012
permittee shall pay to the City, within thirty (30) days of billing, all costs associated with
having to correct the defective work.
(b) Permittee Restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way itself, it shall at
the time of application for an excavation permit, if the Director determines additional
security is necessary, post an additional performance and restoration bond in an amount
determined by the Director to be sufficient to cover the cost of restoration. If, thirty-six
(36) months after completion of the restoration of the right-of-way, the Director
determines that the right-of-way has been properly restored, the surety on the
Performance and Restoration Bond posted pursuant to this subd. 2(b) shall be released.
Subd. 3. Standards. The permittee shall perform patching and restoration according to
the standards and with the materials specified by the Director. The Director shall have the
authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so in written
procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The Director in exercising this
authority shall be guided by the following considerations:
(a) The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations, disruptions or damage to
the right-of-way;
(b) The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way; the character of the neighborhood
surrounding the right-of-way;
(c) The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way; the remaining life-expectancy of
the right-of-way affected by the excavation;
(d) Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in
reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the right-ofway
that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the
right-of-way; and
(e) The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be effective in
slowing the depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise take place.
Subd. 4. Guarantees. By choosing to restore the right-of-way itself, the permittee
guarantees its work and shall maintain if for thirty-six (36) months following its completion.
During this 36-month period it shall, upon notification from the Director, correct all
restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the Director. Said
work shall be completed within five (5) calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the
Director, not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances
constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable
under Section 403.15.
12
§403.013 DEPARTMENTS §403.015
Subd. 5. Failure to Restore. If the Permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the
manner and to the condition required by the Director, or fails to satisfactorily and timely
complete all restoration required by the Director, the Director at its option may do such
work. In that event the permittee shall pay to the City, within thirty (30) days of billing, the
cost of restoring the right-of-way. If permittee fails to pay as required, the City may exercise
its rights under the restoration bond.
Subd. 6. Degradation Fee in Lieu of Restoration. In lieu of right-of-way restoration, a
right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee. However, the right-of-way user shall
remain responsible for patching, and the degradation fee shall not include the cost to

not.
§403.33. SEVERABILITY.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this Chapter is for any
reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent
jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and
such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a regulatory
body or a court of competent jurisdiction should determine by a final, non-appealable order
that any permit, right or registration issued under this Chapter or any portions of this Chapter
is illegal or unenforceable, then any such permit, right or registration granted or deemed to
exist hereunder shall be considered as a revocable permit with a mutual right in either party
to terminate without cause upon giving sixty (60) days written notice to the other. The
requirements and conditions of such a revocable permit shall be the same requirements and

Subd. 1. Statutory Authorization. This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the
authorization and policies contained in Minnesota Statutes Chapters 103B and 462, Minnesota
Rules, Parts 6120.2500-6120.3900, and Minnesota Rules Chapters 8410, 8420 and 7050.0210,
and to be consistent with regional watershed organization rules.

§406.020. ILLICIT DISCHARGE DETECTION AND ELIMINATION
Subd. 1. Findings. The City Council hereby finds that nonstormwater discharges
to the City's municipal separate storm sewer system are subject to higher levels of pollutants
that enter into receiving water bodies adversely affecting the public health, safety and
general welfare by impacting water quality, creating nuisances, impairing other beneficial
uses of environmental resources and hindering the ability of the City to provide adequate
water, sewage, flood control and other community services.
Subd. 2. Purpose. The purpose of the ordinance is to promote, preserve and
enhance the natural resources within the City and protect them from adverse effects
occasioned by nonstormwater discharges by regulating discharges that would have an adverse
and potentially irreversible impact on water quality and environmentally sensitive land. In
addition to requirements relative to the City's sanitary sewer system, this article establishes
methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the City's municipal separate storm
sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit process and for controlling the introduction. The
objectives of this ordinance are:
a) To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer
system (MS4) by stormwater discharges by any user.
b) To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer
system, and
c) To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, enforcement, and
monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this ordinance.

necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.
All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure
their accuracy.
e) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be
inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or
oral request of the City and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access
shall be borne by the operator.
Subd. 12. Access. If the City has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which stormwater is discharged, and is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this section or that there is a need to
inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify
compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the City may seek an administrative
search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
Subd. 13. Enforcement.
a) When the City finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision
of this ordinance, or any order issued hereunder and that the violation(s) has (have)
caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the stormwater
management system or waters of the state which reasonably appears to present an
imminent and substantial endangerment to the environment, or to the health or
welfare of persons, the City may issue and order to the violator to immediately cease
and desist all violations.
b) Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. All persons discharging to the
storm sewer system in violation of this article may have their storm sewer system
access terminated if such termination serves to abate or reduce an illicit discharge. It
is a violation of this section to reinstate storm sewer system access to premises that
have been terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the City.
c) If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued, the City may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the stormwater
management system or public waters, or to minimize danger to persons. If the
violation is not immediately abated, action may be initiated by the City and all

V. PROHIBITING THE USE AND SALE OF COAL TAR-BASED SEALANTS
§511.101. PURPOSE.
The City of White Bear Lake highly values lakes, rivers, streams and other
bodies of water as natural assets which enhance the environmental, recreational,
cultural and economic resources and contribute to the general health and welfare of the
community.
The use of sealers on asphalt surfaces is a common maintenance practice.
However, scientific studies on the use of pavement sealers have demonstrated a
relationship between stormwater runoff and certain health and environmental
conditions, including the presence of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, a known
carcinogen.
The purpose of this ordinance is to regulate the use of sealer products within the
City of White Bear Lake, in order to protect, restore, and preserve the quality of its
waters. Further, it is the purpose of this ordinance to enhance compliance with the
application prohibition through regulating sale of certain products.
§501.020. DEFINITIONS.
Except as may otherwise be provided or clearly implied by context, all terms shall
be given their commonly accepted definitions. For the purpose of this ordinance, the
following definitions shall apply unless the context clear indicates or requires a different
meaning:
ASPHALT-BASED SEALER. A petroleum-based sealer material that is
commonly used on driveways, parking lots, and other surfaces and which does not
contain coal tar.
COAL TAR. A byproduct of the process used to refine coal.
COAL TAR-BASED SEALER. A sealer material containing coal tar and is for
use on an asphalt or concrete surface, including a driveway or parking area.
CITY. The City of White Bear Lake.
PAHs. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons. A group of organic chemicals formed
during the incomplete burning of coal, oil, gas, or other organic substances. Present in
coal tar and believed harmful to humans, fish, and other aquatic life.

parking lot, or other surface within the City of White Bear Lake.
Subd. 2. No person shall contract with any commercial sealer product applicator,
residential or commercial developer, or any other person for the application of any coal
tar-based sealer to any driveway, parking lot, or other surface within the City.

developer, or other similar individual or organization shall direct any employee,
independent contractor, volunteer, or other person to apply any coal tar-based sealer to
any driveway, parking lot, or other surface within the City. A person who owns property
on which a coal tar-based sealer is used is presumed to have used a coal tar-based
saler in violation of this section.
§511.040. SALE OF COAL TAR-BASED SEALER RESTRICTED
Subd. 1. A person may not sell a coal tar-based sealer product within the City,
unless:
a) The sale is to a person who intends to use the coal tar-based sealer
outside the Citys planning jurisdiction; and
b) The seller requires the purchaser to complete and sign a form provided by
the City that includes:
1. The name, address, and phone number of the purchase,

correct, and
6. The seller retains the completed form for a period of not less than two
years and allows the City to inspect or copy of the form upon request.
§511.050. ASPHALT-BASED SEALCOAT PRODUCTS.
The provisions of this ordinance shall only apply to use of coal tar-based sealer
in the City and shall not affect the use or sale of asphalt-based sealer products within
the City.
§511.060 PUBLIC HEALTH, WELFARE AND SANITATION §511.070
§511.060. PENALTY.
Any person convicted of violating any provision of this ordinance is guilty of a
misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) or imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days, or both, plus the costs
of prosecution in either case.
§511.070. SEVERABILITY.

for a parking permit issued pursuant to §603.300. Violation of any application requirement shall
be grounds for denial or revocation of the permit and shall be punishable as a misdemeanor. It shall

racing of pigeons, and providing for the issuance of licenses and providing for violations. (Ref.
Ord. 16-04-2011, 4/12/16).
Subd. 2. Intent and Purpose. It is the purpose and intent of this ordinance to permit
the keeping, maintenance and flying of certain registered pigeons as a recreational sport and
hobby, subject to regulations hereinafter set forth. The keeping, breeding, maintenance and
flying of fancy, racing and sporting breeds of pigeons, as defined herein, is determined not to
be a nuisance and is not detrimental to the public welfare, if regulated as hereafter set forth.
It is recognized that the keeping, breeding, maintenance and flying of such pigeons is now
mainly engaged in by members of local, district and national organizations, and such persons
keep their pigeons in suitable permanent structures constructed and maintained for such
purpose, and keep such structures in a clean and sanitary manner, and do not permit their
pigeons to remain at large in the community in such manner as to disturb their neighbors or
to prevent the full enjoyment of property rights by their neighbors.
It is also recognized that the ability to cultivate ones own food is a sustainable activity that
can also be a rewarding pastime. Therefore, it is also the purpose and intent of this
ordinance to permit the keeping and maintenance of hens in a clean and sanitary manner that
is not a nuisance to or detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare of the community.

any event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant may proceed

two (2) business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the
necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the requirements
necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the actions it took in response to the

City of the most accurate and up-to-date information as soon as this information is known.
§906.220 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
Subd. 1. Substantial Breach. The City reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any
right-of-way permit without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of the terms and conditions

following:
(i) The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit.

indicated on an order issued pursuant to Sec. 906.190.
Subd. 2. Written Notice of Breach. If the City determines that a permittee has committed
a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or any
condition of the permit, the City shall follow the procedural requirements of Sec. 906.170, subd.
2 of this chapter. In addition, the demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for
revocation of the permit. A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the City, at its discretion,
to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach.
§906.010 PUBLIC WAYS AND PROPERTY §906.320
Subd. 3. Response to Notice of Breach. Within two (2) calendar days of receiving
notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the City with a plan, acceptable to the City,
that will cure the breach. The permittees failure to so contact the City, or the permittees failure
to timely submit an acceptable plan, or the permittees failure to reasonably implement the
approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit.
Subd. 4. Reimbursement of City costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also
reimburse the City for the Citys reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of
collection and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with such revocation.

laterals and the service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the Director reasonably
requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the Director evidence satisfactory of
the installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this subdivision 2 and with applicable
Gopher State One Call law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after
December 31, 2005, shall be a condition of any City approval necessary for:
(i) payments to contractors working on a public improvement project, including those
under Minn. Stat. ch. 429; and
(ii) City approval under development agreements or other subdivision or site plan
approvals under Minn. Stat. ch. 462. The Director shall reasonably determine the appropriate
method of providing such information to the City. Failure to provide prompt and accurate
information on the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit issued for
the work or future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors.

users of the right of way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the
publics needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right of way, the time of year
with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right of way, and future
City plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be
in the public interest. The City shall provide written findings to a registrant in connection with the
prohibition of new or additional facilities within the right of way.
§906.250 PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION. In addition to complying with the
requirements of Minn. Stat. §§ 216D.01-.09 (Excavation Notice System) before the start date of
any right-of-way excavation, each registrant who has facilities or equipment in the area to be
excavated shall mark the horizontal and vertical placement of all said facilities. Any registrant
whose facilities are less than twenty (20) inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall notify
and work closely with the excavation contractor to establish the exact location of its facilities and

therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of
billing. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right of
way which it or its facilities damage. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing

emergency occasioned by that registrants facilities.

a permit under this chapter, a registrant or permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the City in

Subd. 1. Discontinued Operations. A registrant who has determined to discontinue all or
a portion of its operations in the City must provide information satisfactory to the City that the
registrants obligations for its facilities in the right of way under this chapter have been lawfully

denied a permit; (2) has had a permit revoked; (3) believes that the fees imposed by the City are
not in conformity with Section 237.163, subd. 6 of the Act; or (4) disputes a determination of the
Director regarding Section 906.230, subd.2 of this chapter may have the denial, revocation, fee
imposition, or decision reviewed, upon written request, by the City Council. The City Council
shall act on a timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting, provided the registrant
or right-of-way user, as the case may be, has submitted its appeal with sufficient time to include
the appeal as a regular agenda item. A decision by the City Council affirming the denial,
revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and supported by written findings establishing the
reasonableness of the decision.
§906.310 RESERVATION OF REGULATORY AND POLICE POWERS. A permittees rights
are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the City to adopt and enforce general ordinances
as necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.
§906.320 SEVERABILITY. If any portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent
provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. Nothing
in this chapter precludes the City from requiring a franchise agreement with a registrant or rightof-
way user, as allowed by law, in addition to requirements set forth herein.

Subd. 1 Findings, Purpose and Intent, and Effect:
A. Findings: The city council hereby finds as follows:
1. Exterior signs have a substantial impact on the character and quality of the
environment.
2. Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a
variety of messages.
3. Signs can create traffic hazards, aesthetic concerns and detriments to property
values, thereby threatening the public health, safety and welfare.
4. The city's zoning regulations have included the regulation of signs in an effort to
provide adequate means of expression and to promote the economic viability of
the business community, while protecting the city and its citizens from a
proliferation of signs of a type, size, location and character that would adversely
impact upon the aesthetics of the community and threaten the health, safety and
welfare of the community. The regulations of the physical characteristics of signs
within the city have had a positive impact on traffic safety and the appearance of
the community.
B. Purpose and Intent: It is not the purpose or intent of this section to regulate the
message displayed on any sign; nor is it the purpose or intent of this section to regulate
any building design or any display not defined as a sign, or any sign which cannot be
viewed from outside a building. The purpose and intent of this section is to:
1. Regulate the number, location, size, type, illumination and other physical
characteristics of signs within the city in order to promote the public health, safety
and welfare.
2. Maintain, enhance and improve the aesthetic environment of the city by preventing
visual clutter that is harmful to the appearance of the community.
3. Improve the visual appearance of the city while providing for effective means of
communication, consistent with constitutional guarantees and the city's goals of
public safety and aesthetics.
4. Provide for fair and consistent enforcement of the sign regulations set forth herein
under the zoning authority of the city.
C. Effect: A sign may be erected, mounted, displayed or maintained in the city if it is in
conformance with the provisions of these regulations. The effect of this section, as more
specifically set forth herein, is to:
§1202.010 BUILDING REGULATIONS §1202.010
1202.010.2
1. Allow a wide variety of sign types in commercial zones, and a more limited variety
of signs in other zones, subject to the standards set forth in this section.
2. Allow certain small, unobtrusive signs incidental to the principal use of a site in all
zones when in compliance with the requirements of this section or when required
by federal, state or local law.
3. Prohibit signs whose location, size, type, illumination or other physical
characteristics negatively affect the environment and where the communication
can be accomplished by means having a lesser impact on the environment and the
public health, safety and welfare.
4. Provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this section.
D. Severability: If any subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this section is for any
reason held to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
portions of this section. The city council hereby declares that it would have adopted this
section in each subsection, sentence, or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any
one or more subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases be declared invalid.
E. Any sign not identified as permitted or allowed by this code is prohibited.

3) That granting the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
this Code and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the
public welfare.
4) That the special condition or circumstance is not the result of actions of the applicant,
the property owner or a predecessor in title.
5) That non-conforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same
district is not the sole grounds for issuance of the variance.
c) Variances from the strict application of the Zoning code may be granted to alleviate practical
difficulties such as problems caused by public actions, unusual topography, lot shapes,
wetlands, or other exceptional physical conditions. The situation must be such that strict application
of the Zoning Code would result in exceptional practical difficulty, which would deprive the
owner of the reasonable use of the land or of the building involved. Should the City Council,
acting on the advice of the Planning Commission, find that these conditions apply to the land, a
variance may be granted from the strict application of this Code so as to relieve such difficulty to
the degree considered reasonable, provided such relief may be granted without impairing the
intent of this Code. The City Council may approve the variance subject to such conditions as it
may deem necessary or desirable. (Ref. Ord. 10-1-1061, 1/12/10; Ord. No. 14-08-1098, 8/26/14)

1301.070.1
§1301.070 ADMINISTRATION - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
Subd. 1. Purpose. The purpose of the PUD, Planned Unit Development Overlay District is
to provide for the integration and coordination of land parcels as well as the combination of varying
types of residential and commercial uses. This section is established to provide comprehensive
procedures and standards designed to allow greater flexibility in the development of neighborhoods
and/or nonresidential areas by incorporating design modifications as part of a PUD conditional use
permit or a mixture of densities/intensities, or use types when applied to a PUD district. The PUD
process by allowing variation from the strict provisions of this Code related to density, setbacks,
height, lot area, width and depth, yards, etc., is intended to encourage: (Ref. Ord. 10-1-1061, 1/12/10)
a) Innovations in development to the end that the growing demands for all styles of economic
expansion may be met by greater variety in type, design, and siting of structures and by the
conservation and more efficient use of land in such developments;
b) Higher standards of site and building design through the use of trained and experienced land
planners, architects, landscape architects and engineers;
c) More convenience in location and design of development and service facilities;
d) The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such as natural topography
and geologic features and the prevention of soil erosion;
e) A creative use of land and related physical development which allows a phased and orderly
development and use pattern;
f) An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets thereby lower
development costs and public investments;
g) A development pattern in harmony with the objectives of the White Bear Lake Comprehensive
Plan. (Ref. Ord. 10-1-1061, 1/12/10)
h) A more desirable and creative environment than might be possible through the strict application
of zoning and subdivision regulations of the City.
i) A mix of land uses made compatible through careful oversight. (Ref. Ord. 10-1-1061, 1/12/10)
Subd. 2. General Requirements and Standards.
a) Application. All permitted, permitted accessory, or conditional uses contained in Section
1303.020 (Open Space) through 1303.180 (BW) and 1303.225 (DBD) through 1303.227 (LVMU)
of this code shall be treated as permitted uses within a PUD District to eliminate the overlapping
procedural requirements of individual conditional use provisions. The PUD overlay district shall
be applied to and superimposed upon all zoning districts. Upon approval by the City Council,
the regulations and requirements imposed upon the PUD process shall supersede the
underlying zoning district standards. (Ref. Ord. 10-1-1061, 1/12/10)
§1301.070 ZONING CODE §1301.070
1301.070.2

landowners of the property included in a project and must be accompanied by a fee of six
hundred fifty ($650.00) dollars. The application and all submissions must be directed to the
development of the property as a unified whole. In the case of multiple ownership, the approved
Final Plan shall be binding on all owners. (Ref. Ord. 01-04-1015, 1/13/04)
c) Comprehensive Plan Consistency. The proposed PUD shall be consistent with the City

owner's association or corporation shall be formed and that all owners shall be
members of said association or corporation which shall maintain all properties and
common areas in good repair and which shall assess individual property owners proportionate

public open space, and is planned as a staged development over a period of time, the total area
of common or public open space or land escrow security in any stage of development shall, at a
minimum, bear the same relationship to the total open space to be provided in the entire PUD as
the stages or units completed or under development bear to the entire PUD.
§1301.070 ZONING CODE §1301.070
1301.070.4
h) Density.
1) The maximum allowable density in a PUD District shall be determined by standards
negotiated and agreed upon between the applicant and the City. Whenever any PUD is to

that all developable land will be accorded a present vested right to develop at such time as
services and facilities are available. Lands which have the necessary available municipal
facilities and services will be granted approval in accordance with existing codes and
development techniques. Lands which lack the available public facilities and services may be
granted approval for development, provided that all applicable provisions of this Code, the City

within six (6) months from the date Council grants Development Stage Plan approval, or in
any case where the applicant fails to file Final Plans and to proceed with development in

Stage Plan approval has been given.
d) Final Plan.
1) Purpose. The Final Plan is to serve as a complete, thorough and permanent public record
of the PUD and the manner in which it is to be developed. It shall incorporate all prior
approved plans and all approved modifications thereof resulting from the PUD process. It
shall serve in conjunction with other City codes as the land use regulation applicable to the

§1301.070 ZONING CODE §1301.070
1301.070.14
4) Limitation on Final Plan Approval. Within one (1) year after the approval of a Final Plan for
PUD, or such shorter time as may be established by the approved development schedule,
construction shall commence in accordance with such approved plan. Failure to
commence construction within such period shall, unless an extension shall have been
granted as hereinafter provided, automatically render void the PUD and all approvals of the
PUD plan and the area encompassed within the PUD shall thereafter be subject to those
provisions applicable in the district in which it is located. In such case, the Council shall
forthwith, as applicable, adopt a resolution or ordinance repealing the PUD and all PUD
approvals and re-establishing the zoning and other code provisions that would otherwise
be applicable. The time limit established by this paragraph may, at the discretion of the
Council, be extended.
5) Inspections During Development.
a. Compliance with Overall Plan. Following Final Plan approval of a PUD, or a stage
thereof, the Zoning Administrator shall, at least annually until the completion of
development, review all permits issued and construction undertaken and compare
actual development with the approved development schedule. If the Zoning
Administrator finds that development is not proceeding in accordance with the
approved schedule, or that it fails in any other respect to comply with the PUD plans
as finally approved, he shall immediately notify the Council. Within thirty (30) days of
such notice, the Council shall either by ordinance or resolution as may be applicable,
revoke the PUD and the land shall thereafter be governed by the regulations
applicable in the district in which it is located; or shall take such steps as it shall deem
necessary to compel compliance with the Final Plans as approved; or shall require
the landowner or applicant to seek an amendment of the Final Plan.

1302.010.1
§1302 GENERAL PROVISIONS
§1302.010 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS STRUCTURES AND USES.
Subd. 1. Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section to provide for the regulation of
nonconforming buildings, structures and uses and to specify those requirements, circumstances and
conditions under which nonconforming buildings, structures and uses will be operated and maintained.
The Zoning Code establishes separate districts, each of which is an appropriate area for the location of
uses which are permitted in that district. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of these
districts that nonconforming buildings, structures and uses not be permitted to continue without restriction.
Furthermore, it is the intent of this Section that all nonconforming uses shall be eventually brought into
conformity.
Subd. 2. Provisions.
a) Any nonconforming structure or use lawfully existing upon the effective date of this Code shall not
be enlarged or reconstructed, but may be continued at the size and in the manner of operation
existing upon such date except as hereinafter specified or subsequently amended.
b) Any proposed structure which will, under this Code, become nonconforming but for which a
building permit has been lawfully granted prior to the effective date of this Code may be completed
in accordance with the approved plans, provided construction is started within sixty (60) days of the
effective date of this Code, is not abandoned for a period of more than one hundred twenty (120)
days, and continues to completion within two (2) years. Such structure and use shall thereafter be
a legally nonconforming structure and use.
c) Normal maintenance of a building or other structure containing or related to a lawful
nonconforming use is permitted, including necessary repairs and incidental alterations which do
not physically extend or intensify the nonconforming use. (Ref. Ord. 10-1-1062, 1/12/10)
d) Except as provided in e) below, alterations may be made to a building containing lawful
nonconforming residential units when they will improve the livability thereof, provided they will not
increase the number of dwelling units or size or volume of the building. A dwelling may not,
however, be demolished and a new dwelling constructed unless the new dwelling is in full
compliance with this Code.
e) Nonconforming, single family dwelling units may be expanded to improve livability as a conditional
use as regulated by Section 1301.050 of this Code, provided that the nonconformity is not
increased.
f) Nothing in this Section shall prevent the placing of a structure in safe condition when said structure
is declared unsafe by the Building Official providing the necessary repairs shall not constitute more
than fifty (50) percent of fair market value of such structure. Said value shall be determined by the
City.
g) No nonconforming building, structure or use shall be moved to another lot or to any other part of
the parcel of land upon which the same was constructed or was conducted at the time of this Code
adoption unless such movement shall bring the nonconformance into substantially closer
compliance with the requirements of this Code.
§1302.010 ZONING CODE §1302.010
1302.010.2
h) When any lawful nonconforming uses of any structure or land in any district has been changed to a
conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use.
i) A lawful nonconforming use of a structure or parcel of land may be changed to lessen the
nonconformity of use. Once a nonconforming structure or parcel of land has been changed, it shall
not thereafter be so altered to increase the nonconformity.
j) If at any time, a nonconforming building, structure or use shall be destroyed to the extent of more
than fifty (50) percent of its fair market value, said value to be determined by the City, then without
further action by the Council, the building and the land on which such building was located or maintained
shall, from and after the date of said destruction, be subject to all the regulations specified
by these zoning regulations for the district in which such land and buildings are located. Any
building which is damaged to an extent of less than fifty (50) percent of its value may be restored
to its former extent, if it is reconstructed within twelve (12) months after the date of said damage.
Estimate of the extent of damage or destruction shall be made by the Building Official.
k) Whenever a lawful nonconforming use of a structure or land is discontinued for a period of one (1)
year, any future use of said structure or lands shall be made to conform with the provisions of this
Code. (04-04-1017, 4/13/04)
l) Wherever a non-conforming use is adjacent to a residential property, and this code would require
screening between the non-conforming use and the residential property, if the non-conforming use
was in a proper zoning district, such screening requirement is applicable to the non-conforming
use. (Ref. Ord. 779, 1/10/89)

1302.025.1
§1302.025 MORATORIUM ON ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS.
Subd. 1. The City Council finds that there are circumstances where, because of changing
development patterns, proposed changes to the City's comprehensive plan, and for other good reasons, it
is necessary to establish moratoriums on the issuance of building permits to allow the City staff and City
Council to study and make amendments to the City's zoning code, subdivision code, or to consider
proposed public improvements. It is the intent of the City Council through this ordinance, to establish an
expeditious procedure for the implementation of such moratoriums and to provide persons affected by
such moratoriums with a means for seeking a variance from the provisions of such a moratorium.

1302.120.1
§1302.120 HOME OCCUPATIONS
Subd. 1. Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to prevent competition with business
districts and to provide a means through the establishment of specific standards and procedures by which
home occupations can be conducted in residential neighborhoods without jeopardizing the health, safety
and general welfare of the surrounding neighborhood. In addition, this Section is intended to provide a
mechanism enabling the distinction between permitted home occupations and special or customarily
"more sensitive" home occupations, so that permitted home occupations may be allowed through an
administrative process rather than a legislative hearing process.
Subd. 2. Application. Subject to the nonconforming use provision of this Section, all
occupations conducted in the home shall comply with the provisions of this Section. This Section shall not
be construed, however, to apply to home occupations accessory to farming.
Subd. 3. Procedures and Permits.
a) Registered Home Occupation. Any home occupation determined by the Zoning Administrator to
meet the specific provisions of Section 1302.120, Subdivision 4 b), shall be considered a
registered home occupation. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to waive the formal permit
requirements for a registered home occupation. The applicant shall register the home occupation
with the city by submitting a letter of intent to the Zoning Administrator describing the nature of the
home occupation and consenting to comply with all of the provisions for a registered home
occupation and other applicable provisions of this Code.
The home occupation shall be allowed to continue until such time as there has been a change in
conditions or until such time as the provisions of this Section have been breached. At such time
as the city has reason to believe that either event has taken place, the Zoning Administrator shall
determine whether the applicant shall be required to make formal application for a permit. (Ref.
Ord. 908; 4/12/94
b) Permitted Home Occupation. Any permitted home occupation as defined in this Code shall require
a "permitted home occupation permit". Such permits shall be issued subject to the conditions of
this Section, other applicable City Codes and State law. This permit may be issued by the Zoning
Administrator or his agent based upon proof of compliance with the provisions of this Section.
Application for the "permitted home occupation permit" shall be accompanied by a fee as adopted
by the City Council. If the Administrator denies a permitted home occupation permit to an applicant,
the applicant may appeal the decision to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission
shall make a recommendation to the Council, which shall make the final decision. The permit shall
remain in force and effect until such time as there has been a change in conditions or until such
time as the provisions of this Section have been breached. At such time as the City has reason to
believe that either event has taken place, a public hearing shall be held before the Planning
Commission. The City Council shall make a final decision on whether or not the permit holder is
entitled to the permit.
§1302.120 ZONING CODE §1302.120
1302.120.2
c) Special Home Occupation. Any home occupation which does not meet the specific requirements
for a permitted home occupation as defined in this Section shall require a "special home
occupation permit" which shall be applied for, reviewed and disposed of in accordance with the
provisions of Section 1301.050 of this Code (Conditional Use).
d) Declaration of Conditions. The Planning Commission and City Council may impose such
conditions on the granting of a special home occupation permit as may be necessary to carry out
the purpose and provisions of this Section.
e) Effect of Permit. A "special home occupation permit" may be issued for a period of one (1) year
after which the permit may be reissued for periods of up to three (3) years each. Each application
for permit renewal shall, however, be processed in accordance with the procedural requirements of
the initial "special home occupation permit".
f) Transferability. Permits shall not run with the land and shall not be transferable.
g) Lapse of Special Home Occupation Permit by Nonuse. Whenever within one (1) year after granting
a permit the use as permitted by the permit shall not have been initiated, then such permit shall
become null and void unless a petition for extension of time in which to complete the work has
been granted by the City Council. Such extension shall be requested in writing and filed with the
Zoning Administrator at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the original permit. There
shall be no charge for the filing of such petition. The request for extension shall state facts
showing a good faith attempt to initiate the use. Such petition shall be presented to the Planning
Commission for a recommendation and to the City Council for a decision.
h) Reconsideration. Whenever an application for a permit has been considered and denied by the
City Council, a similar application for a permit affecting substantially the same property shall not be
considered again by the Planning Commission or City Council for at least six (6) months from the
date of its denial unless a decision to reconsider such matter is made by a majority vote of the City
Council.
i) Renewal of Permits. An applicant shall not have a vested right to a permit renewal by reason of
having obtained a previous permit. In applying for and accepting a permit, the permit holder agrees
that his monetary investment in the home occupation will be fully amortized over the life of the
permit and that a permit renewal will not be needed to amortize the investment. Each application
for the renewal of a permit will be considered de novo without taking into consideration that a
previous permit has been granted. The previous granting of renewal of a permit shall not constitute
a precedent or basis for the renewal of a permit. (Ref. Ord. 908; 4/12/94)

District, are intended to encourage high-quality, scale-appropriate building design that
respects the historic character of the B-5, Central Business District. While the building scale
and design standards do not dictate a particular architectural style, it is the intent of the City to
encourage building design that compliments the architecture of its historically significant
buildings located within the B-5, Central Business District.

h. Parking Requirements
It is recognized that the pedestrian character and small lot sizes within the B-5, Central
Business District make the provision of individual private on-site parking facilities difficult and
detrimental to the traditional character of the district. In addition to on-street parking and
public parking spaces, business owners are encouraged to pursue shared and off-site parking
arrangements at the rear of properties in the B-5, Central Business District.
1. Number of Required Parking Spaces in the B-5, Central Business District

buildings separate parking areas from the street. The City may permit parking to the
side of a building if the lot is a minimum of 150 in width. The need for parking on the
side of the buildings will be evaluated by the City on a case-by-case basis and shall
only be permitted where the configuration of the site and/or need for on-site parking
makes locating all parking at the rear of the building infeasible.

Subd. 1. Shoreland Districts. The shorelands within the City of White Bear Lake are
hereby designated as shoreland districts and the requirements set forth in this Code shall govern
development and other activities within these districts. The classification of the shoreland areas shall
govern the use, alteration and development of these areas according to said classification as per M.S.
§105.485, M.S. §104.31-104.40, and Minnesota Regulations NR 78-84 and NR 2900.
Subd. 2. District Application. The "S", Shoreland District shall be applied to and
superimposed upon all zoning districts as contained herein as existing or amended by the text and
map of this Code. The regulations and requirements imposed by the "S", Shoreland District shall be in
addition to those established for districts which jointly apply. Under the joint application of districts, the
more restrictive requirements shall apply.
Subd. 3. Boundaries. The boundaries of the Shoreland District are established within the
following distances from the ordinary high water level of the surface water, depending on the size of
the surface water as indicated on the White Bear Lake Shoreland District Map. (Ref. Ord. 915,
12/13/94)
SURFACE WATER DISTANCE (FEET)*
Greater than ten (10) acres (Table 1) 1,000
Rivers and Streams (draining on area greater
than two (2) square miles) 300**
* The practical distance may be less whenever the waters involved are bounded by topographical
divides which extend landward from the waters for lesser distances and prevent flowage toward
the surface water.
** The distance requirement shall be increased to the limit of the flood plain when the flood plain is
greater than three hundred (300) feet.
In the case of conflict between the map and the property description in NR 2900, the latter shall
prevail.

1303.230.6
4) Steep Slope Evaluation. The City Planner must evaluate possible soil erosion impacts
and development visibility from public waters before issuing a permit for construction of
sewage treatment systems, roads, driveways, structures, or other improvements on
steep slopes. When determined necessary, conditions must be attached to issued
permits to prevent erosion and to preserve existing vegetation screening of structures,
vehicles, and other facilities as viewed from the surface of public waters, assuming
summer, leaf-on vegetation.
5) Exceptions.
a) Expansion of permitted principal use or accessory use or development of a new
accessory use contained in the R-1I, R-1S, R-2, R-3, and R-4 Districts within any
Shoreland District shall be exempt from the conditional use permit requirements.
Except for legal non-conforming lot width and area conditions, said expansion must
meet all other standards of applicable zoning use district(s) or be subject to a
variance per § 1301.060. (Ref. Ord. 99-11-974, 11/9/99)

c) The provisions otherwise set forth in this Code and in other applicable local codes
shall apply to all development and subdivisions of real estate except Planned Unit
Development. (Ref. Ord. 99-11-974, 11/9/99)
6) Subdivision. No land shall be subdivided which is determined by the City or the
Commissioner of Natural Resources to be unsuitable by reason of flooding, inadequate
drainage, soil and rock formations with severe limitations for development, severe erosion
potential, unfavorable topography, inadequate water supply or sewage treatment
capabilities or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of the
future residents of the proposed subdivision or the community.
§1303.230 ZONING CODE §1303.230
1303.230.7
b) Sewage and Waste Disposal.
1) Public Systems. All premises used for human occupancy shall be connected to public
sanitary sewer collection and treatment facilities. Only in cases where public sewer is
neither available nor proposed, and installation of sewer lines is deemed to be financially
infeasible as determined through prior public hearing processes, then on-site sewage
treatment facilities shall be deemed permissible provided all appropriate state and local
regulations are met.
2) Private Sewage Treatment Standards. All private sewage treatment systems must meet
or exceed the standards adopted by §504 of the City Code.
3) Sewage Treatment System Upgrade Required. A sewage treatment system not meeting
the requirements of §1303.230, Subd. 6b)2) of this ordinance must be upgraded, at a
minimum, at any time a permit or variance is required for any use of the property involving
new construction or expansion of the living area of twenty-five percent (25%) or more, or
the addition of a bedroom or bathroom, but excluding such improvements as screen
porches, entry ways, decks, attics, patios, non-habitable storage space, etc. For the
purposes of this provision, a sewage treatment system shall not be considered
nonconforming if the only deficiency is the sewage treatment system's improper setback
from the ordinary high water level.
4) Nonconforming Sewage Treatment Systems. Within a reasonable period of time which
shall not exceed two years, all nonconforming private sewage treatments systems shall
be identified by inspection required by §1303.230, Subd. 6b)5) and shall be upgraded or
replaced. Systems that were installed according to all applicable local standards adopted
and in effect at the time of installation shall be considered as conforming unless they are
determined to be failing, except that systems using cesspools, leaching pits, or seepage
pits, or systems with less than three feet of unsaturated soil or sand between the
distribution device and the limiting soil characteristics or ground water shall be considered
nonconforming. A system shall be determined failing if it shows signs of surface
discharge or seepage from a soil treatment system to the ground surface, abandoned
wells, bodies of surface water or into any rock or soil formation the structure of which is
not conducive to purification by filtration or into any well or any excavation in the ground.
For the purposes of this provision, a sewage treatment system shall not be considered
nonconforming if the only deficiency is the sewage treatment system's improper setback
from the ordinary high water level.
5) Sewage Treatment System Inspection Required. Each individual sewage treatment
system currently existing shall be inspected for conformance and proper operation and
these currently existing systems as well as those installed under §1303.230, Subd. 6b) of
this ordinance, shall be inspected biennially for proper operation by an individual or firm
certified and licensed to provide individual sewage treatment system inspection, site
evaluation, or design services. The individual or firm performing the inspection must
issue a certificate of compliance or notice of noncompliance, whichever may be the case,
to the property owner, and must provide a copy of the certificate or notice to the City.
§1303.230 ZONING CODE §1303.230
1303.230.8
c) Water Supply. Any private supply of water for domestic purposes shall conform to Minnesota
Department of Health Standards for water quality. Private wells shall be placed in areas not
subject to flooding and up slope from any source of contamination. Wells already existing in
areas subject to flooding shall be flood proofed in accordance with City standards.
Subd. 7. Shoreland Alterations.
a) The removal of natural vegetation shall be regulated to: Prevent erosion into public waters, conserve
nutrients in the soil, preserve shoreland aesthetics and historic values, prevent bank
slumping, and protect fish and wildlife habitat.
1) Intensive vegetation clearing within the shore impact zone is prohibited;
2) Clear cutting is prohibited, except as necessary for placing public roads, utilities,
structures, and parking areas;
3) Natural vegetation shall be restored insofar as feasible after any construction project;
4) Selective cutting of trees and underbrush is allowed as long as sufficient cover is left to
make cars and structures inconspicuous when viewed from the water. (Ref. Ord. 915,
12/13/94)
b) Grading and Filling.
1) Grading and filling within Shoreland Districts, or any alteration of the natural topography
where the slope of the land is toward a public water or water course leading to a public
water must be approved by the Building Official and a permit obtained prior to the
commencement of any work thereon. The permit may be granted subject to the following
conditions:
a. Alterations of topography will be permitted only if they are accessory to permitted or
conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent or nearby properties;
b. An approved schedule for grading which minimizes the duration for which bare
ground is exposed shall be required;
c. Temporary ground cover such as mulch shall be used and permanent cover such
as sod shall be planted as soon as possible;
d. Methods to prevent erosion and trap sediment shall be employed in accordance
with the White Bear Lake Subdivision Code §1404.050;
e. Fill shall not be placed in areas lower in elevation than the ordinary high water
level;
f. Fill shall be stabilized according to accepted engineering standards;
g. Fill shall not restrict a floodway or destroy the storage capacity of a flood plain;
§1303.230 ZONING CODE §1303.230
1303.230.9
h. The maximum slope of the finished surface which slopes toward a water body or a
water course leading to such water body shall be six (6) units horizontal to one (1)
vertical; (Ref. Ord. 915, 12/13/94)
i. Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading of the shoreline and
placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the finished slope does not exceed three
feet horizontal to one foot vertical, the landward extent of the riprap is within ten
(10) feet of the ordinary high water level, and the height of the riprap above the
ordinary high water level does not exceed three (3) feet.
2) Any work which will change or diminish the course, current, or cross section of a public
water must be approved by the department of natural Resources as per M.S. §105.44
before the work is begun. This includes construction of channels and ditches, lagooning,
dredging of lake bottom for the removal of muck, silt or weeds, and filling the lake bed, including
low lying marsh areas. Approval shall be construed to mean the issuance by the
Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources of a permit under the procedures
of Minnesota Statute, 1974, Section 42 and other related statutes.
3) Excavation on shorelands where the intended purpose is connected to a public water,
such as boat slips, canals, lagoons and harbors, shall require a permit from the Building
Official prior to commencement of construction. Such permit shall be obtained only after
the Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources has approved the proposed
connection to public waters. Approval will be given only if the proposed work is consistent
with applicable state regulations for work in beds of public waters.
Subd. 8. Planned Unit Development. The Planned Unit Development provisions contained
in §1301.070 of this Code may be utilized within a Shoreland District, provided that the
following requirements are satisfactorily met.
a) The PUD shall be processed as a conditional use and shall require a shore impact plan
pursuant to the provisions of this Code;
b) Preliminary plans shall be reviewed by the Department of Natural Resources prior to City
approval;
c) The proposed PUD development is served by public sanitary sewer and public water;
d) Dwelling units or sites must be clustered into one or more groups and located on suitable areas
of the development. They must be designed and located to meet or exceed the following
dimensional standards for the relevant shoreland classification: setback from the ordinary high
water level, elevation above the surface water features, and maximum height. Setbacks from
the ordinary high water level must be increased in accordance with Subd. 8e) of this Section for
developments with density increases;
§1303.230 ZONING CODE §1303.230
1303.230.10
Suitability of the site shall be evaluated according to the following method;
1) The project parcel must be divided into tiers by locating one or more lines approximately
parallel to a line that identifies the ordinary high water level at the following intervals,
proceeding landward:
Sewered
General Development Lakes
- 1st Tier 200 ft.
- 2nd and additional Tiers 200 ft.
Recreational Development Lakes 267 ft.
Tributary 300 ft.
2) The suitable area (SAt) within each tier is calculated by excluding from the tier area all
wetlands, bluffs, or land below the ordinary high water level of public waters. This
suitable area and the proposed project are then subjected to either the residential or
commercial planned unit development density evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable
number of dwelling units or sites.
e) Density Evaluation. The procedures for determining the base density of a PUD are as follows.
Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any other tier further from the
waterbody, but must not be transferred to any other tier closer to the waterbody.
1) Residential PUD Base Density Evaluation. The base density within each tier shall be
calculated using the following formula:
Residential Base Density = SAt/LS
SAt = Suitable area within the tier as defined in Subd. 8d)2) of this Section
LS = For Lakes: Single residential lot size (area) standard from Subd. 5a) of this
Section
For Tributary: Single residential lot size (area) standard from Subd. 5a) of
this Section
2) Commercial PUD Base Density Evaluation. The base density with each tier shall be
calculated using the following steps:
a. Select the appropriate floor area ratio from Table 2:
§1303.230 ZONING CODE §1303.230
1303.230.11

1,400 .142 .072
1,500 .150 .075
>1,500 .150 .075
b. Calculate the Base Density Evaluation as follows:
Commercial Base Density = FAt/ALt
where FAt = (SAt)(FAR)
FAt = Total Floor Area for each tier allowed to be used for dwelling units or sites
ALt = Average inside living area size of dwelling units or sites within each tier*
SAt = Suitable Area for each tier as defined in Subd. 8d)2) of this Section
FAR = Floor Area Ratio from Table 2 above
* The average inside living area size of dwelling units or sites within each tier includes both
existing and proposed units and sites, but does not include decks, patios, stoops, steps,
garages, or porches and basements, unless they are habitable space.
§1303.230 ZONING CODE §1303.230
1303.230.12
f) Density Increase Multipliers:
1) Increases to the dwelling unit or dwelling site base densities are allowable if the
dimensional standards of this Code are met or exceeded and the provisions of §1301.070
are satisfied. The allowable density increases will be allowed only if the following
conditions are met: 1) Structure setbacks from the ordinary high water level are
increased to at least fifty (50) percent greater than the minimum setback, or 2) the impact
on the waterbody is reduced an equivalent amount through vegetative management,
topography, or additional means acceptable to the city and the setback is at least twentyfive
(25) percent greater than the minimum setback.
2) Allowable Dwelling Unit or Dwelling Site Density Increases for Residential or Commercial
Planned Unit Developments:
Maximum Density Increase
Density Evaluation Tiers Within Each Tier (Percent)
First Tier 50%
Second Tier 100%
Third Tier 200%
Fourth Tier 200%
Fifth Tier 200%
g) Sufficient open space shall be preserved through the use of restrictive deed covenants, public
dedications, etc. Open space shall be considered sufficient if it meets all of the following
criteria:
1) At least fifty (50) percent of the total project area must be preserved as open space;
2) Dwelling units or sites, road rights-of-way, or land covered by road surfaces, parking
areas, or structures, except water-oriented accessory structures or facilities, shall not be
included in the computation of minimum open space;
3) Open space must include areas with physical characteristics unsuitable for development
in their natural state, or areas containing significant historic sites or unplatted cemeteries;
4) Open space may include outdoor recreational facilities for use by owners of dwelling units
or sites, by guests staying in commercial dwelling units or sites, and by the general
public;
5) Open space must not include commercial facilities or uses, but may contain wateroriented
accessory structures or facilities;
6) The appearance of open space areas, including topography, vegetation, and allowable
uses, must be preserved by use of restrictive deed covenants, permanent easements,
public dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective and permanent means;
§1303.230 ZONING CODE §1303.230
1303.230.13
7) The shore impact zone, based on normal structure setbacks, must be included as open
space. For residential PUDs, at least fifty (50) percent of the shore impact zone area of
existing and new developments must be preserved in its natural or existing state. For
commercial PUDs, at least fifty (50) percent of the shore impact zone must be preserved
in its natural state.
h) All other provisions of this Section and §1301.070 of this ordinance are satisfied.
i) The following factors are carefully evaluated to ensure that the increased density of
development is consistent with the resource limitations of the public water:
1) Physical and aesthetic impact of increased density;
2) Level of current development;
3) Amount and ownership of undeveloped shoreland;
4) Levels and types of water surface use and public access;
5) Possible effects on overall public use.
j) Any commercial, recreational, community, or religious facility allowed as part of the planned unit
development conforms to all applicable federal and state regulations including, but not limited to
the following:
1) Licensing provisions or procedures;
2) Waste disposal regulations;
3) Water supply regulations;
4) Building codes;
5) Safety regulations;
6) Regulations concerning the appropriate use of Public Waters as defined in Minnesota
Statutes, Chapter 105, as may be amended;
7) Applicable regulations of the Minnesota Environmental Quality Board;
8) Storm sewer.
k) The final PUD plan shall not be modified or altered in any way without written approval from the
Department of Natural Resources;
§1303.230 ZONING CODE §1303.230
1303.230.14
l) PUDs incorporating shoreline recreational facilities such as beaches, docks, or boat launching
facilities, etc. shall be designed such that said facilities are centralized for common utilization.
The number of spaces provided for continuous beaching, mooring, or docking of watercraft must
not exceed one for each allowable dwelling unit or site in the first tier (notwithstanding existing
mooring sites in an existing commercially used harbor). Launching ramp facilities, including a
small dock for loading and unloading equipment, may be provided for use by occupants of
dwelling units or sites located in other tiers.
m) Accessory structures and facilities, except water-oriented accessory structures, shall meet the
required principal structure setback.
Subd. 9. Variance. Variances may be granted by the City Council upon application as
required in §1301.060 of this ordinance in extraordinary cases. The City Council may grant variances
only when the proposed use is determined to be in the public interest and no variance shall be
granted which the Council determines will or has a tendency to: (Ref. Ord. 878, 8/11/92; 915,
12/13/94)
a) Result in the placement of an artificial obstruction which will restrict the passage of storm and
flood water in such a manner as to increase the height off-loading, except obstructions approved
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in conjunction with sound flood plain management.
b) Result in incompatible land uses or which would be detrimental to the protection of surface and
ground water supplies.
c) Be not in keeping with land use plans and planning objectives for the City of White Bear Lake or
which will increase or cause danger to life or property.
d) Be inconsistent with the objectives of encouraging land uses compatible with the preservation of
the natural land forms, vegetation and the marshes and wetlands within the City of White Bear
Lake.

standards and criteria, and is consistent with the comprehensive management plan adopted by
the Commissioner of Natural Resources.
f) Alter the essential character of the locality as established by the management plan.
g) No permit or variance shall be issued unless the applicant has submitted a shoreland impact
plan as required and set forth in this Code. In granting any variance the Council may attach
such conditions as they deem necessary to insure compliance with the purpose and intent of this
Code.
h) No variance may be granted that would allow any use that is prohibited in the zoning district in
which the subject property is located. (Ref. Ord. 915, 12/13/94)
i) All variances to the requirements of this Section must be certified in accordance with NR 81 (b)
and Subd. 10 of this Section.
§1303.230 ZONING CODE §1303.230
1303.230.15
Subd. 10. Effect of Permit. The granting of any permit, variance or subdivision approval
under provisions of this Section shall in no way affect the owner's capability to obtain the approval
required by any other statute, ordinance or legislation of any state agency or subdivision hereof.

§1303.235, "FP", FLOOD PLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT
Subd. 1. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and Purpose (Ref. Ord. No. 846,
6/11/91)
a) Statutory Authorization: The Legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minnesota Statutes
Chapters 103F and Chapter (394 for counties or 462 for municipalities) delegated the authority
to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Minnesota
Statute, Chapter 103F further stipulates that communities subject to recurrent flooding must
participate and maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. Therefore the City
of White Bear Lake, Minnesota does ordain as follows:
b) Purpose: The purpose of this ordinance is to comply with the rules and regulations of the
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts
59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the community's eligibility in the NFIP and to minimize
potential losses due to periodic flooding including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures
for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare. (Ref. Ord. No. 10-4-1068, 4/13/10).
c) Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: This Ordinance does not imply that areas outside of the
flood plain district or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding and flood
damages. This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of White Bear Lake or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
Ordinance or any administrative decisions lawfully made thereunder. (Ref. Ord. 06-05-1035,
5/9/06)
Subd. 2. General Provisions.
a) Adoption of Flood Insurance Rate Map. Panel numbers 27123C0035G, 27123C0041G,
27123C0042G, 27123C0055G and 27123C0065G of the Ramsey County, Minnesota All
Jurisdictions Flood Insurance Rate Maps, dated June 4, 2010 and Panel number 27163C0240E
of the Washington County, Minnesota and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Maps
dated February 3, 2010, developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency are hereby
adopted by reference as the Official Flood Plain District Map and made a part of this ordinance.
(Ref. Ord. 10-4-1068, 4/13/10)
b) Lands to Which Ordinance Applies. This ordinance shall apply to all lands designated as flood
plain within the jurisdiction of the City of White Bear Lake.
c) Interpretation. The boundaries of the flood plain district shall be determined by scaling distances
on the Official Flood Plain District Map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location
of the boundaries of the flood plain district, the City Engineer shall make the necessary interpretation
based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, if available, and the
ground elevations that existed on the site at the time the City adopted its initial floodplain
ordinance, or the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map that placed the site in
the floodplain, if earlier. If 100-year flood plain evaluations are not available, the City shall
either require a flood plain evaluation consistent with Subd. 6 of this ordinance to determine a
100-year flood elevation for the site; or base its decision on available hydraulic/hydrologic or
site elevation survey data which demonstrates the likelihood the site is within or outside of the
flood plain. (Ref. Ord. 06-05-1035, 5/9/06, 10-4-1068, 4/13/10)
§1303.235 ZONING CODE §1303.235
1303.235.2
d) Annexations. The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference in Subd. 2.a, above,
may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the corporate boundaries of the City of White
Bear Lake at the time of adoption of this ordinance. If any of these floodplain land areas are
annexed into the City of White Bear Lake after the date of adoption of this ordinance (4/13/10),
the newly annexed floodplain lands shall be subject to the provisions of this ordinance
immediately upon the date of annexation into the City. (Ref. Ord. 10-4-1068, 4/13/10)
Subd. 3. Conflict with Pre-Existing Zoning Regulations, Uses, Standards, General
Compliance and Evaluation Criteria: The flood plain zoning district shall be considered an overlay
zoning district to all existing land use regulations of the community. The uses permitted in Subdivision
4.0 and 5.0 of this ordinance shall be permitted by issuance of a building or grading permit if not
prohibited by any established, underlying zoning district. The requirements of this ordinance shall
apply in addition to other legally established regulations of the community and where this ordinance
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance shall apply. (Ref. Ord. 10-4-1068,
4/13/10)
a) Compliance: No new structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be located,
extended, converted, repaired, maintained, or structurally altered without full compliance with the
terms of this Ordinance and other applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction
of this Ordinance. Within the Floodway and Flood Fringe, all uses not listed as permitted
uses in Subdivision 4.0 and 5.0 of this ordinance shall be prohibited. In addition, a caution is
provided here that: (Ref. Ord. 10-4-1068, 4/13/10)
1) New manufactured homes, replacement manufactured homes and certain recreational
vehicles are subject to the general provisions of this ordinance and specifically Subdivision
4.0, 5.0 and 9.0. (Ref. Ord. 06-05-1035, 5/9/06, 10-4-1068, 4/13/10).
2) Modifications, additions, structural alterations, normal repair and maintenance, or repair
after damage to existing nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses of structures
or land are regulated by the general provisions of this Ordinance and specifically
Subdivision 12.0; and (Ref. Ord. 10-4-1068, 4/13/10).
3) As-built elevations for elevated structures must be certified by ground surveys as stated in
Subdivision 10.0 of this Ordinance. (Ref. Ord. No. 846, 6/11/91)
Subd. 4. Permitted Uses Requiring Building Permit or Grading Permit Only.
a) Any use of land which does not involve a structure, nor an addition to the outside dimensions of
an existing structure, nor an obstruction to flood flows such as fill or storage of materials or
equipment.
b) Any use of land involving the construction of new structures, the placement or replacement of
manufactured homes, the addition to the outside dimensions of an existing structure or
obstructions such as fill or storage of materials or equipment, provided these activities are
located in the flood fringe portion of the flood plain. These uses shall be subject to the
development standards in Subdivision 5.0 of this ordinance and the flood plain evaluation criteria
in Subdivision 6.0 of this Ordinance for determining floodway and flood fringe boundaries. (Ref.
Ord. No. 846, 6/11/91)
§1303.235 ZONING CODE §1303.235

Subd. 5. Standards for all Flood Plain Permitted Uses.
a) Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap,
vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for
certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation - FEMA's
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for
multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the
initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be
requested. (Ref. Ord. No. 846, 6/11/91)
b) Storage of materials and equipment:
1) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive or
potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
2) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area
within the time available after a flood warning or if placed on fill to the Regulatory Flood
Protection Elevation.
c) No use shall be permitted which will adversely affect the capacity of the channels or floodways
of any tributary to the main stream, or of any drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or
system.
d) All structures, including accessory structures, additions to existing structures and manufactured
homes, shall be constructed on fill so that the lowest floor, including basement floor, is at or
above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation must be no lower than
one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and shall extend at such elevation at
least fifteen (15) feet beyond the limits of the structure constructed thereon. (Ref. Ord.
10-4-1068, 4/13/10)
e) Uses that do not have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet below
the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation to lands outside of the flood plain shall not be
permitted unless granted a variance by the Board of Adjustment. In granting a variance, the
Board shall specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the use and only after determining
that adequate flood warning time and local emergency response and recovery
procedures exist. (Ref. Ord. 846, 6/11/91, Ord. 06-05-1035, 5/9/06)
f) Commercial and Manufacturing Uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and
parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However,
a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be
granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if
the area would be inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in
feet) times the velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four (4) upon
occurrence of the regional flood. (Ref. Ord. 06-05-1035, 5/9/06)
g) Where public utilities are not provided: 1) On-site water supply systems must be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 2) New or replacement
§1303.235 ZONING CODE §1303.235
1303.235.4
on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood
waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters and they shall not be
subject to impairment or contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment system
designed in accordance with the State's current statewide standards for on-site sewage
treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with this Section. (Ref. Ord. 846,
6/11/91, Ord. 06-05-1035, 5/9/06)
h) All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include,
but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces. (Ref. Ord. 846, 6/11/91, Ord. 06-05-1035, 5/9/06)
Subd. 6. Flood Plain Evaluation
a) Upon receipt of an application for a Conditional Use/building permit, manufactured home park
development or subdivision approval within the flood plain district, the City Building Official or
Planner shall require the applicant to furnish sufficient site development plans and a hydrologic/
hydraulic analysis by a qualified engineer or hydrologist specifying the nature of the
development and whether the proposed use is located in the floodway or flood fringe and the
regulatory flood protection elevation for the site. Procedures consistent with Minnesota Rules
1983 Parts 6120.5600 (Technical Standards and Requirements for Floodplain Evaluation) and
6120.5700 (Minimum Floodplain Management Standards for Local Ordinances) shall be
followed during the technical evaluation and review of the development proposal.
b) The City Planner shall submit one copy of all information required by Subd. 6a) of this section to
the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' Area Hydrologist for review and comment at
least twenty (20) days prior to the granting of a conditional use/building permit or manufactured
home park development/subdivision approval by the community. The City may accept or reject
any review comments provided. The City Planner shall notify the Minnesota Department of
Natural Resources Area Hydrologist within ten (10) days after a conditional use/building permit
or manufactured home park development/subdivision approval is granted.
Subd. 7. Utilities, Railroads, Roads and Bridges in the Flood Plain District.
All utilities and transportation facilities, including railroad tracks, roads and bridges, shall be
constructed in accordance with state flood plain management standards contained in Minnesota
Rules 1983 Parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200.
Subd. 8. Subdivisions
a) No land shall be subdivided and no manufactured home park shall be developed or expanded
where the site is determined to be unsuitable by the City Council for reason of flooding or
inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. All lots within the flood plain
district shall be able to contain a building site outside the Floodway District at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation. The Planning Commission and City Council shall review
the subdivision/development proposal to insure that each lot or parcel contains sufficient area
outside of the floodway for fill placement for elevating structures, sewage systems and related
activities.
§1303.235 ZONING CODE §1303.235
1303.235.5

Flood Protection Elevation and the required elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled
on all required subdivision drawings and platting documents. (Ref. Ord. No. 846, 6/11/91)
d) Removal of Special Flood Hazard Area Designation: The Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation
for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi--
structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the
initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be
requested. (Ref. Ord. No. 846, 6/11/91)
Subd. 9 Travel Trailers and Recreational Vehicles (Ref. Ord. No. 846, 6/11/91, 1035,

05-1035, 5/9/06, 10-4-1068, 4/13/10)
Subd. 10. Administration.
a) Permits Required. A City of White Bear Lake Conditional Use Permit as per section 1301.050 and
building permits shall be secured prior to the construction of a principal structure, or an expansion of
a principal structure greater than twenty five (25) percent of the footprint of the original structure,
within the flood fringe. A City permit issued by the Building Official or Planner shall be secured prior
to the construction, addition, modification, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair),
or alteration of any building or structure or portion thereof; prior to the use or change of use of a
building, structure, or land; prior to the construction of a dam, fence, or on-site septic system; prior to
the change or extension of a nonconforming use; prior to the repair of a structure that has been
damaged by flood, fire, tornado, or any other source, and prior to the placement of fill, excavation of
materials or the storage of materials or equipment within the flood fringe. Per DNR Rule
#6120.6200, City staff shall submit a copy of the conditional use permit application to the DNR
sufficiently in advance so that it is received by the DNR at least 10 days prior to the public hearing,
and a copy of all decisions granting conditional use permits shall be forwarded by mail to the DNR
within 10 days of such action. (Ref. Ord. 10-4-1068, 4/13/10)
b) State and Federal Permits. Prior to granting a Conditional Use/Building Permit or processing an
application for a variance, the City Planner shall determine that the applicant has obtained all
necessary State and Federal permits.
§1303.235 ZONING CODE §1303.235
1303.235.7
c) Certification of Lowest Floor Elevations. The applicant shall be required to submit certification by a
registered professional engineer, registered architect, or registered land surveyor that the finished fill
and building elevations were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance. The
Building Official shall maintain a record of the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) for all
new structures and alterations or additions to existing structures in the flood plain district. (Ref. Ord.
No. 846, 6/11/91)
d) Notifications for Watercourse Alterations. The City shall notify, in riverine situations, adjacent
communities and the Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources prior to the community
authorizing any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. If the applicant has applied for a permit to
work in the beds of public waters pursuant to Minnesota Statute, Chapter 1036, this shall suffice as
adequate notice to the Commissioner of Natural Resources. A copy of said notification shall also be
submitted to the Chicago Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
e) Notification to FEMA When Physical Changes Increase or Decrease the 100-year Flood
Elevation. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six (6) months after the date such
supporting information becomes available, the Zoning Administrator shall notify the Chicago
Regional Office of FEMA of the changes by submitting a copy of said technical or scientific data.
(Ref. Ord. 06-05-1035, 5/9/06).
Subd. 11. Variances. (Ref. Ord. No. 846, 6/11/91; 1035, 5/9/06)
a) A variance means a modification of a specific permitted development standard required in an official
control including this ordinance to allow an alternative development standard not stated as
acceptable in the official control, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose of
alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in a
community's respective planning and zoning enabling legislation.
b) The Board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such relief or variance from the terms of this
Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest and only for those circumstances such as
hardship, practical difficulties or circumstances unique to the property under consideration, as
provided for in the respective enabling legislation for planning and zoning for cities or counties as
appropriate. In the granting of such variance, the Board of Adjustment shall clearly identify in writing
the specific conditions that existed consistent with the criteria specified in the respective enabling
legislation which justified the granting of the variance.
c) Variances from the provisions of this Ordinance may be authorized where the Board of Adjustment
has determined the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and the spirit and intent of this
ordinance. No variance shall allow in any district a use prohibited in that district or permit a lower
degree of flood protection then the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. Variances may be used to
modify permissible methods of flood protection. The following additional variance criteria of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied:
1) Variances shall not be issued by a community within any designated regulatory floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result;
2) Variances shall only be issued by a community upon a showing of good and sufficient cause or
a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant, and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances,
cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
§1303.235 ZONING CODE §1303.235
1303.235.8
3) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. (Ref. Ord. 06-05-1035, 5/9/06, 10-4-
1068, 4/13/10)
d) The Board shall submit by mail to the Commissioner of Natural Resources a copy of the application
for proposed Variance sufficiently in advance so that the Commissioner will receive at least ten days
notice of the hearing. A copy of all decisions granting a Variance shall be forwarded by mail to the
Commissioner of Natural Resources within ten (10) days of such action.
e) Appeals from any decision of the Board may be made, and as specified in this Community's Official
Controls and also Minnesota Statutes. (Ref. Ord. 06-05-1035, 5/9/06)
f) Flood Insurance Notice and Record Keeping. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant for
a variance that: 1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage and 2) Such construction below the 100-year or regional flood level increases
risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions.
A community shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance,
and report such variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to the Administrator of the
National Flood Insurance Program.
Subd. 12. Nonconforming Uses. (Ref. Ord. 06-05-1035, 5/9/06)
A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the passage or amendment
of this section but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this section may be continued as a
pre-existing nonconforming use subject to the following conditions. Historic structures, as defined by 44
Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1 shall be subject to the provisions of Subd. 12.a-e of this ordinance:
(Ref. Ord. 06-05-1035, 5/9/06, 10-4-1068, 4/13/10)
a) No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a way which increases its
nonconformity.
b) A structural alteration within the inside dimensions of a nonconforming use or structure is permissible
provided it utilizes flood resistant materials so it will not result in increasing the flood damage
potential of that use or structure. A structural addition to a structure must be elevated to the
regulatory flood protection elevation in accordance with Subd. 5.d of this ordinance. (Ref. Ord.
10-4-1068, 4/13/10)
c) The cost of all structural alterations or additions both inside and outside of a structure to any
nonconforming structure over the life of the structure shall not exceed 50 percent of the market value
of the structure unless the conditions of this Section are satisfied. The cost of all structural
alterations and additions constructed since the adoption of the Community's initial flood plain controls
must be calculated into today's current cost which will include all costs such as construction materials
and a reasonable cost placed on all manpower or labor. If the current cost of all previous and
proposed alterations and additions exceeds fifty (50) percent of the current market value of the
structure, then the structure must meet the standards of Subdivision 4.0 and Subdivision 5.0 of this
section for new structures. (Ref. Ord. No. 846, 6/11/91)
d) If any nonconforming use or structure is substantially damaged, as defined in Section 1301.030 of
this ordinance, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this section.
The applicable provisions for establishing new uses or new structures in Subdivisions 4.0, 5.0 or 7.0
will apply depending upon whether the use or structure is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe
respectively. The City Council may issue a Conditional Use Permit as per Section 1301.050 for
§1303.235 ZONING CODE §1303.235
1303.235.9
reconstruction if the use is located outside the floodway and, upon reconstruction, is adequately
elevated on fill in conforming with the provisions of this section. (Ref. Ord. 06-05-1035, 5/9/06,
10-4-1068, 4/13/10)
e) If a substantial improvement occurs, as defined in Section 1303.030 of this ordinance, from any
combination of a building addition to the outside dimension of the existing building or a rehabilitation,
reconstruction, alteration, or other improvement to the inside dimensions of an existing
nonconforming building, then the building addition (as required above) and the existing
nonconforming building must meet the requirements of section 4.0 or 5.0 of this ordinance for new
structures, depending upon whether the structures are in the Floodway, Flood Fringe, respectively.
(Ref. Ord. 06-05-1035, 5/9/06)
f) If any nonconforming use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, any future use of the building
premises shall conform to this ordinance. The Assessor shall notify the Zoning Administrator in
writing of instances of nonconforming uses that have been discontinued for a period of 12 months.
(Ref. Ord. 06-05-1035, 5/9/06)
Subd. 13. Amendments.
All amendments to this ordinance, including revisions to the Official Flood Plain Zoning District
Map, shall be submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of Natural Resources prior to adoption. The
flood plain designation on the Official Flood Plain Zoning District Map shall not be removed unless the area
is filled to an elevation at or above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation and is contiguous to lands
outside of the flood plain. Changes in the Official Zoning Map must meet the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's (FEMA) Technical Conditions and Criteria and must receive prior FEMA approval
before adoption. The Commissioner of Natural Resources must be given 10-days written notice of all
hearings to consider an amendment to this Ordinance and said notice shall include a draft of the ordinance
amendment or technical study under consideration. (Ref. Ord. No. 846, 6/11/91)
Subd. 14. Penalties and Violation. (Ref. Ord. No. 846, 6/11/91)
A violation of the provisions of this Ordinance or failure to comply with any of its requirements
(including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of Variance) shall
constitute a misdemeanor.
a) In responding to a suspected ordinance violation, the Zoning Administrator and Local Government
may utilize the full array of enforcement actions available to it including but not limited to prosecution
and fines, injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a request to the
National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance availability to the guilty party. The
community must act in good faith to enforce these official controls and to correct ordinance violations
to the extent possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
b) When an ordinance violation is either discovered by or brought to the attention of the Zoning
Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall immediately investigate the situation and document the
nature and extent of the violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible, this
information will be submitted to the appropriate Department of Natural Resources' and Federal
Emergency Management Agency Regional Office along with the Community's plan of action to
correct the violation to the degree possible.
c) The Zoning Administrator shall notify the suspected party of the requirements of this Ordinance and
all other Official Controls and the nature and extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If
the structure and/or use is under construction or development, the Zoning Administrator may order
the construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or approval is granted by
the Community. If the construction or development is already completed, then the Zoning
§1303.235 ZONING CODE §1303.235
1303.235.10
Administrator may either (1) issue an order identifying the corrective actions that must be made
within a specified time period to bring the use or structure into compliance with the official controls, or
(2) notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact permit/development approval within a
specified period of time not to exceed 30-days.
d) If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the Zoning Administrator within the
specified period of time, each additional day that lapses shall constitute an additional violation of this
Ordinance and shall be prosecuted accordingly. The Zoning Administrator shall also upon the lapse
of the specified response period notify the landowner to restore the land to the condition which
existed prior to the violation of this Ordinance. (Ref. Ord. 745, 8/11/87; 846, 6/11/91)

1402.030.1
§1402.040 SUBDIVlSION REGULATIONS §1402.040
§1402.040. PREMATURE SUBDIVISIONS. Any preliminary plat of a proposed subdivision deemed premature
for development shall be denied by the City Council of the City of White Bear Lake.
Subd. 1. Condition Establishing Premature Subdivisions. A subdivision may be deemed
premature should any of the conditions set forth in the provisions which follow exist:
a) Lack of Adequate Drainage. A condition of inadequate drainage shall be deemed to exist if:
1) Surface or subsurface water retention and runoff is such that it constitutes a danger to
the structural security of the proposed structures.
2) The proposed subdivision will cause pollution of water sources or damage from erosion
and siltation on downhill or downstream land.
3) The proposed site grading and development will cause harmful and irreparable damage
from erosion and siltation on downhill or downstream land.
4) Factors to be considered in making these determinations may include: Average rainfall
for the area; the relation of the land to flood plains; the nature of soils and subsoils and
their ability to adequately support surface water runoff and waste disposal systems; the
slope of the land and its effect on effluent; and the presence of streams as related to effluent
disposal.
b) Lack of Adequate Water Supply. A proposed subdivision shall be deemed to lack an adequate
water supply if the proposed subdivision does not have adequate sources of water to serve the
proposed subdivision if developed to its maximum permissible density without causing an
unreasonable depreciation of existing water supplies for surrounding areas.
c) Lack of Adequate Roads or Highways to Serve the Subdivision. A proposed subdivision shall be
deemed to lack adequate roads or highways to serve the subdivision when:
1) Roads which serve the proposed subdivision are of such a width, grade, stability, vertical
and horizontal alignment, site distance and surface condition that an increase in traffic
volume generated by the proposed subdivision would create a hazard to public safety and
general welfare, or seriously aggravate an already hazardous condition, and when, with
due regard to the advice of Ramsey or Washington County and/or the Minnesota
Department of Transportation, said roads are inadequate for the intended use.
2) The traffic volume generated by the proposed subdivision would create unreasonable
highway congestion or unsafe conditions on highways existing at the time of the application
or proposed for completion within the next two (2) years.
d) Lack of Adequate Waste Disposal Systems. A proposed subdivision shall be deemed to lack
adequate waste disposal systems if in subdivisions for which sewer lines are proposed, there is
inadequate sewer capacity in the present system to support the subdivision if developed to its
maximum permissible density after reasonable sewer capacity is reserved for schools, planned
public facilities and commercial and industrial development projected for the next five (5) years;
or if in subdivisions where sewer lines are neither available nor proposed, there is inadequate on-
1402.040.1
§1402.040 SUBDIVlSION REGULATIONS §1402.040
site sewer capacity potential to support the subdivision if developed to the maximum permissible
density indicated in the White Bear Lake Comprehensive Plan, as may be amended.
e) Inconsistency with Comprehensive Plan. The proposed subdivision is inconsistent with the
purposes, objectives, and recommendations of the duly adopted Comprehensive Plan of White
Bear Lake as may be amended.
f) Providing Public Improvements. If public improvements, such as recreational facilities, or other
public facilities, reasonably necessitated by the subdivision, which must be provided at public
expense, cannot be reasonably provided for within the next two (2) fiscal years.
g) MEQC Policies. The proposed subdivision is inconsistent with the policies of MEQC 25, as may be
amended, and could adversely impact critical environmental areas or potentially disrupt or
destroy historic areas which are designated or officially recognized by the City Council in violation
of federal and State historical preservation laws.
Subd. 2. Burden of Establishing. The burden shall be upon the applicant to show that the
proposed subdivision is not premature.

§1404.010. BLOCKS.
Subd. 1. Block Length. In general, intersecting streets, determining block lengths, shall be
provided at such intervals so as to serve cross traffic adequately and to meet existing streets. Where no
existing plats control, the blocks in residential subdivisions should not exceed eighteen hundred (1,800)
feet nor be less than four hundred (400) feet in length, except where topography or other conditions
justify a departure from this maximum. In blocks longer than twelve hundred (1,200) feet, pedestrian
ways and/or easements through the block may be required near the center of the block.
Subd. 2. Block Width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two (2)
tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width as
to be considered most suitable for their respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking
and deliveries.
1404.010.1
§1404.020 SUBDIVlSION REGULATIONS §1404.020

established by the White Bear Lake Zoning Code in effect at the time of adoption of the final plat.
Subd. 2. Corner Lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have additional width to permit
appropriate building setback from both streets as required in the Zoning Code.
Subd. 3. Side Lot Lines. Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles to street
lines or radial to curved street lines.
Subd. 4. Frontage. Every lot must have the minimum frontage on a City approved street
other than an alley, as specified in the lot width requirements of the White Bear Lake Zoning Code. (Ref.
Ord.
10-1-1065, 1/12/10)
Subd. 5. Setback Lines. Setback or building lines shall be shown on all lots intended for
residential use and shall not be less than the setback required by the White Bear Lake Zoning Code, as
may be amended.

shall have additional depth and width, as required under the provisions of the White Bear Lake Zoning
Code.
Subd. 7. Features. In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be shown for all natural
features, such as tree growth, water courses, historic spots or similar conditions which, if preserved, will
add attractiveness and stability to the proposed development.
Subd. 8. Lot Remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after subdividing
of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels.
Subd. 9. Political Boundaries. No singular plat shall extend over a political boundary or
school district line without document notification to affected units of government.
Subd. 10. Frontage on Two Streets. Double-frontage, or lots with frontage on two (2)
parallel streets, shall not be permitted except: Where lots back on arterial streets or highways, or where
topographic or other conditions render subdividing otherwise unreasonable. Such double-frontage lots
shall have an additional depth of at least twenty (20) feet in order to allow space for screen planting
along the back lot line.
Subd. 11. Turn Around Access. Where proposed residential lots abut a collector or arterial
street, they should be platted in such a manner as to encourage turn around access and egress on each
lot.

§1404.030. STREETS AND ALLEYS.
Subd. 1. Streets, Continuous. Except for cul-de-sacs, streets shall connect with streets
already dedicated in adjoining or adjacent subdivisions, or provide for future connections to adjoining
unsubdivided tracts, or shall be a reasonable projection of streets in the nearest subdivided tracts. The
arrangement of thoroughfares and collector streets shall be considered in their relation to the reasonable
circulation of traffic, to topographic conditions, to turn-off of storm water, to public convenience and
safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the area to be served.
Subd. 2. Local Streets and Dead-End Streets. Local streets should be so planned as to
discourage their use by non-local traffic. Dead-end streets are prohibited, but cul-desacs shall be permitted
where topography or other physical conditions justify their use. Cul-de-sacs shall not be longer
than five hundred (500) feet, including a terminal turnaround which shall be provided at the closed end,
with a right-of-way radius of not less than sixty (60) feet.
Subd. 3. Street Plans for Future Subdivisions. Where the plat to be submitted includes only
part of the tract owned or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of a proposed
future street system for the unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider.

future extension in conjunction with future subdivision, a temporary turn around facility shall be provided
at the closed end.
Subd. 5. Provisions for Resubdivision of Large Lots and Parcels. When a tract is subdivided
into larger than normal building lots or parcels, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the
logical location and openings of future streets and appropriate resubdivision, with provision for adequate
utility connections for such resubdivision.
Subd. 6. Street Intersections. Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out so as to
intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, except where topography or other conditions justify
variations. Under normal conditions, the minimum angle of intersection of streets shall be eighty (80)
degrees. Street intersection jogs with an offset of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall be
avoided.
Subd. 7. Subdivisions Abutting Major Rights-of-Way. Wherever the proposed subdivision
contains or is adjacent to the right-of-way of a U.S. or State Highway or thoroughfare, provision may be
made for a marginal access street approximately parallel and adjacent to the boundary of such right-ofway,
provided that due consideration is given to proper circulation design, or for a street at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of land between such street and right-of-way. Such distance shall be
determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for approach connections to future
grade separations, or for lot depths.
Subd. 8. Sidewalks. In those cases where the City Council deems appropriate and
necessary, sidewalks of not less than five (5) feet in width shall be provided. Where a proposed plat abuts
or includes an arterial street, sidewalks, of not less than five (5) feet in width on both sides of the paved
surface shall be provided. Where the proposed plats abut or includes a collector street, sidewalks of not
less than five (5) feet in width, shall be required on one side of the street. In all cases where sidewalks
are provided, provisions shall be made for handicapped access.

§1407.050 SUBDIVlSION REGULATIONS §1407.050
§1407.050 CORRECTIVE SUBDIVISION.
In any case where the survey or description of a division of one parcel into two parcels or lots has been
found to be inadequate to describe the actual boundaries, a corrective survey and/or subdivision may be
necessary. This type of subdivision creates no new lots or streets and may be approved administratively.
The subdivision shall not create a lot(s) which is in violation of this regulation or the Zoning Code. A
Certificate of Survey shall be completed by a registered land surveyor describing existing and proposed
property boundaries on both parcels or lots and a letter signed by both parties agreeing to the new
subdivision. The Certificate of Survey shall be presented to the Zoning Administrator, who shall approve
or deny the correction within ninety (90) days of receipt of said survey or corrected legal description.
After approval by the City Engineer, the survey shall be recorded by the applicant with the Ramsey County
Land Records Office with both properties within 90 days of said approval. (Ref. Ord No. 719, 6/10/86,

§1408. VARIANCES, PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS, STANDARDS
§1408.010. FINDINGS. The Planning Commission or Variance Board may recommend a variance from the
minimum standards of this Code (not procedural provisions) when, in its opinion, undue hardship may
result from strict compliance. Whenever, in the rest of this section, Planning Commission or the
Commission is used, it shall also mean Variance Board or The Board. Whether the variance shall be
forwarded to the Planning Commission or the Variance Board shall be the decision of the Zoning
Administrator. In recommending any variance, the Commission shall prescribe any conditions that it
deems necessary to or desirable for the public interest. In making its recommendations, the Planning
Commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of land and the existing use of land in
the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable effect
of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. A variance shall only be recommended
when the Planning Commission finds: (Ref. 10-1-1065, 1/12/10)
Subd. 1. That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting said property such
that the strict application of the provisions of this Code would deprive the applicant of the reasonable
use of the land.
Subd. 2. That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health,
safety and welfare or injurious to other property in the territory in which the property is situated.
Subd. 3. That the variance is to correct inequities resulting from an extreme physical
hardship such as topography, etc. After considerations of the Planning commission recommendations, the
City Council may grant variances, subject to subdivisions 1, 2 and 3 immediately above.
