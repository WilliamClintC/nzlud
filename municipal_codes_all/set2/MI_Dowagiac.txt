PREFACE
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent
ordinances of the City of Dowagiac, Michigan.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1972 Code, as
supplemented through June 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by
the city counciL The source of each section is included in the history note
appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note
indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the
adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back
of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1972 Code, as supplemented,
and any subsequent ordinance included herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical
order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to
facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and
which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state
law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the
back of this Code.
Chapter and Section Numbering System
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same
system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number
consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to
the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the
section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered
1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is
identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted
in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come
between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be
numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same
way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end
of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be
assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using
one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.
Page Numbering System
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters
to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion
of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of
the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix
to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter
of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which
vii
may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding
prefixes:

The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item
has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay
phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally
used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross
references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user
to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and
supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication
will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly
edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the
manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the
holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the
responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the
attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all
such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing
them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical
reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the direct supervision of Allen Z. Paul, Supervising
Editor, and Robert McNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation,
Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of
the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout
the project.
The publisher is most grateful to James E. Snow, City Clerk, for his
cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.
It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code
of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to
all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration
of the city's affairs.

Checklist of Up-to-Date Pages
(This checklist will be updated with the
printing of each Supplement)
From our experience in publishing Looseleaf Supplements on a page-for-page
substitution basis, it has become evident that through usage and supplementation
many pages can be inserted and removed in error.
The following listing is included in this Code as a ready guide for the user to
determine whether the Code volume properly reflects the latest printing of each
page.
In the first column all page numbers are listed in sequence. The second column
reflects the latest printing of the pages as they should appear in an up-to-date
volume. The letters "OC" indicate the pages have not been reprinted in the
Supplement Service and appear as published for the original Code. When a page has
been reprinted or printed in the Supplement Service, this column reflects the
identification number or Supplement Number printed on the bottom of the page.
In addition to assisting existing holders of the Code, this list may be used in
compiling an up-to-date copy from the original Code and subsequent Supplements.

ARTICLE VII. BOARDING UP OF
BUILDINGS
Sec. 18-140. Statement of purpose.
The city recognizes that, due to such factors as
fire, storm, vandalism, deterioration, neglect, etc.,
that certain buildings may, of necessity, be from
time to time boarded up so as to prevent unauthorized
access while vacant. The city further
recognizes that allowing such buildings to remain
boarded up bey ond the time reasonably required
to effectuate necessary repairs and improvements
so as to render them habitable can and does
adversely impact both the city and neighboring
property-owners by continuing an unsightly condition
and by inviting further acts of vandalism
due to the obviously vacant state of such buildings.
Accordingly, it is the purpose of this article
to provide reasonable time frames during which
buildings may remain boarded.
COrd. No. 98- 3, 1, 10-16-98)
Sec. 18-141. Boarding up of buildings.
In order to protect against unauthorized access
of vacant buildings, and to provide for restoration
of such buildings so that the same may be rendered
suitable for occupancy, the city adopts the
following provisions which shall be in addition to
the requirements imposed by the property maintenance
code codified in article iv of this part, and
not in derogation thereof:
(1) Casual entry. No person shall permit any
vacant building to remain open to casual
entry in the city.
Supp. No.9 CD18:6.1
§ 18-141
BUILDINGS AND BUILDING REGULATIONS § 18-145
(2) Time limit. No person shall permit any
building to be boarded up in the city for a
period of longer than three months.
(3) Boarding up of openings. Any boarding up
of openings in a building shall be done
with plywood of minimum thickness of
one-half-inch, free of holes. It shall fully
cover each opening and be securely fastened.
All exposed edges and surfaces
shall be painted.
(4) Extension. The period of three months
may be extended by the building official,
but only in the event that the owner or
person responsible for the premises shall
obtain all necessary permits either to repair
or demolish such premises within
such three month period. No such extension
shall be granted for a period longer
than three additional months.
(5) Existing buildings. This section shall apply
to existing boarded up or open buildings
as well as those which may be boarded
up or open in the future.
(Ord. No. 98-3, 1, 10-16-98)
Sec. 18-141.1. Notice.
If any person shall permit a building to be
boarded up for longer than the three month
period above specified, or any extension thereof as
granted by the building official, then the building
official shall notify the owner of said property, as
shown by the most recent tax rolls of the City of
Dowagiac, that said building has remained boarded
up in excess of the time permitted by this Code.
Such notice shall require the owner to correct this
condition within ten days of the date of such
notice. Failure by the owner to comply with such
notice within the time allowed shall constitute a

owner to the civil and criminal penalties herein
set forth.
(Ord. No. 98-3, 1, 10-16-98)
Sec. 18-142. Nuisance per see
In the event that any building shall remain
boarded up in violation of this article, and in the
event that the owner shall fail to correct such
condition within ten days following notice as
hereinabove required, then said structure shall
constitute a nuisance per se. In such event, the
city council may, after notice to the owner and
public hearing thereon, condemn such building by
giving notice to the owner of the land upon which
such building is located, specifying in what respects
the building is a public nuisance and
requiring the owner to correct such condition(s),
either by repair or demolition, within such reasonable
time, not exceeding 60 days, as may be
necessary to do or have done the work required by
such notice. The council may extend such period
for additional periods not exceeding 30 days each
for good cause shown. The notice shall also specify
the time within which such work shall be commenced
and necessary permits obtained.
(Ord. No. 98-3, 1, 10-16-98)
Sec. 18-143. Abatement.
If, at the expiration of any time limit in the
notice, the owner has not complied with the
requirements of the notice, the city may carry out
the requirements of the notice. The cost of such
abatement shall be charged against the premises
and the owner thereof in accordance with the
provisions of chapter 66 of this Code.
(Ord. No. 98-3, 1, 10-16-98)
Sec. 18-144. Historical preservation policy.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, it
shall continue to be the policy of the city that
buildings and structures of historical significance
be preserved and protected wherever reasonably
possible. To that end, it shall be the policy of the
city to protect such structures against demolition
even though such structure(s) might be in violation
of this article. All potential remedial measures
short of demolition, and possible sources of
funding for such remedial measures, shall be
explored before demolition will be considered,
including action by the city to prevent demolition
of structures of historical significance and/or acquisition
of such structures under the city's power
of eminent domain.
(Ord. No. 98-3, 1, 10-16-98)

specified shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable

fine and imprisonment. Each day that a violation
continues shall be deemed a separate offense.
(Ord. No. 98-3, 1, 10-16-98)

§ 18-155 DOWAGIAC CODE
if the C.R.C. determines that an extension would
be in the best interests of the city. The city
recognizes that absolute enforcement of any property
maintenance code is difficult and reasonable
enforcement is necessary. Rather than placing a
reasonable enforcement of exterior painting in
the hands of one person, the city has opted to
place this important responsibility and determination
with the C.R.C.
(e) A quorum of at least three members of the
C.R.C. shall be necessary to determine that a
paint complaint is a violation of section 18-155(a).
If the C.R.C. rules that a violation exists, the code
official shall serve notice of the violation directing
the owner to comply with section 18-155(a) within
60 days. If the C.R.C. rules that a violation does

fees so that it shall not be discriminatory, unreasonable,
or unfair as to such commerce. Such

for the applicant, an amount that is fair, reasonable
and nondiscriminatory, or, if the fee has

that the fee assessed shall be uniform with
that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long
as the amount assessed does not exceed the fee as
prescribed by article III of this chapter. Should
the city manager determine the gross sales measure
of the fee to be the fair basis, he may require
the applicant to submit, either at the time of
termination of applicant's business in the city or
at the end of each three-month period, a sworn
statement of the gross sales and pay the amount
of fee therefor, provided that no additional fee

shall determine that such suspension is reasonably
necessary to protect the general public safety
and welfare. Any permit holder aggrieved by the
suspension or proposed revocation of his permit

ment payments.
All special assessments contained in any special
assessment roll, including any part to be paid
in installments, shall, from the date of confirmation
of such roll, constitute a lien upon the respective
lots or parcels of land assessed and, until
paid, shall be a charge against the respective
owners of the several lots and parcels of land and
a debt to the city from the persons to whom they
are assessed. Such lien shall be of the same
character and effect as the lien created by the
Charter for city taxes and shall include accrued
interest and fees. No judgment or decree nor act
of the council vacating a special assessment shall
destroy or impair the lien of the city upon the
premises assessed for such amount of the assessment
as may be equitably charged against the
same or as, by a regular mode of proceedings,
might be lawfully assessed thereon. All special
assessments shall become due upon confirmation
of the special assessment roll or in annual installments,
not to exceed 20 in number, as the council
may determine at the time of confirmation, and, if
in annual installments, the council may determine
the first installment to be due upon confirmation
or upon any other date the council may
prescribe, and the subsequent installments annually
thereafter. Deferred installments shall bear
interest at such rate as the council may prescribe.

the city clerk to transmit the assessment roll to
the city treasurer for collection. The city treasurer
shall mail statements of the several assessments
to the respective owners of the several lots and
parcels of land assessed, as indicated by the
records of the city assessor, stating the amount of
the assessment and the manner in which it may
be paid; provided, however, that failure to mail
any such statement shall not invalidate the assessment
or entitle the owner to an extension of
time within which to pay the assessment. The
whole or any part of such assessment may be paid
in full at any time after the date of confirmation of
the special assessment roll until such time as the
council shall prescribe, without interest or penalty.
Each special assessment shall be collected by
the city treasurer with the same rights and remedies
as provided in the Charter for the collection
of taxes, except as otherwise provided in this
section. All collection fees shall belong to the city
and be collectible in the same manner as the
collection fee for city taxes.
(Code 1972, § 1.222)
Sec. 66-13. Fees and interest.
After the expiration of the period provided for
in section 66-12 for payment without interest or
fees, any installment may be discharged by paying
the face amount thereof together with fees
and interest thereon from the date of confirmation
to the date of payment.
(Code 1972, § 1.223)
Sec. 66-14. Additional assessments.
Should the assessments on any special assessment
roll, including the amount assessed to the
city at large, prove insufficient for any reason to
pay the cost of the improvement for which they
were made, then the council may make additional
pro rata assessments to supply the deficiency
against the city and the several lots and parcels of
land in the same ratio as the original assessments,
but the total amount assessed against any
lot or parcel of land shall not exceed the value of
the benefits received from the improvement.
(Code 1972, § 1.224)
CD66:5
§ 66-15 DOWAGIAC CODE
Sec. 66-15. Refunds.
Should the special assessment or the proceeds
of sale of any special assessment bonds prove
larger than necessary to meet the costs of the
improvement or to meet the principal and interest
requirements of any special assessment bonds
and expenses incidental thereto, the excess shall
be placed in the city treasury. If more than five
percent, the excess shall be returned pro rata
according to assessments, except as otherwise
specifically provided. No refunds may be made
which contravene the provisions of any evidence
of indebtedness secured in whole or in part by
such special assessments.
(Code 1972, § 1.225)
Sec. 66-16. Division of lots after confirmation
of assessment.
Should any lots or lands be divided after a
special assessment thereon has been confinned
and divided into installments, the city assessor
shall apportion the uncollected amounts upon the
several lots and lands so divided, and shall enter
the several amounts as amendments upon the
special assessment roll. The city treasurer shall,
within ten days after such apportionment, send
notice of such action to the persons concerned, at
their last known address, by first class mail. Such
apportionment shall be final and conclusive on all
parties, unless protest in writing is received by
the city treasurer within 20 days of the mailing of
such notice.
(Code 1972, § 1.226)
Sec. 66-17. Assessment defects.
Whenever the council deems any special assessment
invalid or defective, or whenever a court
adjudges an assessment to be illegal in whole or
in part, the council may cause a new assessment
to be levied for the same purpose, whether or not
the improvement or any part of such improvement
has been completed, or any part of the
special assessment collected. All proceedings on
such reassessment and for the collection of the
reassessment shall be conducted in the same
manner as provided for the original assessment.
If any portion of the original special assessment is
collected and not refunded, it shall be applied
upon the reassessment, and the reassessment
shall, to that extent, be deemed satisfied. If more
than the amount reassessed is collected, the balance
shall be refunded to the person making such
payment. If in any action it shall appear that, by
reason of any irregularities or informalities the
assessment has not been properly made against
the person assessed or upon such lot or premises
sought to be charged, the court may nevertheless,
on satisfactory proof charge against the person
assessed or the lot or premises in question, render
judgment for the amount properly chargeable
against such person or upon such lot or premises.
(Code 1972, § 1.227)
Sec. 66-18. Additional procedure.
In any case where the provisions of this chapter
may prove to be insufficient to carry into full effect
the making of any improvement or the special
assessment for such improvement, the city council
shall provide any additional steps or procedure
required to effect the improvement by special
assessment in the resolution declaring the determination
of the city council to make such improvement
in the first instance.
(Code 1972, § 1.228)
Sec. 66-19. Single lot assessment??ner­
ally.
(a) When any expense shall be incurred by the
city upon or in respect to any separate or single
lot, parcel of land or premises, which, by the
provisions of this Code, the council is authorized
to charge and collect as a single lot special assessment
against the same, and which is not of that
class of special assessments required to be made
pro rata upon several lots or parcels of land in a
special assessment district, an account of the
labor or services for which such expense was
incurred, verified by the officer or person performing
the labor or services, or causing the same to be
done, shall be reported to the city council in a
manner it prescribes. The accounting reported to
the council shall include a description of the lot or
premises on or in respect to which the expense
was incurred, the name of the owner or person
chargeable therewith, and the cost of labor or
services performed. The provisions of the preceding
sections of this chapter with reference to pro
CD66:6
SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS
rata special assessments generally and the proceedings
necessary to be had before making the
improvement shall not apply to single lot assessments
contemplated in this section.
(b) The city council, after review of the single
lots assessment account, shall determine what
amount or part of every such reported expense
shall be charged, and the premises upon which
the same shall be charged, and the premises upon
which the same shall be levied as a single lot
special assessment. As often as the city council
may deem it expedient, it shall require all of the
several amounts so reported and determined and
the several lots or premises chargeable therewith
respectively to be reported by the city clerk to the
city assessor, who shall spread such amounts
against the real property chargeable therewith on
the next tax roll for the collection of general city
taxes.
(Code 1972, § 1.229)
Sec. 66-20. Same-Use for recovery of cost
of abating public nuisances and
hazards.
When any lot, building or structure, because of
the accumulation of refuse or debris, the uncontrolled
growing of weeds, age or dilapidation, or
because of any other condition or happening becomes
a public hazard or nuisance which is detrimental
to the health or safety of the inhabitants
of the city or of those residing or habitually going
near such lot, building or structure, the council
may order such hazard or nuisance abated, and
the cost of such abatement assessed against the
lot, premises or description of real property upon
which such hazard or nuisance was located as a
single lot assessment.

Sec. 70-86. Sidewalk specifications and requirements.
(a) New sidewalk construction. The construction

standards and specifications set forth in
subsection (d) of this section, as currently existing
or hereafter amended, shall be required along the
entire paved public street frontage of any lot or
property wherein a new principal building is
erected in the city. This section shall apply to all
zoning districts in the city, except the A residence
district and the IP district. A property owner may,
by means of written correspondence to the director,
request that the city arrange for, contract out,
or complete the construction of new sidewalks as
required in this section. The option to honor such
request shall be at the sole discretion of the city,
as represented by its city manager, or his designee,
and shall require the requesting property
owner to make payment arrangements satisfactory
to the city prior to the commencement of any
sidewalk construction activities under this article.
One hundred percent of all costs associated
with new sidewalk construction, as required under
this article, whether completed by the property
owner, city, or agents or employees of either
shall be paid by and exist as a legal obligation of
the property owner. If existing infrastructure,
natural impediments, or topography would make
construction of a sidewalk impractical, and the
city concurs in such a determination, the owner
shall be required to provide the sidewalk in an
alternative onsite route which adequately provides
a proper connection to the existing city
sidewalk system. If a connection to the then
existing city system does not exist within 500
linear feet of the nearest lot line of the property in
question, the city shall waive this requirement in
conformance with subsection (b) of this section.
(b) Waiver of sidewalk requirement. The city
may waive the requirement to construct new
sidewalks when the presence of natural and physical
impediments in combination with a lack of
private off-site connection to the existing sidewalk
system join to cause such construction to be
impractical. Authority to grant such waivers shall
be vested in the city council and may be granted
by resolution following a formal written request,
filed by the property owner, with the office of the
city clerk.
(c) Replacement of existing sidewalk. Replacement
of an existing sidewalk shall take place as
follows:
(1) Determination and notice. Upon receipt of a
report by the city manager, indicating a
sidewalk is unsafe for use and requires
repair or reconstruction for the public safety
and welfare, the city council, by resolution,
may determine to reconstruct or repair the
sidewalk and direct the city manager to
proceed with the required work, using either
city employees or contracted labor.
Following approval, by resolution, of the
determination, the city clerk shall cause
notice to be provided to the owner of property
possessed of frontage along an area
where the sidewalk is to be repaired or
reconstructed. The notice is to be by first
class mail addressed to the last known
address of the owner as shown by the latest
confirmed tax assessment roll, or if the
owner or his address is unknown, by delivering
the notice and leaving the notice with
a person of suitable age and discretion at
the premises. If such person is not found,
such notice shall be posted in a conspicuous
place on the premises. The notice shall list
and detail the estimated costs to be incurred
for repair or reconstruction which
shall be charged against the abutting front-
CD70:7
§ 70-86 DOWAGIAC CODE
age property and owner of the property in
accordance with the provisions of section
66-19 and subsection (c)(2) of this section,
and shall list any and all city-owned or
-controlled trees to be removed as part of
the work. The notice shall be mailed or
delivered not less than 30 day s in advance
of the date the repair or reconstruction
work is to commence.
(2) Costs. Costs shall be based on the following:
a. The costs incurred for the city councilauthorized
repair or reconstruction of
unsafe or hazardous sidewalks, excluding
those traversing private driveways,
in the city, in compliance with
the provisions set forth in this section,
shall be based as follows:
1. No less than 25 percent of the cost
of repair or reconstruction, when
performed or contracted by the
city, shall be charged against the
property abutting such sidewalk
and the owner of the property in
accordance with the provisions of
section 66-19.
2. The remaining costs of the repairs,
which shall not exceed 75
percent of the total, shall be provided
by the city, the state, the
United States, or some combination
thereof, as the then existing
funding opportunities may allow,
and as finally administered by the
city.
3. If the unsafe or hazardous condition
of the sidewalk to be repaired
is a direct causal result of the
growth or prominent presence of
tree roots extending from cityowned
trees or trees growing in
city-owned or controlled rights-ofway,
as determined by the city
engineer; and if, at the determination
of the same city engineer, it is
necessary to remove the offending
tree or tree roots in order to facili
tate the repair and reconstruction
CD70:8
and ensure the longterm integrity
thereof, no portion of the cost of
removing the tree or tree roots
shall be charged against the prop­
erty abutting or the owner of the
property.
4. Property owners seeking to maintain
the health and vitality of cityowned
or controlled offending trees,
which could continue to damage
the contiguous section of any reconstructed
sidewalk, may request,
by formal written correspondence
to the director, that the city not
remove the offending trees in question
prior to the repair or reconstruction
of unsafe contiguous sidewalk
sections. In this event, the
property owner shall be responsible
for, and his property charged
against, 100 percent of the total
costs incurred to repair or reconstruct
the unsafe sidewalk. This
option shall not be available for
trees which, because of significant
levels of rot, infestation, disease,
lack of living matter, or impending
threat to safety or property, shall
be determined by the city forester
to constitute a nonviable tree.
b. The costs incurred for the city councilauthorized
repair or reconstruction of
unsafe or hazardous sidewalks which
traverse private driveways in the city,
in compliance with the provisions set
forth in this section, shall be based as
follows: Fifty percent of the total shall
be provided by the city, state or United
States, or some combination thereof,
as the then existing funding opportunities
may allow, and as finally administered
by the city ; while the remaining
50 percent of the total shall be
charged against the property abutting
such sidewalk and the owner thereof
in accordance with the provisions of
section 66-19.
c. The costs incurred for the city councilauthorized
repair or reconstruction of
STREETS, SIDEWALKS AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES § 70-86
sidewalks in the city, other than those
deemed unsafe or hazardous, in compliance
with the provisions set forth in
this section, shall be based as follows:
100 percent of the total shall be provided
by the city, state, or United States,
or some combination thereof, as the
then existing funding opportunities may
allow, and as finally administered by
the city, unless all or some portion
thereof is defray ed according to the
provisions of chapter 66 of this Code.
d. Property owners who receive notice of
required repairs or reconstruction to
abutting sidewalks deemed unsafe or
hazardous, may choose to make the
necessary repairs or accomplish the
required reconstruction through their
own efforts or that of contracted agents
if the work fully complies with the
requirements and specifications as contained
in the city engineering design
specifications and as set forth in this
section. Further, all costs of repairs or
reconstruction shall be the sole responsibility
of the property owner under
this option, and all work must be completed
to the satisfaction of the director
within the 30-day notice period set
forth in subsection (c)(1) of this section.
This right of election to make or
contract for necessary repairs or replacement
shall not apply to any situation
in which the city manager, or his
designee shall determine that immediate
repair or replacement by the city is
required for public safety. In any other
case, the city may require a property
owner electing to perform or have performed
such repairs to post notice to
the public of any safety hazards and/or
to prevent access to unsafe sidewalk
areas pending repair or reconstruction
as the city manager, or his designee,
shall determine.
(3) Specific criteria for sidewalk replacement.
Sidewalks shall be deemed hazardous or
unsafe when one or more of the following
conditions, as determined by survey inspection
of the city engineer, are present:
a. Edge misalignment. The edge of one
flag is higher or lower than the edge of
the adjacent flag for part of the full
width of the sidewalk. An edge misalignment
of one inch or more at any
point shall constitute a hazardous or
unsafe walk.
b. Spalling, rough surfaces, or large holes.
Spalled or rough surfaces marked with
potholes three-quarters of an inch and
deeper, cover ten percent or more of
the surface area. The presence of large
holes, asphalt caps or overlays, or missing
sections, is discovered.
c. Poor drainage. The presence of standing
water over areas or sections of the
sidewalk for long periods is discovered.
d. Cracks. Cracked flags, if there is onequarter
inch or more of separation, or
the cracked area covers more than ten
percent of the flag. Also, separation of
one inch or more between flags is determined.
e. Slope. There is a longitudinal slope
greater than one inch per linear foot of
sidewalk. A transverse slope greater
than three-quarters of an inch per linear
foot exists across the width of the
sidewalk.
(4) General criteria. The city shall maintain
the discretionary authority to determine
the necessity of sidewalk replacement
whether deemed hazardous or unsafe or
not. However, those sidewalks or sections
of sidewalks so designated shall be subject
to the costs provisions established in subsection
(c)(2) of this section. The city shall
attempt to replace or reconstruct unsafe or
hazardous sidewalks on a prioritized basis,
from highest degree of hazard to least, as
funding allows.
(d) Construction standards and specifications.
Construction standards and specifications shall
be as follows:
(1) Sidewalks shall be constructed of poured
concrete, five feet wide, four inches thick,
CD70:9
§ 70-86 DOWAGIAC CODE
over no less than two inches of compacted
sand containing a minimum of 500 pounds
of air entrained, Portland cement per cubic
yard. Sidewalks traversing driveways shall
be poured to a depth of six inches thick.
Sidewalks may be constructed of alternate
materials and/or exceed the dimensions or
requirements stated in this section when
approved by the city council as part of
downtown or other public improvement,
beautification, or restoration projects.
(2) All city sidewalks shall be constructed or
replaced in accordance with the specifications
established, and as from time to time
amended, by the city of engineering design
specifications and in compliance with any
further requirements or details as estab­
lished by the city engineer.
(Ord. No. 93-7, § 1(4.73),7-19-93)
Sec. 70-87. Removal of snow and ice.
(a) Clearance requirements. The occupant of
every lot or property abutting or adjoining any
sidewalk within the city, or the owner of such lot
or property, if not occupied, shall clear all ice and
snow from sidewalks adjoining or abutting such
lot or property within the time required in this
section, unless the city, by resolution of its city
council, shall assume such duties. The city may,
by resolution, from time to time update or amend
its policy of sidewalk clearance to include any or
all sidewalks, or portions of sidewalks, or to
exclude such sidewalks based on the then existing
financial conditions and public safety requirements
facing the city. When any snow shall fall or
drift upon any sidewalk, the owner or occupant of
the lot or property adjacent to the sidewalk shall
remove such snow as shall have fallen or accumulated
during the night time by 7:00 p. m. Snow
falling or drifting during day light hours shall be
removed before 7:00 p.m. the following day. When
any ice shall form on any sidewalk, the owner or
occupant of the lot or property adjoining or abutting
shall, if practical, immediately remove the
ice. When immediate removal is impractical, the
owner or occupant shall immediately cause sand
or salt to be spread upon the ice in such a manner
and in such quantity as to prevent the sidewalk
from becoming slippery and dangerous to pedestrians
and shall remove the ice as soon thereafter
as shall be practical.
(b) Failure to clear. If, in the absence of a
formally adopted city policy to provide such services,
any occupant or owner shall neglect or fail
to clear ice and snow from the sidewalk adjoining
or abutting his lot or property within the time
limit required in this section, or shall otherwise
permit ice and snow to accumulate on sueh sidewalk,
he shall be guilty of a violation of this
article and in addition, the director may cause
such ice or snow to be cleared and the expense of
removal, together with an expense for administrative
overhead equal to 20 percent of the expense,
shall become a debt to the city from the
occupant or owner of such lot or property and
shall be charged against the premises adjoining
or abutting such sidewalk and the owner of the
sidewalk in accordance with the provisions of
section 66-19.
(Ord. No. 93-7, § 1(4.74), 7-19-93)
Sec. 70-88. Municipal authority and liabil­
ity.
(a) Authority. Under specific authority granted
by its city Charter in section 2.2(3)(iii), the city
maintains the right to require the owners of real
property to build and maintain public sidewalks
in the area of street immediately adjacent to such
property and, upon the failure of any owner to do
so, construct and/or maintain such sidewalk and
assess the cost thereof against such property as a
special assessment. At the same time, the city
Charter in section 2.2(4), authorizes the city to
undertake any public work or make any public
improvement or any repair or replacement thereof,
either directly or by contract with public bodies or
private persons. In combination, these two separate
Charter provisions allow the city to compel
the repair or replacement of sidewalks through
either private or municipal efforts, and with the
expenses incurred therefor to be attributable to
either the municipality or, in whole or in part, the
property owner, by way of special assessment.
(b) Liability. Nothing set forth in this section,
either expressed or implied, shall abrogate, negate,
alter, or limit any or all rights, protection, or
CD70:10
STREETS, SIDEWALKS AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES
indemnification accorded the city in its role as a
municipality of the state, under the cumulative
legal doctrine generally referred to as, "governmental
immunity"; or under any and all of the
laws, statutes, regulations, or ordinances of the
state and city, as from time to time amended.

stringent requirements are contained
herein.
(2) Any plat shall be designed so that no lots
have direct access to public street outside
of the proposed plat. Access to lots within
the plat shall only be provided by streets
proposed as part of the plat. The council,

a. That topography or other significant
natural features preclude access to
any other public street or adjoining
property on which a public street
may be conducted. Such significant
natural features shall be clearly identified
and marked on the proposed
plat.
b.
c.
That not allowing a longer block
would result in inefficient use of
land. Alternate development plans
demonstrating that no other development
is feasible shall be submitted
by the applicant and reviewed by
the city council prior to confirming
this finding.
That other methods of access are
available such that emergency vehicles
are assured a safe and unimpeded

identified and marked on the
proposed plat.
2. That not allowing a longer dead
end street or cul-de-sac would
result in inefficient use of land.
Alternate development plans
demonstrating that no other development
is feasible shall be
submitted by the applicant and
reviewed by the city council prior
to confirming this finding.
3. That other methods of access
are available such that emergency
vehicles are assured a
safe and unimpeded route of
travel to the properties served
by the dead end street or culde-
sac. Such access shall be reviewed
by the fire chief and a
recommendation forwarded to
the planning commission.
b. The city council, upon a finding that
at least one of the above conditions
exist, shall establish the maximum
length of the proposed dead end street
or cul-de-sac.
(6) Streets shall be constructed with the standard,
six-inch concrete curb and gutter. A
concrete, rolled curb and gutter may be
constructed with the approval of the city

governing such rights-of-way.
(4) All utilities shall conform to the construction
standards of the City of Dowagiac or
other appropriate agency or ordinance.
(c) Sidewalks.
(1) Sidewalks shall be required on both sides
of any street serving the plat or any lot
with the plat. Sidewalks may only be
waived by the council in the following
circumstances at their discretion:
a. Where no other public sidewalks are
available on any adjoining street
within 500 feet of the boundary of
the proposed plat.
b. On cul-de-sac streets within such
plat that are less than 500 feet in
length.
c. Where the council determines that
sidewalks are impractical due to physical
limitations of the property.
(2) Sidewalks and pedestrian crosswalks shall
be constructed according to the city's standards.

SUBDMSIONS § 74-71
(e) Existing natural features and amenities.
(1) To the extent possible, existing natural
features and amenities shall be preserved
or where appropriate, replaced with the
plat.
(2) Where such features are required to be
removed or altered or part of the plat
design, the applicant shall certify to the
council:
a. That the properties of the land which
is part of the plat are such that no
practical alternative designed to possible
that would preserve such features.
b. That the removal or alteration of
such features will not have an adverse
effect on adjacent properties
with respect to drainage, views, or
other significant environmental effect.
c. That the removal or alteration of
such features complies with all applicable
federal state, and local laws
and ordinances.
d. That financial considerations alone
are not used to justify the removal or
alteration of such features.
(3) The council may require the installation
of street trees or other landscaping or
other action or compensate for the removal
or alteration of natural features or
amenities or to provide screening from
adjacent properties or streets where
deemed appropriate.
(f) Street lighting.
(1) Street lighting shall be required.
(2) Street lighting shall be installed in accordance
with the standards of the City of
Dowagiac or other appropriate agency or
utility, provided however, in no case shall
the spacing between lights be less than
300 feet.
(3) Alternative street lighting, such as decorative
lamps or other similar design may
be installed, if approved by the council,
upon determination that lighting levels
will be equivalent to standard street light.
(4) The applicant shall enter into a special
assessment agreement with the city for
purpose of maintaining and operating the
street lighting system. The agreement shall
include all properties within the subdivision
and shall cover all expenses associated
with annual maintenance and operation
of the system.
(g) Lots.
(1) Every lot shall have frontage on a public,
dedicated street and each lot shall meet
the requirements of the City of Dowagiac
Zoning Ordinance as to lot width and
area.
(2) Every lot shall contain sufficient buildable
area to permit construction of a principal
building in compliance with the requirements
of the zoning ordinance.
(3) Where there is a question about sufficient
buildable area due to factors such as soil
formations, flood conditions, high water
table, or similar conditions, the planning
commission shall withhold approval of
such lots until a sufficient buildable area
is provided. This may be accomplished
through the combining with other lots or
other such design which shall provide
sufficient buildable area without the necessity
of a zoning variance.
(4) Corner lots in subdivisions located within
any residential zoning district shall be
platted at least ten feet wider than the
minimum width required by the zoning
ordinance.
(5) Excessive lot depth in relation to width
shall be avoided. A depth-to-width ratio
not to exceed 3:1 shall be the maximum
allowed.

i. Once an applicant has established a
current payment history with the
city, a deposit will not be required
should the applicant request utility
service at a new location. Should the
applicant subsequently be disconnected
for a violation of any utility
ordinance, they will be required to
pay any deposits as required of any
applicant without acceptable credit

Sec. 82-8. Budget plan.
(a) All utility customers of the City of Dowagiac
shall have the option of joining the city's utility
budget plan. The city will calculate the average
utility billing during the prior 12 months billing
history. In cases where no prior history exists, the
city will estimate the budget payment based upon
average usage.
(b) Forms for the city's budget plan are available
at the city's utilities office. Only those customer's
whose current utility accounts are paid in
full, shall be eligible to pay under the utility
budget plan. Budget payments will be due on the
tenth of each month.
(c) Any late or missed budget payments will
result in the voiding of the budget agreement. If it
shall be necessary to void the budget agreement,
arrearages on the account will be subject to normal
disconnect procedures. If a customer's budget
plan becomes void for nonpayment, that customer
will not be eligible for a new budget plan until the
customer has maintained an account on a current
basis for 12 consecutive months.
(d) All accounts operating under the budget
plan will be reviewed once per year or earlier if
there is a rate or unexpected usage change. If an
account under the budget plan has a balance
greater than twice the monthly budget, it will be
reviewed and adjusted accordingly.
The city reserves the right to terminate from the
budget plan any and all parties who do not comply
with the terms of the written budget plan agreement
.

All accounts must be current and arrearages paid
at the time of the first direct charge. The city
reserves the right to terminate from this plan any
and all parties who do not comply with the terms
of the written agreement. Any account which
incurs two returned electronic funds transfer transactions
in a 12-month period may be removed
from the plan and may be ineligible for reinstatement.
Automated payment plans shall terminate
upon receipt of notice to discontinue service.

82-19(e).
(Ord. No. 05-6, § 1, 5-10-05; Ord. No. 07-5, § 1,
5-30-07)
Sec. 82-11. Billing/payment procedures.
(a) Every effort will be made to read the customer's
meter every month. Occasionally however,
some meters cannot be read due to extreme
weather conditions, emergencies, watchdogs or
other circumstances. In these cases an estimated
reading will be made by the department based
upon the customer's previous usage. When an
actual reading is obtained for the next billing
period, the utility bill will be adjusted to reflect
the total consumption for the period between
actual readings. If a credit resulting from a high
estimate remains on a utility bill, the credit will
be applied to the next regularly scheduled utility
bill.
(b) Bills for electric, water and sewer service
charges will be provided monthly and are due on
the tenth of the month following the month of
billing. Failure to receive a bill will not entitle a
customer to forego any charge for nonpay ment
within the time specified. If a customer does not
pay the bill by the due date, a one-time late
payment penalty of eight percent of the current
arrears, excluding any sales tax, will be assessed
and a disconnect notice will be mailed approximately
seven day[s] thereafter. The disconnect
notice will provide no less than 14 day s after the
due date to pay the bill and will indicate the
amount due to avoid disconnection and the scheduled
disconnect date. If the customer does not pay
the amount due on said notice by the date and
time indicated on the disconnect notice, the customer's
account will be subject to disconnection
the following day.
(c) Any customer unable to pay a utility bill
prior to the disconnect date may request a ten-day
extension by signing a written agreement prior to
the scheduled disconnect date. The ten-day extension
shall be effective on the day before the stated
disconnect date. Only two extension agreements
will be granted in any calendar y ear. Failure to
pay the amount due in full within the ten-day
extension will result in immediate disconnection.
(d) Services established are to be in the name
of the legal occupant of the property, i.e. the
owner, legal tenant (see section on service deposits)
or a guardian or personal representative if the
owner or tenant should be incapacitated. Any
service set in the name(s) of a person(s) who
becomes deceased is required to be changed to the
name of the legal occupant of the property. Any
service not corrected, after notification by the city,
may be subject to disconnection. In order for the
service to be reestablished, any amounts due after
the date on which the original party becomes
deceased must be paid in full.
(e) The customer remains responsible for the
payment of all bills rendered until he or she
orders the service to be discontinued (flnalled)
and the city has had reasonable time to affect
such discontinuance.
(Ord. No. 05-6, § 1, 5-10-05; Ord. No. 08-4, § 1,
5-13-08; Ord. No. 09-5, § 1, 10-27-09)
Sec. 82-12. Collection.
(a) The charges for electric, water and/or sewer
service, under the provisions of Section 21, Act 94,
Public Acts of Michigan, 1933, as amended, are
hereby made a lien on all premises served thereby.
Whenever any such charges against such premises
shall be delinquent for six months, the city
official or officials in charge of collection thereof,
shall certify annually, on April 30 of each y ear, to
Supp. No. 14 CD82:8.3
§ 82-12 DOWAGIAC CODE
the tax assessing officer of the city, the fact of such
delinquency, whereupon such charges shall be
entered upon the next tax roll by the tax assessing
officer as a charge against such premises to
which the services shall have been rendered, and
the charges shall be collected and the lien enforced
in the same manner as provided for the
collection of taxes assessed upon the roll and the
enforcement of the lien for the taxes. Where
residential real estate is involved, no lien shall
attach unless the user of the utility service(s) is
also the owner of the real estate or unless the
owner negotiated or executed an agreement with
the tenant stating that the owner is responsible
for the utilities used by the tenant. Where notice
is given in writing that a tenant is responsible for
such charges and services, said notice shall include
a signed affidavit form with the city that
shall be notarized and a true copy of the lease of
the affected premises. After such notice is received
by the city, no further service shall be
rendered to such premise unless a cash deposit,
as required by this ordinance, is received as
security for pay ment and all amounts due from
the tenant have been paid in full. By filing the
aforementioned notices with the city, any charges
for electric, water and/or sewer incurred by a
tenant for service beginning with the first day of
the billing cycle following the filing of the affidavit
with the city shall not be subject to a lien
against said premises.
(b) In addition to other remedies provided, and
under the provisions of Public Act 178 of 1939,
Section 123.166, the city shall have the right to
discontinue the supply of electric and water to
any premises for the nonpayment of sewer charges
when due, the city shall have the right to discontinue
either the water services or the sewage
disposal services to the premises or both. Electric,
water services and sewage disposal services so
discontinued shall not be restored until all sums
due and owing shall be paid, including but not
limited to reconnection service charges, any noncompliance
charges, tampering charges, and the
proper utility deposits.

Sec. 82·14. Restoration of service.
The city shall restore discontinued service when
the cause of the discontinuation has been settled
or satisfactory credit arrangements have been
made. The city shall make an effort to restore
service on the day on which restoration is requested.
If the city is unable to restore service on
the day requested, then restoration shall be made
as soon as reasonably possible.
(Ord. No. 05-6, § 1, 5-10-05)
Sec. 82·15. Access to premises.
(a) The city's authorized agents shall have
access to all premises to install, inspect, read,

UTILITIES § 82-19
property and/or to inspect wiring, piping, appliances,
fixtures, water shut-off valves and water
services located within or outside the street rightof-
way, or any other devices that are in any way
connected with the city utility system. Not allowing
the city employees or agents access to premise
may subject the property or other premises owned
by the same party concerned to disconnection of
service.
(b) In cases of rental properties, it shall be the
responsibility of the property owner to effect
proper entrance for city personnel to discontinue
or maintain any services. Failure to provide this
access may result in such services being continued
with the property owner liable for payment
from the date of the tenant's service being discontinued.
(c) The customer shall keep the immediate
area and access area in and around the city's
equipment clean and free of debris. Meters not
accessible to be read will be estimated.
(Ord. No. 05-6, § 1, 5-10-05)
Sec. 82-16. Selection of equipment.
Before purchasing equipment for use in connection
with the utility system, the customer should
secure from the city the characteristics of the
service available (i.e. service voltage, water pressure,
etc.) for such use and should acquaint himself
or herself with the rules and regulations
governing the use and installation of such equipment.
(Ord. No. 05-6, § 1, 5-10-05)
Sec. 82-17. Approval of equipment.
The city reserves the right to approve or disapprove
for use in connection with the utility system,
any plumbing, wiring, equipment, appliances,
fixtures, motors or any other devices that
are presently in use or that are offered for use in
connection therewith. Should any of the same be
disapproved, their use shall be disconnected at
once, either permanently, or until corrective measures
have been taken. Failure to comply with
orders to discontinue the use of or to apply corrective
measures to disapproved equipment shall
be deemed just cause for the discontinuance of all
service until compliance is completed.
(Ord. No. 05-6, § 1, 5-10-05)
Sec. 82-18. Extra expense due to overtime
and adverse conditions.
A charge may be made when extraordinary
expense is incurred by the city in performing
customer services on account of overtime rates for
other than regular working hours, or on account
of unfavorable weather conditions, snow and ice
accumulations, curb boxes buried or filled through
no action of the city, and for similar reasons.
(Ord. No. 05-6, § 1, 5-10-05)
Sec. 82-19. Overcharges, undercharges and
adjustments to customer accounts.
(a) No credit will be allowed unless all city
requirements have been adhered to and the validity
of such a credit or refund is supported by a
clear record. No refund will be made to any
account after six months following discontinuance
of service. No credit or refund will be made in a
net amount of less than $2.00.
(b) When an account has been overcharged
due to a billing or metering error, the city shall
refund or credit the amount of the overcharge for
the period of the billing error up to three years
immediately preceding discovery of the billing or
metering error.
(c) If an account has been undercharged due to
a billing or metering error, the city may bill the
customer for the amount of the undercharge for
the 12-month period immediately preceding discovery
of the billing or metering error. If the
undercharge involves meter tampering or fraud,
the city will charge the customer for the amount
of the undercharge. The city shall offer the customer
payment arrangements for the amount of
the undercharge.
(d) Adjustments of bills may be allowed in
cases of substantiated and unusual usage, broken
water lines, and other such extraordinary situations
as determined by the utility department.
Written requests for bill adjustments due to water
Supp. No. 12 CD82:8.5
§ 82-19 DOWAGIAC CODE
leaks will only be considered if received within 90
days of the due date of the bill containing the
reported high usage. Adjustments for water leaks
shall be limited to the most recent four months of
billings associated with water leaks.
(e) When a meter is tested and found to have
error outside the accuracy limits as recommended
by the department, the city shall adjust the
customer's utility charges and the consumption
registered by the amount of error for the period of
the error not to exceed the time limits stated in
part (d) of this section. When a meter is stopped,
slow, or fast, the adjustment shall be based on
consumption during a corresponding period not to
exceed six months either prior or subsequent to
meter failure. The city shall not charge the
customer's account additional amounts where the
customer has notified the city in writing of the
problem, and the city has allowed the stopped or
slow meter to remain in service.
(Ord. No. 05-6, § 1, 5-10-05)
Sec. 82-20. Meters-Size; location; protection.
All meters and metering equipment and water/
wastewater meters used in regular service, shall
be owned and maintained by the city, which will
determine, given the proper information, the size,
ty pe, location and suitability of the equipment.
Meter locations shall be provided on the customer's
premises as directed by the city. Customers' meters
are not allowed to be located on city poles unless
by special permission. The customer/property owner
shall provide, as directed by and free of expense to
the city, close to the point of the service entrance,
a suitable space for the installation of the city 's
metering equipment and shall, at all times, keep
the area about, over and under this equipment
free and clear so that easy access may be had by
city authorized persons. The customer/property
owner shall protect the city's metering equipment
from damage and, in the case of waterlwastewater
meters, from freezing, and shall permit no
person other than an agent of the city or a person
authorized by the city to remove, inspect or tamper
with the same. Any person damaging, tampering
with or removing any type of metering device of
the city will be held responsible for the repair(s)
or replacement of such device.
(Ord. No. 05-6, § 1, 5-10-05)
Sec. 82-21. Additional meters.

Sec. 82-22. Remote waterlwastewater meter
readers.

remote reader on most accounts. It shall be the
intention of the city to install remote readers in
all customer existing premises where access to
the water/wastewater meter is difficult or where,
in the department's opinion, entering the premises
may cause disruption to the customer or his
or her business operations or that are a detriment
to the city or the customer. All such installations
will be performed by city personnel at city expense.
(Ord. No. 05-6, § 1, 5-10-05)
Sec. 82-23. Automatic account transfers for
rental units.
Owners of rental properties who do not wish
any interruption in utility services to their property
when vacated by tenants may request that
when a tenant orders service out of his or her
name, the service is automatically transferred to
the property owner, and the normal service charge
is billed to the property owner. This automatic
account transfer will not take place if the property
owner has outstanding amounts owed, in
excess of 45 days from original billing date, on the
property involved.
(Ord. No. 05-6, § 1, 5-10-05)
Sec. 82-24. Landlord/tenant policy for rental
properties.
(a) When service is applied for on a rental
property, either written (rent receipt, lease agreement)
or oral confirmation by the manager, land-
Supp. No. 12 CD82:8.6
UTILITIES § 82-26
lord or property owner may be required to ensure
that the applicant is a legal tenant of the property.
Service may be established in the manager's,
landlord's or property owner's name at his or her
request.
(b) To avoid having delinquent utility charges
from their tenants assessed against their premises,
landlords must provide the city with a copy
of the lease agreement before the tenant occupies
the premises and signing a form entitled "Affidavit
of Tenant Responsibility for City of Dowagiac
Utility Charges". The lease must contain language
that the tenant is responsible for the utility
bills. Upon the filing of a lease agreement, the
tenant will be responsible for a utility deposit in
accordance with section 82-7 of this Code that is
pay able at the time service is established. The
utility deposit will be applied to the tenant's final
bill for that premise, with any excess amount
being refunded to the tenant.
(c) If no lease and signed affidavit of tenant
responsibility for the city utility charges is filed
with the city, then pursuant to city ordinance, any
utilities delinquent for six months or more may be
placed as a lien on the premises to which the
service is provided and charged on the next property

CHAPTER 2
GENERAL PROVISIONS
SECTION 2.1 NON-CONFORMING LOTS, BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES,
AND USES
A. Intent
1. It is recognized that there exist within zoning districts certain lots, buildings and
structures, and uses which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or
amended, which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of
this Ordinance. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit such legal nonconforming
lots, buildings and structures, and uses to continue until they are
removed, but not to encourage their survival.
2. Non-conforming lots, buildings and structures, and uses are declared by this
Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts in which they
are located. It is the intent of this Ordinance that these non-conformities shall not
be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other
buildings, structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the district.
3. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans,
construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was
lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been diligently
conducted.
4. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be interpreted as authorization for, or approval of,
the continuance of the use of a structure or premises in violation of zoning
regulation in effect at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance.”
B. Non-Conforming Lots of Record
1. Where a residential lot of record in existence at the time of the adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance does not meet the minimum requirements for lot
width or lot area, such lot of record may be used for any purposes permitted by
the district in which the lot is located, provided that any building or structure
constructed on the lot complies with all other yard setback requirements.
2. If two (2) or more lots of record or combination of lots and portions of lots of
record, in existence at the time of the passage of this Ordinance, or an amendment
thereto, with continuous frontage and under single ownership do not meet the
requirements established for lot width or lot area, the lands involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Ordinance, and no
portion of such parcel shall be used or divided in a manner which diminishes
City of Dowagiac Zoning Ordinance 28
compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this Ordinance.
If such a lot is used, it shall lose its legal nonconforming status.
C. Non-Conforming Uses
1. No non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a
greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of the adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance.
2. No part of any non-conforming use shall be moved unless such movement
eliminates the non-conformity.
3. If a non-conforming use is abandoned for any reason for a period of more than
one (1) year, any subsequent use shall conform to the requirements of this
Ordinance. A non-conforming use shall be determined to be abandoned if one or
more of the following conditions exist, and which shall be deemed to constitute an
intent on the part of the property owner to abandon the non-conforming use:
a. Utilities, such as water, gas and electricity to the property, have been
disconnected;
b. The property, buildings, and grounds, have fallen into disrepair;
c. Signs or other indications of the existence of the non-conforming use have
been removed;
d. Equipment or fixtures necessary for the operation of the non-conforming
use have been removed;
e. Other actions, which in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator constitute
an intention of the part of the property owner or lessee to abandon the nonconforming
use.
4. A non-conforming use may be changed to another non-conforming use provided
that all of the following determinations are made by the Board of Appeals:
a. The proposed use shall be as compatible as or more compatible with the
surrounding neighborhood than the previous non-conforming use. Hours
of operation, traffic, noise, odor and similar characteristics of the use shall
be considered in making such determination.
b. The proposed non-conforming use shall not be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than the previous nonconforming
use.
City of Dowagiac Zoning Ordinance 29
c. That appropriate conditions and safeguards are provided that will ensure
compliance with the intent and purpose of this Ordinance.
d. The non-conforming use of a structure may not be resumed if changed to a
conforming or more conforming use.
D. Non-Conforming Buildings and Structures
1. Where a lawful building or structure exists at the effective date of this Ordinance,
or an amendment thereto, that does not comply with the requirements of this
Ordinance because of restrictions such as lot area, coverage, width, height, or
yards, such building or structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
a. No such building or structure may be enlarged or altered in a way that
increases its nonconformity, except in cases in which the setback of a
building or structure is non-conforming by fifty (50) percent or less of the
distance required by this Ordinance. Only in these cases may the nonconforming
setback be extended along the same plane as the existing nonconforming
setback, provided that in so doing, the setback itself is not
further reduced.
b. Should a non-conforming building or structure be destroyed to an extent
of more than fifty (50) percent of its replacement cost (see definition),
exclusive of the foundation, it shall be reconstructed only in conformity
with the provisions of this Ordinance.
c. Should a non-conforming building or structure be moved for any reason
and for any distance, it shall be moved to a location which complies with
the requirements of this Ordinance.
2. None of the provisions of this Section are meant to preclude normal repairs and
maintenance on any non-conforming building or structure that would prevent
strengthening or correcting of any unsafe condition of the building or structure.
E. The City may acquire, through purchase or condemnation, private non-conforming,
buildings, structures, or land. The City Council may make this purchase of private
property in the manner provided for by law.

CHAPTER 16
FP FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT
SECTION 16.1 INTENT
This overlay district is intended to control the placement of buildings and structures and the use
of land in areas subject to predictable flooding in the floodplain areas of watercourses within the
City so that their reservoir capacity shall not be reduced, thereby creating danger to areas
previously not endangered by high water, or to impede, retard, accelerate or change the direction
of the flow or carrying capacity of the watercourse or to otherwise increase the possibility of
flood. These regulations, while permitting reasonable use of such properties, will help to protect
human life, prevent or minimize material and economic losses and reduce the cost to the public
in time of emergency, through public aid and relief efforts occasioned by the unwise occupancy
of flood areas. This overlay district adds controls to the underlying zoning district but does not
change the underlying zoning.
SECTION 16.2 LOCATION OF DISTRICT
The floodplain areas within the City of Dowagiac shall be determined and a record of the
determination shall be kept in the office of the Zoning Administrator. In making the
determination, the Zoning Administrator shall take into consideration the nature of the situation,
past, present and future experiences, published reports, and information furnished by the
Michigan Water Resources Commission, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Soil
Conservation Services of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and other responsible sources.
Floodplain areas shall be restricted as to use and occupancy so human life is protected and
further flood damage is minimized.
SECTION 16.3 PERMITTED USES
The following uses are permitted by right in this district:
A. Residential supportive uses such as lawns, gardens, driveways or play areas.
B. Open space uses allowed in the underlying zoning district.
C. Private, non-commercial lands or docks for pleasure boats, provided there shall be no
more than one (1) landing or dock for each such lot which abuts a body of water. Such
landing or dock shall be for the exclusive use of the owner or occupant of the lot. A lot
shall be determined to be a parcel of land which consists of the minimum lot area and lot
width required for that zoning district in which the lot is located.
D. Parks and playgrounds.
E. Accessory buildings and uses, customarily incidental to any of the Permitted Uses or
Special Land Uses in this district, as regulated in Section 2.2.
City of Dowagiac Zoning Ordinance 86
SECTION 16.4 SPECIAL LAND USES
The following uses are permitted in this District by obtaining approval from the Planning
Commission as Special Land Uses, after all applicable standards of Chapter 20 are satisfied:
A. Parking lots, loading areas, and storage areas for equipment and machinery easily moved
or not subject to flood damage.
B. Structures designed and constructed to accommodate a 100-year flood which might occur
as calculated from available official data without material damage to the structure and
without material obstruction of the floodplain to the detriment of other properties.
Permissible construction hereunder shall include, among others, structures in which the
lowest habitable floor area (including basement floors, manufactured home floors and
attached garage floor, but excluding detached garages or storage buildings when
constructed and designed in a floodproof manner) is above a documented base 100-year
flood elevation. The Zoning Administrator is authorized and directed to determine the
acceptability of any proposed construction hereunder, subject to appeal to the Zoning
Board of Appeals by an aggrieved applicant, which Board shall be governed in its
decision by the criteria that the proposed construction is not contrary to public health and
safety, and would afford substantial justice to all parties involved, including the general
public.
SECTION 16.5 DISTRICT REGULATIONS
Yard and lot requirements in the FP District shall be the same as set forth in the underlying
zoning district.
SECTION 16.6 STATE COMPLIANCE
No new construction in the FP District shall be permitted until the same has received approval
from the pertinent state agency or official under the provisions, where applicable, of the
Shoreland Protection and Management Act (1970 PA 245), the Subdivision Control Act (1967
PA 288), the Water Resources Commission Act (1929 PA 245), or other applicable state statutes
and any and all amendments thereto.

HISTORIC PRESERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICT (HPD OVERLAY DISTRICT)
SECTION 18.1 INTENT
The purpose of the Historic Preservation Overlay District is to provide a means to promote the
cultural, economic, and general welfare of the public through the preservation and protection of
structures and areas of historic and cultural interest within the City.
SECTION 18.2 HISTORIC COMMISSION
Pursuant to Act No. 169 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1970 (MCL 399.201 et seq., MSA
5.3407(1) et seq.) as amended, a commission to be known as the City Historic Commission shall
be created by resolution prior to City Council establishment of a Historic Preservation Overlay
District (HPD) or at any time deemed appropriate by the City Council.
SECTION 18.3 HISTORIC COMMISSION RESPONSIBILITIES.
Historical preservation is a public purpose. To serve that purpose, the Historic Commission is
hereby charged with the following responsibilities:
A. Review proposals to establish an HPD overlay district to determine if the proposed area
has historic and cultural significance and is suitable for preservation.
B. Upon establishment of an HPD overlay district by the City Council to:
1. Regulate the construction, alteration, repair, moving and demolition of only those
structures in the historic districts which, by City ordinance, have been, or may in
the future be, designated historic structures.
2. In those instances where efforts of the commission to preserve a historic structure
in the historic districts fail, or it is deemed that public ownership is most suitable,
recommend that the City Council work toward acquisition of such property.
3. The Historic Commission may:
a. Maintain public historic structures using its own funds, if not specifically
earmarked for other purposes, or public funds committed to this use by the
City Council.
b. Act as the agent of the City Council to accept and administer grants and
gifts for historical preservation purposes in the historic districts.
c. Address any historic or cultural public policy they deem appropriate.
City of Dowagiac Zoning Ordinance 90

The Historic Commission shall consist of seven members residing in the City. Members shall be
appointed by the Mayor with the approval of the City Council. Appointments shall be for threeyear
terms, except the initial appointments shall provide for three three-year terms, two two-year
terms, and two one-year terms, so that subsequent appointments shall not recur at the same time.
All terms terminate on January 1, except that a member shall continue in office until a successor
is appointed and takes office. Members shall be eligible for reappointment. If a vacancy on the

SECTION 18.7 RULES OF PROCEDURE
The Historic Commission shall propose rules of procedure for approval by the City Council.
SECTION 18.8 BOUNDARY AND IDENTIFICATIO OF HPD OVERLAY
DISTRICT
Upon the establishment of an HPD overlay district, according to the procedure set forth in this
title, the exact boundary of the district shall be clearly noted on the official zoning map, as
described in this chapter. This district shall be labeled as HPD, and a note shall be attached
giving the official name of the historic neighborhood.
SECTION 18.9 ESTABLISHMENT OF HPD OVERLAY DISTRICT; PROCEDURE
A. Established by ordinance of City Council. If it finds that an area of land is of historic and
cultural significance and is suitable for preservation, the City Council may establish such
area by ordinance as a Historic Preservation Overlay District (HPD). In the absence of
provisions to the contrary in the book of standards described in Section 18.10 for any
such HPD overlay district, all regulations of the underlying district within such area shall
continue to apply. However the Historic Commission shall have the power to review
work on, or the moving or demolition of, structures within this district according to the
provisions of Section 18.12.
City of Dowagiac Zoning Ordinance 91
B. Application; filing. Application for an HPD may be initiated as a request from the City
Council to the Historic Commission, or as a petition either by the Planning Commission,
Historic Commission, or by the owners of at least fifty-one (51) percent or more of the
property covered by the petition. Petitions shall be filed with the Historic Commission
and shall contain the necessary information as prescribed by the Historic Commission.
C. Investigation by Historic Commission; report to Planning Commission; recommendation
to City Council. Upon receipt of a petition or request to the Historic Commission, the
Historic Commission shall investigate the property which is the subject of such
application and shall prepare a written report within 30 days and transmit it to the
Planning Commission. At the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning
Commission, after two weeks’ written notice to each property owner in the proposed
district, the report of the Historic Commission and the application for a historic district
shall be considered by the Planning Commission which shall recommend to the City
Council either that such application be approved as submitted or as modified by the
Planning Commission, or that such application be denied.
D. Consideration by City Council; amendment. Thereafter, the City Council shall proceed
with consideration of such proposed district in the same manner and subject to the same
voting requirements as would apply to a zoning amendment, provided that the City
Council may amend such proposed ordinance prior to its adoption in any manner it may
deem necessary to accomplish the purposes of this chapter.
SECTION 18.10 ADOPTION OF A DISTRICT BOOK OF STANDARDS
As part of its written report described above in Section 18.9, the Historic Commission shall
recommend a set of standards for that specific historic preservation overlay district. Such book
shall contain all of the provisions different from those normally applicable to the underlying
district and all additional architectural and site development standards to be followed within the
historic district. The official name of the historic district shall be stated as part of the title of the
book of standards. If the City Council shall approve a historic district, they shall also approve as
submitted or modify the book of standards submitted by the Historic Commission. Amendments
to the approved book of standards shall be made only by the City Council after review by the
Historic Commission and a public hearing by the Planning Commission in the same manner as
set forth in Section 18.9. All books of standards shall become part of this chapter.
SECTION 18.11 ESTABLISHMENT OF A LOCAL LANDMARK
In addition to the regulations and procedures of this division, the establishment of a local
landmark may be approved by the City Council upon recommendation of the Historic
Commission and the Planning Commission. A petition to establish a local landmark may be
initiated by the owner of the property involved or by petition of the Historic Commission,
Planning Commission, or City Council. The local landmark described may or may not be
located within an existing or proposed HPD. Such landmarks may include restrictions and a
separate book of standards or may be designated for strictly honorary purposes with not
restrictions whatsoever. Local landmark designation will follow the same procedures outlined
City of Dowagiac Zoning Ordinance 92
for the establishment of a district in Section 18.9 and the adoption of a district book of standards
in Section 18.10.
SECTION 18.12 APPROVAL OR REJECTION OF WORK ON OR MOVING OR
DEMOLITION OF HISTRIC STRUCTRUES
A. Permit application; referral to Historic Commission for review. The Building Official
shall refer each application for a permit for any construction, alteration, repair, moving or
demolition affecting the exterior appearance of a structure within a HPD, together with
plans pertaining thereto, to the Historic Commission, and the Historic Commission shall
review such plans and application. No permit shall be granted until the Historic
Commission has issued a recommendation thereon.
B. Review of plans; considerations. In reviewing plans, the Historic Commission shall give
consideration to:
1. The historical or architectural value and significance of the structure and its
relationship to the historical value of the surrounding area.
2. The relationship of the exterior architectural features of such structure to the rest
of the structure and to the surrounding area.
3. The general compatibility of exterior design, arrangement, texture and materials
proposed to be used.
4. Any other factor, including aesthetics, which it deems to be pertinent.
C. Exterior features considered; disapproval of applications. The Historic Commission shall
pass only on exterior features of a structure and shall not consider interior arrangements,
nor shall it issue a negative recommendation on an application, except in regard to the
considerations set forth in subsection (b) of this section.
D. Application for repair; approval. An application for repair or alteration affecting the
exterior appearance of a historic structure, or for its moving or demolition, shall be
recommended for approval by the Historic Commission, if any of the following
conditions prevail, and if, in the opinion of the Historic Commission, the proposed
changes will materially improve or correct these conditions:
1. The structure constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or the occupants.
2. The structure is a deterrent to a major improvement program which will be of
substantial benefit to the community.
3. Retention of the structure would cause unnecessary financial hardship to the
owner.
City of Dowagiac Zoning Ordinance 93

G. Review Standards
The following standards shall be utilized by the Planning Commission in reviewing all
site plans. These standards are intended to provide a frame of reference for the applicant
in the preparation of site plans as well as for the reviewing authority in making judgment
City of Dowagiac Zoning Ordinance 101
concerning them. These standards shall not be regarded as inflexible requirements. They
are not intended to discourage creativity, invention, or innovation.
1. Site Development Standards
a. The uses proposed will not adversely affect the public health, safety, or
welfare. Uses and structures located on the site shall take into account
topography, size of the property, the uses on adjoining property and the
relationship and size of buildings to the site. The site shall be developed so
as not to impede the normal and orderly development or improvement of
surrounding property for uses permitted in this Ordinance.
b. The site plan shall provide reasonable visual and sound privacy for all
dwelling units located therein, and adjacent thereto. Fences, walls,
barriers, and landscaping shall be used, as appropriate, to accomplish these
purposes.
c. All buildings and groups of buildings shall be arranged so as to permit
necessary emergency vehicle access as requested by the Fire Department.

planned streets in the area shall be planned to provide a safe and efficient
circulation system for traffic within the City.
c. All streets and driveways shall be developed in accordance with the City
Subdivision Control Ordinance, access standards or MDOT specifications,
as appropriate. Except that the Planning Commission may impose more
stringent requirements than those of the Michigan Department of
Transportation with respect to driveway location and spacing. Sidewalks
may be required if deemed necessary or appropriate for pedestrians or
non-motorized vehicles. Shared parking, common driveways, frontage
roads and similar access management techniques shall be encouraged
where practical.
d. Entrances and exits shall be provided at appropriate locations so as to
maximize the convenience and safety for persons entering or leaving the
site. The number of entrances to and exists from the site shall be
determined with reference to the number of dwelling units or other land
uses within the site, the nature and location of the surrounding streets, the
effect of traffic in the area, nearby topography, and other factors. The
number of individual driveways should be the minimum needed to serve
the proposed development.
3. Environmental and Natural Features Standards
a. Removal or alteration of significant natural features shall be restricted to
those areas which are reasonably necessary to develop the site in
accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance. The Planning
Commission may require that landscaping, buffers, and/or greenbelts be
preserved and/or provided to ensure that proposed uses will be adequately
buffered from one another and from surrounding public and private
property.
b. Areas of natural drainage such as swales, wetlands, ponds, or swamps
shall be protected and preserved insofar as practical in their natural state to
provide areas for natural habitat, preserve drainage patterns and maintain
the natural characteristics of the land.

waters will not adversely affect neighboring properties or the public storm
drainage system. Provisions shall be made to accommodate stormwater,
prevent erosion and the formation of dust. The use of detention/retention
ponds may be required. Surface water on all paved areas shall be collected
at intervals so that it will not obstruct the flow of vehicular or pedestrian
traffic or create puddles in paved areas. Catch basins may be required to
contain oil filters or traps to prevent contaminants from being directly
discharged to the natural drainage system.
City of Dowagiac Zoning Ordinance 103
H. Site Plan Approvals
1. As part of an approval to any site plan, the Planning Commission may impose any
additional conditions or limitations as in its judgment may be necessary for
protection of the public interest. A record of conditions shall be maintained with
the approved site plan. The conditions shall remain unchanged unless an
amendment to the site plan is approved in accordance with this Ordinance.

which site plans have been approved. Non-compliance with the requirements and
conditions of the approved site plan shall be considered violations of this
Ordinance.
6. Any site plan review approval may be voided by the Zoning Administrator or
Planning Commission if it has been determined that a material error in the
original approval has been discovered either because of inaccurate information
supplied by the applicant or administrative error by a staff member or other
agency. The voiding of an approved site plan shall be communicated in writing
with reasons for revocation to the property owner. The Building Official shall
also be notified to withhold any building permit until a new site plan is approved.
I. Performance Guarantees
The Planning Commission may require a performance guarantee in accordance with
Section 22.4 to ensure compliance with the approved site plan.
J. Appeal

SECTION 19.4 SIGNS

approval of an appeal, variance, or any other decision which they are required to make.
B. Conditions shall be imposed in a manner in accordance with the City and Village Zoning
Act and related to the standards by which the decision is reached.
SECTION 21.6 VARIANCE PROCEDURES
A. Authority for Variances
The Zoning Board of Appeals, after public hearing, shall have the power to grant requests
for variances from the provisions of this Ordinance where it is proved by the applicant
that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship in the way of carrying out the
strict letter of the Ordinance relating to the construction, equipment, or alteration of
buildings or structures so that the spirit of the Ordinance shall be observed, public safety
secured and substantial justice done.
B. Granting of Non-Use Variances
A non-use variance may be allowed by the Zoning Board of Appeals only in cases where
there is reasonable evidence of practical difficulty in the official record of the hearing and
that all of the following conditions are met:
1. That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying
to the property in question that do not apply generally to other properties in the
same zoning district;
2. That the condition or situation of the specific piece of property for which the
variance is sought is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably
practical the formulation of a general regulation for such conditions or situations.
Unique circumstances include: exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a
specific property on the effective date of this chapter, or by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation on the land, building or
structure or by reason of the use or development of the property immediately
adjoining the property in question, the literal enforcement of the requirements of
this chapter would involve practical difficulties;
City of Dowagiac Zoning Ordinance 161
3. That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right similar to that possessed by other properties in the same
zoning district and in the vicinity. The possibility of increased financial return
shall not of itself be deemed sufficient to warrant a variance.
4. The variance will not be significantly detrimental to adjacent property and the
surrounding neighborhood.
5. The variance will not impair the intent and purpose of this Ordinance.
6. That the immediate practical difficulty causing the need for the variance request
was not created by any action of the applicant.
C. Granting of Use Variances
1. A use variance may be allowed by the Zoning Board of Appeals only in cases
where there is reasonable evidence of unnecessary hardship in the official record
of the hearing that all of the following conditions are met:
a. That the building, structure, or land cannot be reasonably used for any of
the uses permitted by right or special approval in the zone district in which
it is located.
b. That the condition or situation of the specific piece of property or the
intended use of such property for which the variance is sought is not of so
general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably practical the
formulation of a general regulation for such conditions or situations.
Unique circumstances include: exceptional narrowness, shallowness or
shape of a specific property on the effective date of this chapter, or by
reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary
situation on the land, building or structure or by reason of the use or
development of the property immediately adjoining the property in
question, the literal enforcement of the requirements of this chapter would
cause unnecessary hardship.
c. That the proposed use will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood.
2. Prior to Zoning Board of Appeals hearing on a request for a Use Variance, the
Planning Commission shall consider such request and forward a report to the
Zoning Board of Appeals. For this report the Planning Commission shall
consider the Comprehensive Plan, the ability of the property owner to use the
property for a use already permitted under the existing zoning classification, the
effect of the request on the essential character of the neighborhood, and other such
factors as the Planning Commission may deem relevant.
City of Dowagiac Zoning Ordinance 162
SECTION 21.7 FEES
The City Council may prescribe and amend by resolution a reasonable schedule of fees to be
charged to applicants for appeals to the Zoning Board of Appeals. The fee shall be paid to the
City Treasurer at the time the application for the appeal or variance is filed.
