A 50 foot wide Locally Designated Channel beginning at the northerly limit of the Federally Designated Channel and extending northward approximately 758 feet; thence a 40 foot wide Locally Designated Channel beginning at the end of the 50 foot wide Locally Designated Channel and extending northerly approximately 312 feet to the Mathew J Lanigan Bridge. All of said Locally Designated Channel is as depicted on a plan encaptioned “Kennebunk River Locally Designated Channel,” dated August 26, 2004, and prepared by the Southern Maine Regional Planning Commission, the same being incorporated herein by reference.
10.5 Rules Of River Use
5.A) Prudent Operation of Vessels: Vessels shall be operated on the Kennebunk River in a reasonable manner so as not to endanger persons or property or to cause excessive wash. In no case shall speeds exceed five (5) knots while operating on any portion of the Kennebunk River south of the aforementioned Railroad Bridge.
5.B) Traps in the River: No operation of fixed traps of any kind will be allowed in the Kennebunk River southerly of the Railroad Bridge. Storage cages shall be permitted if attached to a vessel or to a vessel's mooring.

5.C) Record of Moorings: The Harbormaster shall maintain a written record of the basic information on each mooring including assigned location, identifying number, vessel description, owner, mooring specifications and details and any additional data deemed useful.
The Harbormaster will maintain the aforementioned plans of the Channel and a chart of the Harbor showing current mooring location assignments.
Each mooring location will be assigned at identifying number which must be marked in a legible fashion on the marker buoy or log in at least three inch (3”) numerals.
5.D) Mooring Authorizations: No moorings shall be permitted, and no moorings shall be placed, utilized or allowed without written authorization from the Harbormaster for the mooring of a specific vessel therein. Each day that a mooring remains in place or is utilized in violation of this section shall be deemed a separate violation hereof.
The Harbormaster shall have the authority to determine the total number of allowed moorings based on available Mooring Sites. The Harbor Master may consult with the Kennebunk River Committee and any other appropriate authority to determine mooring areas and their capacity. Commercial Moorings shall comprise at least 50% of the total number of Mooring Sites within the Kennebunk River. If an existing Commercial Mooring becomes available within the Kennebunk River, it may not be assigned for use as a Recreational or Transient Mooring if such assignment would cause the number of Commercial Moorings to constitute less than 50% of the total number of available mooring sites within the Kennebunk River.
The Harbor Master may change the location of assigned Mooring Sites when the crowded condition of the river, the need to conform with Title 38 M.R.S.A., §§ 3, 7-A, or other conditions render the change desirable.
The Harbor Master absolute authority over all moorings and mooring locations in accordance with the terms of this Ordinance and the laws of the State of Maine.
No Vessel greater than forty feet (40ft) shall be assigned a mooring space, except that should there be space available outside of the Federally designated Channel a commercial vessel of up to forty four feet (44ft) may be eligible for a mooring provided that it does not conflict with any existing moorings and/or create any hazards or obstructions to navigation.
Any mooring location which is not utilized by the holder of the mooring authorization therefore, or by an assignee approved by the Harbormaster, for a term of thirty (30) consecutive days during the months of June, July and August of any year shall be declared vacant and shall thereupon be available for reassignment by the Harbormaster except where the holder of the mooring has sent advance written notice to the Harbormaster showing good cause.
5.E) Mooring Precedence for Mooring Locations: The rules contained in this section are intended to comply with the requirements of Title 38 M.R.S.A. Section 3, 7-A, 8 and 11.
33
The Harbormaster shall maintain a chronological list, according to the date and time, of all vessel owners requesting mooring location assignment or reassignment to a new location.
Except as otherwise required by law, the Harbormaster shall assign spaces as they become available from the waiting list in accordance with the following priority guidelines:
a. To shorefront owners who request for one mooring location immediately adjacent to frontage, and who have no other current shorefront moorings, so long as the assignment of such a mooring is practicable and so long as neither the mooring nor any vessel tied to the mooring encroaches upon the federal navigation channels or anchorages or upon the natural channels established by the Board of Selectmen. The assignment of a mooring site under this priority guideline shall not prevent the shorefront owner from receiving additional mooring assignments under the allocation system for other moorings set forth in this ordinance.
Under this provision, a “shorefront owner” is an owner of shore rights of at least I00 contiguous feet of frontage.
b. To resident commercial vessel owners, unless less than IO% of the moorings are currently assigned to non-resident commercial owners, in which case the next mooring available shall be assigned to the first non-resident commercial vessel owner on the list.
c. To resident pleasure vessel owners, unless less than IO% of the moorings are currently assigned to non-resident pleasure vessel owners, in which case the next mooring available shall be assigned to the first non-resident pleasure vessel owner on the list.
d. To non-resident commercial vessel owners.
e. To non-resident pleasure vessel owners.
f. A dedicated continuous run at the end of the Kennebunk River adjacent to Government Wharf running northerly shall be kept specifically for commercial fishing vessels only. (Exhibit A) (06-10-2014)
Future mooring assignments will be on an as available basis in accordance with the chronological listing of requests and the foregoing priority guidelines. These priority guidelines shall not apply to the assignment of moorings located within the area dredged pursuant to the Kennebunk River Federal Navigation Project as delineated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also defined as the Kennebunk River Channel.
34
5.F) Special Rules for Federal Anchorage Areas

Within the area described above (and only within this area) the following rules shall apply:
(1) The priority guidelines under “Mooring Precedence for Mooring Locations” under Section 5.E of this ordinance shall not apply and the Harbormaster shall assign mooring spaces as they become available, from a chronological waiting list, without regard to residency of the applicant.
(2) No priority shall be given to residents if skiff tie-off space becomes overcrowded.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Harbormaster from giving priority to commercial vessel owners in mooring location and skiff tie-off space.

B) Variances shall be granted only upon:
1) a showing of good and sufficient cause; and
2) a determination that should a flood comparable to the base flood occur, the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, public expense or create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and,
118
3) a showing that the issuance of the variance will not cause a conflict with other state, federal or local laws or ordinances; and,

a) that the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is granted; and,
b) that the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood; and,
c) that the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality; and,
d) that the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner.
C) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief, and the Board of Appeals may impose such conditions to a variance as it deems necessary.
D) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction, substantial improvements or other development for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
1) other criteria of Article X and Article VI K are met; and,

119
1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in greatly increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 per $100 of insurance coverage;
2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property; and,
3) the applicant agrees in writing that the applicant is fully aware of all the risks inherent in the use of land subject to flooding, assumes those risks and agrees to indemnify and defend the municipality against any claims filed against it that are related to the applicant's decision to use land located in a floodplain and that the applicant individually releases the municipality from any claims the applicant may have against the municipality that are related to the use of land located in a floodplain.

D) Limitation of Diggers: Since clam resources vary in density and size distribution from year to year and over the limited soft shell clam producing area of the town, it is essential that the town carefully husband its shellfish resources. If, following the annual review of the town's clam resources, its size distribution, abundance, and the warden's reports, as required by Section 3, the Shellfish Committee, in consultation with the DMR area biologist, determines that limiting shellfish licenses for the following year is an appropriate shellfish management option, then it may do so.
The Shellfish Committee will determine the exact time and location of the shellfish beds that will be open for harvest in any given year. The harvesting season will be in the fall, winter and spring months as June, July, August and September shall be excluded. Harvesting may also be limited to Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, with
186
hours beginning one hour before sunrise, and ending one hour after sunset, if the Shellfish Committee so determines.
Three months prior to the opening of the flats for harvesting, the committee shall report its findings and document recommendations for the number of recreational licenses to be made available for the following license-year to the Commissioner of DMR for concurrence. (11-15-05)

The licensee has the right to meet with the Town Clerk during that seven (7) day period to review the evidence of convictions in the Town Clerk’s possession, and to present any evidence showing the licensee does not have the convictions. A third conviction of violations of this Ordinance in the same licensed year will result in forfeiture of the license for the remainder of the licensed year.
I) Opening and Closing of the Flats: The Board of Selectmen, upon the approval of the Commissioner of Marine Resources, may open and close areas for shellfish harvesting. Upon recommendations of the Shellfish Committee, and the DMR area biologist, that the status of shellfish resources and other factors bearing on sound management indicate that an area should be opened or closed, the Board of Selectmen shall call a public hearing, and shall send a copy of the notice to the DMR. The decision of the Board of Selectmen made after the hearing shall be based on findings of fact.
J) Minimum Legal Size of Soft Shell Clams: It is unlawful for any person to possess soft shell clams within the municipality, which are less than two (2) inches in the longest diameter except as provided below.

8.6.4 Storm Drainage Design Standards:
A. Adequate provision shall be made for disposal of all storm water collected in streets and areas tributary to the street system. A storm water management plan shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer in accordance with Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, T.R. 20 or T.R. 55, 1986 edition, published by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, or latest revisions thereof.
1) All storm water systems shall be designed to meet the criteria of a 25 year storm based on rainfall data from weather bureau records for Portland.
2) Appropriate conveyances for outlets to drainage systems must be provided.
3) In any case, the minimum pipe size for any storm drainage pipe shall be 12 inches. Catch basins of an appropriate size and type shall be installed where necessary, and shall be located generally at the curb line. Catch basins shall be placed away from the line of traffic flow, however, shall be adequate in design and strength to accommodate vehicle traffic. Catch basins shall be specifically constructed to accept a granite inlet headstone.

1) Storm drainage pipes shall be one of the following:
- aluminized Type 11 culvert,
- PVC-SDR 35,
- reinforced concrete,
- aluminum pipe.
2) Where the storm drainage pipe is to be covered by ten feet or more of fill material, pipe material shall be PVC SDR 35 or concrete.
3) Where storm drainage pipe may come into contact with salt water, concrete pipes shall be used.
b) Pipe Gauges: Metallic storm drainage pipe shall meet the following thickness requirements depending on pipe diameter:
203
Material
Aluminum/Zinc Coated CMP Inside Diameter Corrugated Aluminum Alloy

42" to 54" 10 ga.
60" to 72" 8 ga.
B. Existing or future downstream drainage requirements shall be studied to determine the effect on proposed drainage. The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board that the storm drainage will not, in any way, overload existing or future storm drainage systems downstream from the proposed street. The drainage requirement for a two, ten and 25 year storm shall be evaluated to determine drainage system needs.
C. For both upstream and downstream drainage, in determining the rate and volume of surface run-off, the following factors must be considered:
1) intensity of rainfall: 25 year design storm;
2) timing of rainfall (e.g. falling on snow or during the spring snow melt);
3) amount of precipitation occurring in the five days preceding the storm in question;
4) hydrologic soil group (i.e. the soil's rate of water infiltration and transmission. The rates for soils are described in the Best Management Practices Handbook, 1991, or latest revision thereof);
5) hydrologic conditions (soil's moisture content humus/organic content, temperature, and whether or not it is frozen);
6) vegetative cover (vegetation helps soil dry out after a rainfall, intercepts some precipitation during the rainfall, and slows down the flow of water over the land);
7) area of land covered by impervious surfaces (roads, sidewalks, roofs, driveways, patios, etc.);
8) topography (slopes affect the rate of run-off; marshland reduces peak discharge rate by slowing down the rate of run-off);
9) size and shape of watershed (peak discharge rates are slower in long, narrow watersheds, and vice versa).
D. An underdrainage system shall be designed and installed to properly drain all springs or areas where the ground water level is within one foot of the bottom of road sub-base and would cause a hazard to the stability of the roadway base. Evidence that water level exceeds the one foot standard ( test hole data) shall be submitted as part of any application which does not include such an underdrainage system.
204
The underdrain shall be a minimum of 6” diameter perforated PVC SDR 35 pipe encapsulated with ¾” crushed stone inside a geotextile fabric. Holes shall be placed down.
E. No storm water shall be permitted to drain across the surface of a street or an intersection.

B. General Construction Requirements:
1) Trenching shall be accomplished in accordance with all appropriate state and federal safety requirements.
2) Drain alignment shall be straight in both horizontal and vertical alignment, unless specific approval of a curvilinear drain is obtained in writing from the Board.
3) Manholes shall be provided at all changes in vertical or horizontal alignment, and at all junctions. In straight runs, manholes shall be placed at a maximum of 300 feet intervals. Catch basins shall be connected to manholes on the main storm drain line. The maximum distance between catch basins and manholes shall be 250 feet.
4) Where necessary, outlets shall be terminated in an endwall of concrete construction, or shall be rip-rapped to prevent erosion, or other appropriate measures taken. Facilities for energy dissipation shall be provided where necessary.
8.6.6 Additional Improvements and Requirements:
A. Erosion Control: An erosion control plan shall be prepared by a professional engineer, licensed in the State of Maine, and designed in accordance with the standards of the Maine Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for Construction: Best Management Practices, March 1991. Procedures shall be undertaken, both during preparatory, construction, and cleanup stages, to prevent soil erosion and water pollution.
B. Cleanup: Following street construction, the developer or contractor shall conduct a thorough cleanup of stumps and other debris from the entire road or street right-of-way. Each catch basin or manhole shall be cleaned of all accumulation of silt and debris and kept clean.
205
C. Street Name, Street Signs, Street Lights: Streets which join and are in alignment with streets of abutting or neighboring properties shall bear the same name. Names of new streets shall not duplicate, nor bear phonetic resemblance to the names of existing streets within the Town, and shall be subject to the approval of the applicable review board. Street name signs and directional signs shall be shown on plans and shall be furnished by the developer. The type, size and location shall be subject to the approval by the Reviewing Board. Street lighting shall be installed as required by the Planning Board or Site Plan Review Board per the applicable plan review and shall be consistent with the Town's street lighting standards.

8.7 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE -
A. Purpose - Performance guarantees shall be provided to ensure the proper installation of required street, utility, storm drainage and other improvements.
B. Submission of Performance Guarantee - Prior to plan approval per the applicable reviewing Board under Section 8.4.1 the applicant shall submit a performance guarantee for an amount adequate to cover the total construction costs of all required improvements. The guarantee shall contain a construction schedule, cost estimates for each phase of construction, provisions for inspections of the construction, provisions for method of release of part or all of the performance guarantee to the developer, and a date after which the developer will be in default and the Town shall have access to the funds to finish construction.
The performance guarantee which is submitted for the Board's approval shall first be reviewed and accepted by the Town Manager. The following types of guarantee are acceptable methods:
1) Certified check payable to the Town for the establishment of an escrow account, but only if the total construction costs are $5,000 or less.
2) Savings account, naming the Town as owner, to be established as an escrow account.
3) Performance bond payable to the Town issued by a surety company.
4) An irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution which establishes funding for the construction of the required improvements, and from which the Town may draw upon if the construction is not completed in conformance with the approved plan.
206
5) A condition of approval requiring 1) that within one (1) year of the date of final plan approval, the developer shall submit to the reviewing Board a performance guarantee that covers the total cost of all required improvements and conforms to the format of 8.7.B.1, 2, 3 or 4 above; and 2) that no conveyance of lots, site disturbance or development and/or issuance of building permits shall occur until such performance guarantee is submitted to and approved by the reviewing Board. A note shall be placed on the final plans listing this condition.
C. Phasing of Development - The Planning Board or Site Plan Review Board may approve plans to develop a major development in separate and distinct phases. This may be accomplished by limiting final approval to those lots, commercial or industrial buildings, abutting that section of the proposed road which is covered by a performance guarantee. When development is phased, road construction shall commence from the public way. Final approval of subsequent phases shall be given only after determining that there has been substantial completion of requirements pertaining to the first and/or previous phase(s) of development.
D. Inspection of Required Improvements - No street construction shall be initiated until the required inspection fee has been submitted to the Town to cover the costs of having each construction stage inspected by the Town's inspection agent (engineer) per the Town's inspection schedule.
E. Release of Guarantee - Prior to the release of any part of the performance guarantee, the applicable Reviewing Board shall determine to its satisfaction, in part upon the inspection report of the Town's Engineer, that the site improvements meet or exceed the design and construction requirements for that portion of the improvements for which the release is requested.
F. Default - If, upon inspection, the Town's Engineer finds that any of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications filed as part of the application, he shall so report in writing to the Code Enforcement Officer, the Municipal Officers, the Reviewing Board and the developer or builder. The Municipal Officers shall take any steps necessary to preserve the Town's rights.
G. Assignment or Transfer - No assignment or transfer of rights to construct the project is valid without prior approval, by the applicable Reviewing Board, of a new performance guarantee to ensure that any assignee or transferee has the financial and technical capacity to complete the project. Should a previously approved performance guarantee become invalid for any reason, the plan approval shall be nullified until such time as a new performance guarantee is approved in the same manner as was originally approved.

Section 5: Manner of Excavating
It shall be unlawful to make such excavation or tunnel in any way contrary to or at variance with the terms of the permit therefore. Proper bracing shall be maintained to prevent the collapse of adjoining ground; and in excavations the excavation shall not have anywhere below the surface any portion which extends beyond the opening at the surface.
No injury shall be done to any pipes, cables or conduits in the making of such excavations or tunnels; and notice shall be given to the persons maintaining any such pipes, cables or conduits or to the municipal department or officer charged with the care thereof, which are or may be injured or affected by the making of any such excavation or tunnel before such pipes, cables or conduits shall be disturbed.
No unnecessary damage or injuries shall be done to any tree or shrub or the root thereof.
Section 6: Sidewalks
If any sidewalk is blocked by any such work, a temporary sidewalk shall be constructed or provided which shall be safe for travel and convenient for users. The temporary sidewalk is
219
subject to inspection by the Public Services Director, and shall not be open for use until approved by him.
Section 7: Restoring Surface
Any person, firm or corporation making any excavation or tunnel in or under any public street, alley or other public place in the Town shall restore the surface to its original condition if there is no pavement there. Backfilled material shall be properly compacted down.
Any opening in a paved or improved portion of a street shall be repaired and the surface replaced by the applicant, in compliance with the Ordinances of the Town, including this Ordinance, and under the supervision of the Public Services Director.
Section 8: Surfacing Materials
8.1 Parallel or Diagonal street openings in excess of ten feet in width or twenty feet in length; also Cross or Right Angle openings in excess of twenty feet in width (Amended 04-22-85): The hot topping for these openings shall consist of 2 1/2 inches of binder or base mix, or thickness equivalent to the existing pavement, whichever is greater, confined within the limit of the opening. The full width of the paved street or sidewalk to a point 20 feet beyond the end of the opening and 20 feet prior to the beginning of the opening will be overlaid with not less than 1 inch of the surface mix.
8.2 Cross or Right Angle street openings twenty feet or less in width: The hot topping for these openings shall consist of 2 1/2 inches of binder or base mix, or thickness equal to the existing pavement, whichever is greater, confined within the opening limits, plus 1 inch of surface mix raised slightly above the existing street or sidewalk surface to allow for settling. Openings wider than 20 feet will fall within the preceding paragraph, and resurfacing of those openings shall comply with those provisions.
All hot top paving contractors shall be approved in writing by the Public Services Director prior to beginning work.
All hot top paving shall be completed within 14 days following the final day of backfill.
Section 9: Supervision
The Public Services Director shall from time to time inspect or cause to be inspected, all excavations and tunnels being made in or under any public street, alley or other public place in the Town to see to the enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance. Notice shall be given to him at least 10 hours before the work of refilling any such tunnel or excavation commences.
220
Section 10: Protective Measures & Routing of Traffic
It shall be the duty of every person, firm or corporation cutting or making an excavation in or upon any public place, to place and maintain barriers and warning devices necessary for the safety of the general public. The Selectmen may restrict the use of lanterns or open flame devices in fire hazard areas.
The permittee shall take appropriate measures to assure that during the performance of excavation work, traffic conditions as near normal as possible shall be maintained at all times so as to minimize inconvenience to the occupants of the adjoining property and to the general public.
When traffic conditions permit, the Selectmen may, by written approval, permit the closing of streets and alleys to all traffic for a period of time prescribed by them, if in their opinion that is necessary. Such written approval may require that the permittee give notification to various public agencies and to the general public. In such cases, such written approval shall not be valid until such notice is given.
Warning signs shall be placed far enough in advance of the construction operation to alert traffic within a public street, and cones or other approved devices shall be placed to channel traffic, in accordance with the instructions of the Public Services Director.
Section 11: Relocation and Protection of Utilities
The permittee shall not interfere with any existing facility without the written consent of the Selectmen and the owner of the facility. If it becomes necessary to relocate an existing facility this shall be done by its owner. No facility owned by the Town shall be moved to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such work is borne by the permittee. The cost of moving privately owned facilities shall be similarly borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements with the person owning the facility. The permittee shall support and protect by timbers or otherwise pipes, conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by the excavation work, and do everything necessary to support, sustain and protect them under, over, along or across said work. The permittee shall secure approval of method of support and protection from the owner of the facility. In case any of said pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should be damaged, and for this purpose pipe coating or other encasement or devices are to be considered as part of a substructure, the permittee shall promptly notify the owners thereof, All damaged facilities shall be repaired by the agency or person owning them and the expense of such repairs shall be charged to the permittee. It is the intent of this paragraph that the permittee shall assume all liability for damage to facilities and any resulting damage or injury to anyone because of such facility damage and such assumption of liability is a contractual obligation of the permittee. The only exception will be such instances where damage is exclusively due to the negligence of the owning utility. The Town shall not be made a party to any action because of this section. The permittee shall inform itself as to the existence and location of all underground facilities and protect the same against damage.
221
Section 12: Abandonment of Substructures
Whenever the use of a substructure is abandoned, except the abandonment of service lines designed to serve single properties, the person owning, using, controlling, or having an interest therein, shall within 30 days after such abandonment file with the Public Services Director a statement in writing giving in detail the location of the substructure so abandoned. If such abandoned substructure is in the way, or subsequently becomes in the way, of an installation of the Town or any other public body, which installation is pursuant to a governmental function, the owners shall remove such abandoned substructures or pay the cost of its removal during the course of excavation or construction of the facility by the Town or any other public body.
Section 13: Protection of Adjoining Property
The permittee shall at all times and at his or its own expense preserve and protect from injury any adjoining property by providing proper foundations and taking other measures suitable for the purpose. Where in the protection of such property it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purpose of taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall obtain consent from the owner of such private property for such purpose. The permittee shall, at its own expense shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property likely to be damaged during the progress of the excavation work and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private property or highways resulting from its failure properly to protect and carry out said work. Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through any lawn area said area shall be reseeded or the sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been backfilled as required by this Ordinance. All construction and maintenance work shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to that which existed before such work began. The permittee shall not remove, even temporarily, any trees or shrubs which exist in parking strip areas without first obtaining the consent of the appropriate Town department or Town official having supervision of such property.
Section 14: Placement of Excavated Material
All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench or in any street shall be piled, and maintained in such manner as not to endanger those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets and adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as might be the case in a narrow alley, the Selectmen shall have the authority to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a storage site and then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling. It shall be the permittee's responsibility to secure the necessary permission and make all necessary arrangements for all required storage and disposal sites.
222
Section 15: Clean Up
As the excavation work progresses, all streets shall be thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris resulting from such work. All clean up operations at the location of such excavation shall be accomplished at the expense of the permittee and shall be completed to the satisfaction of the Public Services Director. From time to time, as may be ordered by the Public Services Director and in any event immediately after completion of said work, the permittee shall, at his or its own expense, clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of any kind resulting from said work, and upon failure to do so within twenty-four hours after having been notified to do so by the Public Services Director, said work may be done by the Public Services Director and the cost thereof charged to the permittee, and the permittee shall also be liable for the cost thereof under the surety bond provided hereunder.
Section 16: Protection of Watercourses
The permittee shall maintain all gutters free and unobstructed for the full depth of the adjacent curb and for at least one foot in width from the face of such curb at the gutter line. Whenever a gutter crosses an intersecting street, an adequate waterway shall be provided and at all time maintained.
The permittee shall make provisions to take care of all surplus water, muck, silt, slickings, or other run-off pumped from excavations or resulting from sluicing or other operations and shall be responsible for any damage resulting from its failure to so provide.
Section 17: Breaking Through Pavement
1) Pavement will, as a general rule, be cut only with pavement breaker blades or pavement saws. The Selectmen, Public Services Director or Town Manager may, if they feel a particular project justifies it, authorize the use of different equipment in specific cases.
2) Heavy duty pavement breakers may be prohibited by the Selectmen when the use endangers existing substructures or other property.
3) Saw cutting of Portland cement concrete may be required when the nature of the work or the condition of the street warrants. When required, the depth of the cut shall be not less than one inch. Depths greater than one inch may be required by the Public Services Director when circumstances warrant. Saw cutting may be required by the Public Services Director outside of the limits of the excavation over cave-outs, over-breaks and small floating sections.
4) Approved cutting of bituminous pavement surface ahead of excavations may be required by the Public Services Director to confine pavement damage to the limits of the trench.
223
5) Sections of sidewalks shall be removed to the nearest score line or joint.
6) Unstable pavement shall be removed over cave-outs and over-breaks and the subgrade shall be treated as the main trench.
7) Pavement edges shall be trimmed to a vertical face and neatly aligned with the centerline of the trench.
8) Cutouts outside of the trench lines must be normal or parallel to the trench line.
9) Boring or other methods to prevent cutting of new pavement may be required by the Public Services Director.

Fine material, free from lumps and stone, selected from the spoil shall be thoroughly compacted around and under the substructure to the upper level of such substructure. Above the upper level of the substructure, backfill material shall be placed to the subgrade of the pavement in lifts consistent with the type of soil involved and the degree of consolidation specified by the Public Services Director. Broken pavement, large stones over three inches in diameter, roots and other debris and peat-type material shall not be used in the backfill. The backfill material will be placed in one foot lifts with each lift compacted with compaction equipment approved by the Public Services Director. The last eighteen inches of backfill material will be placed in three six-inch lifts. Each lift being compacted with the same approved equipment used on the lower layers. Backfilled material is generally required to be 95% compacted. Exceptions to this rule may be made by the Public Services Director when, in his judgment, this is warranted by the nature of a specific project. Such backfill shall be done in a manner that will permit the restoration of the surface to a density condition not less than that existing prior to excavation unless otherwise specified. The Public Services Director may require soil tests to be furnished by a recognized soil testing laboratory or registered professional engineer specializing in soil mechanics when, in his opinion, backfill for any excavation is not being adequately compacted. In order for the resurfacing to be permitted, such tests must show that the backfill material meets the minimum requirements as prescribed by the Selectmen. All expense of such tests shall be borne by the permittee.
Section 19: Prompt Completion of Work
After an excavation is commenced, the permittee shall prosecute with diligence and expedition all excavation work covered by the excavation permit and shall promptly complete such work and restore the street to its original condition, or as near as may be so as not to obstruct the public place or travel thereon more than is reasonable necessary.
224
Section 20: Urgent Work
When traffic conditions, the safety or convenience of the traveling public or public interest require that the excavation work be performed as emergency work the Selectmen shall have full power to order, at the time the permit is granted, that a crew of men and adequate facilities be employed by the permittee twenty-four hours a day to the end that such excavation work may be completed as soon as possible.
Section 21: Emergency Action
Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent the making of such excavations as may be necessary in emergency situations for the preservation of life or property, provided that the person making such excavation shall apply for such a permit on the first working day after such work is commenced.
Section 22: Noise, Dust and Debris
Each permittee shall conduct and carry out excavation work in such manner as to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and annoyance to the general public and occupants of neighboring property. The permittee shall take appropriate measures to reduce to the fullest extent practicable in the performance of the excavation work, noise, dust and unsightly debris and between the hours of 8 PM and 7 AM shall not use, except in case of emergency as herein otherwise provided, any tool, appliance or equipment producing noise of sufficient volume to disturb the sleep or repose of occupants of the neighboring property.

In addition, the applicant is responsible for having someone at the site walk who clearly
understands the site flagging. It is recommended that the person responsible for setting the flags
actually be present at the site walk, especially in the case of wetlands which have been flagged.
E. Additional Sketch Plan meeting. If the Sketch Plan submitted is significantly different than what
the zoning would permit or what exists out at the site, then the Planning Board may require that
the applicant submit a revised Sketch Plan which more accurately represents the site conditions
and/or zoning standards.
5.2 Submissions
The Sketch Plan submission shall consist of the following:
A. Completed application form.
B. Ten (10) copies of a sketch of the proposed parcel to be divided drawn to a sufficient scale to
demonstrate concept but not greater than 1"=100' and showing:

PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE
12.1 Purpose- Performance guarantees shall be provided to ensure the proper installation of required street,
utility, storm drainage and other improvements.
12.2 Submission of Performance Guarantee- Prior to plan approval under Article 8.4, the applicant shall
submit a performance guarantee for an amount adequate to cover the total construction costs of all
required improvements. The guarantee shall contain a construction schedule, cost estimates for each
phase of construction, provisions for inspections of the construction, provisions for method of release
of part or all of the performance guarantee to the developer, and a date after which the developer will
be in default and the Town shall have access to the funds to finish construction.
The performance guarantee shall be submitted to and approved by the Town Manager. The following
types of guarantee are acceptable:
1) Certified check payable to the Town for the establishment of an escrow account, but only if the
total construction costs are $5,000 or less.
2) Savings account, naming the Town as owner, to be established as an escrow account.
3) Performance bond payable to the Town issued by a surety company.
4) An irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution which establishes funding for the
construction of the required improvements and from which the Town may draw upon if the
construction is not completed in conformance with the approved plan.
5) A condition of approval requiring (1) that within one year of the date of final plan approval the
developer shall submit to the Town Manager a performance guarantee that covers the total cost
of all required improvements and conforms to the requirements of 12.2.1, 2, 3 or 4 above and (2)
that no conveyance of lots, site disturbance or development, and/or issuance of building permits
shall occur until such performance guarantee is submitted to and approved by the Town
Manager. A note shall be placed on the final plans indicating that they were approved subject to
this condition.
12.3 Phasing of Development - The Planning Board may approve plans to develop a major development
in separate and distinct phases. This may be accomplished by limiting final approval to those lots,
commercial or industrial buildings, abutting that section of the proposed road which is covered by a
performance guarantee. When development is phased, road construction shall commence from the
public way. Final approval of subsequent phases shall be given only after determining that there has
been substantial completion of requirements pertaining to the first and/or previous phase(s) of
development.
12.4 Inspection of Required Improvements- No street construction shall be initiated until the required
inspection fee has been submitted to the Town to cover the costs of having each construction stage
inspected by the Town's inspection agent (engineer) per the Town's inspection schedule.
12.5 Release of Guarantee - Prior to the release of any part of the performance guarantee, the Town
Manager shall determine to his satisfaction, in part upon the inspection report of the Town's Engineer,
that the site improvements meet or exceed the design and construction requirements for that portion of
36
the improvements for which the release is requested. Also upon completion of the required
improvements and prior to release of the final 10% of the performance guarantee, the applicant shall
file a (1) year defect/maintenance bond in the amount of 10% of the performance guarantee. The
defect/maintenance bond shall ensure the workmanship and durability of all materials used in the
construction of the required site improvements which may become defective within one (1) year
period.
12.6 Default- If, upon inspection, the Town's Engineer finds that any of the required improvements have
not been constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications filed as part of the application,
s/he shall so report in writing to the Code Enforcement Officer, the Board of Selectmen, the Planning
Board and the developer or contractor. The Board of Selectmen shall take any steps necessary to
preserve the Town's rights.
12.7 Assignment or Transfer - No assignment or transfer of rights to construct the project is valid without
prior approval, by the Town Manager, of a new performance guarantee to ensure that any assignee or
transferee has the financial and technical capacity to complete the project. Should a previously
approved performance guarantee become invalid for any reason, the plan approval shall be nullified
until such time as a new performance guarantee is approved in the same manner as was originally
approved.

standards, the Planning Board shall determine that the following criteria are satisfied and shall specify
the length of any extension granted:
13.2.1 The need for an extension is beyond the applicant's control because the application has been
held up by another review agency. The applicant shall provide the necessary documentation,
from the responsible agency, indicating the reason for the delay.
13.2.2 The extension request was made prior to expiration of the deadline sought t o be extended.
13.2.3 The applicant has diligently been attempting to eliminate the cause of delay.
If 13.2.1 is not the reason for delay, the Planning Board shall determine that the criteria of
13.2.4 noted below is met in addition to the criteria of 13.2.2 and 13.2.3 above.
13.2.4 Substantive amendments which would prohibit development of the project as proposed, have
not been made to the Zoning Ordinance, the Comprehensive Plan, or these subdivision
standards, since submission of the preliminary application.
13.2.5 The Board shall not grant more than two (2) six month extensions.
13.3 Where the Planning Board finds that, due to special circumstances of a particular Plan, the provision
of certain required improvements is not requisite in the interest of public health, safety, and general
welfare, or is inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities adjacent or in
proximity to the proposed subdivision, it may waive such requirements, subject to appropriate
conditions.
13.4 In granting variances and modifications, the Planning Board shall require such conditions as will, in its
judgment, secure substantially the objectives or the requirements so varied or modified.
13.5 In all instances, the burden of proof is on the applicant to document and provide justification for
waivers/variances requested.
13.6 All variances/waivers which are granted shall be noted on the face of the subdivision plan.

-Maine Turnpike
-Route One
B. Collector Street: A street with average daily traffic of over 250 vehicles per day, or a street serving
as a feeder to an arterial and as a collector of traffic from minor streets. Streets classified under this
category shall be further classified as either "rural" or "growth", based upon the guidelines of the
Town's Comprehensive Plan.
C. Minor Street: A minor street shall be defined as a street which generally serves to carry the least
amount of traffic at the lowest speeds. It is also intended to provide a safe environment for
residential neighborhoods. No minor street (or street section if it has more than one street
connection) shall have an ADT greater than 250. Streets classified under this category shall be
further classified as either "rural" or "growth", based upon the guidelines of the Town's
Comprehensive Plan.

as measured along the road onto which traffic will be turning, shall conform to the table below.
Sight distance shall be measured from an eye point located 15 feet behind the edge of traveled
way at an elevation of 3.5 feet above the finished grade surface to a height of object of 4.25 feet
above the pavement in the centerline of the travel lane approaching the intersection. Where
unavoidable obstructions are encountered at the 15 foot setback, the point of eye may be moved
to a point no closer than 10 feet from the traveled way. If the special conditions of the site or of
the use so warrant, the Board may require such additional sight distance as will enhance safety.

8.6.4 Storm Drainage Design Standards:
A. Adequate provision shall be made for disposal of all storm water collected in streets and areas
tributary to the street system. A storm water management plan shall be prepared by a registered
professional engineer in accordance with Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, T.R. 20 or T.R.
55, 1986 edition, published by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, or latest revisions thereof.
1) All storm water systems shall be designed to meet the criteria of a 25 year storm based on
rainfall data from weather bureau records for Portland.
2) Appropriate conveyances for outlets to drainage systems must be provided.
3) In any case, the minimum pipe size for any storm drainage pipe shall be 12 inches. Catch basins
of an appropriate size and type shall be installed where necessary, and shall be located generally
at the curb line. Catch basins shall be placed away from the line of traffic flow, however, shall
be adequate in design and strength to accommodate vehicle traffic. Catch basins shall be
specifically constructed to accept a granite inlet headstone.
a) Materials:
1) Storm drainage pipes shall be one of the following:
47
- aluminized Type 11 culvert,
- PVC-SDR 35,
- reinforced concrete,
- aluminum pipe.
2) Where the storm drainage pipe is to be covered by ten feet or more of fill material, pipe
material shall be PVC SDR 35 or concrete.
3) Where storm drainage pipe may come into contact with salt water, concrete pipes shall be
used.
b) Pipe Gauges: Metallic storm drainage pipe shall meet the following thickness requirements
depending on pipe diameter:
Material
Aluminum/Zinc Coated CMP
Inside Diameter Corrugated Aluminum Alloy
15” to 24" 14 ga.
30" to 36" 12 ga.
42" to 54" 10 ga.
60" to 72" 8 ga.
B. Existing or future downstream drainage requirements shall be studied to determine the effect on
proposed drainage. The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board that the storm
drainage will not, in any way, overload existing or future storm drainage systems downstream from
the proposed street. The drainage requirement for a two, ten and 25 year storm shall be evaluated to
determine drainage system needs.
C. For both upstream and downstream drainage, in determining the rate and volume of surface run-off,
the following factors must be considered:
1) intensity of rainfall: 25 year design storm;
2) timing of rainfall (e.g. falling on snow or during the spring snow melt);
3) amount of precipitation occurring in the five days preceding the storm in question;
4) hydrologic soil group (i.e. the soil's rate of water infiltration and transmission. The rates for soils
are described in the Best Management Practices Handbook, 1991, or latest revision thereof);
5) hydrologic conditions (soil's moisture content humus/organic content, temperature, and whether
or not it is frozen);
6) vegetative cover (vegetation helps soil dry out after a rainfall, intercepts some precipitation
during the rainfall, and slows down the flow of water over the land);
7) area of land covered by impervious surfaces (roads, sidewalks, roofs, driveways, patios, etc.);
8) topography (slopes affect the rate of run-off; marshland reduces peak discharge rate by slowing
down the rate of run-off);
9) size and shape of watershed (peak discharge rates are slower in long, narrow watersheds, and
vice versa).
D. An underdrainage system shall be designed and installed to properly drain all springs or areas where
the ground water level is within one foot of the bottom of road sub-base and would cause a hazard to
48
the stability of the roadway base. Evidence that water level exceeds the one foot standard ( test hole
data) shall be submitted as part of any application which does not include such an underdrainage
system.
The underdrain shall be a minimum of 6” diameter perforated PVC SDR 35 pipe encapsulated with
¾” crushed stone inside a geotextile fabric. Holes shall be placed down.
E. No storm water shall be permitted to drain across the surface of a street or an intersection.
8.6.5 Storm Drainage Construction Standards:
A. All storm drain construction shall be in conformity with State of Maine Specifications for Highways
and Bridges, revision 1990, or latest revisions thereof.
B. General Construction Requirements:
1) Trenching shall be accomplished in accordance with all appropriate state and federal safety
requirements.
2) Drain alignment shall be straight in both horizontal and vertical alignment, unless specific
approval of a curvilinear drain is obtained in writing from the Board.
3) Manholes shall be provided at all changes in vertical or horizontal alignment, and at all
junctions. In straight runs, manholes shall be placed at a maximum of 300 feet intervals. Catch
basins shall be connected to manholes on the main storm drain line. The maximum distance
between catch basins and manholes shall be 250 feet.
4) Where necessary, outlets shall be terminated in an endwall of concrete construction, or shall be
rip-rapped to prevent erosion, or other appropriate measures taken. Facilities for energy
dissipation shall be provided where necessary.
8.6.6 Additional Improvements and Requirements:
A. Erosion Control: An erosion control plan shall be prepared by a professional engineer, licensed in
the State of Maine, and designed in accordance with the standards of the Maine Erosion and
Sediment Control Handbook for Construction: Best Management Practices, March 1991.
Procedures shall be undertaken, both during preparatory, construction, and cleanup stages, to prevent
soil erosion and water pollution.
B. Cleanup: Following street construction, the developer or contractor shall conduct a thorough
cleanup of stumps and other debris from the entire road or street right-of-way. Each catch basin or
manhole shall be cleaned of all accumulation of silt and debris and kept clean.
C. Street Name, Street Signs, Street Lights: Streets which join and are in alignment with streets of
abutting or neighboring properties shall bear the same name. Names of new streets shall not
duplicate, nor bear phonetic resemblance to the names of existing streets within the Town, and shall
be subject to the approval of the applicable review board. Street name signs and directional signs
shall be shown on plans and shall be furnished by the developer. The type, size and location shall
be subject to the approval by the Reviewing Board. Street lighting shall be installed as required by
the Planning Board or Site Plan Review Board per the applicable plan review and shall be consistent
with the Town's street lighting standards.
49
D. Utilities, where available, shall be installed prior to the street construction phase so as to avoid reexcavation
of the finished street.
8.7 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE
A. Purpose - Performance guarantees shall be provided to ensure the proper installation of required
street, utility, storm drainage and other improvements.
B. Submission of Performance Guarantee - Prior to plan approval per the applicable reviewing Board
under Section 8.4.1 the applicant shall submit a performance guarantee for an amount adequate to
cover the total construction costs of all required improvements. The guarantee shall contain a
construction schedule, cost estimates for each phase of construction, provisions for inspections of the
construction, provisions for method of release of part or all of the performance guarantee to the
developer, and a date after which the developer will be in default and the Town shall have access to
the funds to finish construction.
The performance guarantee which is submitted for the Board's approval shall first be reviewed and
accepted by the Town Manager. The following types of guarantee are acceptable methods:
1) Certified Check payable to the Town or a savings account naming the Town as owner, for the
establishment of an escrow account.
2) Performance Bond payable to the Town issued by a surety company.
3) An irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution which establishes funding for the
construction of the required improvements, and from which the Town may draw upon if the
construction is not completed in conformance with the approved plan.
4) Conditional (one year) plan approval stipulating that there shall be no conveyance of lots or
issuance of building permits until a performance guarantee covering the total cost of all required
improvements, and conforming to the format of 8.7.B.1, 2, or 3 above, is submitted to the
Reviewing Board and approved. A note shall be placed on the final plans listing this condition.
C. Phasing of Development - The Planning Board or Site Plan Review Board may approve plans to
develop a major development in separate and distinct phases. This may be accomplished by limiting
final approval to those lots, commercial or industrial buildings, abutting that section of the proposed
road which is covered by a performance guarantee. When development is phased, road construction
shall commence from the public way. Final approval of subsequent phases shall be given only after
determining that there has been substantial completion of requirements pertaining to the first and/or
previous phase(s) of development.
D. Inspection of Required Improvements - No street construction shall be initiated until the required
inspection fee has been submitted to the Town to cover the costs of having each construction stage
inspected by the Town's inspection agent (engineer) per the Town's inspection schedule.
50
E. Release of Guarantee - Prior to the release of any part of the performance guarantee, the applicable
Reviewing Board shall determine to its satisfaction, in part upon the inspection report of the Town's
Engineer, that the site improvements meet or exceed the design and construction requirements for
that portion of the improvements for which the release is requested.
F. Default - If, upon inspection, the Town's Engineer finds that any of the required improvements have
not been constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications filed as part of the application,
he shall so report in writing to the Code Enforcement Officer, the Municipal Officers, the Reviewing
Board and the developer or builder. The Municipal Officers shall take any steps necessary to
preserve the Town's rights.
G. Assignment or Transfer - No assignment or transfer of rights to construct the project is valid without
prior approval, by the applicable Reviewing Board, of a new performance guarantee to ensure that
any assignee or transferee has the financial and technical capacity to complete the project. Should a
previously approved performance guarantee become invalid for any reason, the plan approval shall
be nullified until such time as a new performance guarantee is approved in the same manner as was
originally approved.
8.8 VARIANCES AND WAIVERS:
1. The Planning Board or Site Plan Review Board may, as part of their review and approval of a plan,
vary/waive certain street design and construction standards in conformance with the variance/waiver
provisions of Article 13 of the Subdivision Review Regulations or Article 11, Section 9 of the
Zoning Ordinance, as applicable. Such variances/waivers shall not assure eligibility for the
petitioning or acceptance of such street as a Town Way.
2. Any variance/waiver of the provisions of this ordinance which is part of a petition for acceptance of
street as a Town Way shall be decided by the Board of Selectmen and shall conform to the standards
of Section 8.8.2.A and 2.B below.
A. Where extraordinary and unnecessary hardships would result, or due to the special circumstances
of the site, certain requirements of this ordinance may be varied or waived by the Board of
Selectmen based upon the following criteria:
1) The requested variance/waiver shall have been previously reviewed and approved by the
Planning Board (if the street is part of a subdivision plan review) or by the Site Plan Review
Board (if the street is part of a site plan review). Such approval shall specifically address the
impact of the requested variance/waiver upon: the safe functioning of the street, the long
term costs of maintaining the street, and the Town's ability to provide public services along
the street.
2) The required thickness of pavement shall not be reduced, and
3) A report from the Town's Highway Superintendent and Town's Consulting Engineer
concerning the expected performance of the street (per the criteria listed in subsection A.1.
above) if the variance/waiver is granted.
B. In granting such variances/waivers, the Board of Selectmen shall require such conditions, as will,
in its judgement secure the objectives of Section 8.2 of these standards and of the requirement(s)
so varied or waived.
51
8.9 APPEAL: Any person aggrieved by a decision or failure to act of the Board of Selectmen, Planning
Board or Site Plan Review Board, pursuant to this ordinance, may appeal to York County Superior
Court within 30 days of such decision or refusal to issue a decision.
8.10 SEVERABILITY: The invalidity of any section or provision of this ordinance shall not be held to
invalidate any other section or provision of this ordinance.
8.11 REPEAL: All provisions of the Street Design and Construction Standards Ordinance, 1977, as
amended 1988, and of the street standards of the Planning Board Standards for Reviewing Land
Subdivisions, 1977, as amended, and of other prior ordinances of the Town that are inconsistent with

Where so indicated by the text, these definitions also include substantive regulations. Also, whenever the symbol (SZ) is shown, the definition applies to Shoreland Zoning only.

Section 2.  Definitions

ABUTTING PROPERTY: Any lot which is physically contiguous with the lot in question even if only at a point and any lot which is located directly across a street or right-of-way. In the case of a condominium development, the condominium association will be considered the owner of abutting property for purposes of notice under this ordinance.

ACCESSORY APARTMENT: An apartment created by converting part of an existing single family detached dwelling or accessory building into a separate dwelling unit containing not more than 650 square feet of total space. See also the performance standards of Article 10, Section 15.

ACCESSORY BUILDING: A detached, subordinate building, the use of which is clearly incidental and related to that of the principal building or use of the land, and which is located on the same lot as that of the principal building or use.

ACCESSORY USE: A use clearly incidental and subordinate to a principal building or use allowed in the district in which it is located, and located on the same lot with such principal building or use. A small wind energy system that meets the requirements of Article 10, Sections 21 of this Ordinance shall be allowed as an accessory use if it primarily produces electrical power for consumption on the same lot or on an  adjacent lot under the same ownership as the principal use that will be the primary consumer of the generated electrical power. Parking lots which serve uses permitted in the district need not be located on the same lot as those principal uses; however, such lots shall be reviewed under the minor or major site plan review process, as applicable.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING: Decent, safe and sanitary dwelling units that can be afforded by households with annual incomes no greater than 120% of the median household income in non-metropolitan York County, as established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. A renter-occupied unit is affordable to such households if the unit's monthly housing costs, including rent and basic utility costs (the costs of heating and of supplying electricity to the unit plus the cost, if any, of supplying public water and public wastewater disposal service to the unit), do not exceed 30% of gross monthly income. An owner-occupied unit is affordable to such households if its price results in monthly housing costs that do not exceed 28% of gross monthly income for principal, interest, insurance, and real estate taxes. Estimates of mortgage payments are to be based on down payments and rates of interest generally available in the area to low and moderate income households.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING COVENANT: Any agreement among one or more owners, one or more tenants of residential real estate and one or more qualified holders, or between one or more owners and one or more qualified holders, or between one or more tenants and one or more qualified holders, that permits a qualified holder to control, either directly or indirectly, the purchase price of residential housing for the primary purpose of providing that the housing remains affordable to lower income and moderate-income households.

39
40	When a lot is divided by a zoning district boundary, the regulations set forth in this Ordinance
41	applying to the portion of such lot which is larger in area may be deemed to govern the smaller

12	District, the affected  land  shall be governed  by the regulations applicable in the zoning district
13	which  was  in  place  prior  to  the  effective  date  of this  amendment,  and  if applicable,  by  the
14	regulations of the Shoreland Overlay District.  The Notice of Map Correction shall be recorded in
15	the office of the Town Clerk and may be recorded by the applicant in the Registry of Deeds.
16
17	A map correction under this section shall constitute administrative action by the Planning Board
18	and shall not constitute a rezoning or an amendment to the Town of Kennebunk Shoreland Zoning

nonconforming  than the prior nonconforming  building or use.   Nothing  in this section shall prevent the demolition of the remains of any building so damaged or destroyed.

(2)		Notwithstanding  paragraph (I) above, in the Coastal Residential District, nonconforming business establishments, which are damaged by fire, hurricane, or other force majeure, or which  are proposed  to be remodeled  to modernize,  may be rebuilt or remodeled  only within the location of their existing foundation or building footprint and at or below their original height.  To retain its nonconforming  status, construction  or reconstruction must begin within two (2) years after destruction or other injury or damage to the previously existing nonconforming  business  establishment  and must  be completed  within  five (5) years  from  the  date  of  such  destruction,  damage,  or  other  injury;  or,  in  the  case  of remodeling with the intention of modernizing the facility, such remodeling must be completed   within  three  (3)  years  after  remodeling  begins;  provided   that  all  work performed pursuant to this paragraph shall comply with all other applicable requirements of this Ordinance.

Section 6.	Nonconformities in the Branch Brook Aquifer Pmtection (BB) District

A.	Extension or expansion of nonconforming uses in the BB District is not permissible by variance or otherwise, unless provided for herein:

(l)	Expansion of a nonconforming one-family home which increases discharge to a wastewater disposal system in Zone A requires the approval of the Board of Appeals. Approval shall be granted only ifthe applicant shows that the expansion:

(a)	meets the criteria of review listed in Atiicle 7, Section 3(C), and

(b)	the expansion will not create a discharge which exceeds the design capacity of the wastewater disposal system.

(2)	Expansion of a nonconforming commercial or industrial facility within the district requires the approval of the Board of Appeals.  Approval shall be granted only ifthe expansion:

(a)	meets the criteria of review listed in Article 7, Section 3(C);

(b)	will not create a discharge which exceeds the design capacity of the wastewater disposal system; and

(c)	is limited to the lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of the BB district on which the use is located.

B.	A nonconforming use of a structure, building, or prope1ty may be changed to another nonconforming use by appeal to the Board of Appeals ifthe applicant can prove that the proposed new use will be less detrimental to the BB District than the prior use.

C.	Any single lot of record existing legally on the effective date of the BB District and lying totally within Zone A may have one one-family dwelling and one wastewater disposal system located on it providing the landowner secures a use variance from the Board of Appeals, and providing this use variance conforms with all other applicable local and State laws and  regulations.  The applicant must produce proof from the Registry of Deeds that the lot existed and was recorded prior to the effective date of the amendment creating the BB District.
 
A1iicle 5, Page 5
Sections 6A and 7


D.	Nonconforming uses of "limited" or "restricted" use herbicides or pesticides require a permit from the Hazardous Materials Control Board. The applicant shall submit the information required in Section 20 of Article 8 to the Hazardous  Materials Control Board. The Hazardous Materials Control Board may approve the permit with conditions if conditions are necessary to ensure that continued use will not cause a violation of the performance standard for pollution levels.

Section 6.A   Nonconformities in the Resource Protection Zone

Any single-family strncture in the Resource Protection District that is nonconforming as to the maximum ground floor area established by Article 7, Section 1.(8)(e) due to its lawful existence prior to the enactment of that section may be expanded vertically, provided that such expansion does not exceed the maximum height allowed in that district. No increase in the footprint of such a strncture shall be allowed.

Section  7.  Nonconformities in the Shorelaml Zone

A.	Purpose. It is the intent of this Ordinance to promote land use conformities, except that non­ conforming conditions that existed before the effective date of this Ordinance or amendments thereto shall be allowed to continue, subject to the requirements set forth in Section 7. Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, a non-conforming condition shall not be permitted to become more non-conforming.

B.	General

(1)	Transfer of Ownership. Non-conforming strnctures, lots, and uses may be transferred, and the new owner may continue the non-conforming use or continue to use the non­ conforming slrncture or lot, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance.

(2)	Repair and Maintenance. This Ordinance allows the normal upkeep and maintenance of non-conforming uses and strnctures including repairs or renovations that do not involve expansion of the non-conforming use or sll'llclure, and such other changes in  a non­ conforming use or stl'llcture as federal, state, or local building and safety codes may require.

C.	Non-conforming Stmctures

(I)	Expansions. A non-conforming stl'llclure may be added to or expanded after obtaining a permit from the same permitting authority as that for a new strncture, if such addition or expansion does not increase the non-conformity of the strncture and is in accordance with Section 6.A above and subparagraphs (a) and (b) below.

(a)	After January I, 1989 if any po1tion of a structure is less than the required setback from the normal high-water line of a water body or tributary stream or the upland edge of a wetland, that portion of the structure shall not be expanded, as measured in floor area or volume, by 30% or more, during the lifetime of the structure. If a replacement strncture conforms with the requirements of Section 7(C)(3), and is less than the required setback from a water body, tributmy stream or wetland, the replacement structure may not be expanded if the original structure existing on January I, 1989 had been expanded by 30% in floor area and volume since that date.
 
A1ticle 5, Page 6
Sections 7



(b)	Whenever a new, enlarged, or replacement foundation is constructed under a non­ conforming structure, the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Planning Board (or Site Plan Review Board in the case of a site plan application), basing it's decision on the criteria specified in Section 7(C)(2) Relocation, below. If the completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure, except for expansion in conformity with Section 7(C)(l )(a) above, and the foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three (3) additional feet, as measured  from the uphill side of the strncture (from original ground level to the bottom of the first floor sill), it shall not be considered to be an expansion of the structure.

(2)	Relocation. A non-conforming strncture may be relocated within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all shoreland setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Applicable Review Board, and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of State law and the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules (Rules), or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said Rules. In no case shall a strncture be relocated in a manner that causes the strncture to be more non-conforming.

In determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent, the Applicable Review Board shall consider the size of the lot, the slope of the land, the potential for soil erosion, the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties, the location of the septic system and other on-site soils suitable for septic systems, and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation. When it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure, the Applicable Review Board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation. In addition, the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation. Replanting shall be required as follows:

(a)	Trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree, minimum 2" dbh, for every tree removed. If more than five trees are planted, no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted. Replaced trees must be planted no further from the  water or wetland than the trees that were removed.

Other woody and herbaceous vegetation, and ground cover, that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a strncture must be re-es,tablished. An area at least the same size as the area where vegetation and/or ground cover was disturbed, damaged, or removed must be reestablished within the setback area. The vegetation and/or ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation and/or ground cover that was disturbed, destroyed or removed.

(b)	Where feasible, when a strncture is relocated on a parcel the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses, shrubs, trees, or a combination thereof.

(3)	Reconstrnction  or Replacement.  Any non-conforming  structure which  is located  less than the required setback from a water body, tributary stream, or wetland  and which is
 

removed, or damaged or destroyed, regardless of the cause, by more than 50% of the market value of the structure before such damage, destruction or removal, may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within eighteen (18) months of the date of said damage, destruction, or removal, and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the water body, tributary stream or wetland setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the Applicable Review Board in accordance with the purposes of this Ordinance. In no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its non-conformity. If the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure, except as allowed pmsuant to Section 7(C)(l) above, as determined by the non-conforming floor area and volume of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location. Tfthe total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated 01· reconstructed beyond the required setback area, no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structme. When it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure, vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with Section 7(C)(2) above.

Any non-conforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body, tributary stream, or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value, or damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market value of the structure, excluding normal maintenance and repair, may be reconstructed in place if a permit  is obtained from the Code Enforcement Officer within one year of such damage, destruction, or removal.

In determining whether the building reconstruction 01· replacement meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the applicable Review Board shall consider, in addition to the criteria in Section 7(C)(2) above, the physical condition and type of foundation present, if any.

(4)	Change of Use of a Non-conforming Structure. The use of a non-conforming structure may not be changed to another use unless the Planning Board (or Site Review Board  if change is pmt of a site plan application), after receiving a written application, determines that the new use will have no greater adverse impact on the water body, tributary stream, or wetland, or on the subject or adjacent properties and resources than the existing use.

In determining that no greater adverse impact will occur, the applicable review board shall require written documentation from the applicant, regarding the probable effects on public health and safety, erosion and sedimentation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, vegetative cover, visual and actual points of public access to waters, natural beauty, floodplain management, archaeological and historic resources, and commercial fishing and maritime activities, and other functionally water-dependent uses.

D.	Non-conforming Uses

(I)	Expansions. Expansions of non-conforming uses are prohibited, except that non­ conforming residential uses may, after obtaining a permit from the Planning Board, be expanded within existing residential structures or within expansions of such structures as allowed in Section 7(C)(l)(a) above.
 

D.	Non-conforming Uses

(I)	Expansions. Expansions of non-conforming uses are prohibited, except that non­ conforming residential uses may, after obtaining a permit from the Planning Board, be expanded within existing residential structures or within expansions of such structures as allowed in Section 7(C)(l)(a) above.

(2)	Resumption Prohibitecl. A lot, building or structure in or on which a non-conforming use is discontinued for a period exceeding one year, or which is superseded by a conforming use, may not again be devoted to a non-conforming use except that the Applicable Review Board may, for good cause shown by the applicant, grant up to a one year extension to that time period. This provision shall not apply to the resumption of a residential use of a residential strncture provided that the structure has been used or maintained for residential purposes during the preceding five (5) year period.

(3)	Change of Use. An existing non-conforming use may be changed to another non­ conforming use provided that the proposed use has no greater adverse impact on the subject and adjacent properties and resources, than the former use, as determined by the Board of Appeals. The determination  of no greater adverse impact shall be made according to criteria listed in Section 7(C)(4) above.

E.	Non-conforming Lots

(1)	Non-conforming Lots: A  non-conforming lot of record as of the effective date of this Ordinance or amendment thereto may be built upon, without the need for a variance, provided that such lot is in separate ownership and not contiguous with any other lot in the same ownership, and that all provisions of this Ordinance except lot area, lot width and shore frontage can be met. Variances relating to setback or other requirements not involving lot area, lot width or shore frontage shall be obtained by action of the Board of Appeals.

(2)	Contiguous Built Lots: If two or more contiguous lots or parcels are in a single or joint ownership of record at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, if all or part of the lots do not meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance, and if a principal use or structure exists on each lot, the non-conforming lots may be conveyed separately or together, provided that the State Minimum Lot Size Law (12 M.R.S.A. sections 4807-A through 4807-D) and the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules are complied with.

If two or more principal uses or strnctures existed on a single lot of record on the effective date of this ordinance, each may be sold on a separate lot provided that the above referenced law and rules are complied with. When such lots are divided each lot tlrns created must be as conforming as possible to the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance.

(3)	Contiguous Lots - Vacant or Partially Bullt: Tftwo or more contiguous lots or parcels are in single or joint ownership of record at the time of or since adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, if any of these lots do not individually meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance or subsequent amendments, and if one or more of the lots are vacant or
 
Sections 8 & 9

contain no ptincipal strncture the lots shall be combined to the extent necessaty to meet the dimensional requirements. This provision shall not apply to 2 or more contiguous lots, at least one of which is non-conforming, owned by the same person or persons on the effective date of this Ordinance and recorded in the registty of deeds if the lot is se1ved by a public sewer or can accommodate a subsurface sewage disposal system in confo1mance with the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules; and each lot contains at least 100 feet of shore frontage and at least 20,000 square feet oflot area.

Section 8.  Transfer of Ownership

Ownership of nonconfonning lots, uses, and/or buildings as defined in this Ordinance may be transferred without loss of their lawful but nonconfonning status.

Section 9.   Changes in Nonconforming Lots, Structures, and Uses

A nonconforming aspect of a lot or building may be changed if the Code Enforcement Officer determines that it is no more nonconforming than the existing situation. In the case of a change in a nonconforming nse, the Board of Appeals shall make the detennination of whether the change is to a use that is less or no  more nonconfonning than the existing situation. In making its determination, the Board of Appeals shall apply the standards of Aiiicle 7, Section IA.

Article 6, Page 2
Section 4
 
3	(I)	To hear and decide applications requesting such variance from the terms of this ordinance
4	as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
5	enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in undue hardship.   Except
6	as provided  in  Section 2.F.(2)(c)  of Atticle  8, use  variances  may not  be granted.	A
7	variance  may  include  such  conditions  and  safeguards  as  are  appropriate  under  this
8	Ordinance.  Any variance granted shall be the minimum necessary to relieve the hardship.
9	The words "undue hardship" as used in this subsection mean:
IO
II	(a)	That the land in question cannot yield  a reasonable return  unless a variance  is
12	granted;
13
14	(b)	That the need for a variance  is due to the unique circumstances of the property
15	and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood;
16
17	(c)	That the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality;
18	and
19
20	(d)	That the hardship  is not the result of action  taken  by the applicant or a prior
21	O\Vner.
22
23	(2)	Notwithstanding subsection B.(l) above, for the purpose of reviewing requests for setback
24	variances for single family dwellings, the term "undue hardship" shall have the following
25	rneaning:
26
27	(a)	The need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not
28	to the general conditions in the neighborhood;
29
30	(b)	The granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality;
31
32	(c)	The hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner;
33
34	(d)	The granting of the variance will not substantially reduce or impair the use of the
35	abutting property; and
36
37	(e)	That   the   granting   of  a  variance   is   based   upon   demonstrated   need,  not
38	convenience, and no other feasible alternative is available.
39
40	A variance granted under subsection B.(2) shall be limited to permitting a variance from a
41	setback requirement for a single family dwelling that is the primary year-round residence
42	of the petitioner.	A variance  under this subsection may not exceed 20% of a setback
43	requirement and may not be granted if the variance would cause the area of the dwelling to
44	exceed the maximum permissible lot coverage.
45
46	(3)	Disability Variance
47
48	Notwithstanding subsection B(l) above, the Board of Appeals may grant a variance to a
49	propetty owner for the purpose of making that prope1ty  accessible to a person with a
50	disability who is living on the prope1ty.  The Board of Appeals shall restrict any variance
 
Article 6, Page 3
Section 4



2		granted under this subsection solely to the installation of equipment or the construction of structures necessary for access to or egress from the property  with the disability.   The
3		Board of Appeals may impose conditions on the variance, including limiting the variance
4		to the duration of the disability or to the time that the person with the disability lives on
5		the prope1ty.  For the purposes of this subsection, a disability has the same meaning as a
6		physical  or  mental  handicap  under  Title  5,  section  4553,  of  MRSA,  and  the  term
7		"structures  necessary  for access  to or egress from  the  property"  is defined  to include
8		railing, wall or roof systems necessary for the safety or effectiveness of the structure.
9		
10		Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance to the contrary, and as a necessary
11		supplement to the above provisions for the granting of disability variances to comply with
12		the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, any single family dwelling lawfully existing
13		as of the  effective  date  of this  amendment  (June  13, 2007), shall be  eligible to  expand  its
14		footprint  by  not more than  500 square feet,  without regard  to the provisions  in this
15		Paragraph  (3) limiting such variances  to ingress and  egress  improvements  only, upon
16		application for a disability variance by the owner/occupant provided:
17		
18		(a) the additional footprint and accompanying living area are shown to be the minimum
19		necessary to accommodate the owner/occupant or a member of his immediate family
20		residing in the dwelling who suffers from a physical or mental disability as referenced
21		above, and
22		
23		(b) no part of the addition intrudes into any applicable height or lot coverage restrictions;
24		provided,   fmther,  the  variance   application   shall   remain   subject  to  the  further
25		restrictions  in subsection 2(C) below.	Where it would  be unreasonable to require
26		removal  of any  improvement  made pursuant to the granting of such  variance, the
27		Board of Appeals shall not require it.
28		
29	c.	Shoreland Overlay District and Resource Protection District.
30		
31		( 1)	Prior to taking action on a variance  request for prope1ty  located within the Shoreland
32		Overlay  District  or Resource Protection  District,  the Board  shall apply the  following
33		standards in addition to the variance standards:
34		
35		The proposed  structure or use would  meet the provisions  of A1ticle  8, except for the
36		specific provisions which has created the nonconformity and from which relief is sought.
37		
38		The applicant's submission to the Town shall include the following evidence in suppo1t of
39		the requested variance:
40		
41		(a)	A plot plan  showing the location, dimensions and setbacks of all existing and
42		proposed struchires.
43		
44		(b)	The location of the Shoreland zone line and/or Resource Protection zone line on a
45		plot plan.
46		
47		(c)	Documentation of conformance to standards of subsection C.(2). below.
48		
49		(2)	Prior  to  voting  to  grant  a  variance  within  the  Shoreland  Overlay  and/or  Resource
50		Protection Districts, the Board shall, in addition to determining that the four elements of
 
Article 6, Page 4
Section 4

1	hardship  have  been  met and that the variance  requested  is the minimum  necessary  to
2	address  the hardship,  shall also determine  that  the proposed  variance  conforms  to the
3	following standards:
4
5		(a)	will not result in unsafe or unhealthful conditions;
6		
7		(b)	will not result in unreasonable erosion or sedimentation;

33		administrative boards if expressly so provided by statute or ordinance.  This authority shall include
34		the power to hear and decide special exception appeals from the Planning Board, determinations
35		made by the Historic Preservation Commission and site plan appeals from the Site Plan Review
36		Board, but shall not include review of any action by the Planning Board relative to subdivisions,
37		which shall be appealable directly to Superior Comt.

19		topography  and  minimize  changes  to  the  existing  natural  topography  to  the
20		maximum extent feasible;
21		
22	5.	The telecommunications  facility shall utilize the surrounding tree coverage and
23		foliage as a buffer to the maximum extent possible.  Removal of mature trees shall
24		be strongly discouraged;
25		
26	6.	Design  of the tower, antenna, and any secondary structures and facilities shall
27		contain design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
28		obtrusiveness;
29		
30	7.	Provisions that have been made for future co-location;
31		
32	8.	The telecommunications  facility shall minimize visual  impacts  on view sheds,
33		ridge lines, and other impacts by means of tower location, tree and foliage clearing
34		and placement of incidental structures;

Section 2. Branch Brook Aquifer Protection District (BB)

A.	Purpose
The purpose of this district is to protect the quality and quantity of present and future groundwater
resources which recharge Branch Brook and its tributaries by regulating activities and land use practices. The protection of these groundwater resources is critical to promoting the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the municipality.

The purpose of Zones A and B is to restrict or control uses involving hazardous or leachable materials which, if introduced to the ground or groundwater, cannot be rendered harmless by dilution or by the attenuative capacity of the soil prior to reaching the water supply. In addition, the purpose of Zone A is to prohibit sources of viral and bacterial contamination which can contaminate the water supply.

B.	Delineation of Aquifer Protection Area

(1)	For the purposes of this Ordinance, the Branch Brook Aquifer Protection District shall be delineated on copies of the Assessor's maps, shall be entitled "Branch Brook Aquifer Protection District Map: Town of Kennebunk," and as are dated 10-16-86. This map shall be deemed an integral part of this Ordinance and shall be maintained on file at the Town office.

(2)	The Branch Brook Aquifer Protection District consists of aquifers and aquifer recharge areas comprised of the following elements:

Zone A, as delineated on the official aquifer protection district map, which shall control, consists of the area in which it would take a leachable material introduced into the groundwater 200 days or less to reach Branch Brook or one of its tributaries. The travel time boundary of this zone is based on the length of time viruses present in wastewater can survive in the soil.

Zone B, as delineated on the official aquifer protection district map, which shall control, consists of the recharge area for Branch Brook and its tributaries.

(3)	If any portion of a lot is located in Zone A or Zone B,all the land located in Zone A shall be governed by the regulation for Zone A, and all the land located in Zone B shall be governed by the regulations for Zone B.

(4)	Where the boundary between Zone A and Zone B crosses a single lot, land in Zone A may be used to fulfill the minimum net lot area requirement for a one-family detached dwelling, provided no land in Zone A is used in lot development.

(5)	The delineation of aquifers, aquifer recharge areas, and Zones A and B may be revised by amendment to the official aquifer protection district maps in accordance with procedures listed below and in Article 12 of this Ordinance.

Where the bounds of Zone A or Zone B as delineated are in doubt or dispute, the Planning Board shall hold a public hearing to receive evidence from the concerned party. Within 30 days of the hearing the Planning Board shall decide whether to recommend to the Selectmen that an amendment to the official aquifer protection map be placed on the next Town meeting warrant.  If
 

an amendment to the official aquifer protection map is approved by vote of the Town's legislative body, the date of the revision and the signature of the Chairman of the Planning Board certifying the revision shall be noted on the map.

In determining where the bounds should be properly located, the burden of proof shall be upon the party challenging the present definition of the bounds or the Town's interpretation thereof. The evidence shall include a report from a geologist licensed in the State of Maine with proven experience in hydrogeology. The Town may hire a hydrogeologist to review all information submitted by the concerned party and may charge the concerned party for the cost of the consultant. Or, at the request of the owner, the Town may engage a licensed geologist to determine more accurately the location and extent of aquifers, aquifer recharge areas, and Zones A and B, and may charge the concerned party for the cost of the investigation.

(6)	In the case of any proposed amendment to this district, the Planning Board shall notify the Kennebunk, Kennebunkport, Wells Water District of any hearing to amend the provisions of the district at least seven (7) days prior to the date of the hearing.

Section 6.	Suburban Residential (SR)

A.	Purpose
The purpose of the Suburban Residential District is to acknowledge and respect an established
pattern of residential development, predominantly on one- and two-acre lots, such as exists along the Sea Road and Route 35 corridors between Kennebunk Village and Lower Village. The intention of the district is to allow additional development that (a) is harmonious with the established neighborhoods in these areas, (b) can safely coexist with the rural and suburban landscape of these areas, including wooded lands, adjacent wetlands, and a gently rolling topography and roadways that are fitted to that topography, and (c) will not unduly change the historic character of segments of these areas. The Comprehensive Plan recognized that public sewer lines serve portions of the Suburban Residential District and may be extended to other parts of the district to replace failing septic systems on poor soils; but the Plan's intention for the district is to maintain a relatively low density of development as a break between the more intensely developed Kennebunk Village and Lower Village.

Zone A, as delineated on the official aquifer protection district map, which shall control, consists of the area in which it would take a leachable material introduced into the groundwater 200 days or less to reach Branch Brook or one of its tributaries. The travel time boundary of this zone is based on the length of time viruses present in wastewater can survive in the soil.

Zone B, as delineated on the official aquifer protection district map, which shall control, consists of the recharge area for Branch Brook and its tributaries.

(3)	If any portion of a lot is located in Zone A or Zone B,all the land located in Zone A shall be governed by the regulation for Zone A, and all the land located in Zone B shall be governed by the regulations for Zone B.

(4)	Where the boundary between Zone A and Zone B crosses a single lot, land in Zone A may be used to fulfill the minimum net lot area requirement for a one-family detached dwelling, provided no land in Zone A is used in lot development.

(5)	The delineation of aquifers, aquifer recharge areas, and Zones A and B may be revised by amendment to the official aquifer protection district maps in accordance with procedures listed below and in Atticle 12 of this Ordinance.

Where the bounds of Zone A or Zone B as delineated are in doubt or dispute, the Plalllling Board shall hold a public hearing to receive evidence from the concerned party. Within 30 days of the hearing  the  Plalllling  Board  shall  decide  whether  to  recommend   to  the  Selectmen  that  an

Section 6.	Suburban Residential  (SR)

A.	Purpose
The purpose  of the Suburban Residential District  is to acknowledge  and respect  an established pattern of residential development, predominantly on one- and two-acre lots, such as exists along
the Sea Road and Route 35 corridors between Kennebunk Village and Lower  Village.  The intention of the district is to allow additional development that (a) is harmonious with the established neighborhoods in these areas, (b) can safely coexist with the rural and suburban landscape of these areas, including wooded lands, adjacent wetlands, and a gently rolling topography and roadways that are fitted to that topography, and (c) will not unduly change the historic character of segments of these areas. The Comprehensive Plan recognized that public sewer lines serve portions of the Suburban Residential District and may be extended to other parts of the district to replace failing septic systems on poor soils; but the Plan's intention for the district is to maintain a relatively low density of development as a break between the more intensely developed Kennebunk Village and Lower Village.

(3)	New roads and driveways are prohibited in a Resource Protection District, except to provide access to permitted uses within the district, or as approved by the Planning Board upon a finding that no reasonable alternative route or location is available outside the district, in which case the road and/or driveway shall be set back as far as practicable from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland.

(4)	Road and driveway banks shall be no steeper than a slope of two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical, and shall be graded and stabilized in accordance with the provisions for erosion and sedimentation control contained herein.

(5)	Road and driveway grades shall be no greater than ten(10) percent, except for short segments of less than two hundred (200) feet.

(6)	In order to prevent road and driveway surface drainage from directly entering water bodies, tributary streams or wetlands, roads and driveways shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to empty onto an unscarified buffer strip at least fifty (50) feet, plus two times the average slope, in width between the outflow point of the ditch or culvert and the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland. Surface drainage which is directed to an unscarified buffer strip shall be diffused or spread out to promote infiltration of the runoff and to minimize channelized flow of the drainage through the buffer strip.

(7)	Ditch relief (cross drainage) culverts, drainage dips and water turnouts shall be installed in a manner effective in directing drainage onto unscarified buffer strips before the flow gains sufficient column or heat to erode the road, driveway or ditch. To accomplish this, the following shall apply:

(a)	Ditch relief culverts, drainage dips and associate water turnouts shall be spaced along the road or driveway at intervals no greater than indicated in the following table:
Grade	Spacing
(Percent)	(Feet)
0-2	250

(75) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high water line of other water bodies or the upland edge of a wetland, harvesting operations shall
not create single clearcut openings greater than ten thousand (10,000) square  feet  in the  forest canopy.	Where  such  openings  exceed five
thousand (5,000) square feet, they shall be at least one hundred (100) feet apart.   Such clear-cut openings shall be included in the calculation of
total volume removal.  For the purposes of these standards, volume may
be considered to be equivalent to basal area.

(b)	No accumulation of slash shall be left within fifty (50) feet of the normal high- water line of a water body. In all other areas, slash shall either be removed or disposed of in such a manner that it lies on the ground, and no part thereof, extends more than four (4) feet above the ground. Any debris that falls below the normal high-water line of a water body shall be removed.

(c)	Timber harvesting equipment shall not use stream channels as travel routes except when:

(e)	Skid trail approaches to water crossings shall be located and designed so as to prevent water runoff from directly entering the water body or tributary stream. Upon completion of timber harvesting, temporary bridges and culverts shall be removed and areas of exposed soil revegetated.

(f)	Except for water crossings, skid trails and other sites where the operation of machinery used in timber harvesting results in the exposure of mineral soil shall be located such that an unscarified strip of vegetation of at least seventy-five (75) feet in width for slopes up to ten (10) percent shall be retained between the exposed mineral soil and the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland. For each ten (10) percent increase in slope, the unscarified strip shall be increased by twenty (20) 2feet. The provisions of this paragraph apply only to a face sloping toward the water body or wetland, provided however, that no portion of such exposed mineral soil on a back face shall be closer than twenty-five (25) feet from the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland.
 

K.	Water Quality

No activity shall deposit on or into the ground or discharge to the waters of the State any pollutant that, by itself or in combination with other activities or substances, will impair designated uses or the water classification of the water body, tributary stream or wetland.

L.	Erosion and Sediment Control

(1)	All activities which involve filling, grading, excavation or other similar activities which result in unstabilized soil conditions and which require a permit shall require a written soil erosion and sedimentation control plan in conformance with York County Soil and Water Conservation District Standards.

(3)	Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall apply to all aspects of the proposed project involving land disturbance, and shall be in operation during all stages of the activity. The amount of exposed soil at every phase of construction shall be minimized to reduce the potential for erosion.

(4)	Any exposed ground area shall be temporarily or permanently stabilized within one (1) week from the time it was last actively worked, by use of riprap, sod, seed, and mulch, or other effective measures. In all cases, permanent stabilization shall occur within nine (9) months of the initial date of exposure.  In addition:

(a)	Where mulch is used, it shall be applied at a rate of at least one (1) bale per five hundred (500) square feet, and shall be maintained until a catch of vegetation is established.

(b)	Anchoring the mulch with netting, peg and twine or other suitable method may be required to maintain the mulch cover.

(c)	Additional measures shall be taken where necessary in order to avoid siltation into the water. Such measures may include the use of staked hay bales and/or silt fences.

(5)	Natural and man-made drainage ways and drainage outlets shall be protected  from erosion from water flowing through them.

area/lot or an increase in the number of parking spaces is not de minimis.

Any off-street plan that involves de minimis changes shall not be required to bring the parking area or lot into compliance with standards adopted after the date of approval of the area or lot or any changes thereto, including but not limited to any additional buffer or setback  standards.

Substantive changes must comply with all requirements of this Section; provided, however that when a substantive change is reviewed under this Section, such review shall be limited to the specific change requested and shall not otherwise apply to any parking area, lot or plan approved prior to March 10, 2014, (that being the first public hearing date of these amendments) to the extent not being changed.
 

(e)	The Staff Review Committee shall provide an initial recommendation on all off- street parking plans, related requests, and plan changes that are subject to review and approval by the CEO, Site Plan Review or Planning Board.

either the Site Plan Review Board or Planning Board, as applicable, for review under
this Section, if the Staff Review Committee determines that:
(1)	the off-street parking plan will generate significant public interest, either in the neighborhood where parking is proposed, or on a Town-wide basis; or
(2)	the off-street  parking plan will cause significant traffic or environmental impacts.
(2)	On-Site Parking Requirements. Required off-street parking in all districts shall be located on the same lot as the principal building or use, or on an adjacent lot owned

(a)	Proximity to Public Parking. The off-street parking requirement may be reduced by 20% or 10 parking spaces, whichever results in a greater parking obligation, if delineated public on-street parking spaces and/or a parking lot owned or operated by the Town of Kennebunk for public use are located within a 1,000 foot radius of the proposed use(s).
(b)	First Floor Retail/Eating Place/Drinking Place. The off-street parking requirement for any first floor retail, restaurant eating or drinking place use may be reduced by up to 10 parking spaces.
(c)	The reductions in this Subsection may not be combined.
(d)	Reductions will only be granted to the extent that the off-street parking requirements as calculated under Subsection C (6) above cannot be satisfied by
an  applicant’s  available  on-site  parking  spaces.  Before  an  applicant  will  be
eligible for a reduction, they must demonstrate that they will use any available on-site parking spaces to satisfy their off-street parking requirements as calculated under Subsection C (6) above.

Applicant must also show that the need for parking reduction is not due to on-site parking being eliminated due to building expansion

D.	Off-Street Parking Design and Functioning Standards

The following design standards shall be required for all new and expanded off-street parking areas:

(5)	Parking areas shall be designed such that vehicles will not back out into a street. Residential multifamily subdivisions which propose use of a private street are exempt from this standard provided the approved subdivision plat or other filing plat provides a plan note stipulating that the road shall remain privately owned and privately maintained.

(6)	Parking areas shall not inhibit emergency vehicle access to any building or structure.
 

(7)	Where parking is placed or expanded in front of the lot, and a green perimeter strip is not required per Article 8, a landscaped area at least ten (10) feet wide shall be placed between the street right-of-way and the parking area. A walkway may be placed in this border strip, but in no event shall it reduce the border strip to less than five (5) feet.

(8)	Parking areas shall be separated from the front of all buildings by a landscaped area at least five (5) feet wide.

(9)	Wheel stops/curbs shall be placed where needed to prevent encroachment into walkways, landscaped areas, circulation aisles, streets and structures.

(10)	Parking spaces and travel aisles shall be clearly delineated.

Note: In many cases, federal and state regulations concerning accessibility to the handicapped are applicable to the design of parking lots, and applicants are responsible for complying with such regulations. Those regulations include the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Maine Human Rights Act. A copy of each of these documents is on file in the Town Planner's Office and may be reviewed upon request.

(b)	limiting site conditions are not the result of action(s) taken by the applicant or prior owner(s) since the amendment effective as of January 21, 1993;

(c)	the waiver will not result in any public safety hazards, and

(d)	the applicant has made every reasonable effort to conform to the standards of this Section and has provided documentation substantiating the existence of the
required conditions for a waiver. Such documentation must include, when applicable, evidence the applicant contacted potential sources of off-site parking and parking was

(3)	Waiver of Paving Requirement. Notwithstanding the paving requirement herein, the Site Plan Review Board or Planning Board, as applicable, may permit, upon written request of the applicant, or, in order to minimize the loss of green space or to reduce drainage impacts, may itself require all or a portion of the required off-street parking  to  be unpaved provided the parking plan conforms to the following criteria:

(a)	the remaining design standards of Subsection D. above,

(b)	all  travel  aisles  and  parking  spaces  which  are  dedicated  to  the  physically handicapped shall be paved,

2.	Review Process: The additional standards of this Art. 10. Section 23 shall be made a part of  the Site Plan Review Standards/Process (Zoning Art. 11) or the Subdivision Review Standards/Process, as applicable. (Please note that in some cases, these standards and the Design Standards Manuals are more stringent than the Site Plan Review Standards.)  In the event that a proposal meets the applicability criteria of Section B. 2. And B.3. above but  is not subject to the applicability criteria of either Site Plan Review or Subdivision Review, it will  be reviewed by the Site Plan Review Board under the provisions of this Section. A pre application informational meeting with Town Staff is required as part of this process.

3.	Design Review Standards Manual(s) : Reference is made to the Kennebunk Design Review Standards Manual and the Better Models for Commercial Development booklet
(prepared  by Ed McMahon and The Conservation Fund) which  are provided as guides to
understand what the Town’s design goals are for development along Route 1 North and Route 1 South. These manuals provide direction and shall be used by both the applicant and the review board in the plan review and approval process.

4.	Waiver of Criteria: All requests for waivers of any of the Art. 10, Section 23. Design Review Standards shall be decided by the applicable review board utilizing the waiver provision of Zoning Art. 11, Section 9.

D.	Design Criteria

In considering the application before it, the applicable review authority shall determine that the following site layout and building design standards have been met:
 

1. Site Layout and Design -

a)	Site Design for new buildings and infill development – Proposed structures shall be related harmoniously to the terrain and to existing buildings in the vicinity of the proposed building(s). The design of the site shall be based on existing topography, vegetation and drainage characteristics and shall retain significant and /or unique site features such as historic resources, existing ponds or streams and mature trees to the greatest practical extent. In addition, building layout shall conform to the following:

•	Building frontages shall be located at the street edge where possible, and new buildings shall be compatible with the front facades of existing buildings which are presently located along the Route 1 street edge;

•	Buildings shall be aligned to the front setback line from the Route 1.  R.O.W. , and from both streets if building will be located on a corner lot. The review board may permit a reduction in the front setback requirement and green buffer requirement - to a minimum of 15 feet - where applicant provides a plan for locating the new building(s) in line with front facades of existing buildings in the area. In addition, when the creation of an outside seating area or outdoor use area is part of the design for front of building, some variation in this front setback standard will be permitted;

In addition, the review board may require that a maximum front setback from the edge of Route 1  R.O.W. be set at 40 feet ; with a  greater setback from street permitted only if the location of the building and the proposed setback will enhance the public realm;

•	Locate main entrance, or at least one functional entrance, on the side of building(s) directly facing Route 1;

•	Drive – through lanes shall not cross a business’s principal entrance to the building;

•	Walls along the street(s) should be transparent (not opaque); with windows and doors to maximize views in and out of the building;

•	Parking shall be located entirely to the side or rear of the building. In the case of sites where existing buildings will be retained or reconfigured, every effort shall be made to locate the new parking to the side or rear of building closest to Route 1; and

•	For multi-building developments , a conceptual master plan shall be prepared to show the general location of both current buildings and proposed future buildings, parking areas, driveways, walkways and natural features to be retained or protected (such as wetlands).

b)	Site Features

Internal Traffic Flow and Connections to Adjacent Sites -  To ensure safety of motorists, delivery trucks, bicyclists and pedestrians, the site plan shall clearly delineate internal traffic patterns for both vehicles and pedestrians. Special attention shall be given to location, number of access points, increased traffic to the public streets, width of interior drives and access points, general interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and arrangement of parking areas that are safe and convenient. In addition, the plan shall show
 

potential connections between parking lots and driveways on adjacent parcels (whether developed or undeveloped) in order to minimize turning movements on Route 1 and to provide safe, direct access between adjacent lots.

Shared Driveway Access - Entrances to and exits from uses located along the Portland Rd. and the York St. corridors shall be combined and shared with neighboring uses to the maximum extent possible in order to minimize the number of curb cuts and increase vehicular and pedestrian safety.

Connections to abutting streets – Where a development abuts or receives its primary site access from Route 1 , the Board may require that the site provide a connection to an abutting street or R.O.W. or to a rear access road if available.

Parking – Where new off –street parking areas are proposed, they shall be located to the side or the rear of the principal building, and no parking shall be located closer than 25 feet of Route 1 R.O.W.  In no case shall parking be located closer to Route 1 than building located closest to Route 1.  No more than 50 % of the lot’s frontage width may be used for parking. Parking lots shall be designed as inviting, pedestrian friendly places with careful attention to landscaping, lighting, and internal walkways. Shared parking is encouraged, especially where abutting uses have differing hours of peak parking demand. (Cross access easements may be required to allow shared parking.) Where multiple buildings are proposed, parking should be located within the core/central area if possible, to provide adequate ADA adjacency and also street screening. Parking lots shall be screened from Rt. 1 and visually broken up through the use of trees, landscaped parking islands, building locations, hedges, shrubs, or a combination of all these elements.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Movement – The circulation plan shall provide safe pedestrian and bicycle movement – both within the site and to abutting sites and public sidewalks. The plan shall also demonstrate how linkage(s) can be made to adjacent properties, both developed and undeveloped. Internal crosswalks shall be provided and marked by a change in pavement texture, pattern, and/or color to maximize pedestrian safety.

Service Areas – Service areas (e.g. solid waste/recycling facilities, above ground transformers, mechanical equipment, utility areas and loading areas) shall be located to the side or rear of the building and, wherever possible, shall be hidden and incorporated into the design of the building – with maximum screening from public view.

Service areas shall be screened with privacy fencing, walls and/or landscaping in order to minimize visibility from public and private roadways, main entrances, abutting neighborhoods, public open spaces, and pathways.

Additionally, the location of proposed ATMs and /or vending machines shall be shown on the plan and screened from Route 1 view.

Roof Top Equipment - Where roof top utility and/or equipment areas are necessary, they shall be hidden and incorporated into the architecture of building and screened from all visible sides.

Landscaping - A Landscape Plan, conforming to  the standards of Art. 11, Section 6.B. (7) and  Art. 11, Section 8. (1) and  (2) of this Ordinance  - as well as the standards  of this
 
Article 10, Page 66
Part D. Mixed Uses and Nonresidential Uses, Section 23

Section, shall be provided as part of any plan involving new building construction, parking lot, and/or drive through development.  Landscaping shall be used to complement the architecture, enhance the human scale, reinforce circulation paths, highlight entrances, provide shade, and add color and seasonal interest to site.

Existing mature trees and natural vegetation along the street frontage and edges of the site shall be evaluated and, when determined to be in good condition, shall be retained. Within the green perimeter strip abutting Route 1, the plan shall include one shade tree per 30 linear feet, or fraction thereof, for the length of the property line, exclusive of the driveway, with most trees being evenly spaced within such strip. Shade trees shall have a minimum caliper of 2 ½ inches.

Advertising Features – The size, number, location, design, color, texture, lighting and materials of all permanent signs and outdoor advertising structures or features shall not detract from or adversely affect the design, appearance, and environmental and aesthetic qualities of proposed building and structures and the surrounding properties.

Snow Storage – Provisions shall be made for adequate snow storage in the design of all parking areas, and shall avoid conflicts with landscaping, visibility, drainage and icing during winter months. Alternatively, a snow management plan indicating how the snow removal will be handled shall be reviewed and included in the plan approval process.

c)	Additional Standards for Auto oriented uses and Drive -Throughs – Auto oriented establishments such as gas stations, convenience stores, fast food restaurants ( in zones where they are permitted) , car wash facilities, and drugstores or banks with drive through windows/ATMs, shall orient the building close to the Route 1 and shall locate all the automobile-related activities such as parking, fuel pumps, drive through windows and drive through lanes to the side or rear of the building – with no such auto oriented activities to be located between the building and Route 1. Drive-through facilities are permitted only as accessory uses to a permitted use within the zoning district, and not as a principal or sole use.

Queuing and Circulation – Each drive-through or queuing lane shall be separated from the general circulation lanes necessary either for entering or exiting the property or for providing interior circulation within the property. This separation shall be done by means of an island, and the lanes shall be distinctly marked and striped.

Pedestrian Circulation – Pedestrian safety shall be an important consideration in the design of access routes leading to or from auto - oriented uses. Site layout shall minimize conflicts with pedestrian access to the on-site businesses, to businesses on adjacent sites, and to public

sidewalks. Drive - through lanes shall not cross a business’s principal entrance to the building. Traffic calming measures shall be included where appropriate to discourage speeding within the site and between abutting sites. Measures may include raised crosswalks, curbing, roadside plantings, curbed islands, and appropriate signage.

Facility Design - Drive-through operations and other automobile-oriented facilities shall be designed with façade and roofline elements that reduce their scale and are consistent with the architectural character of the main building.
 
Article 10, Page 67
Part D. Mixed Uses and Nonresidential Uses, Section 23

Traffic Standards - All streets and intersections to be impacted by a proposed drive-through facility shall show that they will meet the Maine DOT Level of Service Standards after development and shall provide evidence of such conformance as part of the review process. No vehicular entrance to or exit from a drive-through facility shall be located within two hundred feet (200) of a street intersection. Entrances to drive-through facilities shall be located off of interior roadways,  interior drives, or parking areas , rather than off the public street. Queuing lane(s) shall be designed so they do not result in vehicles needing to back into or block public streets.

Buffer / Screening - Landscaped buffers in addition to walls and/or fences, shall be used to soften the visual impact of parking areas, service areas, commercial buildings, drive through lanes, street frontages and adjacent properties.

2)	Building Design – The Town encourages high quality architectural design that is inspired by Kennebunk’s traditional building style. The following standards shall be addressed as part of the proposed building design:

Architecture - The goal of these standards is to produce architecture that draws its inspiration from traditional New England vernacular. Traditional building styles and materials shall be used in a way to accommodate contemporary building needs.

Buildings shall present an inviting, human-scaled façade to the street, internal drives, parking areas, and abutting properties.

Scale of Building(s) – The scale of a building depends on its overall size, the mass of it in relationship to the open space around it, and the sizes of its doors, windows, porches and balconies. The scale gives a building “presence”, that is, it makes it seem so big or small, awkward or graceful, overpowering or unimportant. The scale of a building should be visually compatible with its site and with its neighborhood.

Linear commercial structures, e.g. shopping centers, multi-tenant office buildings, and other large commercial structures, shall be visually unified through the use of complimentary architectural forms, similar materials and colors, variations in rooflines, detailing, and building heights, and coordinated signage.

Facades greater than 100 feet in length shall be designed with façade and roofline elements that reduce their scale and add architectural interest. Where the plane of a wall is broken, the offset shall be proportional to the building’s height and length. Projections used to break up the mass of the building shall extend to the ground.

Height – Heights of new buildings and reconstruction of existing buildings should be  visually compatible with the heights of the buildings in the neighborhood. A sudden dramatic change in the building height can have a jarring effect on the overall look of the street. If a building’s proposed height is 50% or higher than neighboring buildings, the applicant shall incorporate architectural features in the building’s design that limit the visual impact of the proposed building.

Roof Shape – The shape and proportion of the roof shall be articulated so as to lend visual interest and reduce the apparent size of new building(s) and should be visually compatible with the architectural style of the building and with neighboring buildings.
 
Article 10, Page 68
Part D. Mixed Uses and Nonresidential Uses, Section 23

National Franchises – National franchises ( e.g., restaurants, service stations, retail stores, ) are welcome and permitted forms of land use otherwise permitted in some of the zoning districts covering the Route One corridor. Since the design of these buildings can contribute to a loss of identity for Kennebunk by repeating the generic architectural forms that are repeated throughout the country, buildings that are stylized to the point where the structure is a form of advertising are not permitted.

Façade Design and Materials – The first impression that a building gives is very important. All buildings shall present an inviting, human scaled façade to the street, internal drives, parking areas, and surrounding neighborhoods. Buildings with Rt. 1 frontage shall have at least one entrance to the building along the Route 1 frontage.

-- All sides of a building should receive design consideration. Blank walls facing public or private streets, residential neighborhoods, or abutting properties are prohibited. Where side or rear facades are visible from adjacent properties or roadways, they shall be designed to complement the architectural treatment of the primary façade to give scale and visual interest.

-- The pattern of solids and voids, windows and doors in the front façade of a new or altered building should be visually compatible with the architectural style of the building and with that of its neighbors.

-- Materials used on facades help to provide added character to a building – clapboards, shingles, brick, etc. – and therefore should be visually compatible to those of other buildings around it. For facades of buildings visible from a public way, preference shall be given to clapboard, brick, shingle and other materials commonly used in local architecture. (Cinder block, highly reflective metal siding, stucco type siding are discouraged.)

Canopies - Canopies should incorporate features to help them fit the scale and architectural character of the building A pitched roof or other traditional roof form shall be used and the fascia of the canopy shall be short in height, generally not to exceed two feet.

Primary Entrance - The primary building entrance shall face the street unless the applicant can demonstrate that the circumstances of a given application merit an alternative orientation. The entrance shall be identified through the use of architectural details that may include awnings or roofs for shelter, recessing, decorative lighting, trim or railings, in addition to pedestrian walkways connecting to parking areas and public sidewalks.

Street Corners - Buildings located on street corners are important because these high visibility locations help define the character of both streets, therefore the building facades along both streets shall be articulated. No parking, vehicular travel ways, or service areas shall be located between the building and the property lines along both streets.

Signage - The size, scale, materials, illumination, colors, style and location of signs on the site have a visual impact on the streetscape. Signs shall state clearly the name of the business without overwhelming either the architecture or the streetscape. Multi-use sites shall prepare a signage master plan that provides size, design and locations of the signs for all the proposed business spaces proposed for the site, as well as any shared or joint identification signage proposed.
 
Article 10, Page 69
Part D. Mixed Uses and Nonresidential Uses, Section 23

Color – Colors used on building exteriors should integrate a building’s various design elements or features. The use of bright colors should be avoided. Softer, muted or earth-toned colors are preferred. Colors should be compatible with the architectural character of surrounding buildings and neighborhood, unless such surrounding buildings are not in conformance with these design standards. To view examples of acceptable paint choices please see Historic Colors of America Palette by California Paints.

Lighting - The proposed lighting plan shall be consistent with the architectural style of the principal building and shall conform to the standards of Art 10, Section 6.



Section 24 – Retail Marijuana.

The following uses as defined in Article 2, Section 2 of this Ordinance and 7 M.R.S.A § 2442, as may be amended, or any successor provisions thereof, are hereby prohibited in all zoning districts, either as principal or accessory uses:

D.	Design Criteria

In considering the application before it, the applicable review authority shall
determine that the following site layout and building design standards have been met:



1.	Site Layout and Design -

a)  Site Design for new buildings and infill development -Proposed structures shall be related harmoniously to the terrain and to existing buildings in the vicinity of the proposed building(s). The design of the site shall be based on existing topography, vegetation and drainage characteristics and shall retain significant and /or unique site features such as historic resources, existing ponds or streams and mature trees to the greatest practical extent. In addition, building layout shall conform to the following:

•	Building frontages shall be located at the street edge where possible, and new buildings shall be compatible with the front facades of existing buildings which are presently located along the Route 1 street edge;


•	Buildings shall be aligned to the front setback line from the Route 1. R.O.W. , and from both streets if building wi ll be located on a comer lot. The review board may permit a reduction in the front setback requirement and green buffer requirement - to a minimum of 15 feet - where applicant provides a plan for locating the new building(s) in line with front facades of existing buildings in the area. In addition, when  the creation of an outside seating area or outdoor use area is part of the design for front of building, some variation in this front setback standard will be permitted;

In addition, the review board may require that a maximum front setback from the edge of Route I  R.O.W. be set at 40 feet; with a  greater setback from street permitted only if the location of the building and the proposed setback will enhance the public realm;

•	Locate main entrance, or at least one functional entrance, on the side of building(s)
directly facing Route I;

•	Drive -through lanes shall not cross a business's principal entrance to the building;


•	Walls along the street(s) should be transparent  (not opaque); with windows and
doors to maximize views in and out of the building;

SI P ag e
 


(As passed to town vote by Bd. of  Selectmen)
 

•	Parking shall be located entirely to the side or rear of the building. In the case of sites where existing buildings will be retained or reconfigured, every effort shall be made to locate the new parking to the side or rear of building closest to Route 1; and

•	For multi-building developments, a conceptual master plan shall be prepared to show the general location of both current buildings and proposed future buildings, parking areas, driveways, walkways and natural features to be retained or protected (such as wetlands).




b)  Site Features

Internal Traffic Flow and Connections to Adjacent Sites -  To ensure safety of motorists, delivery trucks, bicyclists and pedestrians, the site plan shall clearly delineate internal traffic patterns for both vehicles and pedestrians. Special attention shall be given to location, number of access points, increased traffic to the public streets, width of interior drives and access points, general interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and arrangement of parking areas that are safe and convenient. In addition, the plan shall show potential connections between parking lots and driveways on adjacent parcels (whether developed or undeveloped) in order to minimize turning movements on Route 1 and to provide safe, direct access between adjacent lots.

Shared Driveway Access - Entrances to and exits from uses located along the Portland Rd. and the York St. corridors shall be combined and shared with neighboring uses to the maximum extent possible in order to minimize the number of curb cuts and increase vehicular and pedestrian safety.

Connections to abutting streets -Where a development abuts or receives its primary site access from Route 1 , the Board may require that the site provide a connection to an abutting street or R.O.W. or to a rear access road if available.

Parking - Where new off -street parking areas are proposed , they shall be located to the side or the rear of the principal building, and no parking shall be located closer than 25 feet of Route 1 R.O.W. In no case shall parking be located closer to Route 1 than building located closest to Route 1. No more than 50 % of the lot's frontage width may be used for parking. Parking lots shall be designed as inviting, pedestrian friendly places with careful attention to landscaping, lighting, and internal walkways. Shared parking is encouraged, especially where abutting uses have differing hours of peak parking demand. (Cross access easements may be required to allow shared parking.) Where multiple buildings are proposed, parking should be located within the core/central area if possible, to provide adequate ADA adjacency and also street screening. Parking lots shall be screened from Rt. 1 and visually broken up through the use of trees, landscaped parking islands, building locations, hedges, shrubs, or a combination of all these elements.



5
 


Pedestr ian and Bicycle Movement - The circulation plan shall provide safe pedestrian and bicycle movement - both within the site and to abutting sites and public sidewalks. The plan shall also demonstrate how linkage(s) can be made to adjacent properties , both developed and undeveloped. Internal crosswalks shall be provided and marked by a change in pavement texture, pattern, and/or color to maximize pedestrian safety.

Service Areas - Service areas (e.g. solid waste/recycling facilities, above ground transformers, mechanical equipment, utility areas and loading areas) shall be located to the side or rear of the building and, wherever possible, shall be hidden and incorporat ed into the design of the building -with maximum screening from public view.

Service areas shall be screened with privacy fencing, walls and/or landscaping in order to minimize visibility from public and private roadways, main entrances, abutting neighborhood s, public open spaces, and pathways.

Additionally, the location of proposed ATMs and /or vending machines shall be shown on the plan and screened from Route 1 view.



Roof Top Equipment - Where roof top utility and/or equipment areas are necessary, they shall be hidden and incorporated into the architecture of building and screened from all visible sides.



Landscaping - A Landscape Plan,  conforming to  the standards of Art. 11, Section
6.B. (7) and  Art. 11, Section 8. (1) and  (2) of this Ordinance  - as well as the standards of this Section, shall be provided as part of any plan involving new building construction, parking lot, and/or drive through development. Landscaping shall be used to complement the architecture, enhance the human scale, reinforce circulation paths, highlight entrances, provide shade, and add color and seasonal interest to site.

Existing mature trees and natural vegetation along the street frontage and edges of
the site shall be evaluated and, when determined to be in good condition, shall be retained. Within the green perimeter strip abutting Route 1, the plan shall include one shade tree per 30 linear feet, or fraction thereof, for the length of the property line, exclusive of the driveway, with most trees being evenly spaced within such strip. Shade trees shall have a minimum caliper of  2	inches.

Advertising Features -The size, number , location, design, color, texture, lighting and materials of all permanent signs and outdoor advertising structures or features shall not detract from or adversely affect the design, appearance, and environmental





6
 

and aesthetic qualities of proposed building and structures and the surrounding
properties.

Snow Storage - Provisions shall be made for adequate snow storage in the design of all parking areas, and shall avoid conflicts with landscaping, visibility, drainage and icing during winter months. Alternatively, a snow management plan indicating how the snow removal will be handled shall be reviewed and included in the plan approval process.




c)    Additional  Standards for Auto oriented  uses and  Drive -Through s -Auto oriented establishments such as gas stations, convenience stores, fast food restaurants
( in zones where they are permitted) , car wash facilities, and drugstores or banks with
drive through windows/ATMs, shall orient the building close to the Route  I   and shall locate all the automobile-related  activities such as parking, fuel pumps, drive through windows and drive through lanes to the side or rear of the building - with no such  auto oriented  activities to be located between the building and Route  I. Drive-through facilities are permitted  only as accessory uses to a permitted  use within the zoning district, and not as a principal or sole use.

Queuing and Circulation -Each drive-through or queuing lane shall be separated from the general circulation lanes necessary either for entering or exiting the property or for providing interior circulation within the property. This separation shall be done by means of an island, and the lanes shall be distinctly marked and striped.

Pedestrian Circulation -Pedestrian safety shall be an important consideration in the design of access routes leading to or from auto - oriented uses. Site layout shall minimize conflicts with pedestrian access to the on-site businesses, to businesses on adjacent sites, and to public sidewalks. Drive - through lanes shall not cross a business's principal entrance to the building. Traffic calming measures shall be included where appropriate to discourage speeding within the site and between abutting sites. Measures may include raised crosswalks, curbing, roadside plantings, curbed islands, and appropriate signage.

Facility Design - Drive-through operations and other automobile-oriented facilities shall be designed with fayade and roofline elements that reduce their scale and are consistent with the architectural character of the main bui lding.

Traffic Standards - All streets and intersections to be impacted by a proposed drive­ through facility shall show that they will meet the Maine DOT Level of Service Standards after development and shall provide evidence of such conformance as part of the review process. No vehicular entrance to or exit from a drive-through facility shall be located within two hundred feet (200) of a street intersection. Entrances to drive-through facilities shall be located off of interior roadways,  interior drives, or





7
 

parking areas, rather than off the public street.  Queuing lane(s) shall be designed so
they do not result in vehicles needing to back into or block public streets.

Buffer I Screening - Landscaped buffers in addition to walls and/or fences, shall be used to soften the visual impact of parking areas, service areas, commercial buildings, drive through lanes, street frontages and adjacent properties.



2) Building Design - The Town encourages high quality architectural design that is inspired by Kennebunk's traditional building style. The following standards shall be addressed as part of the proposed building design:



Architecture - The goal of these standards is to produce architecture that draws its inspiration from traditional New England vernacular. Traditional building styles and materials shall be used in a way to accommodate contemporary building needs.

Buildings shall present an inviting, human-scaled  fa9ade to the street, internal drives, parking areas, and abutting propertie s.

Scale of Building(s) -The scale of a building depends on its overall size, the mass of it in relationship to the open space around it, and the sizes of its doors, windows, porches and balconies. The scale gives a building "presence", that is, it makes it seem so big or small, awkward or graceful, overpowering or unimportant. The scale of a building should be visually compatible with its site and with its neighborhood.

Linear commercial structures, e.g. shopping centers, multi-tenant office building s, and other large commercial structures, shall be visually unified through the use of complimentary architectural forms, similar materials and colors, variations in rooflines, detailing, and building heights, and coordinated signage.

Facades greater than 100 feet in length shall be designed with fa9ade and roofline elements that reduce their scale and add architectural interest. Where the plane of a wall is broken, the offset shall be proportional to the buildin g's height and length. Projections used to break up the mass of the building shall extend to the ground.



Height -Heights of new buildings and reconstruction of existing building s should be visually compatible with the heights of the buildings in the neighborhood. A sudden dramatic change in the building height can have a jarring effect on the overall look of the street. If a building's proposed height is 50% or higher than neighboring buildings , the applicant shall incorporate architectural features in the building's design that limit the visual impact of the proposed
building.







8
 

Roof Shape -The shape and proportion of the roof shall be articulated so as to lend visual interest and reduce the apparent size of new building(s) and should be visually compatible with the architectural style of the building and with neighboring buildings.

National  Franchises  -National  franchises (e.g., restaurants,  service stations, retail  stores, ) are welcome and permitted forms of land use otherwise permitted  in some of the zoning districts covering the Route One corridor. Since the design of these buildings can contribute to a loss of identity for Kennebunk by repeating the generic architectural forms that are repeated  throughout the country, buildings that are stylized to the point where the structure is a form of advertising are not permitted.

Fa ade  Design  and Materials  - The first  impression  that  a building  gives is very  important.    All buildings  shall  present  an  inviting,  human  scaled  fa9ade to the  street,  internal  drives, parking areas,  and  surrounding  neighborhoods.  Buildings  with  Rt.  I  frontage  shall  have  at least  one entrance to the  building  along  the Route  1  frontage.

-- All sides of a building should receive design consideration. Blank walls facing public or private streets, residential neighborhoods, or abutting properties are prohibited. Where side or rear facades are visible from adjacent properties or roadways, they shall be designed to complement the architectural treatment of the primary fa9ade to give scale and visual interest.

-- The pattern of solids and voids, windows and doors in the front fa9ade of a new or altered building should be visually compatible with the architectural style of the building and with that of its neighbors.

-- Materials used on facades help to provide added character to a building -clapboards, shingles, brick , etc. -and therefore should be visually compatible to those of other buildings around it. For facades of buildings visible from a public way, preference shall be given to clapboard, brick, shingle and other materials commonly used in local architecture. (Cinder block , highly reflective metal siding, stucco type siding are discouraged.)

Canopies - Canopies should incorporate features to help them fit the scale and architectural character of the building A pitched roof or other traditional roof form shall be used and the fascia of the canopy shall be short in height, generally not to exceed two feet.

Primary Entrance - The primary building entrance shall face the street unless the applicant can demonstrate that the circumstances of a given application merit an alternative orientation. The entrance shall be identified through the use of architectural details that may include awnings or roofs for shelter, recessing, decorative lighting, trim or railings , in addition to pedestrian walkways connecting to parking areas and public sidewalks.

Street Corners - Buildings located on street comers are important because these high visibility locations help define the character of both streets, therefore the building facades along both streets shall be articulated. No parking, vehicular travel ways, or service areas shall be located between the building and the property lines along both streets.

(As passed to town vote by Bd. of Selectmen)

Signage - The size, scale, materials, illumination, colors, style and location of signs on the site have a visual impact on the streetscape. Signs shall state clearly the name of the business without overwhelming either the architecture or the streetscape. Multi-use sites shall prepare a signage master plan that provides size, design and locations of the signs for all the proposed business spaces proposed for the site, as well as any shared or joint identification signage proposed.

Color -Colors used on building exteriors should integrate a building's various design elements or features. The use of bright colors should be avoided. Softer, muted or earth-toned colors are preferred. Colors should be compatible with the architectural character of surrounding buildings and neighborhood, unless such surrounding buildings are not in conformance with these design standards. To view examples of acceptable paint choices please see Historic Colors of America Palette by California Paints.

Lighting - The proposed lighting plan shall be consistent with the architectural style of the principal building and shall conform to the standards of Art 10, Section 6.

Proposed amendments to approved subdivision plans shall be resubmitted to and approved by the Planning Board. This provision shall not prohibit minor field changes during construction, made with the approval of the Code Enforcement Officer and reflected on as-built drawings.

The Site Plan Review Board or the Staff Review Committee, as applicable, shall use the  standards and criteria in Section 8 of this Article in judging proposals for amendments to previously approved site plans and shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny proposed amendments in the same manner as applications for site plan review.  Any proposed amendment that falls into one of the categories enumerated in Section 3 of this Article is subject to independent site plan review and thus shall be submitted as a new application for site plan review regardless of the fact that it is an amendment to a previously-approved  site plan.

Section 12. Expiration of Approval

C.	Application for Certificate of Appropriateness

(I)	Ce1iificates of Appropriateness shall be applied for in writing to the Historic Preservation
 
Section 3

Commission. Applications shall include the location, use, nature, the date of completion, and where pe1tinent, the materials, color and texture of the matter or item for which such certificate is sought.

(2)	Within ten days after the filing of an application for a certificate of appropriateness or application for demolition, the Commission shall determine the properties deemed to be materially affected by the application and, unless a public hearing has been  waived in writing by all persons entitled to notice thereof, shall cause forthwith its secretary to give, by mail, to the applicant, to the owners of all affected properties as they appear on the most recent real estate tax list, and to any person filing written request for notice of such hearings (such requests to be renewed annually in December), not less than ten days notice of a public hearing to be held by the Commission on such an application.

(3)	In reviewing applications for Certificates of Appropriateness, the Commission shall adopt the Secretary of Interior's Guidelines and Standards for Rehabilitation (l983 edition), as the same may be amended from time to time, as its guidelines as well as the Kennebunk Historic Preservation Overlay District Design Guidelines (2002 edition).

(4)	The Commission, in reviewing applications, shall consider the appropriateness of proposed features, buildings, structures, and appurtenant fixtures, the location of the lot, and the removal or demolition of any building, strncture, or appurtenant fixture, whenever such features, buildings, strnctures, and appurtenant fixtures are subject to public view.

(5)	The Commission, in considering the appropriateness of any features, fixtures, and usages included within an application, shall keep in mind the purpose of this Section and shall consider, among other things, the historic and architectural significance and value, the architectural style, the general design, arrangement, texture, material, and color of the building, structure, or appurtenant fixtures in question, the relation of such features to similar features of buildings in the immediate surroundings, and the position of such buildings or strnctures in relation to the street or public way and to other buildings and structures.

(6)	The Commission shall not make any recommendations or requirements except for purposes of historic preservation and for purposes of preventing developments, constrnction, or changes incongruous with the historic district, its buildings, sites, and surroundings.

(7)	As soon as possible after a public hearing, but within a period of fo1ty-five (45) consecutive calendar days after the filing of an application, the Commission shall determine whether the action or usage proposed will be appropriate in its opinion in the historic district in accordance with the purposes of this section. If the Commission or the applicant proposes alternatives to the action or usage originally sought by the applicant, such alternatives shall be acted upon within the fmty-five (45) day period set forth above. If the applicant agrees at a public hearing to extend such forty-five (45) day period, it may be extended by the Commission for final action to mutually agreed date certain.

(8)	Notwithstanding that the proposed action or usage may be deemed inappropriate owing to conditions   specifically   affecting   the   lot,   buildings,   or   structures   involved   in  the
 
Sections 3 & 4

application, but not affecting the historic district generally, the Commission may find that failure to issue a certificate of appropriateness will result in undue hardship, as defined in Article 6, Section 2(B) of this Ordinance, and that such ce1tificate may be issued.

(9)	If the Commission determines that a proposed activity is appropriate, or is not appropriate but finds that a certificate may be issued in accordance with the conditions and findings expressed in paragraph 8 above, or ifthe Commission fails to make a determination within the time herein before prescribed, the Commission shall forthwith approve such application and shall issue to the applicant a certificate of appropriateness in which the Commission may impose conditions.

(11)	Whatever its findings, the Commission shall forthwith notify the applicant of its determination and shall furnish the applicant a copy of the reasons for its finding and any recommendations which appear in the records of the Commission.

(12)	Any person aggrieved by  a decision of the Historic Preservation Commission on an application of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal the same within thirty (30) days from the date of the decision is rendered to the Board of Appeals, and the procedure therefore shall be as set fmth in A1ticle 6, Section 3, of this Ordinance.

Section 4.	Appl'oval Standal'ds and Criteria

Jn considering an application for a Ce1tificate of Appropriateness, the Historic Preservation Committee applies the following general review standards as are determined to be relevant to the particular applicant:

(1) Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for the property which requires minimal alteration to the character-defining features of the structure, object or site and its environment or to use a prope1ty for its originally intended purpose.

 
(2)




(3)





(4)




(5)
 
The distinguishing original qualities or character of a structure, object or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible.

All sites, structures and objects shall be recognized as products of their own time, place and use. Alterations that have no historical basis or create a false  sense of historic development such as adding conjectural features or elements from other properties shall be discouraged.

Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a structure, object or site and its environment. Changes that have acquired significance in their own right shall not be destroyed.

Distinctive features  and construction techniques or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a structure, object or site shall be treated with sensitivity.
 
A11icle 12, Page 5
Section 4




(6)	Deteriorated  historic  features shall be repaired  rather than replaced  wherever  feasible.
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature should match the feature being replaced in composition, design, texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Repair or replacement of missing historic features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other structures or objects.

(7)	The surface cleaning of structures and objects, if appropriate, shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be unde11aken.

(8)	Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve significant archeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project. If resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.

(9)	Contemporaty design for alterations and additions to existing propetiies shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant cultural, historical, architectural or archeological materials shat characterize the propetiy. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the size, color, material and character of the property, neighborhood or environment.

(!0) Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures and objects shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property would be unimpaired.

49
50	Section 9.	West Kennebunk Fire Station Impact Fee
51
52	A.   Description of the improvements
53
54	The West Kennebunk Fire Station Impact Fee will be used to pattially fund the construction
55	of a new  West  Kennebunk  Fire  Station.   The  new  station  will  be  a six-bay  facility with
 
Section 9

I	approximately I 0,140 square feet of floor area plus a small storage mezzanine.  The facility
2	will include crew quarters, offices and suppo1t space, a training room, and storage areas.  The
3	new West Kennebunk Fire Station has been designed to address both current deficiencies and
4	to provide excess capacity to allow the community to expand its fire protection service in the
5	western  portion  of  the Town  in  the  future.    Approximately  4,060  square  feet of the  new
6	facility  are excess capacity designed  to allow for the  future expansion  of the station's
7	capabilities as demand grows with new development.   This excess capacity includes two plus
8	additional equipment bays (2,600 SF), additional office space (260 SF), and crew quaiters
9	including rest/locker rooms (1,200 SF).
10
11	B.   Need for the improvements
12
13	The current West Kennebunk Fire Station is inadequate for both current and projected needs.
14	The facility cannot accommodate additional  equipment, there are no crew quarters, and
15	storage  and  suppo1t  space  is very  limited.	There  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  the
16	demand  for fire services  in  the  western  pa1t  of the Town  including  the  area west  of the
17	Turnpike.	In   1988,  there  were  approximately  603  dwelling  units  in  the  portion  of  the
18	station's service area west of the Turnpike.  This has grown to  1242 in 2005.   As a result, the
19	Fire Department is planning on adding a tanker to the West Kennebunk station to increase the
20	amount of "water on wheels" available.   In addition, the Depa1tment  is considering moving
21	one of the Town's rescue units to West Kennebunk.  Neither of these can be accommodated
22	in the current facility.
23
24	As development continues in the western  part of Kennebunk, the Fire Department envisions
25	that it will need  to increase the amount of equipment available in West Kennebunk  and re­
26	evaluate  its  staffing  needs.	Therefore,  the  new  building  is  designed  to  provide  excess
27	capacity  beyond  what  is currently  needed  to  allow  for  increased  service  as development
28	occurs within the station's service area.
29
30	C.   Activities subject to the fee
31
32	Any project involving the constrnction of a new building in the portion of Kennebunk within
33	the service area of the West Kennebunk Fire Station is subject to the impact fee (see attached
34	map of the impact fee area).  This includes both residential and non-residential buildings.   In
35	addition, any project that increases the amount of habitable area in a building  for which an
36	impact fee has been paid, shall be subject to an impact fee for any incremental  increase in
37	habitable area for a period  of five (5) years after the payment  of the initial  impact fee.   In
38	addition,  any  project  that  increases  the  habitable  area  of  a  residential   or  nonresidential
39	building by more than four hundred (400) square feet that has not paid an impact fee or that
40	paid the initial impact fee more than five years previous, shall be subject to the impact fee for
41	the incremental increase in habitable area.
42
43	D.  Amount of the fee
44
45	The amount  of the West Kennebunk  Fire  Station  Impact  Fee is $0.42 (forty-two  cents) per
46	square foot of habitable  area to be created as determined  by the Code Enforcement Officer
47	based upon a review of the development plans and the approach used for determining the area
48	of  the  building   for  application   of  the  Building  Penni!  Fee  Schedule.	For  residential
49	properties,  the habitable  area  is the sum of  I 00%  of the residential  area and  100% of any
50	garage area based upon this methodology.  For nonresidential buildings, the habitable area is
51	I 00% of the usable area based upon the methodology.   The amount of the fee is based upon
52	the Impact Fee Methodology for the West Kennebunk Fire Station dated September I, 2006.

5	not  been  approved  by the Planning  Board  or Site Plan  Review  Board  as of September  5,

9	Section 10.	Bicycle Facility Improvements Impact Fee
10
11	A.   Description of the improvements
12
13	The Bicycle Facility Improvements Impact Fee will be used to partially fund the construction
14	of   paved   shoulders   to   accommodate   bicycle   movement   as   set   forth   in   the   Town's
15	Comprehensive   Plan   and   Bicycle   Facility   Improvements   Plan   (see   Bicycle   Facility
16	Improvements Impact Fee Methodology dated April  11, 2006).   This includes improvements
17	in the following areas: Alewife  Road,  High  Street, Cole Road, Maguire  Road, Port  Road,
18	Factory  Pasture  Lane  and  Depot  Street,  Cat  Mousam  Road  and  Mill  Street,  Ross  Road,
19	Thompson  Road, and Western  Avenue.   The proposed  improvements are described in more
20	detail in the methodology.
21
22	B.   Need for the improvements
23
24	Traffic volumes  on  the town's  primaiy  road  network  continues to grow as a result  of
25	continuing  growth  and  development  in  Kennebunk  as well  as development  in surrounding
26	communities that results  in traffic on Kennebunk's  roads.   Many of these roads lack paved
27	shoulders or any provisions to accommodate bicyclists or pedestrians.	Residential  growth
28	creates more bicycle movements that increase conflicts between bicyclists and motor vehicles
29	on the primary  road network resulting in safety concerns.	To address this concern, the
30	Town's Comprehensive Plan recommends  that the Town  develop a network  of bicycle
31	facilities along major roads.
32
33	C.   Activities subject to the fee
34
35	All new residential development  shall be subject to the impact fee.   Any activity, including
36	modifications to existing structures, which results in the creation of a new dwelling unit shall
37	pay the fee.
38
39	D.  Amount of the fee
40
41	The base impact fee for the bicycle improvements  is $450 per dwelling unit.  The amount of
42	the base fee is based upon the Bicycle Facility Improvements Impact Fee Methodology dated
43	April 11, 2006.
44
45	The base impact fee shall be adjusted to account for changes in the cost of construction.   The
46	impact  fee shall  be adjusted  based  upon  the change  in  the ENR  Construction  Cost Index
47	between  June 2006 and the month  in which  the impact fee is paid.   The amount of the fee
48	shall be calculated as follows:
49
50	Impact fee to be paid per dwelling unit= Base impact fee X (ENRCCI for the month in which
51	fee is paid/ENRCCI  for June 2006) where ENRCCI is the national construction cost index
52	published by ENR (Engineering News Record).

Introduction


lean air, clean water and healthy natural systems are all important to the health and well being of American communities, but as Mark Twain once
said, "We take stock of a city like we take stock of a man.
The clothes or appearance are the externals by which we judge." ln other words, community appearance is also important. Unfortunately. many Arnerican communities have gotten used to ugliness, accepting it as inevitable to progress. just look around:
billboards, cluttered com­
mercial strips and look-alike fast food restaurants are all too common across America.

There is an immense but too often ignored relationship between a communit:ys char­ acter and its economic well being. Attractive, well­ planned communities always
 




were designed one at a time. St. Michael's, Maryland, looked somewhat similar to nearby Oxford, but not quite like Chestertown and a whole lot different from Taos, New Mexico, or Beaufort, South Carolina. Regional style predominated, and local variation provided uniqueness.

Today, however the subtle differences between places are
fading and the bigger regional distinctions hardly exist.
Now if you were dropped along a road outside of almost any American city you wouldn't have the slightest idea where you were because it all looks exactly the same. ls it Albany or Allentown, Provi­ dence or Pittsburgh , Balti­ more or Binningham, who can tell?

Placelessness
No two towns are exactly alike. Each has a particular street layout and arrangement of buildings, shaped over time in a particular geography, by a part icular population. The dynamic forces of place, time and culture work to create endless variations on the theme of city. town, vil­ lage or rural area.

At least they used to. In another era local culture and geography played a larger role in the shaping of towns: Build ings were constructed of local materials, regional architectural styles predominated, businesses were locally owned, and building technology was limited .

Over the last 40 years, America's commercial  landscape has progressed from the unique to the uniform,  from the stylized  to  the standard­ ized. A big reason  for this is the proliferation  of chain stores, franchises and big box retailers.

About This Booklet
This booklet is designed to show how new commercial development can be made more amactive, more efficient, more profitable and more compat ible with local commu­ nity identity. This booklet focuses on ways to improve the appearance, design and siting of chain stores, franchises , and big box retailers .

Experience shows that if you accept standard look-alike corporate design, this is what you 'll get. On the other hand, if your communit}' insists on a customized, site­ specific design, that is what you will get. To understand how, see the Lips and suggestions lhat follow.

The bottom line for most chain stores and franchises is securing access to profitable trade areas. They evaluate locations based on Lheir economic potential. If they are asked to address local histo1ic presen-ation, site planning, or architectural concerns, they will usually do so.

Fast-food restaurants, gas stations, convenience stores,
and chain dmg stores are some of the most prominenl

physically as well as economically. But as more communi­
ties have recognized the economic value of preserving their sense of place, lhere increasingly are examples of where these huge companies have adapted their designs or even their locations ro meet local standards.

Today, communities all across Amer ica are working successfully with franchises, chain stores, and big box relailers to get buildings that fit in. See the examples thal follow.

THINGS YOU SHOULD KNO\V:
•	Design review is one means of ensuring the compatibil­
ity of franchise design with local community character.


•	More than 3,000 cities, towns, and counties nation­
\vide exercise some type of design review over new commercial construction . Many others have voluntary
 

design guidelines or use other techniques to get build­ ings to respect local communiLy identity.

11  Chesterfield County, Virginia, Santa Barbara, California,
and Sedona , Arizona, have clone a particularly good
job developing design standards that require franchises and chain stores to fit in with the character of the com­ munity.

•	E\'en without a formal design review ordinance, a com­
munity can develop voluntary design guidelines . These

cation and incentives .


a Chain stores and franchises that respect community character can be found in every region of the country


•	Many communities, including Rockville and Chester­ town, Maryland, have placed limits on the size of commerc.ial buildings to ensure that national retailers are an appropriate scale.

 
•	Other communities limit the amount of land covered by the building, in effect allowing more square footage in additional sto1ies. Gaithersburg, Maryland, for example, limits commercial buildings to 80,000 square feet per floor, thus encouraging multi-story buildings . Target, Kohl's, Toys-R-Us , and olher big-box retailers have con­ structed attractive two-stOl)' buildings in Gaithersburg.

a "Big boxes" can also locate in downtowns or in existing buildings. Both Wal-Mart and Target lm·e developed two-story build ings in several communities. For exam­ ple, Vlal-Man recently opened a store in a mixed-use urban location in long Beach, California, withoUL the usual sea of parking in front. Instead the parking is in two nearby garages . Toys-R-Us has two-sto1y down­ town bu ildings in many communities.

•	A national survey found that a majority of consumers would prefer to shop in a town center with a mix of stores and ciYic buildings rather than in a strip shop­ ping center.
 





The bigger the store, the bigger the parking lot and the wider the roads that lead to it.



















In Gaithersburg, Maryland, the Target is in a two­ story building which means it uses less land, fits better with the community, and is accessible on foot.

Commercial strips are often ugly and congested.


EOPLE LIKE THE CONVENIENCE and low prices of dis­ count stores, supermarkets and chain restaurants, but the same people often complain about the ugli­
ness and traffic congestion associated with commercial strip development. Progress does not require turning every major road corridor into an endless parade of parking lots, pole signs, and bland strip shopping centers. Commercial strips can be redesign ed to make them more atcracrive, less con­ gested, and more convenient for shoppers and pedestrians.


Communities can begin the process of reclaiming existing commercial sn-ips by agreeing to a long-term design pro­ gram that gradually transforms strips into mixed-use
town centers. These steps can help:


1.	Put a finn limit on the length of any commercial district; instead of a longer strip, allow commercial expansion in greater depth. This concentrates commer­ cial uses and encourages shared parking and walking between stores.

2.	Limit   curb  cuts  and  consolidate  entrances  along the road to a few main driveways with internal service streets based on a block system to connect businesses. This relieves traffic back-ups, accidents, and the need for expensive road widening.


3.	Help  unify  the streetscape with continuous  street trees, high-quality parking-lot landscaping and, where

possible , planted medians in the main roadways to
prevent unlimited left-hand turns.


4.	Build  sidewalks and crosswalks throughout the area to encourage shared parking, public transporta ­ tion, and walking between stores and to nearby homes and offices.

5.	Build a street frontage by filling in the front of large
parking lots with small, closely spaced store fronts
with parking behind or on the side.


6.	Provide incentives for the use of attractive, place­ responsive architecture, smaller signs, and m.u1ti-story buildings.

7.	Encourage a mix of other uses, including nearby housing to begin to build a walkable neighborhood rather than a driving-only strip district.

8.	Eradicate  the ugliness by controlling  signs, under­ grounding utility wires, planting street trees and improving the design of new buildings.

A good sign code is pro-business, since an
attractive business district will attract more customers than an ugly one. More- over, when signs are controlled, business­
 
sign can be colorful , decorative, even distinguished .


So why do American communities need to control signs?
The answer is obvious: too often signs are oversized, poorly planned, badly located , and altogether too numerous. Whats more, sign clutter is ugly, costly, and ineffective . And it degrades one of the coun­ try'.s greatest economic assets-its scenic land­ scape.


D1iving down a street clut­
 
es will do a better job of selling at less cost because when
clutter is reduced, consumers actually have an easier time
finding what they are looking for.


A community should con­ sider guidelines for both public and priva te signs. The careful design and placement of traffic signs and other public signs can improve community appearance and aid driv­ ers. A profusion of signs is as confusing as a lack of them.

COMMERCIAL  DEVELOPMENT,  ARIZONA  SIYLE



HERE  ARE  NO  GOLDE!\   ARCHES  in  Sedona,
Arizona. Instead, th ey are turquoise and beige to complement the high desert setting of this South­
western community. Set amid the beauty of northern Ari­ zona's red rock counlry, Sedona is one of the Southwest's most popular and attractive destinations. This is not an accident.

 
Since 1993, Sedona has used comprehensive design review standards to "preserve and enhance Sedona's unique sense of place , one project at a time." To ensure that new development respects and enhances Sec\ona's cultural and environm ental uniqueness, the city's design review manual espouses the following imperatives for new development:


•	Architectural transplants from other locales are neither appropriate nor desirable .

•	The natural environment deserves authenticity and
integrity in the bu ilt environment.
 





McDonald 's, Sedona, Arizona


•	Careful site planni ng is the essential basis for designing and building structures on sensitive, often difficult ter­ rain.

The design ·guidelines were created to provide good design that is responsive to its contextual setting. As a resu lt of the guidelines, the national chains that have located in Sedona have departed from their "off the shelf" designs to construct buildings compatible ·with Sedona's
 
•	Commercial, public facilities, and multi-family residen-	unique character.
tial development can be designed with architectural
 
character that accommodates the structures in hanno­ ny with their natural surroundings.

11  Franchise/monoculture (co1vorate signature) buildings and shallow or artificial imitations or "western" architectural styles are not desirable.
 
Sedona's planning director notes that the city's business
comrnun it)' supports the design review process, "because it realizes that Seclona's continu ed clesirnbility as a tourist destination is dependent on preserving its unique sense of place."
 

 
•	Natural structural rhythms, propor­ tions, and color schemes can enhance environmental surround­ ings.

Lessons  Learned


SK , AND  YOLI  MA\' RECEIVE. Experience shows thar if you accept the standard "cookie-cutter" design, thats what you'll get. On the other hand,
if your community insists on a cust omized, place-respon­
si\•e building, then that is what you'll get. The bottom line for most chain stores is seeming access to good trade areas. They evaluate locations based on their economic potential. If they are required to address local site plan­ ning or architectural concerns, they will usually do so.
Hu nd reds of local communities have successfully worked with national chains and franchises to get buildings  that respect local community ident.ity. Your community can, too.


A  design  review process  is always  desirable, bu t even without a formal design review process , local gov­ ernmems can establish a process of "mandatory re\'iew and voluntary compliance." The mere act of talking about the design of a building will almost always improve it. When coupled with design guidelines and public educa­ tion, requiring developers to discuss design issues as pan of the site plan review process can go a long way toward producing «corporate good neighbor" buildings.

Use incentives  and  public  opinion,  too. ln  cases where chain stores and franchises insist on placing corpo­ rate interest over community interest, local government can use a variety of regulations and incemives to foster compatibility between franchises and communities. These include incenti\·es, such as relaxed parking standards, density bonuses, and tax credits, as well as regulatory techniques such as limits on store size or foorprint, his­ toric districts, design guidelines and review, conditional use permits, site plan review, corridor overlay zones, sign controls, and landscape ordinances. However, with or without legal tools. no community should forget the power of publi c opinion. Many of the successes featured here grew out or publi c calls for a site-specific design or for saving a cherished building .


Control  the signs. Garish,  O\'ersized  signs are  one of  the more objectionable aspects of franchises and chains. Left unchecked,  the "copy-cat" logi c of corporate competition
 




often results in an un igh tly clutter of portable signs, pole signs, plasti c pennants, flapping flags, and twirling streamers all shouting for attention. Experience shows
that sign clutter is ugly, costly, and inelfective. Experience also shows that when signs are controlled , franchises do a better job  of selling at less cost, because sh oppers can
now find what they are looking for. When it comes to sig­
nage, businesses want a level playing field. They can com­ pete for attention with 1oq-foot-tall signs or 10-foot-tall signs. Either way, the burgers raste the same.

The keys to success. Nat ional corporations and their local franchises are more likely to agree to design modifi­ cations when:

•	Design object ives are clearly stated. The developer and architects should know in advance what criteria wi11 be applied  to the proposed  project.


•	The local government  offers pre-application meetings .
Misunderstandings can be avoided if the national com­
pany is given a chance to meet in fom1Rlly with staff and commission members prior to submitt ing a formal application.

11 Visual design guidelines are available. Many communi­ ties no longer rely solely on written design standards. They have adopted visua l design guides that graphical­ ly depict what constitm es a compatible design .

•	Local government understands that it has leverage whene\'er a building applicant req uests a variance, a rezoning, or other consideration from the city or county.

•	Local groups know when to compromise. Fast food companies care a lot more about some things than oth­ rs. For example, they are much more adama nt about having a driYe-thru than they are about architectural styles or sign heights.


•	There is organized community support for historic preservation or urban design standards.

The Design Standards for Kennebunk's Portland Road and York Street Commer­ cial Districts have been developed as a guide to the appearance, form and functioning of new development occurring along the Portland Road and York Street Corridors in furtherance of the Town's Comprehensive Plan Economic Strategy 2 - D which states:


"Every effort should be made to develop and apply design standards to all com­ mercial and industrial areas which are sensitive to and enhance community character and livability, including standards which promote aesthetic building design, reduce the number of curb cuts, improve the design of parking lots and provide pedestrian friendly standards for all commercial areas."



These standards are meant to illustrate and expand upon the Design Review Standards provided in Article 10, Section 23 of the Zoning Ordinance and are intended to be used as a guide for developers, design professionals, Planning Board and Site Review Board members , and Town Staff.


These Design Standards are presented in six sections: Definitions
Site Planning Architectural Landscaping Signage Lighting










The Kennebunk Planning Board has approved  these Design Standards  in an effort to assist applicants in designing proposals which will comply with the town's design goals. Please note that  the town has utilized information I photos from several other town design standards  manuals -  including those from Falmouth, Maine, Scarborough, Maine, Newburgh, New York and Perth, Canada.

OBJECTIVES

All development activities shall be characterized by safe, user-friendly, and efficient traffic flow. Access management principles shall be followed to reduce the number of curb cuts, provide a safer vehicular and pedestrian environment, encourage intra-parcel travel , and minimi ze the number of trips on roadways.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Curb Cuts on Major Roads. Site plans shall  be designed to minimize the number of curb cuts on major roadways to increase vehicular and pedestrian safety.

Shared Access. Entrances to abutting commercial prope1iies shall be combined to the maximum extent possible.

Internal Traffic Flow. To ensure the safety of motorists, delivery trucks, and pedestrians, the site plan shall clearly delineate internal traffic patterns. Site plans shall be designed by a professional engineer. Parking space, directional arrows, crosswalks, and other markings on the ground shall be delineated with pavement paint or other suitable material to  ensure safe  circulation .

Internal  Connections.  Connections  between parking lots and driveways on adjacent parcels shall be provided to facilitate deliveries and minimize turning movements onto major roadways. Internal connections shall provide safe, direct access between adjacent lots in a manner that prevents them from becoming vehicular shortcuts. Cross easement s shall be provided as required to facilitate circulation. The site plan shall anticipate future vehicular connections to abutting undeveloped property.

Internal Pedestrian Connections. Safe pedeshian connections between abutting land uses shall be provided where possible to encourage foot traffic and minimize vehicular movement.

Traffic Calming. Traffic calming measures shall be included where appropriate to discourage speeding within the site and between abutting properties. Measures may include speed tables, on-street parking, raised crosswalks, vertical curbing, curvilinear road alignment, roadside plantings, neck-
 
downs, curbed islands, and signage.

Drive-Throughs. Access routes leading to or from takeout windows or other drive-throughs shall minimize conflicts with pedestrian circulation routes. Motorists shall be made aware of pedestrians through signage, lighting, raised crosswalks, changes in paving, or other devices. The site plan shall be designed to prevent queuing in parking lots or other areas which would cause congestion or unsafe conditions. Pedestrian safety shall be an important consideration in the design of access routes leading to or from auto-oriented uses. Site layout shall minimize conflicts with pedestrian access to the on­ site businesses, to businesses on adjacent sites, and to public sidewalks.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Movement. The circulation plan shall provide safe pedestrian and bicycle movement within the site. The plan shall demonstrate how linkages can be made to adjacent properties , both developed and undeveloped. Pedestrian and bicycle connections between abutting properties shall be coordinated with vehicular routes to encourage foot traffic and minimize vehicular movement.

Refuge Zones. Pedestrian islands (five  feet minimum width) shall be installed in driveways and streets where the crossing distance is greater than 32 ft.

 

This curbed, landscaped island divides entering and exiting traffic. The identification sign is located away from the intersection to avoid interfering with the motorists' line of sight.

Site Planning/4
 
CIRCULATION PLANNING
 






Outparcel Development. Plans for multi-building developments shall accommodate future buildings , access roads, sidewalk s, esplanades, and signage in a coordinated fashion. (See Multiple Building Dev. Standards for additional standards )

Service Drives. Service drives shall be separated from internal walkways, parking areas, or pedestrian use areas by  landscaped islands, grade changes, or other devices to minimize pedestrian contact.

 

This planted bed serves as an attractive way to separate entering and exiting traffic. The planting bed has also helped pr eserve a large, mature tree located on the site.






 

This fast-food restaurant is an outparcel of a larger commercial retail development Circulation, including drive­ through, parking , and pedestrian access, has been carefully integrated into the surrounding site.
 



 
An island provides a refuge zone for pedestrians crossing this wide driveway Permanent crosswalks would have minimized annual maintenance costs.












 

The predominance of curb cuts along this roadway creates an unsafe/uninviting environment for  thepedestrian.
 

===--=======================================================
Site Planning/5
 
=================================================================

 
OBJECTIVES

Parking lots shall be designed to complement adjacent buildings, the site, and the commercial district without becoming  a dominant visual element. Every effort shall be made to reduce the scale of parking lots by minimizing the total amount of paved surface visible from the road .

Parking lots shall be designed as inviting, pedestrian
-friendly places by careful attention to landscaping, lighting, and internal walkways. With proper planning, parking lots can balance the needs of both the vehicle and the pedestrian.



DESIGN STANDARDS
In addition to the Site Plan Review  Standards  of Art. 11, Section 8. , these standards shall be used in the design and layout of parking lots.

Siting. The majority of parking areas shall be located at the rear or sides of commercial buildings , except where parking would be located adjacent to a residential neighborhood, or when included as part of a multi-building site plan (see pp. 13-14). Where land use conflicts occur, (e.g., unavoidable siting of a parking lot next to a home) the lot shall be screened with evergreen trees, earth berms, fences, or shrubs.

Orientation. Parking lots shall be designed as part of the overall plan for the site, and coordinated with building entrances, lighting, and landscaping.

Scale. The scale of parking areas with more than 1s spaces shall be broken up with trees, landscaped islands, grade changes, low walls, or other appropriate features.

Relationship to Buildings. Paved surfaces of parking lots shall be separated from buildings by a minimum of five feet of landscaping and/or a paved walkway. The width of the landscaping shall be proportional to the height of the building.

Screening. Where front parking is permitted between the building and the road, it shall be screened   by   berms,   fencing,   low   walls,   trees,
 
shrubs, perennial masses, or a combination of elements. The ultimate height of the screen shall be 3± feet to minimize the view of the vehicle while still providing a clear view of the building and signage.

Landscaping in Parking Lots. Between 10% and 15% of the parking lot shall be landscaped. The higher percentage shall be used for larger lots (more than 40 cars) and those that are most exposed to public view. Planting islands shall be a minimum of 9' in width. All parking lot landscaping shall be hearty and appropriate for parking lot conditions. Natural groupings or clusters of trees are also encouraged. See Landscaping for further standards.

Dead End Parking Lots. Parking lots with a single point of access are strongly discouraged. Dead-end parking lots shall not contain more than ten spaces. Where dead-end lots are unavoidable, they shall not contain more than 10 spaces, and shall be designed to safely tum a vehicle around without having to back out.
Shared   Parking.   Shared   parking   is   strongly
encouraged , particularly where abutting land uses have differing hours of peak parking demand. Cross easements may be required to allow shared parking.

Safety. Crosswalks shall be marked by a change in pavement texture, pattern , or color to maximize


 

An attractively landscaped parking lot that is a positive asset to	the surrounding commercial area. Bikeracks are conveniently situated near surrounding shops.
 

================================================================  =============
Site Planning/6

pedestrian safety in parking areas and other potentially hazardous areas. Care shall be taken in the selection of shrubs, ornamental  grasses,  walls, or other landscape elements to maintain visibility.

Side Lot Parking. Parking on the side of buildings shall not extend closer to the street than the front fac;ade, and shall such parking shall conform to the Art. I 0, Section 23. Design Critera. The space between the end of the parking lot and the roadway shall be landscaped according to an overall plan for the property.

Snow Storage. Provisions shall be made for snow storage in the design of all parking areas. The areas shall be shown on the Site Plan to avoid conflicts with landscaping, visibility, drainage, or  icing during winter months.

Buildings in Existing Parking Lots. The development of smaller commercial buildings on out-parcels is strongly encouraged to break up the scale of large parking areas.





 





Landscaped islands should have been used here to provide scale, reinforce internal circulation, and guide pedestrians.

PEDESTRIAN SPACES
==================================================---===========================

OBJECTIVES

Entrances to buildings shall be designed to provide outdoor spaces for a variety of uses -seating/resting, dining, displays, and aesthetic enhancement - to create a pedestrian-friendly  environment.

DESIGN STANDARDS

 
Planning. Outdoor use areas should be located in sunny, highly visible locations and sized to fit the anticipated uses. The design should be a collaborative effort between architect, landscape architect, engineers, artists, . and other design professionals.

Materials. Outdoor  use  areas  shall be  constructed of high quality, easily maintained  materials. All elements within the space shall be coordinated with the architecture and site elements to achieve a unified look. The use of decorative paving is encouraged for sitting areas, pedestrian plazas, building entrances, or other designed open spaces. See Landscaping for plantings and street furniture standards.

Entrances. Major entrances to new or renovated buildings shall be emphasized through the use of canopies, recessed entries, seating areas, decorative plantings and lighting, sculpture,  and  other elements.

PUBLIC SIDEWALKS
==============================================================---=================

 
OBJECTIVES

Public sidewalks shall be provided  along the Route
1 street frontage. Existing and proposed road corridors should iriclude sidewalks, planted esplanades, crosswalks, and pedestrian amenities to encourage a safe flow of non-motorized traffic.

There are many areas within the town's commercial districts which are not pedestrian or bicycle friendly. The long term objective is to encourage an interconnected network of sidewalks and bike lanes that encourage both pedestrian and bicycle activity.



DESIGN STANDARDS

Public Sidewalks. Sidewalks  and  planted esplanades shall be provided within or near the right­ of-way on both sides of all streets to encourage safe pedestrian movement. Facilities shall be coordinated with abutting land uses to create interconnections throughout the commercial area and linkages to surrounding residential neighborhoods. lighting and other amenities abutting walkways should be at human scale.

Coordination with Site Plan. All new sidewalks shall be coordinated with the Site Plan to avoid conflicts with landscaping, utilities,  grading, drainage structures, signs, and other elements. All sidewalks shall be designed to facilitate snow removal and allow year-round use. Sheet flow of stormwater across sidewalks shall be avoided. Underground storm drainage systems are strongly encouraged .

Material Selection. Bituminous sidewalks with granite curbing shall be used on sidewalks within the public  ROW.

Crosswalks. Where sidewalks intersect with commercial drives or roads, crosswalks shall be installed to alert the motorist and improve visibility. Crosswalks shall offer a noticeable change in texture and color. Materials for crosswalks shall be highly durable and slip resistant.
 
Lighting. Sidewalks shall be lit to the minimum standards recommended by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) to promote safe use during evening hours.

Accessibility. All new and renovated facilities shall be located, designed, and detailed in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as revised .

Site Planning/9
 



 
OBJECTIVES

Commercial properties shall provide attractive, safe,
and functional walkways between the public right-of
-way and the main entrance. Internal walkways shall invite pedestrians onto the property and make them feel welcome.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Internal Walkways. Continuous internal walkways shall be provided from the public sidewalk to the principal customer entrance of all p1in cipal buildings on the site. At a minimum, walkways shall connect focal points of pedestrian activity such as, but not limited to, transit stops, street crossings, and building entrances.

Location. Walkways shall be located where motorists can anticipate ped estrians and react accordingly. likewise, walkways shall be designed to give the pedestrian a full view of oncoming vehicles, with minim al interference from trees, shrubs, and parked cars. Walkways shall avoid drive-through lanes, access and service drives, and other high-traffic routes. Traffic control signs, light fixtures, trees, or other potential  obstacles shall be located far enough from walkways to prevent interference with pedestrian movement.

 
An internal walkways that is an integral part of Jhe site plan.
 
Orientation. Walkways in parking lots shall be aligned with the main entry or a focal point on the building to assist in wayfinding .

Curbing. Internal walkways  shall be separated from parking bays and/or travel lanes by raised curbing. Granite is preferred for its longevity, low maintenance, and appearance.

Width. Internal walkways shall be a minimum of five feet wide to allow two people to pass comfortabl y. Additional width may be necessary in certain conditions, e.g., where shopping carts may be used, where heavy pedestrian traffic  is anticipated, or where cars over hang the walkway.


 

This circulation  system results in excessive width in front of the storefron ts and creates an auto-oriented  environment. The paint ed walkway offers little contrast and leads to theparking aisle.
 
This raised walkway provides a high level of contrast with the surrounding parking lot However the width  is compromised by the overhang of cars, making  p edestrian  movement difficult.
 

============================== ==============
Site Planning/10
 
====--====================·===========================


 
Coordination with Landscaping. Areas adjacent to walkways shall be landscaped with trees, shrubs, benches, flower beds, ground covers, or other such materials. Walkways in parking lots shall include landscaped islands to provide visual relief, shade, and scale. Shrubs shall be used with care to avoid blind spots. Special features, such as benches, flower beds, planter s, and artwork can be used to enhance the walkway. Trees along all  walkways shall be tiirnmed to provide adequate sight distance and to remove potential obstacles. Vertical clear­ ances of at least eight feet shall be maintained.


 
An internal walkway oriented toward the main ent1y of a restaurant.  The planting  strips with ornamenta l grasses  and p erennials separate the pathway from  vehicles.

Crosswalks. Internal crosswalks shall be marked by a change in pavement texture, pattern, or color to maximize pedestrian safety in parking areas and other potentially hazardous areas. The materials selected for road crossings shall be highly durable and low maintenance. Raised crosswalks shall be considered at key locations as a traffic calming device to make crosswalks more visible. Signs may be wan·an ted in certain situations as determined by the Institute for Traffic Engineers (ITE). Materials selected for crosswalks shall allow safe bicycle movement across the surface.

Lighting. A minimum level of lighting shall be provided , following the current standards of the Illuminatin g Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) and the standards of Art. 10, Section 6, to safely guide the pedestrian from the front entrance to the parking lot and/or the public sidewalk.
 
Drainage. Sheet flow of stormwater across walkways shall be avoided. Culverts shall be sized to prevent ponding and provide uninterrupted use of the walkway .

Maintenance. All internal walkways shall be designed to facilitate maintenance by the property owner. The site plan shall coordinate the location of walkways with utilities, plantings, drainage, and other site elements that could affect long-term maintenance.



 
Decorative plantings can add to the attractiveness of walkways
while helping to set them apartfrom parking  lots.

MULTIPLE BUILDING DEVELOPMENTS
============= ==================================================================


OBJECTIVES

Multiple building development s shall exhibit a high degree of coordination in site planning , architectural design, site design, and site detailing. Their physical components shall be designed to complement an overall plan.

DESIGN STANDARDS

 
Master Plan. For multi-building developments (MBD's), a conceptual master plan shall be prepared to show the Town the general location of future buildings, parking lots, roads and driveways, walkways, common open spaces, utilities, service areas, stormwater management, and other components of site development. The master plan shall also show how traffic, stormwater , and utilities will be coordinated with adjacent properties. The plan shall also illustrate the measures that will be taken to preserve significant natural or cultural features, such as wetlands, specimen trees, or stone walls.

Phasing Plan. As part of the Site Plan application, the applicant shall provide a phasing plan that illustrates the sequence of development and what steps will be taken to ensure compatibility between current and future activities.

Building Orientation. All buildings in MBD's shall be oriented to create usable, safe and attractive pedestrian spaces, preserve significant site features, and minimize the appearance of parking areas.
 




The buildings in this MBD have been sited to reinforce pedestrian circulation patterns and reduce the scale of the overall development.

Focal Points. In MBD's, a limited number of buildings or other elements shall be designed as focal points. These structures shall be visually more prominent, enhanced by height, massing, distinctive architectural treatment, lighting, landscaping, or other distinguishing features.

Outdoor Spaces. MBD's shall include outdoor use areas such as greens, plazas, and courtyards. Buildings may be oriented toward open spaces rather than roadways. In these situations buildings shall have a major access on the space as well as a secondary access point(s) oriented to parking areas. Outdoor spaces shall be coordinated with the pedestrian circulation plan to encourage pedestrian use, with provisions for seating and outdoor activities. Outdoor spaces shall be designed to separate pedestrian and vehicular traffic with landscaping, grade changes, and other site features.
 


 
Similar roof pitches, pedestrian use areas, and traditional building materials help unify this multi-building development.

MULTIPLE BUILDING DEVELOPMENTS
===============================================================================

Drive Through Facilities. Where drive-through facilities are a component of a MBD, the building and site plan shall emphasize pedestrian access.



Lighting Plan. Site lighting for MBD's shall be coordinated with all  other elements of the site. A lighting pl an shall be prepared by a qualified lighting professional and submitted to the Board as part of review process.
(see lighting standard s in Zoning Alt I0, Sec 6) .

 
Landscape Plan. Landscaping for MBD's shall be coordinated with all other elements of the site. As part of the application for Site Plan approval, applicants shall submit a master landscape plan that shows how landscaping will be used to complement proposed buildings, reinforce circulation paths, help define pedestrian use areas, highlight entrances, provides shade, and adds seasonal interest to the landscape . See Landscaping Chapter for further standard s on landscape materials.




 

This MBD  is  unified  by  a  common  architectural  style  and
coordinated landscaping, lighting, and outdoor spaces.




Shared Stormwater Management. Wherever appropri ate, treatment basins shall be designed to be shared by multiple building sites to minimize the land area devoted to stormwater managemen t.

================================================================================
 

OBJECTIVES

Service areas shall be integrated into the overall site plan. They shall be designed to meet the functional needs of the facility while minimizing any traffic or visual conflicts, audible noise, or smells.

DESIGN  STANDARDS

Locations. All facilities for service, including waste collection and storage facilities, off-street  loading and unloading areas, loading  docks,  storage facilities, dumpsters, fueling areas, and vehicle service and maintenance areas, shall be located at the side or rear of the principal building. Locations that face public roadways or abutting residential properties shall be avoided. Overhead doors or other vehicle entrances or exits shall not be located on any fa9ade that faces a public street or residential neighborhood.

Design. Service areas shall be sized to fit the specific needs of the building and its intended operations. The smallest size needed to meet the building's requirements is encouraged .

Screening. Service areas shall be screened to minimize visibility from  sensitive viewpoints  such as public and p1i vate roadways, main entrances, abutting neighborhoods, public open spaces, and pathways in these situations. Service areas shall be screened with architectural elements such as walls or fences. Screening may be further enhanced with evergreen trees, shrubs, and earth be1ms.

Screening Design. Structural screens and fencing shall complement the design of the main structure by repetition of materials, detailing, scale, and color. Where chain link fencing is required for safety, it shall be landscaped and painted black or a similar dark color, or coated with dark vinyl. Plastic slats in chain link fencing are not permitted. Gates shall be designed to prevent sagging.

Service Access. Service areas shall be sited to accommodate the turning movements of vehicles used for trash pickup, deliveries, and similar functions without conflicting with other vehicles.
 

Coordination. Prior to Town  submittal,  the applicant shall contact the representatives of utility companies, fuel suppliers, trash haulers, the fire department, and others who may have input into the design and siting of service areas and facilities.

Protection. Where architectural screening or freestanding fencing is used for screening, it shall be protected with granite posts or concrete filled steel bollards, or reinforced in a manner that will prevent damage from service vehicles.

Recycling Facilities. The installation and use of recycling bins is encouraged. All recycling facilities shall be screened in a manner similar to other service areas. Dumpsters and recycling areas shall be consolidated where possible.

BUFFERING &  SCREENING






OBJECTIVES

 
Buffering or screening will be required in certain areas to ensure compatibility  between unharmonious land uses, particularly between commercial and residential prope1iies. Plantings, earth be1ms . Stone walls, grade changes, fences, distance, and other means can be used effectively to create the necessary visual and psychological separation.








DESIGN STANDARDS



Design . Buffers and screens shall be considered an integral part of the Site Plan. Stone walls, planting s, fencing, landform s, etc. used for buffers shall be similar in form, texture, scale, and appearance to other landscape elements. Structural measures (e.g., screening walls) shall likewise be related to the architecture in tenns of scale, materials, forms, and surface treatment.



Landscape  buffers  can  separa te  land  uses  and  soften  the
pr esence of buildings.
 










Maintenance. Buffers shall be maintained in a condition that assures their continual effectiveness. Where plantings do not survive, or grow to a point where they no longer serve as effective buffers , they shall be replaced to meet the intent of the approved plan. Walls, fencing, or other fonns of screening likewise shall be maintained in good condition.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
=====================================================--==========================

 
OBJECTIVES

To comply with Town requirements and MeDEP Stormwater Management law, site plans may be required to incorporate treatment basins or other measures to maintain the quality of stormwater runoff. All stormwater management areas shall be treated as integral and attractive parts of the landscape.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Location. Where stormwater treatment basins or other related facilities are required , they shall be located in the least visible portion of the site. Where visible, they should be graded to confonn to natural contours and planted to integrate them into the natural landscape.

Design. Stormwater treatment basins shall be patterned after naturalistic landforms , avoiding hard geometric shapes. Side slopes shall be landscaped with appropriate plantings to reduce erosion and screen the basin. Islands can be effective  in breaking up the mass of a treatment pond while increasing habitat opportunities.

Grading. Abrupt changes in grades and steep side slopes (>3:1) shall be avoided. Transitiona l grading shall be used to blend all earthworks into the natural contours of the land where possible.

Structures. Man-m ade drainage strnctures (e.g., culverts, manhol es, and outfalls) that are visible from roadways or residential neighborhoods shall be screened with vegetation or treated to reduce their visibility and integrate them into the landscape.

Planting Design. Plantings used in stormwat er treatment pond s should be designed by a qualified professional familiar with the growing requirements of wetland species.

Shared Basins. Wherever appropriate, treatment basins shall be designed to be shared by abutting properties to minimize the amount of land area devoted to stormwater man agement.
 


Rip-Rap. Where ground protection is necessary in highly visible locations (e.g., at spillways and culverts), it shall be constructed of  hand-placed rock or geo-grid, rather than coarse rip-rap. The use of coarse crushed rock in visible roadside ditches is discouraged. The use of Permeon (Desert Varnish) is encouraged to hasten the weathering process on rip-rap and other stone surfaces.

INTRODUCTION

These Design Standards establish criteria for new or renovated buildings in Kennebunk's commercial districts. They anticipate a greater sense of continuity and identity by illustrating high quality architectural design. They are not intended to dictate building styles.

Architectural Goals

Architecture that offers a positive experience from three perspectives: by the motorist driving along the road corridor, by the pedestrian viewing the buildings up close, and in relation to surrounding buildings that tie into the community's identity.

•	Good neighborhood buildings that thoughtfully consider scale, form, orientation, height, setback, massing, matelials , and architectural features.

•	Buildings that are designed to human scale that address the comfort, enjoyment, and safety of the users.

•	Buildings that are designed as pennanent, positive additions to the commercial district , constructed	of   high   quality,    long    lasting m ate1ials.

•	Street comers that are treated as special places.

•	Architecture that utilizes energy conservation
measures wherever possible.

•	Older buildings that are restored and/or reused to maintain  the integrity of            historic he1itage.

============================================================================--===

 
OBJECTIVES

The purpose of these standards is to encourage architecture within Kennebunk's  commercial districts that draws its inspiration from traditional New England examples. Building design shall reinforce a human scaled  environment through careful consideration of architectural fonns, massing, detailing, number and use  of  materials, and color.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Design. New buildings shall be designed to fit the individual characteristics of their particular site. The architecture shall be influenced by traditional New England building forms and town-making patterns, the specific needs of the intended users, the nature of the intended use, and other site-specific factors. Contemporary architectural styles are approp1iate, provided they meet these standards.

Human Scale. Buildings and site elements shall be designed to human scale. The forms, massing, and openings of buildings shall be proportional to the size of a human figure. Many architectural elements can add scale to a building: watertables, integral planters, recessed openings, windows with divided panes, building mounted light fixtures, dormers, cupolas, projecting rooflines, covered walkways, colonnades, and similar features.

Licensed Architects. Any structure subject to site plan review shall be designed by an architect licensed in the State of Maine.

Freestanding  Accessory  Structures.   Non­ habitable structures, such as freestanding ATMs, garages, service stations, canopies, storage units, recycling sheds, trash enclosures, cart corrals, and utility buildings shall meet the same design standards as the principal building(s) on the site. The design of freestanding structures shall be coordinated with the principal building through repetition of architectural forms, materials, colors, and detailing.
 
Energy  Conscious  Design.   Commercial architecture and site planning shall promote energy conservation wherever possible. Consideration shall be given to solar orientation and siting, use of maximum ins dating materials, reduced lighting loads, and landscaping for windbreaks and shading.

 


 


 

Examples of high quality Maine  architecture  -a  medical office, a retail store, and a library -that have been designed at human scale and fit  their unique sites.

RENOVATIONS AND ADDITIONS
======================--=========================================================

 
OBJECTIVES

Many existing commercial buildings may be coming through plan review as they undergo major renovation s or additions. This is an opportunity to add visual interest to the building and to strengthen its relation ship with the site and nearby structures. The Town expects high quality architectural and site design for all renovated structures.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Alterations. Where the existing buildin g cmTently meets the design standards, proposed renovations must be designed to respect the propo11ions, fenes­ tration patterns, and details of the original buildin g. Where the existing building does not meet the design standard s, the owner is strongly encouraged to upgrad e the entire structure.

Design. Application s that involve renovations and additions shall show all improvem ents as well as the existing structure. A narrative shall accompany the application which explains the designer's intent to relate the old with the new.

Materials.  Where existing buildings meet the design standards, additions or renovations shall compl ement or match the materials, form, color, and detailing of the original  structure.  Where the  original build ing does  not   meet   the   standard s,   the   owner   shall demonstrate	how	the	mat erials	used	in	the renovation will complement the existing structure. Architectural Features. Renovations shall retain any distinctive  architectural   features   or   examples  of skilled craftsmanship.

FA9ADEDESIGN
------- - --------- ----- ------	----	--	----------  --

 
OBJECTIVES

All buildings shall present an inviting, human scaled facade to  the street, internal drives, parking areas, and surrounding neighborhoods. Wherever possible, entrances shall be clearly visible from the street and reinforced through site and architectural features.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Facade Treatment. The facade containing the main entrance shall be treated as a front facade and shall be designed in a manner that is consistent with the design standards. Building entrances shall be designed to be visible from the street and provide unobstrncted areas for pedestrians. The front facade shall contain a clearly defined , highly visible customer entrance and three or more of the following elements to add scale to the building:
•	canopies
•	overhanging   rooflines   to   provide   shelter   for pedestrian s
•	recesses or projections in keeping with the scale of the building
•	arcad es
•	raised corniced parapets over entrances
•	gables and donners
•	pilasters
•	peaked roof forms
•	outdoor sifting or dining areas
•	display   windows   that   are   visible   from   the
sidewalk
•	architectural details such as moldings which are
integrated into the buildin g design
•	other  features which  are designed to add scale and visual interest to the facade.

For retail strnctures, the front facade or any other facade that faces a public or private street shall have display windows, entry areas, or other transparent features along 40% or more of its horizontal length. This standard may be waived if other architectural elements are used to provide scale and visual interest to the front facade in keeping with these Design Standards.

Offsets . No uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed 100 horizontal feet. Facades greater than 100
 
feet in length shall incorporate wall plane projections or recesses having a depth of at least 3% of  the length of the facade and extending at least 20 percent of the length of the facade. Where the plane of a wall is broken, the offset shall be proportional to the building's height and length. Strong shadow lines, changes in rooflines, pilasters and other architectural details, pattern s in the surface material , and wall openings can all be effectively used to add visual interest and scale to the facade. Projections used to break up the mass of the building shall extend to the ground .

Rear and Side Facades. Blank walls facing public road s, residential neighborhood s, or abutting properties are prohibited. Where rear or side facades are visible from adjacent properties or roadways they shall be designed to  match or complement the architectural treatment of the piimary facade to give it scale and visual interest.



 

 

Facade treatments on these two commercial buildings wrap around the corners to pres ent a unified design from all visible faces.

Site Design. Signage, lighting, landscaping,  and other exterior elements shall all be designed to complement and be in scale with the facade, avoid visual or functional conflicts, and retain visibility.

Trim. Windows, door openings,  ventilation openings, and other forms of exterior fenestration in frame construction shall be trimmed.

Window Shapes. Windows should be vertical m orientation, or square.

Shutters. If shutters are used, they must be sized to fit the openings and provided for all windows on a given wall.




















While thefron t plane of the wall of this building is broken, the offset does not continue to the ground . The p rojection becomes a billboard and the building is seen as a large box.

 
The sca le of this 'big box 'has been effectively reduced by architectural elements and detailing. The overhang provides protec tionfor pedes trians and emphasizes the entrance.
 


 


 

 
Three views of  a branch bank set in a mixed-use  village setting. Allfacades were treated with equal importance. The front   (top) faces  the street and  is built  to  the sidewalk, encouraging pedestrian  traffic. The  side  of  the  building (middle) f acing a single famil y home is residential in scale and design. The canopy  at the rear  (bottom) provides  a transition  area  between  the  parking   lot  and  the  back
entrance.

FACADE DESIGN



Functional Elements. All vents, downspouts, flashing, electrical conduits, meters, HVAC equipment, service areas, loading docks, service connections, and other functional elements shall be treated as integral parts of the architecture , starting at the conceptual building design phase.  When these elements need to be part of the fac;ade (e.g., downspouts, vents) they shall be incorporated  into the architecture through detailing or m atching colors. Meters, utility banks, HVAC equipment , and other exterior service elements shall be contained  in service closets, behind walls, or located out of view from the publi c. Building elevations presented for review shall show the location and treatment of all functional elements.

Vending Machines. Where vending machines are provided, they shall be sited in locations that are not visible from the street. The site plan and architectura l elevations shall show the location of all vending machines.

Illustrations. All elevations of proposed buildings shall be evaluated as part of the design review. The Review Board may request perspectives of the building to illustrate the three-dimensional relationship between the front and side elevations. Elevations and perspective drawings shall include all l andscape elements (trees, shrubs, lighting, street furnishings, etc.) that will be seen in conjunction with the fac;ade.



 
The building's meters and service connections are located out
of sight in this service cabinet.

BUILDING MATERIALS
===============================================================================

 
OBJECTIVES

Building materials shall be treated as significant design elements that define the appearance of  the structure and strengthen the sense of identity throughout Kennebunk. The use of materials  that give the appearance of New England architecture is strongly encouraged.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Materials Encouraged. Traditional, high-quality building materials common to northern New England (e.g., brick, clapboard , shingles or other similar products) shall be used as the primary  siding material. Contemporary materials that have the same visual characteristics (e.g., cement plank clapboards or vinyl siding) are acceptable if attention is paid to detailing (e.g., corners, trim at openings, changes in material). Painted MDO plywood is acceptable when used in combination with traditional materials to give it scale. Long-tenn maintenance needs shall be a consideration in the selection of all building materials.

Materials Prohibited.  Highly  reflective  or processed materials (e.g., metal or plastic panels , brushed aluminum, bronzed glass, concrete block , T-111, untreated plywood , dryvit, etc.) and multicolored brick (incorporating occasional white bricks in a random pattern) shall not be used on the primary or front-facing facade.

Colors. Traditional colors commonly found in New England villages are appropriate for all components of the building. Facade colors shall be low reflectance. The use of high intensity, high reflectance, chrome, metallic, or fluorescent colors or black is prohibited as the primary color.
 
Trim. Where trim is used, it shall be a color that complements to the building's primary color. Neon tubing shall not be allowed as an exterior trim or accent material.

Detailing. Arbitrary changes in materials or embellishments that are not in keeping with the rest of the building are discouraged.
 

 

Cement  plank   clapboard  is  a  new  material  that  resembles	Three buildings  that  use traditional  materials:  brick, granite, traditional wooden siding with less maintenance.	and wood.

AWNINGS & CANOPIES
====--==============--==--==--==--===--======= ==================

OBJECTIVES

Awnings and canopies can enhance the appearance and function of a building by providing shade, shelter, shadow patterns, and visual interest. Where awnings are used, they shall complement the design, materials , color, and appearance of the building.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Location. Where awnings are used, both fixed or retractable , they shall be an integral element of the architecture. Awnings shall be located directly over windows or doors to provide protection from the elements.

 
Materials. Awnings and canopies shall not be made of reflective materials, such as metal or plastic. Their color shall match or complement the facade of the building.

Design Elements. Graphics used on awnings for identification or advertising shall be designed as an integral part of the signage program for the property , and shall be coordinated with other sign elements in te1ms of typeface, color, and spacing. Awnings shall not be used as advertising features or light sources. Backlit awnings are prohibited. Graphics on canopies are counted toward the total signage area.
 


Canopies over the doorways emphasize the main entrance and provide effective prote ctionfrom  the elements.
 








 

Backlit,   highly  reflective  canopies   are  not  appropriate   in Kennebunk.   These canopies (above and to the right) function primarily as a large signs, which is not acceptable.

'	ROOF LINES
======--=========---===============================================

 
OBJECTIVES

Rooflines shall be designed to provide diversity in the form of the building and add visual interest to the streetscape. When used properly, rooflines  can reduce the mass of large buildings , emphasize entrances, and provide shelter and shade for the pedestrian.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Pitched Roofs. Buildings with pitched roofs are strongly encouraged. Where pitched roofs are used, the minimal pitch shall be at least 5/12. Projecting rooflines shall be designed to create strong shade/ shadow pattern s.

Shapes to be Avoided . False mansard, A-frames, and other non-traditional roof forms shall not be used as the primary roofline.

Flat Roofs. Flat roofs, especi ally on single-story isolated buildings, are discouraged in most applications. Where flat rooflines are used,  the design shall create no horizontal  line greater  than 100 feet without a break, using features  found on traditional New England buildings. See pp. 15-16 Large  Scale  Buildings  for  additional   design stand ards.

Parapets. Where parapets are used to break up a flat roofline, the height of the parapet shall be at least five percent of the total length of the wall.

Preferred Materials for Pitched Roofs. Composite asphalt shingles and standing-seam non-glare metal are preferred for visible roofing. High gloss roofing mate1ials shall not be used. Roofing materials shall complement the color and  texture of the building's facade. Roof colors shall be muted earth tones or a color that is darker than the facade. Shipes and patterns on the roof are strongly discouraged.

Roof-Mounted Equipment. Mechanical and other equipment mounted on rooftops must be screened from public view or grouped in a location where visibility is limited. Where used, screening for roof­ mounted equipment shall be designed as an integral part of the architecture to complement the building's mass and appearance.
 


Roof-Mounted Signs. Roof mounted signs are prohibited by the Sign Regulations in the Zoning Ordinance..






 


The scale of this linear shopping plaza has been effectively reduced through variations in roof plan es, dormers and a cupola.


 

Standing seam metal roofing is a traditional material common
in older commercial buildings in New England.

 

A cupola projecting from this steeply p itched roof is an example of traditionalforms used in a contemporary structure. Roofm ounted mechanical equipment has been effectively screened by balustrad es.

STREET CORNERS
================================================================================

 
OBJECTIVES

Buildings located on comers are particularly important because they help define the character of two streets. These high-visibility locations shall be emphasized by quality architecture and site development.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Siting on Corner Lots. A building on the comer of two public streets shall be located close to the intersection and shall exhibit a strong relationship to both streets that it fronts. Where zoning allows, the Review Board may permit  a limited amount of parking and vehicular travelways between the building and the property lines along one or more of the streets, but the majority of the parking  shall be located to the side or rear of the building. The amount of parking and vehicular travelways permitted between the building and the property lines along each  street shall depend on both the zoning district and the context of the site.

Corner Buildings. Buildings on comers shall be a minimum of two stories or twenty feet (20') in height to add mass and visual prominence to the street.

Facade Treatment. Both facades of comer buildings shall be designed according to the standards in Facade Design,  p. 5. Blank or unadorned facades facing streets on comer buildings are prohibited. The facade of the upper floor(s) shall be visually related to the ground floor through repetition of design elements, e.g., color, materials, window  treatment , and detailing that will unify the structure and help frame the ground floor.

Corner Treatment. The architectural treatment of the street comer of the building shall emphasize its prominent position. This can be accomplished by greater massing and height , unique detailing, lighting, and other fac;ade treatment to emphasize the front comer of the building. This comer  treatment shall be designed to be visible from both streets. Where practical , an entrance to the building shall be located on the comer.

Focal Points. Comer locations offer opportunities to
create dynamic focal points in the streetscape. These
 
can take the form of distinctive architectural elements, signs, sculpture, lighting, or landscaping. Focal points shall be visually related to the building as a whole, providing an accent without overwhelming it.

DESIGN OF NATIONAL FRANCHISES
-	-	-- - --- ----- - -	-	--------- ----- --------	-

 
OBJECTIVES

National franchises (e.g., restaurants,   service stations, retail stores) are a welcome and permitted use within Kennebunk's commercial districts. However, the design of these buildings can contribute to the loss of identity for Kennebunk by the repetition of generic architectural fonns that are found throughout the country. Buildings for these types of uses shall reflect an awareness of New England architectural traditions in their form, detailing, and materials.


DESIGN STANDARDS

Franchise Styles. Architectural fo1ms primarily de1ived from building styles from other regions  of the country are prohibited. New England regional prototypes from national franchises are permitted , provided they meet the Design Standards. Buildings that are stylized to the point where the structure is a form of advertising are not acceptable.

Coordination of Site Features. Applicants shall provide the Reviewing Board with illustrations that demonstrate how site features and  accessory structures will be coordinated with the principle building. These may include dumpster screen s, storage building s, refiigeration lockers, playgrounds, signage, and lighting.

Architecture/16
 


OBJECTIVES



Due to their visibility and mass, large scale buildings (20,000 square feet or greater), such as 'big box' retail or grocery stores, can greatly enhance or detract from the visual character of the commercial district. These buildings  shall  be  designed  as  attractive pieces  of
commercial  architecture that are consistent with the	 	 scale  and  fonn  found   in  Kennebunk's  traditional
buildings.



DESIGN STANDARDS

 
Design and Massing. Large structure s shall be designed to break up their mass into smaller visual components through the use of projections, recesses, and vaiied facade treatm ents. (See pp. 5-8, Facade Treatment).

Site Design. Scale reductions oflarge buildings shall be reinforced by appropriate site features such as pedestrian shelters, large trees, clearly-defined entrances, and site furnishings.

Architectural  Details . Architectural detail s shall be used  to  reduce  the  scale  and  uniformity  of  large buildings.  Elements  such  as  colonnades, pilasters, gable ends, canopies, display windows, and light fixtures  can  be  effective  measures  to  add  human scale.

 


Main entrances on large-scale buildings shall be designed as prominent focal points to orient customers.
 







A large retail establishment that still projects the image of a big box, despite the canopy and entrance treatment.







Facades and Exterior Walls. Horizontal facades greater than too feet in length shall incorporate wall plane projections or recesses having a depth of at least 3% of the length of the facade and extending at least 20% of the length of the facade. Nor unintenupted length of any facade shall exceed 100 horizontal feet.

Other devices to add  interest to long walls  include strong shadow lines, changes in rooflines , pilasters and architectural details, patterns in  the surface material, and wall openings. All facade elements shall be coordinated with the landscape plan to ensure balance, proportion, and continuity.

Ground floor facades that face public streets shall have display windows, entry areas, or other such transparent features along 40% or more of their horizontal length.
 

======================--==========================================================
Architecture/17
 


Smaller Retail Stores. Where principal buildings contain additional, separate stores which in total occupy less than 20,000 square feet of gross floor area, with separate, exterior customer entrances, the following standards shall apply:

•	The street level facade of such stores shall be transparent between the height of  three  feet and eight feet above the walkway grade for no less than 40% of the horizontal length of the building facade of such additional stores.

•	Windows	shall	be	trimmed	and	include visually prominent sills, shutters or other such forms of framing.

Entryways. Each principal building shall have a clearly defined, highly  visible customer entrance featuring three or more of the following:










Arcades can be an effective way to add human scale to large buildings. Architectural detailing and  shadow patt erns create an inviting space.
 

•	Canopies
•	Overhangs or recesses provide shelter
•	Arcades that lead to entrances
•	Raised corniced parapets over the door
•	Peaked roof forms
•	Outdoor patios
•	Architectural details such as tile work and moldings which are integrated into the building structure and design, or
•	Other features which are designed to add scale and visual interest to the buildings.

Where additional stores are located in the principal building, and customer entrances to such stores are outdoors, each additional store shall conform to the above requirements . All components used to enhance entranceways or provide a distinctive look shall be designed or detailed as integral parts of the whole building.

Multiple Entrances. All sides of a large scaled building that face an abutting public or private street shall feature at least one customer entrance to facilitate pedestrian access,  minimize walking distances from cars, and reduce the scale of facades. Where a building abuts more than two streets, this requirement shall apply to only two sides of the building , including the side facing the primary public street and another side facing a second street.







 
The entrances to this larger grocery store are emphasized by projecting canopies, distinctive openings, and a covered arcade.
 

=================================================================================
Architecture/IS
 

Features and Amenities. Large scale buildings shall contribute to the establishment or enhancement of the pedestrian envirorunent by providing at least two of the following:

•	Patio/seating area
•	Pedestrian area with benches
•	Window shopping walkway
•	Outdoor playground area
•	Water fountain
•	Clock tower
•	Other  focal  features  or amenities  that
enhance  the pedestrian environment.

Any such area shall have direct access to the public sidewalk. Such features shall be constructed of materials that are equivalent in quality  to  the building and land scape.



Cart Storage. Shopping carts must be stored inside the building, or in 'cart corral s', out of the way of pedestrian circulation. Cati storage areas shall meet the stand ards for accessory structures.
(See Genera/Architectural Principl es, p. 2)


This retail store, attached to a large grocery store, has been designed as an individual building, with a separate entrance and architectural detailing. A covered walkway connects all the storefronts.

=======================---==========================

 
OBJECTIVES

Linear commercial structures (e.g., strip shopping centers, multi-ten ant offices, or commercial buildings) shall be designed with facade  and roofline elements that reduce their scale and add architectural interest.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Design. Buildings with multiple storefronts (e.g., strip shopping centers, one story office buildings) shall be visually unified through the use of complimentary architectura l  forms,  similar materials and colors, consistent details, and coordinated signage. Variation s in the front setbacks are  strongly  encouraged  to  add  visual  interest,
create spaces for common entries, outdoor eating /
social spaces, and landscaped spaces.

Scale. Linear structures shall include architectural elements designed to provide shelter, encourage pedestrian movement, and visually unite the building. These can include covered walkways, open colonnades, arcades, and similar features.

Entrances. Pedestrian entrances to each building shall be clearly delineated to convey a sense of individuality. This can be accompli shed by architectural detailing, roofline breaks, landscaping, lighting or a combination of these elements. Where covered walkways are used , they should extend the full length of the facade.



















Covered walkways add a shadow line which can reduce the
scale of a long building and unify  the facade.
 
Rooflines. Variations in rooflines, detailing, and building heights shall be included to break up the scale of connected linear buildings.

Focal Points. Linear commercial buildings shall include a focal point -such as raised entrance way, clock tower, or other architectural elements -to add visual interest and help reduce the scale of the building.











Colonnades add visual interest to linear buildings, while providing scale and protection from the elements.

Archit ecture/21
 




OBJECTIVES

Service stations, car washes, and convenience stores shall be designed with facade and roofline elements that reduce their scale and add architectural interest.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Orientation. Service stations, convenience stores, and similar uses shall be sited to face the  street. Pump islands and canopies shall be located in the rear so the primary building is the major feature seen from the road.

Architecture. The architecture shall be designed so all four sides are in compliance with these design guidelines. Windows or other fonns of fenestration shall be included on the facade facing the street which shall be treated as a front facade (see Facade Design, p. 6-7). The front facade shall include a pedestrian entrances from the street.

Canopies. Service station canopies shall be visually compatible with the main structure through consistency in roof pitch , architectural detailing, materials, and color. Pitched roofs and fascia trim are preferred for canopies. Bands of bold color on the canopy and backlighting inside the canopy are prohibited. See Lighting.

Large Openings. Openings for car washes or service bays must be integrated with the design of the building and sited so they are not directly  visible from public roadways or adjacent residential areas.

Site Design. The site design must address the issues of off-site noise exposure, und erground drainage systems to keep water off public streets (in the case of car washes), snow storage, circulation patterns , room for vehicle stacking, and other issues peculiar to these uses.

Pedestrian Circulation. Connections to the public sidewalk shall be included in the site plan to encourage pedestrian use. Access routes leading to or from service stations and convenience stores shall minimize conflicts with pedestrian circulation.
 



 




This service station canopy is designed to be an extension of the building. The columns, roojline, dormers,  and  signage contribute to a sense of continuity in the architecture.

DRIVE-THRO UGHS
=================--=============================--======--===
 

OBJECTIVES

Drive-throughs shall be subordinate to the design of the main building to maintain the pedestrian orientation of the structure. Architectural design and circulation planning for buildings  with  drive­ throughs require careful consideration to integrate them into the Kennebunk environment. Drive­ through operations and other automobile-oriented facilities shall be designed with facade and roofline elements that reduce their scale and add architectural interest.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Drive-Throughs. Where drive-through window s are allowed, they shall be incorporated into the design of the buildin g through their scale, color,  detailing, massing, and other architectural treatments.

Location. Drive-throughs shall avoid  facing public or private roadways and shall generall y be located at the side or rear of the buildin g. Where drive­ tlu·oughs are located at the rear, the site should  be designed to ensure the safety of the employees and patrons.

Canopies. Drive-through canopies shall be visually compatible with the main structure. This can be accomplished through consistency in roof pitch , architectural detailing, materials, and color. Pitched roofs and fascia trim are preferred for canopies. Bands of bold color on the canopy and backlighting inside the canopy are prohibited.

Pedestrian Circulation. Access routes leading to or from drive-tlu·ough facilities shall minimize conflicts with pedestrian circulation. Where walkways must cross driveways, moto1ists shall be made aware of pedestrians through signage, lighting, raised crosswalks, changes in paving, or other devices.
 

 


 

These banks 'drive-through windows have been designed as integral part s of the buildings. They repeat the roojlines,forms, and materials.

BACKGROUND

 
Landscaping shall be an integral part of all site plan developments. Trees, shrubs, and other landscape elements can be used to accentuate buildings, create a sense of identity, and provide human scale. The applicant shall carefully evaluate the physical characteristics of each site and each plant when making the final selection to ensure that the plantings will survive and thrive in their selected location.

A Plant Materials List has been developed to encourage property owners to look at many options in both fo1m and species (see pp. 9-10). The list shall be considered a starting point in selecting plants.

Landscape  Goals

o	Reinforce the identity of Kennebunk's commercial distticts through the use of plant materials in scale with their surroundings.

o	Enhance the attractiveness and scale of com­ mercial development through the use of colorful plant	materials with interesting forms and massing.

o	Help define areas where pedestrians are safely separated from the road.

o	Reinforce wayfinding by emphasizing entrances and circulation patterns.

•	Increase the attractiveness of parking lots by reducing their scale, providing shade, and adding seasonal interest.

•	Provide screening for  less attractive pa1is of  a site or incompatible land uses.

BACKGROUND
===========-=-===-	----- - -----------	--

 
OBJECTIVES

Landscaping shall be used to complement the architecture, enhance human scale, reinforce circulation paths, highlight entrances, provide shade, and add seasonal interest. Kennebunk's commercial districts shall be unified by a rich variety of street trees, flowering shrubs, and masses of color.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Preparation. As part of the application for site improvements involving parking lots with more than ten cars and/ar more than 2,000 SF of building, a landscape plan shall be prepared by a landscape architect registered in Maine, or other qualified professional familiar with local growing conditions. The Board, at their discretion , may require a peer review of landscape plans.

Selection. The use of plant materials and landscape elements that require a low degree of maintenance is strongly encouraged. All plantings shall be resistent to insect infestation, drought, disease, roadside salt, and auto emissions, and hardy to Maine winters.

Plant material shall be selected with consideration to public health and safety. Plants to be avoided include those with poisonous fruits, large thorn s, or invasive growth patterns, or shrubs that could provide hiding places along pathways or block the view of moving vehicles.

Coordination with Utilities. The planting plan shall illustrate how plantings shall be coordinated with the location of underground and overhead utilities and lighting. The planting plan shall show screening for transfo1mers, propane tanks, and similar utilitarian elements.

Variety. A variety of plant materials that exhibit seasonal color and interesting texture is encouraged to create a distinctive, yet low maintenance environment. Plantings plans shall strike a balance between monoculture (the use of a single species) and too much variety.  A list of suggested plant is included on pages 9-10.
 
Simplicity. Planting design shall stress simplicity in form and limit the number of species. Shrubs, perennials, annuals, ornamental grasses, etc. used along the roadways should be planted in masses or 'drifts' that emphasize colors and textures,  rather than used as single specimens.

Irrigation. The installation of underground irrigation is encouraged in front setbacks, public spaces, and other highly visible areas. It shall be coordinated so it does not cause overflow or flooding in pedestrian use areas, such as walkways, sidewalks, or parking lots.

Integration. Plantings shall be massed to soften edges, comers, and pavement areas, and to integrate the building into the landscape.

Boulevard Effect. Large spreading deciduous trees shall be planted in appropriate locations along Route 1 and other major roadways to define the edge of the travelway, provide shade for pedestrians, clean the air, and add scale to commercial corridors.


Existing Trees / Plants. Wherever  practical, existing or unique trees or other significant plantings shall be preserved. The landscape plan shall illustrate which vegetation will be preserved and what protection measures will be taken during construction. Transplanting and reusing trees and other plantings is strongly encouraged.

Safety. The ultimate form and height of plantings shall be considered so they will not create unsafe condition s or block sight  lines for pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorists as they mature.

Rocks. Large rocks shall be used as landscape elements very sparingly and only as accents in mass plantings. Where used, they shall be buried for at least half of their depth.

Ground Cover. Extensive areas of bark mulch shall not be used as a substitute for live ground cover. Where mulch is used , it shall consist of dark, decomposed shredded bark, with pieces less than l" in any one dimension.

Buffers & Screening. Plant materials and other landscape elements shall be used to create suitable buffer s between residential and commercial properties. The design of buffers shall consider the appearance from both commercial and residential viewpoint s. Evergreen plantings are particularly effective for year-round buffering.

Minimum Plant Sizes.  Unless  otherwise required by site conditions, plant materials shall meet the following minimum sizes:
 
The Board may require larger plants for special locations, such as within the Route One ROW. The use of bare root plant material shall be avoided.

Guarantee Period. All lawns  and plant materials shall be guaranteed for a period of not less than 2 years. The developer shall submit a copy of a guarantee and a contract with the landscape contractor, indicating the terms of the guarantee period , or may obtain a letter of credit.

============================================--=======================

 
OBJECTIVES


Landscaping is necessary in parking lots to improve the visual appearance, reduce the scale of paved areas, define edges, provide shade, and add seasonal interest. Trees, shrubs, and ornamentals shall be planted in large groups, or drifts, appropriate to the scale of the space.



DESIGN STANDARDS

Total Landscape Area . 10-15% of the total area of a parking lot shall be landscaped . In general, larger and more visible parking lots shall have more intensive landscape treatments. Driveways leading into and around parking lots are not calculated in detennining the area of a lot. The Board will have discretion in the amount of landscaping required.

Undesirable Plant Materials. Trees that may damage automobiles (dripping sap, messy fruit, or hard seeds such as acorns) are discouraged in or around parking lots.

Location of Trees. Trees in parking lots shall be planted in informal groups, straight rows, or irregular groupings as space permits, or concentrated  in certain areas. Trees shall be planted a minimwn of five feet from the end of parking lot islands.

Screening. Parking lots shall be separated from the street by planting s, earth berms , walls, and/or other landscape elements to minimize the view of vehicles, while still allowing the public to see the building.

Safety. Where trees abut pedesttian walkways or places where people will be walking in parking lots, their lower branches shall be pruned to at least eight feet above the paved surface to avoid becoming  an obstacle. Shrubs in parking lot islands shall not exceed 3' in height to avoid blocking visibility.

Parking Stall Separation. Landscaped areas used for separation between banks of parking stalls shall be a minimum of nine feet in width.
 
Snow Storage. Land scape materials surrounding parking lots and in islands shall be able to tolerate large quantities of snow stored during winter months. Delicate plant material shall not be used in areas where they are likely to be buried under snow.

 

Plants selected for parking lots shall be able to withstand severe growing conditions and weather

 

A low earth berm effectively screens a parking lot Ornamental trees or plantings added to the berm would provide a greater degree of attractiveness, as well as separation from  the roadway.

 

These trees have been pruned  so they minimize  interference at
eye levelfor  both drivers and pedestrians.

TREE SELECTION & PLANTINGS
======--===========================--=======================



OBJECTIVES

Trees shall be used throughout Kennebunk 's Route 1 commercial corridor, planted within the right of way, near building s, and throughout parking lots. Trees shall be sited to achieve full maturity and  display their natural form. Planting plans shall emphasize large shade trees within or near the right-of-ways in order to create a more unified streetscape.

DESIGN STANDARDS

 
Suitability.     Trees	shall	be   resistent	to	insect infestation , drought, disease, road side salt, and  auto emissions.  All  plant  material  shall  be  suitable  to growing  conditions.  A  list  of  street
trees                             is included in the
Plant Materials List, pp.9- 10.


Coordination with Architecture. Trees shall be carefully selected and located to complement the building elevation without blocking storefronts, signs, or lighting.

Roadside Plantin gs. Trees shall be planted a minimum of 5' from the edge of the roadway. Trees and other landscaping planted at intersections shall preserve an adequate sight triangle as determined by the traffic engineer.

Pedestrian Movement. The lower branches of trees planted near pathway s and sidewalks shall be at least eight feet above the pavement to minimize interference with pedestrian movement  throughout the year.

Root Zones. Trees shall be pl anted  in locations where their root development and branch ing patterns will not interfere with window displays, signage, underground or overhead utilities, streets, and sidewalks.
 


Trees have been pruned to prevent inte1ference with pedestrian movement An adequate amount  of room has been provided to accommodate root development.


 

Masses of trees can help tie buildings into the site and provide
attractive patterns  of light and shade.

SHRUBS & ORNAMENTAL PLANTINGS
=============================================--=================================

 
OBJECTIVES

A variety of appropriate shrubs and ornamental plantings shall be  used throughout the commercial districts to add seasonal color, provide visual interest, help define spaces, screen undesirable elements, and emphasize circulation routes.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Variety in Plantings. The use of flowering shrubs, evergreen shrnbs, perennials, annuals, vines, ornamental grasses, and other plant material is highly recommended , in addition to street trees, evergreen trees, and ornamental trees. A listing of plantings that is suitable for                   is provided at the end of this chapter. See  Plant Materials List, pp. 10-11.

Selection. The selection of plantings shall consider ultimate height and spread, maintenance, pest and disease tolerance and their nuisance potential (severe thorns, excessive leaf litter, etc.). Invasive species shall not be used.

Foundation & Wall Plantings. Planting beds are recommended along exposed building edges, foundations and uninte1rupted walls. Plantings shall provide either a fonnal pattern or a naturalistic blend of heights, colors, and textures for visual relief.

Accent Plantings. The installation of  special planting beds is be encouraged in appropriate areas for visual accents in the landscape. These can include daylily beds, butterfly gardens, bog gardens, fragrant gardens, shade gardens, yellow foliage gardens, early blooming gardens, texture gardens, etc.

 
Ornamental    grasses    can    provide    a    cost-effective,
low-maintenance way to add year-round  texture.
 
Mass Plantings. Shrubs and perennials shall generally be planted in large masses or 'drifts,' rather than as individual specimens, to provide a pleasing effect for both motorists and pedestrians.

Safety. Plant material shall be selected with due consideration to public health and safety. Avoid plants with poisonous or messy fruits or leaves, large thorns, or overly aggressive growth patterns . Large shrubs which could provide  hiding places along pathways or block the view of moving vehicles shall be avoided.





 




 
Masses of daylilies (above) or groups of flowering shrubs (below) make a bright, colorful statement in front of these commercial buildings.

LANDSCAPE  MAINTENANCE
====================================== ===================== ====================
 

OBJECTNES

The planting plans presented to the Board shall anticipate a 3-8 year growing cycle to achieve maturit y for shrubs, and is-20 years or more for trees. Proper maintenance shall be assured so the site continues to improve as the landscaping achieves maturity. The Site Plan shall be designed and planting s selected with due consideration for maintenance requirements.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Maintenance	Plan . As part of the Site Plan application for buildings > 5,000 SF, a written maintenance plan shall be provided for all landscape el ements to be installed on the property.

Details of Plan. Topics to be  addressed  shall include (but not be limited to) initial installation, guarantee period , replacement policy, pe1iodic and seasonal maintenance, special considerations, use of pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation, and seasonal displays.

 
Shrubs have been excessive ly pruned so their natural fonn  is no longer apparent..

 
A mature shrubs next to a driveway could cause problems with visibilityfor cars exiting the driveway.
 

Natural Forms. All plant material shall be allowed to achieve their natural forms without excessive pruning.	Shaping evergreen shrubs into tight geometrical forms shall be avoided.

Low Maintenance Materials. The use of plant materials and landscape elements that require a low degree of maintenance is strongly encouraged. Planting characteristics to be considered include : drought	resistance (except where inigated), tolerance to auto emissions, disease and insect resistance, lack of thorns that could trap debris, and relatively light leaflifter for ease of fall cleanups.

Replacement	Planting. Where plant mateiials specified on the planting plan do not survive or are damaged, they shall be replaced and/or reinforced in accordance with the two-year  performance guarantee to maintain conformance with the approved planting plan and to provide the necessary landscape effect.














Care must be taken to insure that  trees are given  room to achieve   full	maturity    and natural form,   illustrated   at right  Tight planting  pockets and  installation  too close  to buildings  may put  stress  on trees   and   plants   and   can present	a   problem	when removing		dead	materials

BACKGROUND

Signs play a central role in providing information, wayfinding, and setting the tone for Kennebunk's commercial districts. They inform motorists and pedestrians, while having a direct effect on the overall appearance of the roadway.

Signage Goals

•	Provide basic, legible information about commercial establishments with attractive, highly legible signage.

•	Encourage forethought m the design, size, placement, and graphic format of all signage used in the commercial areas of Kennebunk

•	Create distinctive commercia l corridors and nodes, where signage is compatible with quality architecture and site design.

•	Reduce visual clutter along Kennebunk's major roadways.

•	Protect the investment of commercial interests throughout Kennebunk by establishing a quality benchmark for future signage, in keeping with the design standards.

SIGN DESIGN
================================================================================


 
OBJECTIVES

Commercial uses in Kennebunk shall be identified by attractive, legible signs that serve the needs of the individual business, complement the site and the architecture, and are legible to both the motorist and pedestrian. All new and replacement signs erected within Kennebunk' s commercial districts shall be designed to meet these standards.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Signage Plan . A Signage  Plan meeting the standards of Zoning Art. 10, Section 7. shall be submitted as part of the Plan application. It shall be developed by professionals experienced in commercial signage. The applicant shall expect to resubmit the plan to the planning staff if the building's tenant is unknown at the time of application.

Compatibility. Sign shall be designed to achieve a high level of visual compatibility with the building and its surroundings through the use of similar detailing, form, color, lighting, and materials.

Design. The shape of the sign shall complement the architectural features on the building. Simple geometric shapes are preferred for all signage. Signs shall be trimm ed and detailed to complement the building.
 
These discreet fa9ade-mounted signs are well-integrated into their commercial buildings.
Lettering  Size.  As  a  general  rule,  the  minimum
lettering size for identification signs shall be six inches in height. Smaller letters are generally unreadable at high speeds and may require motorists to slow down to read them , which could potentially be a safety hazard.

Location. Signs shall be mounted in locations that do not block motorists' line of sight or create a hazard for pedestrians or bicyclists. Roof mounted signs are strongly discouraged. Roof mounted signs that project above the roofline are prohibited.

Street Numbers . The principal site identification sign shall contain the street address shown in a prominent location to facilitate wayfinding and 911 emergency response.

Advertising Features. Objects other than signs designed primarily to attract public attention are prohibited in the commercial district because they distract motorists and contribute to visual clutter. Examples of prohibited advertising features include greater-than-life size models of food or other products, replicas of spokes-peop le associated with commercial products, rows of flags or banners, and internally-lit bands of color.

Standard Note. Any modifications to signage that has been approved by the  Board shall comply with
 
 		the Standard Note. No change from the conditions of approval is permitted unless an amended plan is first submitted to and approved by the Board.

EXTERNALLY-LIT SIGNS
================================================================================

OBJECTIVES

Lighting for externally-lit signs shall be designed as an integral part of the sign design. Lighting shall not create glare that would distract motorists or pedestrians, nor shall the degree of illumination disturb the surrounding residential areas or contribute to light pollution.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Light Level. The illumination level on the vertical surface of the sign shall be bright enough to provide a noticeable contrast with the surrounding building or landscape without causing undue glare or reflection.

 
Lighting. Lighting fixtures shall be carefully located, aimed, and shielded so that light is directed only onto the sign facade. Lights shall not be aimed toward adjacent streets, sidewalks, or abutting properties. Ground-mounted lighting shall be screened or partially buried to minimize the view of the light source.

Light Sources. Top-mounted lighting fixtures shall be used if they are directed downward in a manner that hides the light source.

Design. Light fixtures and mounting devices shall be selected to complement the color and design of the sign and the architecture. Concealed  light sources are strongly encouraged.
 





In both example above and below the top-mounted lightfixtures are well-located, aimed, and shielded so that only the sign is lit The lighting fixtures compliment the signs and the buildings. These top-mounted  light fixtures  are not  well shielded  nor integrated into the sign.

Signage/ 8
 




OBJECTIVES
 
EXTERNALLY-LIT SIGNS
 

Internally-lit signs ( in zoning districts where permitted) shall consist of light lettering and/or symbols on a dark background, and shall not act as light fixtures in their own right.

DESIGN STANDARDS

 
Design . Internally-lit  signs shall consist of light lettering and/or symbols set against a  dark background to minimize the amount of light emanating from the sign. Internally-lit letters and symbols are preferred over whole panels that are internally lit. Letters and/or symbols on panels shall constitute no more than 40% of the sign's  surface area.

Mounting Systems. Signs shall be mounted in a manner that provides adequate support for the weight of the sign. Mounting systems shall be designed to be compatible with the architecture in term s of color, fonns, and style. Electrical connections, wiring, junction boxes, and other similar devices shall not be visible from pedes-trian pathways or roadways.

Intensity. Internally-lit signs shall not act as light fixtures or cause glare on nearby pathways or roadways. Lighting levels shall not exceed 1 fc of illumination measured 10 feet from the base.

Maintenance. Signs shall be located where they can be easily maintained. Non-functioning bulbs shall be replaced immedi ately.
 






An effective use of individual internally-lit letters to create a simple identityfor  a commercial building.

 


The sign's dark background and light lettering emphasize the bank's name while  minimizing glare. Information occupies about 40% of the sign.

 
The white background of this sign will increase skyglow

==============================================================================--=
Lighting/4
 

 
OBJECTIVES

Parking lot lighting shall be designed to provid e the minimum lighting necessary for safety, visibility, and comfort, without causing glare or avoidable spillover onto adjacent properties or roadways, or an increase in skyglow. In general, parking areas shall have less illumination than their surrounding commercial uses.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Layout. The alignment and spacing of fixtures in parking lots shall follow a regular pattern that is coordinated with the orientation of buildings and other site elements.

Location. Light poles shall be incorporated within raised planting areas wherever possible to avoid damage from vehicles and plows.

Bases. The use of bases raised above the level of plantings (when installed in islands or plant beds) or higher than one foot above the level  of  the pavement (when installed in walkways) is discouraged.

Coordination with Plantin g  Plan.  The  lighting plan shall be coordinated with the landscape plan to avoid obstruction s from large trees, dark spots from shadows, or other conflicts as plantings m ature.






 
The alignment and spacing of these lighting fixtures follow a regular pattern that coordinates with the orientation of the buildings and parking  lot.
 
Illumination Levels. Illumination levels shall be defined by !ESNA recommendation RP-20-2000 "Lighting for Parking Facilities" or current manual. Illumination Levels for general parking and pedestrian areas shall maintain a minimum of o.6 horizontal footcandles with a uniformity ratio of 4:1 average to minimum. This standard shall be met both on the ground and six feet above the ground.

Luminaries. The use of metal halide lamps is strongly recommended in parking lots through-out Kennebunk's commercial districts for its color rendition and energy efficiency. Lamps shall be housed in a lumi naire that is classified by IE5NA as a cutoff distribution. Decorative fixtures may be used, provided they meet the cutoff criteria.

Mounting Heights. Fixture heights shall vary with the size and position of the lot. Both small Parking Areas (less than 150 cars) and large Parking Areas (greater than  150 cars) shall have a maximum pole height of 25 feet. Poles within 200' of residential property lines shall not exceed 20' in height.

Adjacencies. Cut off fixtures shall be designed to avoid spillover onto adjacent residential properties .

OBJECTIVES

The lighting of pedestrian spaces shall consider users' needs and safety. Light standards shall adequately, but not excessively,  illuminate not only the space occupied by people, but also the elements within those spaces such as stairs, walls, benches , curbs, and landscaping .

DESIGN STANDARDS

Heights. Mounting heights  for pedestrian lighting shall be appropriate for the project and the setting. Bollard fixtures, 3-4 feet in height, and ornamental fixtures, up to 12 feet in height, are encouraged as pedestrian area lighting. When decorative or special lighting is used, pole height shall be a maximum of 16 feet above the ground.
 

Decorative. Ornamental and decorative lightng shall be used to highlight significant design elements (e.g., gateways, plazas, major building entrances).

Design. The light poles and fixtures shall be selected to complement the roadway and parking lot lighting, as well as the other elements of the streetscape.











Ornamental lighting can add human scale to exterior  spaces while providing necessary illumination for pathways  and outdoor spaces.

OBJECTIVES

Facade lighting is a way of highlighting special architectural features and attractively  landscaped areas, while adding depth and variety to Kennebunk at night. Lighting used to illuminate building facades and landscaping shall be limited to areas where it enhances particul ar features in accordance with the overall lighting plan and does not disturb smTounding residential areas.

DESIGN  STANDARDS

Intent. The lighting plan nan-ative shall describe how the facades of individual buildings and/or landscaping will be lit (if at all) and the design intent behind such lighting.

Levels.  Maximum   level   of  illumination   on  any
vertical surface shall not exceed s.o footcandles.

Location. Lighting fixtures shall be properly sited, aimed, and shielded so that light is directed only onto the building facade. Lighting fixtures shall not be directed toward adjacent streets, sidewalks, or properties.

Types. Lighting fixtures that are mounted on the facade and designed to wash the face with even light in a downward direction are prefeITed.

Landscape Lighting. Landscape lighting shall be properly sited, aimed, and shielded so that light is directed only onto the selected tree or shrnb.


 
Neon lighting, shown here outlining the roof is prohibited in Kennebunk's  commercial districts.
 


Lighting fixtures shall not be directed toward adjacent streets, sidewalks, or properties. The lighting plan shall demonstrate that the installation will not generate excessive light levels, cause glare, or direct light beyond the landscaping toward the night sky. Indirect landscape lighting (uplighting and washes) is encouraged over high branch-mounted flood-lights aimed toward the ground.

Bands of Light. Neon tubes as lighting features are not allowed on building exteriors. The use of internally illuminated bands of color and/or light is prohibited .

 
These facade-mounted   lighting fixtures  are visually compatible
with theform  and color of the building.



 

Lighting  can be used to achieve dramatic effects, especially in
gateway  locations.

GAS STATION, CONVENIENCE STORES & DRIVE-THROUGH LIGHTING
--===-       ===================================--====================================-        -==

OBJECTIVES

Lit canopies or architectural features or devices used to illuminate gas stations, convenience stores, and drive-through elements of a building shall facilitate the activities taking place in such locations without creating glare onto adjacent properties or roadways.

DESIGN STANDARDS

Light Levels under  Canopies.  Areas  around gasoline pumps and under canopies where a higher level of light is necessary for effective use of pumps shall be illuminated so the average horizontal illuminance at ground level is 30 fc or less, with a uniformity ratio of 1.25 (average to minimum).

Parking Areas. The maximum levels shall  only apply to the area under and within 20 feet of the canopy. Areas beyond 20 feet from canopies and gasoline pumps shall follow the standards  for parking lots. If gasoline pumps are not provided under a canopy, the entire apron shall be treated as a parking area.

Canopy Luminaries. Recessed luminaries  with  flat or regressed lenses shall be used in canopies so the motorist cannot see the source of light. Drop fixtures are not allowed. The cut off angle shall not exceed
8    degrees  above  the  vertical  to  make  the  light
source invisible to passing motorists.

Fascia. Lights shall not be mounted on the sides (fascia) or top of the canopy. Sides and tops of canopies shall not be illuminated.


Lighting being considered as an integral part of the canopy design. The canopy light fzxtures are recessed so the light source is not visible and do not create 'hot spots 'that are distracting to the passing  motorist

T.R. 20 or T.R. 55, 1986 edition, published by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, or latest
revisions thereof.



VIII
 

I)  All storm water systems shall be designed to meet the criteria of a 25 year storm based on rainfall data from weather bureau records for Portland.

2)   Appropriate conveyances for outlets to drainage systems must be provided.

3)	In any case, the minimum pipe size for any storm drainage pipe shall be 12 inches.  Catch basins of an appropriate size and type shall be installed where necessary, and shall be located generally at the curb line.  Catch basins shall be placed away from the line of traffic flow, however, shall be adequate in design and strength to accommodate vehicle traffic. Catch basins shall be specifically constructed to accept a granite inlet headstone.

60" to 72"
 
14 ga.
12 ga.
10 ga.
8 ga.
 

B.	Existing or future downstream drainage requirements shall be studied to determine the effect on proposed drainage. The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board that the storm drainage will not, in any way, overload existing or future storm drainage systems downstream from the proposed street.  The drainage requirement for a two, ten and 25 year storm shall be evaluated to determine drainage system needs.



IX
 

C.	For both upstream and downstream drainage, in determining the rate and volume of surface	(
rnn-off, the following factors must be considered:

1)	intensity of rainfall:  25 year design storm;
2)	timing of rainfall (e.g. falling on snow or during the spring snow melt);
3)	amount of precipitation occuning in the five days  preceding the storm in question;
4)	hydrologic soil group (i.e. the soil's rate of water infiltration and transmission.  The rates for soils are described in the Best Management Practices Handbook, 1991, or latest revision thereof);
5)	hydrologic conditions (soil's moisture content humus/organic content, temperature, and
whether or not it is frozen);
6)	vegetative cover (vegetation helps soil dry out after a rainfall, intercepts some precipitation during the rainfall, and slows down the flow of water over the land);
7)	area ofland covered by impervious surfaces (roads, sidewalks, roofs, driveways, patios,
etc.);
8)	topography (slopes affect the rate of rnn-off; marshland reduces peak discharge rate by slowing down the rate of rnn-off);
9)	size and shape of watershed (peak discharge rates are slower in long, nanow watersheds, and vice versa).

D.	An underdrainage system shall be designed and installed to properly drain all springs or areas where the ground water level is within one foot of the bottom of road sub-base and would
cause a hazard to the stability of the roadway base. Evidence that water level exceeds the one	( foot standard (test hole data) shall be submitted as part of any application which does not
include such an underdrainage system.
The underdrain shall be a minimum of 6" diameter perforated PVC SDR 35 pipe encapsulated with 74" crnshed stone inside a geotextile fabric. Holes shall be placed down.

E.	No storm water shall be permitted to drain across the surface of a street or an intersection.

8.6.5	Storm Drainage Constrnction Standards:

A.	All storm drain construction shall be in conformity with State of Maine Specifications for Highways and  Bridges, revision 1990, or latest revisions thereof.

B.	General Construction Requirements:

1)	Trenching shall be accomplished in accordance with all appropriate state and federal safety requirements.

2)	Drain alignment shall be straight in both horizontal and vertical alignment, unless specific approval of a curvilinear drain is obtained in writing from the Board.



x
 

3)	Manholes shall be provided at all changes in vertical or horizontal alignment, and at all junctions.   In straight runs, manholes shall be placed at a maximum of 300 feet intervals. Catch basins shall be connected to manholes on the main storm drain line. The maximum distance between catch basins and manholes shall be 250 feet.

4)	Where necessary, outlets shall be terminated in an endwall of concrete construction, or shall be rip-rapped to prevent erosion, or other appropriate measures taken.  Facilities for energy dissipation shall be provided where necessary.

8.6.6	Additional Improvements and Requirements:

A.	Erosion Control:  An erosion control plan shall be prepared by a professional engineer, licensed in the State of Maine, and designed in accordance with the standards of the Maine Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for Construction:  Best Management Practices, March 1991. Procedures shall be undertaken, both during preparatory, construction, and cleanup stages, to prevent soil erosion and water pollution.

B.	Cleanup:  Following street construction, the developer or contractor shall conduct a thorough cleanup of stumps and other debris from the entire road or street right-of-way.  Each catch basin or manhole shall be cleaned of all accumulation of silt and debris and kept clean.

C.	Street Name, Street Signs, Street Lights:  Streets which join and are in alignment with streets
(	of abutting or neighboring properties shall bear the same name.  Names of new streets shall not duplicate, nor bear phonetic resemblance to the names of existing streets within the
Town, and shall be subject to the approval of the applicable review board.  Street name signs and directional signs shall be shown on plans and shall be  furnished by the developer.  The type, size and location shall be subject to the approval by the Reviewing Board. Street lighting shall be installed as required by the Planning Board or Site Plan Review Board per the applicable plan review and shall be consistent with the Town's street lighting standards.

D.	Utilities, where available, shall be installed prior to the street construction phase so as to avoid re-excavation of the finished street.

8.7	PERFORMANCE  GUARANTEE

A.	Purpose - Perf01mance guarantees shall be provided to ensure the proper installation of required street, utility, storm drainage and other improvements.

B.	Submission of Performance Guarantee - Prior to plan approval per the applicable reviewing Board under Section 8.4.1 the applicant shall submit a performance guarantee for an amount adequate to cover the total construction costs of all required improvements.  The guarantee shall contain a construction schedule, cost estimates for each phase of construction, provisions for inspections of the construction, provisions for method of release of part or all


XI
 

of the performance  guarantee to the developer, and a date after which the developer will be in	(
default and the Town shall have access to the funds to finish construction.

The performance guarantee which is submitted for the Board's approval shall first be  · reviewed and accepted by the Town Manager.  The following types of guarantee are acceptable methods:

1)  Certified Check payable to the Town or a savings account naming the Town as owner, for the establishment of an escrow account.

2)	Performance Bond payable to the Town issued by a surety company.

3)	An in·evocable letter of credit from a financial institution which establishes funding for the construction of the required improvements, and from which the Town may draw upon if the construction is not completed in confo1mance with the approved plan.

4)	Conditional (one year) plan approval stipulating that there shall be no conveyance oflots or issuance of building pe1mits until a performance guarantee covering the total cost of all required improvements, and conforming to the format of 8.7.B.l, 2, or 3 above, is submitted to the Reviewing Board and approved.  A note shall be placed on the final plans listing this condition.

C.	Phasing  of Development  - The Planning  Board  or  Site Plan Review Board  may approve plans	(
to develop a major development in separate and distinct phases.  This may be accomplished by limiting final approval to those lots, commercial or industrial buildings, abutting that section of the proposed road which is covered by a performance guarantee.  When development is phased, road construction shall commence from the public way.  Final approval of subsequent phases shall be given only after determining that there has been substantial completion of requirements pe1iaining to the first and/or previous phase(s) of development.

D.	Inspection of Required Improvements - No street construction shall be initiated until the required  inspection fee has been submitted to the Town to cover the costs of having each construction stage inspected by the Town's inspection agent (engineer) per the Town's inspection schedule.

E.	Release of Guarantee - Prior to the release of any pati of the performance guarantee, the applicable Reviewing Board shall determine to its satisfaction, in part upon the inspection repo1i of the Town's Engineer, that the site improvements meet or exceed the design and construction requirements for that portion of the improvements for which the release is requested.

F.	Default - If, upon inspection, the Town's Engineer finds that any of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications
(
XII
 

filed as pait of the application, he shall so report in writing to the Code Enforcement Officer, the Municipal Officers, the Reviewing Board and the developer or builder.  The Municipal Officers shall take any steps necessary to preserve the Town's rights.

G.	Assignment or Transfer - No assignment or transfer of rights to construct the project is valid without prior approval, by the applicable Reviewing Board, of a new performance guai·antee to ensure that any assignee or transferee has the financial and technical capacity to complete the project.  Should a previously approved performance guarantee become invalid for any reason, the plan approval shall be nullified until such time as a new performance guarantee is approved in the saine manner as was originally approved.
