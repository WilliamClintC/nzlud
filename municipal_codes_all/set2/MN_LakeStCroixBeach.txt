§ 10.01  TITLE OF CODE.
   (A)   All ordinances of a permanent and general nature of the city, as
revised, codified, rearranged, renumbered and consolidated into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the
“Lake St. Croix Beach City Code,” for which designation “code of ordinances,”
“codified ordinances” or “code” may be substituted. Code title, chapter and
section headings do not constitute any part of the law as contained in the
code.
   (B)   All references to codes, titles, chapters and sections are to the
components of the code unless otherwise specified.  Any component code may be
referred to and cited by its name, such as the “Traffic Code.”  Sections may be
referred to and cited by the designation “§” followed by the number, such as “§
10.01.”  Headings and captions used in this code other than the title, chapter
and section numbers are employed for reference purposes only and shall not be
deemed a part of the text of any section.
§ 10.02  RULES OF INTERPRETATION.

required, the same rules of construction, definition and application shall
govern the interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of
state law.

of this city shall be by the following rules, unless that construction is

the same ordinance.
      (1)   AND or OR.  Either conjunction shall include the other as if
written “and/or,” whenever the context requires.
      (2)   Acts by assistants.  When a statute, code provisions or ordinance
requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent or deputy as well may do as
the principal, that requisition shall be satisfied by the performance of the
act by an authorized agent or deputy.
      (3)   Gender; singular and plural; tenses.  Words denoting the masculine
gender shall be deemed to include the feminine and neuter genders; words in the
singular shall include the plural, and words in the plural shall include the
singular; the use of a verb in the present tense shall include the future, if
applicable.

§ 10.19  ADOPTION OF STATUTES AND RULES AND SUPPLEMENTS BY REFERENCE.
   (A)   It is the intention of the City Council that, when adopting this code
of ordinances, all future amendments to any state or federal rules and statutes
adopted by reference in this code or referenced in this code are hereby adopted
by reference or referenced as if they had been in existence at the time this
code was adopted, unless there is clear intention expressed in the code to the
contrary.
   (B)   It is the intention of the City Council that, when adopting the code
of ordinances, all future supplements are hereby adopted as if they had been in
existence at the time this code was enacted, unless there is clear intention
expressed in the code to the contrary.
§ 10.20  ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any licensed peace officer of the city’s Police Department, or the
County Sheriff, or any Deputy Sheriff shall have the authority to enforce any
provision of this code.
   (B)   As permitted by M.S. § 626.862, as it may be amended from time to
time, the City Clerk-Administrator shall have the authority to administer and
enforce this code. In addition, under that statutory authority, certain
individuals designated within the code or by the Clerk-Administrator or City
Council shall have the authority to administer and enforce the provisions
specified. All and any person or persons designated may issue a citation in
lieu of arrest or continued detention to enforce any provision of the code.
   (C)   The City Clerk-Administrator and any city official or employee
designated by this code who has the responsibility to perform a duty under this
code may with the permission of a licensee of a business or owner of any
property or resident of a dwelling, or other person in control of any premises,
inspect or otherwise enter any property to enforce compliance with this code.
   (D)   If the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of a
premises objects to the inspection of or entrance to the property, the City
Clerk-Administrator, peace officer, or any employee or official charged with
the duty of enforcing the provisions of this code may, upon a showing that
probable cause exists for the issuance of a valid search warrant from a court
of competent jurisdiction, petition and obtain a search warrant before
conducting the inspection or otherwise entering the property. This warrant
shall be only to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the people are being complied with
and to enforce these provisions only, and no criminal charges shall be made as
a result of the warrant. No warrant shall be issued unless there be probable
cause to issue the warrant.  Probable cause occurs if the search is reasonable.
Probable cause does not depend on specific knowledge of the condition of a
particular property.
   (E)   Every licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of property
within the city shall permit at reasonable times inspections of or entrance to
the property by the City Clerk-Administrator or any other authorized city
officer or employee only to determine whether the provisions of this code
enacted to protect the health, safety and welfare of the people are being
complied with and to enforce these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit
the inspection of or entrance to the property shall be grounds for termination
of any and all permits, licenses or city service to the property. Mailed notice
shall be given to the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of
the property, stating the grounds for the termination, and the licensee, owner,
resident or other person in control of the property shall be given an
opportunity to appear before the City Clerk-Administrator to object to the
termination before it occurs, subject to appeal of the Clerk-Administrator’s
decision to the City Council at a regularly scheduled or special meeting.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the city to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
§ 10.98  SUPPLEMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to those administrative penalties established in this code
and the enforcement powers granted in §
10.20, the City Council is authorized to create by resolution, adopted by a
majority of the members of the Council, supplemental administrative penalties.
Such resolution may not proscribe administrative penalties for traffic offenses
designated by M.S. § 169.999, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   These administrative penalty procedures in this section are intended
to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost effective and
expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of
certain provisions of this code. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on
the part of those who have been charged with those offenses.
   (C)   Administrative penalties for violations of various provisions of the
code, other than those penalties established in the code or in statutes that
are adopted by reference, may be established from time to time by resolution of
a majority of the members of the City Council. In order to be effective, an
administrative penalty for a particular violation must be established before
the violation occurred.
   (D)   In the discretion of the peace officer, City Clerk-Administrator, or
other person giving notice of an alleged violation of a provision of this code,
in a written notice of an alleged violation, sent by first class mail to the
person who is alleged to have violated the code, the person giving notice may
request the payment of a voluntary administrative penalty for the violation
directly to the City Treasurer within 14 days of the notice of the violation. A
sample notice is contained in Appendix A to this chapter. In the sole
discretion of the person giving the notice of the alleged violation, the time
for payment may be extended an additional 14 days, whether or not requested by
the person to whom the notice has been given. In addition to the administrative
penalty, the person giving notice may request in the notice to the alleged
violator to adopt a compliance plan to correct the situation resulting in the
alleged violation and may provide that if the alleged violator corrects the
situation resulting in the alleged violation within the time specified in the
notice, that the payment of the administrative penalty will be waived.
   (E)   At any time before the payment of the administrative penalty is due,
the person who has been given notice of an alleged violation may request to
appear before the City Council to contest the request for payment of the
penalty. After a hearing before the Council, the Council may determine to
withdraw the request for payment or to renew the request for payment. Because
the payment of the administrative penalty is voluntary, there shall be no
appeal from the decision of the Council.
   (F)   At any time after the date the payment of the administrative penalty
is due, if the administrative penalty remains unpaid or the situation creating
the alleged violation remains uncorrected, the city, through its Attorney, may
bring criminal charges in accordance with state law and this code. Likewise,
the city, in its discretion, may bring criminal charges in the first instance,
rather than requesting the payment of an administrative penalty, even if a
penalty for the particular violation has been established by Council
resolution. If the administrative penalty is paid, or if any requested
correction of the situation resulting in the violation is completed, no
criminal charges shall be initiated by the city for the alleged violation.
§ 10.99  CODE VIOLATION AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Prohibited acts. No person shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Violate, fail to comply with, or assist, authorize or permit the
violation of any provision of the Lake St. Croix Beach City Code.
      (2)   Violate, fail to comply with, or assist, authorize, or permit the
violation of the terms and conditions of any city approval, including permits
and licenses, required and granted pursuant to the City Code.
      (3)   Knowingly make or submit any false statement, document, or material
omission in connection with any application or procedure required by the City
Code.
   (B)   Construction regarding employees. No section or part of the City Code
designating the duties of any official, employee, or appointee of the city
shall be construed to make that person liable for the penalties provided below.
   (C)   Misdemeanor. Any person who violates division (A) of this section
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished
by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by imprisonment for a period not to
exceed 90 days, or both; provided, however, that if a different punishment be
prescribed in the City Code, such provision shall govern the punishment for
that violation.
   (D)   Petty misdemeanor. Specific mention of a violation of any of the
provisions of the City Code as being a petty misdemeanor shall mean that, upon
conviction, the sentence of a fine of not more than $100 may be imposed. In the
absence of the designation of a “petty misdemeanor” in connection with any
violation, such violation shall be a misdemeanor as set forth in division (C)
of this section.
   (E)   Continued violation. Each calendar day that division (A) of th is
section is violated shall constitute a separate offense.
   (F)   Application denial; permit revocation. Any violation of division (A)
of this section shall constitute sufficient grounds for denial of any
application required by this code or revocation of a permit which is related to
the violation.
   (G)   City may void approval, license or permit. Any action prohibited by
division (A) of this section shall, at the option of the city, void any
applicable city approval, permit or license previously given.
   (H)   Abatement of violation. The city attorney may institute any lawful
action or proceeding in the name of the City of Lake St. Croix Beach to
prevent, restrain, remedy or abate any violation of division (A) of this
section.
   (I)   Penalties cumulative. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the city
from taking such other actions as are permitted under law, and the penalties
provided here shall be cumulative.
   (J)   Application. Divisions (K) through (M) of this section shall govern
administrative citations and civil penalties for violations of the City Code.
   (K)   Administrative citations and alternative enforcement methods.
      (1)   The city council finds that there is a need for alternate methods
of enforcing the City Code. While criminal fines and penalties have been the
most frequent enforcement mechanism, there are certain negative consequences
for both the city and the accused. The delay inherent in that system does not
ensure prompt resolution. Citizens resent being labeled as criminals for
violations of administrative regulations. The higher burden of proof and the
potential of incarceration do not appear appropriate for some administrative
violations. The criminal process does not always regard City Code violations as
being important. Accordingly, the city council finds that the use of
administrative citations and the imposition of civil penalties is a legitimate
and necessary alternative method of enforcement. This method of enforcement
shall be in addition to any other legal remedy which may be pursued for City
Code violations.
      (2)   The administrative offense procedures established pursuant to this
chapter are intended to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost
effective, and expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for
violations of certain ordinance provisions. The procedures are intended to be
voluntary on the part of those who have been charged with the administrative
offenses. At any time prior to the payment of the administrative penalty as is
provided for hereafter, the individual may withdraw from participation in the
procedures, in which event the city may bring criminal charges in accordance
with law. Likewise, the city, in its discretion, may choose not to initiate an
administrative offense and may bring criminal charges in the first or
succeeding instances.
   (L)   Administrative citation procedure.
      (1)   A violation of any provision of the City Code or the acts
prohibited in division (A) of this section, is an administrative offense which
may be subject to an administrative citation and civil penalties pursuant to
this chapter. Each day a violation exists constitutes a separate offense.
      (2)   Any officer of the Washington County Sheriff’s Office or any other
person appointed by the city, authorized in writing by the city administrator
shall, upon determining that there has been a violation, notify the violator,
or in the case of a vehicular violation, attach to the vehicle a notice of the
violation. The notice shall set forth the nature, date and time of violation,
the name of the official issuing the notice, and the amount of the scheduled
penalty.
      (3)   Once such notice is given, the alleged violator may, within seven
days of the time of issuance of the notice, pay the amount set forth on the
schedule of penalties for the violation as adopted by the city council
resolution from time to time, or may request a hearing in writing, as is
provided for hereafter. The penalty may be paid in person or by mail, and
payment shall be deemed to be an admission of the violation.
      (4)   Any person contesting an administrative offense pursuant to this
chapter may, within seven days of the time of issuance of the notice, request a
hearing by a hearing officer who shall forthwith conduct an informal hearing to
determine if a violation has occurred.
      (5)   A person designated in writing by the city administrator shall be
the hearing officer. The Administrator, in his/her discretion, may refer the
matter to the City Council for public hearing, to act as the hearing officer.
The designated hearing officer is authorized to hear and determine any
controversy relating to administrative offenses provided for in this chapter.
      (6)   The violator shall have the right to be represented by counsel, the
right to respond to the charged violations, and the right to present evidence
through witnesses. The rules of evidence do not apply to the hearing and the
hearing officer may rely on all evidence it determines to be reasonably
credible. The determination to uphold or dismiss the violation shall be made
upon a preponderance of the evidence.
      (7)   The hearing officer shall have authority to dismiss the violation
or reduce or waive the penalty. If the violation is sustained by the hearing
officer, the violator shall pay the penalty imposed within seven days or
withdraw from participation in the administrative procedure by notice in
writing.
   (M)   Recovery of civil penalties.
      (1)   If a civil penalty is not paid within the time specified, it shall
constitute;
         (a)   A lien upon the real property upon which the violation occurred
if the property or improvements on the property was the subject of the
violation and the property owner was found responsible for that violation; or
         (b)   A personal obligation of the violator in all other situations.
      (2)   A lien may be assessed against the property and collected in the
same manner as taxes.
      (3)   A personal obligation may be collected by any appropriate legal
means.
      (4)   A late payment fee to ten percent of the fine shall be assessed for
each 30-day period, or part thereof, that the fine remains unpaid after the due
date.
      (5)   Failure to pay a fine is grounds for suspending or revoking a
license or permit or other approval associated with the violation.
   (N)   Criminal penalties. The following are misdemeanors, punishable in
accordance with state law.
      (1)   Failure to pay a fine or request a hearing within seven days after
issuance of an administrative citation.
      (2)   Failure to appear at a hearing which was scheduled.
      (3)   Failure to pay a fine imposed by a hearing officer within seven
days after it was imposed, or such other time as may be established by the
hearing officer.
   (O)   Collection of fees.
      (1)   Except as otherwise prohibited by State Statute, the City of Lake
St. Croix Beach City Code, or other governing law, no permit or license shall
be issued by the City of Lake St. Croix Beach unless payment has been received
for:
         (a)   Previous permits issued under City Code;
         (b)   Previous licenses issued pursuant to the City Code;
         (c)   Delinquent property taxes;
         (d)   Delinquent special assessments;
         (e)   Penalties;
         (f)   Interest; and
         (g)   Municipal utility fees.
      (2)   Upon receipt of an application, and prior to issuing a permit, the
City Clerk shall review City records to ensure that there are no outstanding
balances. The review shall include:
         (a)   The subject property and/or any adjacent properties under common
ownership; and
         (b)   The resident and/or members of the resident’s immediate family
residing in the same dwelling as the resident.
(Ord. 2013-164A, passed 3-17-2014)

   As an alternative to the payment of this administrative penalty, if the
situation that gave rise to this alleged violation is corrected by            
           (establish date), then the payment of the administrative penalty
will be waived.
   Even if the administrative penalty is paid, the city reserves the right to
institute appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or
abate the violation.
   Before the due date, you may request to appear before the City Council to
contest the request for payment of the penalty. After a hearing before the
Council, the Council may determine to withdraw the request for payment or to
renew the request for payment. Because the payment of the administrative
penalty is voluntary, there shall be no appeal from the decision of the
Council.
   If you pay the administrative penalty, the city will not initiate criminal
proceedings for this alleged violation. However, the Council, or any city
official designated by it, may institute appropriate proceedings at law or at
equity to restrain, correct or abate the violation.
   Payment of the administrative penalty may be made by check, cash or money
order to the City of Lake St. Croix Beach.

demolition wastes within the City without first having obtained a license from
the City Council. Such license shall be issued by the Council for a period of 1
year under the conditions prescribed within this chapter and upon payment of a
license fee of $50, or such other fee as may be established by resolution of
the City Council from time to time. A license so issued may at the sole
discretion of the city be renewed annually upon the payment of such fee and
upon approval by the city. No licensee pursuant to this chapter shall acquire
vested rights in a license. The city may, upon finding that public necessity
requires, establish other means of MSW, recyclables, bulky waste, yard waste,
SSOM or construction/demolition wastes collection. The City Council may for
cause revoke or refuse to renew any license issued hereunder; the violation of
any provisions of this chapter by the licensee shall be cause for the
revocation or refusal to renew the license. If the county revokes or suspends
any hauler’s license, the city license, in case of revocation, shall be
automatically terminated without any further action of the city, or, in case of
suspension, the city license shall also be automatically suspended for the same
length of time, without further action of the city.
   (A)   Any person desiring to be licensed as a licensed hauler shall make
application to the city on a form prescribed by the city. Each licensed hauler
operating under a separate name or identity, whether as parent/subsidiary or
brother/sister organizations or as an independent organization, shall apply for
and obtain a separate license prior to collecting MSW, recyclables, bulky
wastes, yard waste, SSOM, or construction/demolition wastes.
   (B)   No license shall be issued until the applicant files with the city a
current policy of public liability insurance and property damage insurance upon
each of the trucks or other vehicles to be used by the applicant in the
licensee’s business. The limits of coverage of such insurance shall be at least
the sum of $1,000,000 for injury to one person, $2,000,000 for injury to two or
more persons in the same accident, $200,000 for property damages and statutory
limits for workers compensation insurance and may be adjusted from time to
time. The city shall be a named insured on each policy. There shall be a
certificate showing that the licensee has in force and effect the aforesaid
insurance covering both the licensee and the City, and said certificate shall
be filed with the City Clerk within ten days of the approval of the license,
within ten days of any change in insurance status and at least 30 days prior to
the expiration of the policies of insurance for each year of the license.

misdemeanor punishable by jail. The certification shall be approved by the
city.
   (E)   In order to renew a residential dwelling/recycling license, the
licensee must submit to the city a list of all active accounts.
   (F)   No license shall be issued until the applicant files with the city a
schedule of volume based billing rates to be charged by the hauler during the
license period for which the application is made. Differences between rates
charged for the various garbage container sizes shall be sufficient to
encourage recycling and waste reduction in accordance with Minnesota Statutes
and the Washington County Solid Waste Master Plan. Every licensee shall provide
notification to the city and customers at least two weeks prior to any change
in rates to be implemented during the licensed period. Failure to submit the
rates in a timely manner shall render the changed rates void.

revocation of the license.

with its application materials and provide notice to the city within 15 days of
any change of information, forms, rate structures, or certificates filed as

      (3)   Yard waste collection and processing/disposal in season shall be
provided to all customers within five business days of request by the customer.
An additional fee may be charged.
      (4)   SSOM collection and processing/disposal may be provided to all

   (D)   Collection days and hours. The licensed hauler shall comply with days
and hours for collection of MSW, recyclables, bulky wastes, yard wastes, SSOM,
or construction/demolition wastes as contained in this Ordinance and as
specified by resolution of the City Council from time to time.
      (1)   No collection of solid waste recycling, bulky waste, SSOM, yard
waste and/or construction/demolition waste shall be made except between the
hours of seven o’clock (7:00) a.m. and six o’clock (6:00) p.m., Monday through
Friday, as established by the Council. Operation during these hours may require
that service be moved back one day to accommodate holidays. Customers shall be
notified of a specific day for collection of their MSW and recyclables, and the
licensee shall collect the materials within those time periods.
      (2)   Commercial/multiple dwelling collection of solid waste and
construction/demolition waste shall be made at least once a week between the
hours of seven o’clock (7:00) a.m. and six o’clock (6:00) p.m., and on any day
of the week and as often as is necessary to protect the public’s health.
      (3)   Residential “special pick up” as defined in § 50.01 of this chapter
may take place on any day, Monday through Saturday, seven o’clock (7:00) a.m.

hauler.
      (4)   Stops reported by customers and verified as missed shall be
collected within two business days of the miss being reported.
   (E)   Vehicles and equipment. Each licensed hauler shall only use vehicles
and equipment so constructed that the contents shall not leak, spill, or blow
out of the vehicle. The vehicles and equipment shall be kept clean and as free
from offensive odors as possible, and shall not stand on any street, alley, or
public place longer than is reasonably necessary to collect MSW, recyclables,
bulky wastes, yard wastes, SSOM, or construction/demolition wastes. Each
vehicle for which a collector’s license is issued shall exhibit such license in
a prominent position on said vehicle.
   (F)   Collection site and cleanup of spills. The licensee shall ensure that
the collection site is left tidy and free of litter. Any spills, including
spills of solid wastes, vehicle or waste fluids, or hydraulic fluids shall be
cleaned up immediately. If not noticed by the hauler, spills that the city
provides notice to the hauler of shall be cleaned within two hours of notice by
the city.
   (G)   Reports. Each licensed hauler shall compile and retain MSW, recycling,
bulky waste, SSOM, yard waste, and construction/demolition waste weight slips
and other data. Failure to certify accurate weights may be cause for revocation
of the hauling license. All licensees shall submit to the Minnesota Pollution
Control Agency (MPCA), the county, and other required reporting entities in the
future required MSW, recycling, and other waste data in compliance with the
MPCA’s and the county’s reporting requirements. Failure to submit the reports
shall be cause for license suspension. In addition, the hauler shall, when
requested by the city, furnish the city with copies of reports that are
submitted to reporting entities. Failure to keep accurate weights and/or to
furnish this data to the required reporting entities or the city within 30
business days of it being due shall entitle the city to impose liquidated
damages and/or revoke the collection license.
      (1)   Upon demand of the city, the licensee shall produce any records,
which the city may require to verify that all MSW, recyclables, bulky waste,
SSOM and yard waste have been disposed of in a lawful manner. Each licensed
hauler shall provide to the city during normal business hours, access to books,
documents, papers, and other records of the licensee that are directly
pertinent to the issuance and monitoring of the license and required reports.
In addition, all licensed haulers shall report to the city such information as
shall be required by the City Council by resolution from time to time, with
such information being provided as required on a form provided through the
office of the City Clerk for such purpose. Haulers shall be required to
demonstrate that they have disposed of MSW at facilities which are duly
licensed for that purpose.
      (2)   Hauler shall also provide to the city, on demand, a master list of
its customers so that the city may verify that every household and/or business
located within the city has a contract for collection services as required by
M.S. § 115A.941(a), as it may be amended from time to time.
      (3)   The licensee shall notify the City of the discontinuance of service
to any premises with a five day written notice prior to service being
discontinued, if possible, but no later than the date service is actually
discontinued.
   (H)   Opportunity to recycle. Unless the City provides recycling services,
each licensed MSW hauler shall provide its customers with the opportunity to
recycle through a weekly curbside collection of recyclables (as defined in §
50.01 of this chapter). The curbside collection of recyclables shall be on the
same day as collection of customer’s MSW but may occur at a different time
within that day. The recyclables collection shall be from a location at or near
the MSW collection site, or at such other location as mutually agreeable to the
hauler and the customer. The hauler shall specify how the customers are to
place and prepare their recyclables for collection. The hauler shall provide
each new customer with detailed instructions on how to prepare recyclables for
collection. Haulers must notify customers at least 30 days in advance before
changing their recycling collection system and provide detailed instructions on
how to prepare recyclables under the new system. The hauler is deemed the owner
of recyclables, and upon collection, the hauler may market them. Nothing herein
shall be construed to prevent the hauler from offering curbside collection for
other recyclable materials in addition to the defined recyclables.
      (1)   All separated recyclables must be transported to a licensed
recycling facility or delivered to an end market for sale or reuse, or brought
to an intermediate collection center for later delivery to a licensed
processing center or end market for recycling. It is unlawful for any person to
transport for disposal or to dispose of designated recyclables in an MSW
disposal facility. No separated recyclables may be mixed with another waste
material or incinerated or landfilled or composted or made into fuel pellets.
      (2)   In each instance where a hauler does not collect recyclable
materials from a residence or business, adequate notification as to why the
recyclable material was not picked up, must be left with the recyclable
materials left at the curbside.
   (I)   Billing Practices. As licenser, the city reserves the right to insure
billing practices and charges for service are fair and conscionable. All
licensed haulers shall reimburse any unearned fees to any customer who cancels
service for any reason. Additionally, haulers shall not charge any fees to
remove any bin from a customer’s property when they cancel service except, a
hauler may charge a service fee for bin removal if they have entered into a
written contract that expressly outlines this charge in the event the customer
cancels service before the end of the contract period. In the event the city
receives a complaint on billing practices it deems unfair and/or
unconscionable, it shall send a violation notice to the hauler outlining the
unacceptable billing practice. The hauler will be provided an opportunity to
respond to the complaint before any enforcement action is taken.
   (J)   Office location. The hauler shall establish and maintain an office
with continuous supervision for accepting complaints and customer calls. The
office shall be in service with continuous supervision during the hours of 8:00
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. A system for recording and responding
to customer calls outside business hours shall be established and described in
the application for license. The address and telephone number of such office
and any changes therein shall be given to the city in writing.
   (K)   Complaints. The hauler shall maintain a complaint response and file
system. All complaints shall be answered courteously and promptly. The hauler
is responsible for resolving all complaints received.
      (1)   Missed collections reported by customers shall be collected within
two business days of the report of the miss.
      (2)   The city will notify the hauler of any unresolved complaints that
it receives. The hauler shall provide a semi-annual report in a format
prescribed by the City on the total number and type of complaints received and
the resolution of those complaints.

§ 50.17  REGULATIONS; RATES.
   All collection and removal of garbage or recyclables within the city shall
be performed in accordance with the following regulations:
   (A)   Frequency of collections. MSW, recycling, SSOM if provided, and yard
waste during yard waste season shall be collected and removed from each
collection point with sufficient frequency to minimize purification,
objectionable odors, infestation by vectors of disease or as determined by the
city.
   (B)   Limits on quantity. There shall be no limits as to quantity but
haulers need not collect or remove any MSW, recycling, SSOM, or yard waste
unless the same is in appropriate containers.
   (C)   Collection and removal fees/rates. No hauler shall charge a fee for
the collection and removal of MSW, SSOM, or yard waste from any single-family
residential dwelling house, as provided by divisions (A) and (B) of this
section, except as provided by the hauler in its application for license and
established by ordinance by the City Council. A variable rate billing schedule
must be used for all MSW. In the case of multiple-family residential buildings
the fee for each unit within the building shall not exceed the amount permitted
for service to any single-family residential dwelling house; however, in the
case of commercial or other nonresidential buildings, the hauler may charge a
fee to be established by agreement between him or her and the individual
customer, provided the fee is reasonably related to the rate established
hereunder for the collection and removal of MSW and recyclables from
residential buildings to the extent the collection and removal service required
is comparable. In accordance with M.S. § 115A.93 Subd.3(c) haulers shall not
impose a greater charge on residents who recycle than on residents who do not
recycle. The hauler in March and September shall notify each customer of the
yard waste services, costs, and procedures for yard waste pickup provided by
the hauler.
   (D)   Effect of failure to pay fees. Notwithstanding any provision of this
chapter to the contrary, no hauler need collect or remove the garbage from any
collection point if the customer for whom the garbage and rubbish is being
collected and removed at that collection point is in default of any payment or
payments required to be paid for the service under the contract or agreement
existing between the hauler and the customer. All such accounts must be
reported to the city within two business days of non-collection.
   (E)   Separation of yard wastes, other waste. Yard waste separated by the
customer shall not be comingled with garbage, recycling, bulky waste, SSOM, or
construction/demolition waste by the hauler. The City Council of the city may
also by resolution pass from time to time rules and regulations affecting the
separation of other solid waste for collection by licensed haulers within the
city.
   (F)   Unlawful disposal of garbage, rubbish and recyclables. No MSW,
recycling, bulky waste, SSOM, yard waste and construction/demolition waste
shall be collected, conveyed or disposed of except by haulers licensed by the
city.

§ 52.04  COMPLIANCE CRITERIA.
   (A)   Treatment required. Sewage discharged from a dwelling or other
establishment that is not served by a system issued a permit containing
effluent and discharge limits or specific monitoring requirements by the
Department or Agency must be treated according to applicable requirements.
   (B)   Compliance criteria for new construction. An SSTS regulated under a
current permit is considered compliant if it meets the applicable requirements
of §
52.16(U).
   (C)   Compliance criteria for existing systems. To be in compliance, an
existing SSTS must meet the provisions of this subpart.
      (1)   The SSTS must be protective of public health and safety. A system
that is not protective is considered an imminent threat to public health or
safety. At a minimum, a system that is an imminent threat to public health or
safety is a cesspool, seepage pit, drywell or leaching pit, a system with
discharge of sewage or sewage effluent to the ground surface, drainage systems,
ditches, or storm water drains or directly to surface water; systems that cause
a reoccurring sewage backup into a dwelling or other establishment; systems
with electrical hazards; or sewage tanks with unsecured, damaged, or weak
maintenance hole covers. A determination of protectiveness ft other conditions
must be made by a qualified employee of the Department or licensed inspection
business.
      (2)   The SSTS must be protective of groundwater. A system that is not
protective is considered a system failing to protect groundwater. At a minimum,
a system that is failing to protect groundwater is a system that is a seepage
pit, cesspool, drywell, leaching pit, or other pit; a system with less than the
required vertical separation distance described in divisions (C)(4) and (5) of
this section; and a system not abandoned in accordance with §
52.23. A determination of the threat to groundwater quality for other
conditions must be made by a qualified employee of the department or local unit
of government or licensed inspection business.
      (3)   The SSTS must be operated, meet performance standards, and be
managed according to its operating permit.
      (4)   SSTS built after March 31,1996, or in an SWF area as defined in §
52.02, shall have a three foot vertical separation. No more than a 15%
reduction in the vertical separation distance is allowed to account for
settling of sand or soil, normal variation of measurements, and interpretations
of the limiting layer conditions.
      (5)   SSTS built before April 1, 1996, in areas that are not SWF areas as
defined in §
52.02, must have at least two feet of vertical separation.
      (6)   The vertical separation measurement for divisions (C)(4) and (5) of
this section shall be measured outside of the area of system influence in an
area of similar soil and on the same contour elevation.
      (7)   An existing system which is found to be an imminent threat to
public health and safety by either a qualified employees of the Department,
local unit of government, or a licensed inspection business is hereby declared
to be a public health nuisance and shall be repaired, upgraded, replaced or its
use discontinued within 30 days of notice and order to comply by the
Department. Any further discharge of effluent must be stopped immediately (by
such methods as reducing or stopping all water use or pumping the tank as
necessary) until such time as the system is corrected.
      (8)   Any existing system which is found to be failing to protect
groundwater shall be replaced or otherwise brought into compliance within 90
days of notice and order to comply by the Department.
      (9)   An existing system that is not otherwise considered an imminent
threat to public health and safety and which was constructed under a permit
issued by the Department, or other local unit of government that verified that
the required vertical separation existed at the time of installation, need not
be upgraded, repaired, replaced, or its use discontinued notwithstanding the
fact that at the time of a compliance inspection, there appears to be less than
the required vertical separation between the system bottom and any limiting
layer.
   (D)   Compliance criteria for systems with a flow of greater than 2,500
gallons per day. In addition to the requirements under division (C) of this
section, systems designed under §
52.16(D) must demonstrate that the additional nutrient reduction component
required under those items is in place and functioning.
   (E)   Compliance criteria for systems receiving replacement components.
Components of an existing system that result in the system being in
noncompliance must be repaired or replaced according to this chapter. The
repaired or replacement components must meet technical standards and criteria
of this chapter. The remaining components of the existing system must result in
the system being in compliance with division (C) of this section. If a
compliant existing sewage tank is to be used with the design of the new soil
dispersal system, the tank must also be baffled and be watertight.
   (F)   New construction, replacement, or existing MSTS designed under this
chapter are considered conforming if they meet the requirements of this
chapter. Existing MSTS constructed before the effective date of this chapter
are considered conforming if they meet the requirements of this section, except
for divisions(I)(4) and (5) of this section.
   (G)   To be in compliance, all MSTS must:
      (1)   Have treatment processes and devices that do not allow sewage or
sewage effluent contact with humans, insects, or vermin;
      (2)   Disperse sewage effluent into our soil or sand below final grade,

            2.   Redoximorphic accumulations or depletions.
         (c)   In the upper 12 inches of the topsoil layer immediately below
which occurs a periodically saturated horizon, the depth of seasonal saturation
is determined by indicators in divisions 1. to 5. below:

bottom of each test hole shall be at the depth of the absorption area;
         (b)   Soil texture descriptions for percolation test holes must note
the depths from the ground surface where texture changes occur;
         (c)   The bottom and sides of the hole must be carefully scratched to
remove any smearing and to provide a natural soil surface into which water
penetrates. The scarification must not result in the hole having a diameter of
greater than eight inches;
         (d)   All loose material must be removed from the bottom of the test
hole and two inches of one-fourth to three-fourths inch gravel or clean sand
must be added to protect the bottom from scouring;
         (e)   The hole must be carefully filled with clear water to a minimum
depth of 12 inches from the bottom of the test hole and maintained for no less
than four hours for saturation to occur. The soil must then be allowed to swell
for at least 16, but no more than 30, hours. In sandy soils, the saturation and
swelling procedure is not required and the test is allowed to proceed if the
initial filling of the hole with 12 inches of water seeps away in less than ten
minutes;
         (f)   In sandy soils, water depth must be adjusted to eight inches
over the soil at the bottom of the test hole. From a fixed reference point, the
drop in water level must be measured in inches to the nearest 1/16 inch at
approximately ten-minute intervals. A measurement is also allowed to be made by
determining the time it takes for the water level to drop one inch from an
eight inch reference point. If eight inches of water seeps away in less than
ten minutes, a shorter interval between measurements must be used, but water
depth must not exceed eight inches. The test must continue until three
consecutive percolation rate measurements do not vary by more than ten percent.
In other soils, the water depth must be adjusted to eight inches over the soil
at the bottom of the test hole. From a fixed reference point, the drop in water
level must be measured in inches to the nearest 1/16 inch at approximately 30-
minute intervals and refilled between measurements to maintain an eight inch
starting head. If water seeps away in less than 30 minutes, a shorter time
interval between measurements must be used, but water depth must not exceed
eight inches. The test must continue until three consecutive percolation rate
measurements do not vary by more than ten percent. The percolation rate is also
allowed to be determined by observing the time it takes the water level to drop
one inch from an eight-inch reference point if a constant water depth of at
least eight inches has been maintained for at least four hours prior to the
measurement;
         (g)   The time interval must be divided in minutes by the drop in
water level in inches to obtain the percolation rate in minutes per inch. The
percolation rates that are within the ten percent provision determined for each
test hole must be averaged to determine the final percolation rate for that
hole. The slowest final percolation rate for all holes within the soil
dispersal area must be used for design; and
         (h)   A percolation test must not be run where frost exists within 12
inches of the bottom of the percolation test hole.

evaluation, including, but not limited to, identifying and interpreting soil
and landform features and how the difficulties were resolved.
      (10)   A notation of any differences between observed soil
characteristics and those identified in the soil survey report.
   (I)   Applicants for subsurface sewage treatment system permits, site
approvals or subdivision approvals will be required to submit soil test data
from soil borings and percolation tests, or soil pits, for each proposed site
or installation. The minimum testing shall be that necessary to verify suitable
conditions for two complete soil dispersal and treatment areas.
   (J)   All soil testing shall be conducted in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter and shall be conducted by appropriately licensed
businesses and certified individuals in accordance with Minn. Rules Chapter
7083.
   (K)   Prior to and during construction or lot improvements, the proposed
initial and replacement soil treatment and dispersal areas shall be protected
from disturbance, compaction, or other damage by use of stakes and silt fence
or snow fence.
   (L)   Underground utilities must be located before soil observations are
undertaken. Required safety precautions must be taken before entering soil
observation pits.
   (M)   Where soil tests require a mound, testing and design must clearly show
suitable area for installation of two complete mounds. Where site conditions
are such that the only backup mound will likely be disturbed, the Department,
at its discretion, may require both mounds to be constructed at once.
   (N)   Designs for new construction or replacement SSTS must comply with all
applicable requirements and any other applicable codes, rules, and laws.

§ 52.12  SEWAGE FLOW DETERMINATION.
   (A)   Completion of tasks outlined in §§
52.12 to
52.21 is considered the second phase of SSTS design.
   (B)   The estimated design flow for any dwelling must provide for at least
two (2) bedrooms. For multiple or multifamily dwellings, the design flow
consists of the sum of the design flows for each individual unit.

systems require a state disposal system permit.
   (F)   If construction of additional dwellings or bedrooms, installation of
water-using devices, or other factors likely to increase the flow volumes can
be reasonably anticipated, the SSTS must be designed to accommodate the
additional capacity as determined by the Department or local unit of
government.
   (G)   Design sewage flow for other establishments are determined by methods
in divisions (G)(1) or (2) below:
      (1)   The design flow of sewage for MSTS serving other establishments is
estimated using Table II.
      (2)   The measured design flow of sewage for MSTS serving other
establishments is determined by averaging the measured daily flows for a
consecutive seven-day period in which the establishment is at maximum capacity
or use.

* Waste other than sewage is only allowed to be discharged into the system if
the waste is suitable to be discharged to groundwater.
   (H)   Unless otherwise noted in Table II, the flow values do not include
flows generated by employees. A flow value of 15 gallons per employee per eight
hour shift must be added to the flow amount for determining the design flow for
other establishments.
   (I)   Design flow determination for establishments not listed in Table II
shall be determined by the base available information and approved by the
Department or by the local unit of government.
   (J)   The measured flow of sewage for existing other establishments may be
used to modify estimated flow values determined in this part if the length and
frequency of the measured flow accurately represents the annual average water
use, along with the peak weekly and daily water use.
   (K)   The design flow for MSTS must also include 200 gallons of infiltration
and inflow per inch of collection pipe diameter per mile per day with a minimum
pipe diameter of two inches to be used for the calculation. Flow values are
allowed to be further increased if the system employs treatment devices that
are exposed to atmospheric conditions that will infiltrate precipitation. Flow
estimates as calculated in this Chapter shall not be relied upon for the design
of collection systems.
   (L)   If concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand, total suspended
solids, and oil and grease from the sewage are expected to be higher than 175
mg/L, 65 mg/L, or 25 mg/L, respectively, an estimated or measured average
concentration must be determined and be acceptable to the Department or local
unit of government. System design must account for concentrations of these
constituents so as to not cause internal system malfunction, such as, but not
limited to, clogging of pipes, orifices, treatment devices, or media.

unit of government. At a minimum, management plans must include the following:
      (1)   Maintenance requirements, including frequency;
      (2)   Operational requirements, including which tasks the owner can
perform and which tasks a licensed service provider or maintainer must perform;
      (3)   Monitoring requirements;
      (4)   Requirements that the owner notify the Department when the
management plan requirements are not met;
      (5)   Disclosure of the location and condition of the additional soil
treatment and dispersal area on the lot or serving that residency; and
      (6)   Other requirements determined by the Department.
   (B)   SSTS and all components must be maintained in compliance with this
chapter and manufacturer requirements.
   (C)   The owner of an SSTS or the owner’s agent shall regularly, but in no
case less frequently than every three years:
      (1)   Assess whether sewage tanks leak below the designed operating depth
and whether sewage tank tops, riser joints, and riser connections leak through
visual evidence of major defects.
      (2)   Measure or remove the accumulation of scum, grease, and other
floating materials at the top of each septic tank and compartment, along with
the sludge, which consists of solids denser than water.
   (D)   All solids and liquids must be removed by pumping from all tanks or
compartments in which the top of the sludge layer is less than 12 inches from
the bottom of the outlet baffle or transfer hole or whenever the bottom of the
scum layer is less than three inches above the bottom of the outlet baffle or
transfer hole. Total sludge and scum volume must not be greater than 25% of the
tank’s liquid capacity.
   (E)   Removal of accumulated sludge, scum, and liquids from septic tanks and
pump tanks must be through the maintenance hole. The removal of solids from any
location other than the maintenance hole is not a compliant method of solids
removal from a sewage tank, and this method does not fulfill the solids removal
requirements of this Section or a management plan. Liquid and solids removal
from cleanout pips is allowed for holding tank.
   (F)   After removal of solids and liquids, from a system installed after the
effective date of this Chapter, the system shall be secured as described in §
52.13(M). Covers secured by screws shall be refastened in all screw openings.

removed and must be filled with clean earth and slightly mounded to allow for
settling. Removed solids shall be disposed of according to division (K) of this
section.
   (J)   Additives, which are products added to the sewage or to the system
with the intent to lower the accumulated solids in sewage, must not be used as
a means to reduce the frequency of proper maintenance and removal of sewage
solids from the sewage tanks as specified in this section. The use of additives
does not fulfill the solids removal requirement of this section or a management
plan. Additives that contain hazardous waste must not be used in an SSTS.
   (K)   Septage or any waste mixed with septage must be disposed of in
accordance with state, federal, or local requirements for septage and other
wastes. If septage is disposed of into a sewage or septage treatment facility,
a written agreement must be provided between the accepting facility and the
maintenance business.
   (L)   Activities on the current soil dispersal system or the reserve soil
dispersal system, as defined in §
52.02 and described in §
52.09(D), that impair the current or future treatment abilities or hydraulic
performance of the soil dispersal system are prohibited. This includes, but is
not limited to, covering all or part of the soil treatment system with an
impermeable surface as determined by the local unit of government.
   (M)   Any maintenance activity used to increase the acceptance of effluent
to a soil treatment and dispersal system must:
      (1)   Not be used on a system failing to protect groundwater as defined
in §
52.04(C)(2), unless the activities meet the requirements of §§
52.20 or
52.21.
      (2)   Not decrease the separation to the periodically saturated soil or
bedrock.
      (3)   Not cause preferential flow from the soil treatment and dispersal
system bottom to the periodically saturated soil or bedrock.
      (4)   Be conducted by an appropriately certified qualified employee or an
appropriately licensed business as specified in Minn. Rule 7083.0790. Any
substance added with the intent to increase the infiltration rate of the soil
treatment and dispersal system must not contain hazardous substances.
   (N)   Licensed maintenance businesses must maintain accurate records of
pumping activity in the County and shall report such data annually to the
Department on forms provided.
   (O)   MSTS must be maintained according to this section.
   (P)   All external grease interceptors must be routinely inspected to
determine the volume of grease present. All external grease interceptors must
be properly maintained to prevent clogging of downstream piping and system
components.
   (Q)   For all MSTS constructed after the effective date of this chapter, the
designer must complete an operation and maintenance manual and the manual must
be submitted to the Department or the local unit of government before system
operation. The manual shall include a copy of the plans and specifications, as-
built drawings of the system, and information to properly operate the system.
   (R)   All new MSTS shall be operated under a local operating permit
submitted and approved with the design.
   (S)   All groundwater shall be monitored in accordance with §
52.11.
   (T)   Any operational noncompliance must be immediately corrected and
reported by the owner or service provider to the Department or local unit of
government.

future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and
federal agencies. Under this chapter, persons excavating and obstructing the

chapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from persons
using the public rights-of-way.

and the other laws governing applicable rights of the city and users of the
right-of-way. This chapter shall also be interpreted consistent with Minn.
Rules, parts 7819.0050 through 7819.9950 where possible. To the extent any
provision of this chapter cannot be interpreted consistently with the Minnesota
Rules, that interpretation most consistent with the Act and other applicable
statutory and case law is intended. This chapter shall not be interpreted to
limit the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general
ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.

§ 92.09  ANIMAL BITES; ANIMALS EXPOSED TO RABIES.
   (A)   Any law enforcement officer or Animal Control Officer may enter upon
the private property of any person while in pursuit of any dog or cat under
probable cause to believe that such dog or cat has bitten a person or animal,
or that such dog or cat is rabid.
   (B)   Division (A) above notwithstanding, whenever any person who owns,
possesses or harbors any dog or cat within the city learns that the dog or cat
has bitten any human being, such person shall immediately quarantine such dog
or cat for a period of at least ten days, keeping it apart from other animals
until it is determined whether the dog or cat has rabies. The quarantine may be
by the person owning the dog or cat if such dog or cat has a current license
and rabies vaccination at the time the bite occurred. If the dog or cat does
not have a current license and rabies vaccination at the time the bite,
occurred, the dog or cat must be impounded at a licensed pound or with a
licensed veterinarian at the owner’s expense. After the required ten-day
quarantine, the dog or cat shall be examined by a licensed veterinarian to
ensure that there are no clinical signs of rabies. If the dog or cat is found
to be rabid, it shall be humanely euthanized.
   (C)   If the dog or cat owner cannot be located or advised of the dog or cat
bite within two hours of the occurrence, or if the owner fails to quarantine
the dog or cat as required by this subchapter, the Animal Control Officer shall
cause the dog or cat to be impounded and so quarantined. After the required
ten-day quarantine, if the dog or cat is still unclaimed, the dog or cat shall
be humanely euthanized and tested for rabies; if claimed, the dog or cat shall
be examined by a licensed veterinarian to ensure there are no clinical signs of
rabies. If no signs of rabies are observed, the dog or cat can be released to
the owner as specified in §
92.16 of this subchapter. If the dog or cat is found to be rabid, it shall be
humanely euthanized.
   (D)   The Animal Warden, Animal Control Officer or other designate of the
city shall have the authority to verify if the dog or cat is properly
quarantined. Any veterinarian quarantining an animal shall notify the Animal
Warden before the release of such animal.
   (E)   Any dog or cat known to have been bitten by a rabid dog or cat or
exposed to rabies shall be impounded. If, however, the dog or cat is at large
and cannot be apprehended after reasonable effort, the dog or cat may be
immediately destroyed. After impoundment, if proof of rabies immunization is
furnished and booster injections are given by a licensed veterinarian at the
expense of the owner, the dog or cat may be released to the owner as specified
in §
92.16 of this subchapter. If it cannot be proven that the animal has a current
rabies immunization, the owner may, at his or her discretion, make provision
for a suitable quarantine for a period of not less than six months.

      (2)   Any dog or cat that, without provocation, chases, molests or
approaches pedestrians or bicyclists in a threatening manner upon the streets,
sidewalks, right-of-way or any public property, or habitually chases
automobiles on the public streets or highways;
      (3)   Any dog or cat that is kept under unsanitary and/or inhumane
conditions such that the maintenance or keeping of the animal creates odors to
the annoyance of the public in the vicinity;
      (4)   Any dog or cat that kills or attacks another domestic animal or
livestock without provocation while off the owner’s property; or
      (5)   The owning, keeping or harboring of any dog or cat which shall by

   (B)   Any person may, by telephone, notify the City Clerk-Administrator,
Animal Control Officer or law enforcement officer of an alleged violation of

complaint to initiate the citation process. All formal complaints shall be
submitted in writing to the attention of the City Clerk-Administrator and shall
describe the dog or cat, state the acts committed by the dog or cat, the name
and address of the person owning or harboring the dog or cat, and the name and
the address of the person making the complaint. The City Clerk-Administrator
shall then promptly notify the person owning or harboring the dog or cat of the
acts complained of, either by letter or door tag, and shall request that the
nuisance be abated or eliminated within a specified time period. The City
Clerk-Administrator shall also cause the Animal Control Officer or law
enforcement officer to investigate and file a report on the complaint.
   (C)   Upon receipt of a second complaint of a violation of this subchapter,
the City Clerk-Administrator shall cause the Animal Control Officer or law
enforcement officer to investigate and file a second report on the complaint.
If the offense is corroborated by the investigation, the City Clerk-
Administrator shall, by certified letter, notify the person owning or harboring
the dog or cat of the violations complained of, and require that the nuisance
be abated or eliminated within 24 hours or some other reasonable time specified
in the letter. A copy of the letter shall be mailed to the Animal Control
Officer and a copy shall be mailed to the person making the complaint.

within the time specified in the letter), the City Clerk-Administrator shall
contact the appropriate law enforcement agency and/or the City Attorney, inform
them of the alleged violation and request that the owner be cited.

347.50, as it may be amended from time to time.

   (C)   The Animal Control Officer or law enforcement officer shall
immediately seize and impound any dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog
that is found within the city. The dog will be kept no fewer than ten calendar

dog will be euthanized. The owner must pay all associated impounding and
boarding costs prior to the release of the dog. Upon its release, the dog shall
be immediately transported to a location outside of the city, or to a proper
facility to be euthanized.
   (D)   Any such dog that is not properly claimed within ten calendar days
shall be humanely euthanized. The owner of the dog that is euthanized shall be

person or officer (other than the Animal Warden) impounding or restraining such
dog or cat shall immediately deliver the same to the Animal Warden. If the

fees so imposed shall be paid to the Animal Warden at the time of reclaiming

the Animal Warden to determine their reasonableness, and may, by resolution,
impose such additional fees reasonably related to the necessary and reasonable
expenses incurred by the city for the capture, transportation and/or care of
impounded dogs or cats. All such fees must be paid to the Animal Warden prior
to release of the animal. The Animal Warden shall issue a receipt to the owner
evidencing such payment.

within three days from the time of release. At the time of the dog’s or cat’s
release, the owner shall be required to sign a document acknowledging that the
dog’s or cat’s rabies vaccination and/or city dog or cat license are not
current. The Animal Warden shall immediately provide a copy of such document to
the City Clerk-Administrator and to the appropriate law enforcement officer. It
shall be the responsibility of the dog or cat owner to have the dog or cat
vaccinated as provided in §
92.08 of this subchapter, and/or to have the dog or cat licensed as provided in

ALLEGATIONS OF LICENSE VIOLATIONS
§ 110.01  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The city regulates many types of activities. For many of these
activities, the city issues licenses or permits. Licenses or permits are issued
for those activities which have the most profound effect (or potential effect)
upon the health, safety and welfare of the citizens. For example, licenses and
permits are issued for bars and retail liquor establishments, junkyards, the
sale of cigarettes, the operation of mining pits and other special uses of
property which require the City Council to be particularly aware of the
activities being conducted.
   (B)   From time to time, the city is also called upon to determine if the
holder of a license or a permit has violated the terms of that license or
permit. Similarly, there are sometimes allegations that the license or permit
holder has violated a statute, ordinance or rule which also regulates the
proper operation of that activity.
   (C)   Current city ordinances do not adequately establish a uniform
procedure for the city to determine if a violation has occurred. Ordinances
also do not adequately delineate what remedies are available to the city to
ensure that licenses and permits are properly followed in the future so as to
adequately protect the health, safety and welfare of the city’s residents.
   (D)   This chapter is designed to establish a uniform method of determining
whether or not violations have occurred. It is the intent of the City Council
to establish a system which would provide fair and adequate notice to the
permit/license holder of the alleged violation and a hearing before the City
Council. The possible penalties which are provided for are designed to protect
the public from future violations. Specifically, the sanctions should deter a
violator from engaging in future violations and should serve as a warning to
other individuals engaged in the same types of activities that the City Council
will respond appropriately to proven violations.
(1990 Code, § 1102.010)  (Ord. 140, passed 5-24-2000)
§ 110.02  LICENSES AND PERMITS.
   The terms of this chapter shall apply to all licenses and permits of any
kind issued by the city.
(1990 Code, § 1102.020)  (Ord. 140, passed 5-24-2000)
§ 110.03  HEARING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All hearings as envisioned within this chapter shall take place before
the City Council at the City Council chambers or at such other place as is
convenient and proper, given the nature of the matter under consideration.
   (B)   None of the civil sanctions authorized herein shall be imposed by the
City Council until the license/permit holder has been given an opportunity for
a hearing before the City Council.
   (C)   Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions found
within the state’s Administrative Procedure Act (M.S. §§ 14.57 through 14.69,
as they may be amended from time to time).
   (D)   This chapter does not require the city to conduct its hearing before
an employee of the Office of Administrative Hearings. Rather, it is intended
that hearings will take place before the City Council.
(1990 Code, § 1102.030)  (Ord. 140, passed 5-24-2000)
§ 110.04  CIVIL SANCTIONS.
   If the City Council finds that a license or permit holder has failed to
comply with their license or permit, or has failed to comply with any
applicable statute, rule or ordinance related to the operation of the activity
for which a license or permit has been granted by the city, then the City
Council may revoke the license or permit, suspend the license or permit for a
period of up to 60 days, impose a civil penalty of up to $2,000 for each
violation or impose any combination of these sanctions.
(1990 Code, § 1102.040)  (Ord. 140, passed 5-24-2000)  Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 110.05  PAYMENT OF FINES.
   (A)   If the Council imposes a civil fine, the Council shall also allow the
license/permit holder a reasonable time to pay the fine. A “reasonable time to
pay” means that all fines shall be paid within 60 days unless the Council
determines that a longer period of time is justified under the circumstances of
the case.
   (B)   Failure of a license/permit holder to pay a fine within 60 days (or
within the time otherwise allowed by the Council) shall cause that license or
permit to become immediately suspended until full payment is received by the
City Clerk-Administrator.
(1990 Code, § 1102.050)  (Ord. 140, passed 5-24-2000) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 110.06  REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION.
   Any license/permit holder who has had their license or permit suspended or
revoked pursuant to any of the terms of this chapter, shall not be allowed to
operate the activity which required the license or permit until the license or
permit is reinstated. Any operation during a period of suspension or revocation
shall be deemed to be an additional violation of the terms of the permit or
license.
(1990 Code, § 1102.060)  (Ord. 140, passed 5-24-2000)  Penalty, see §

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 111.01  PURPOSE.
   Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 18 years
purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, tobacco products and
tobacco-related devices; and because studies, which the city hereby accepts and
adopts, have shown that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached the
age of 18 years, and that those persons who reach the age of 18 years without
having started smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking; and
because smoking has been shown to be the cause of several serious health
problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of
government; this chapter shall be intended to regulate the sale, possession and
use of tobacco, tobacco products and tobacco-related devices for the purpose of
enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect minors against the serious
effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco products and
tobacco-related devices, and to further the official public policy of the state
in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as stated in M.S. §
144.391, as it may be amended from time to time.

   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

public works (or equivalent position at the city) or designated representative.
   COMPANY.  A natural or corporate person, business association, political
subdivision, public or private agency of any kind, its successors and assigns,
who or which seeks or is required to construct, install, operate, repair,
maintain, remove or relocate facilities in the city.
   FACILITIES.  Telecommunications equipment of any kind, including but not
limited to audio, video, paging, facsimile or similar service, not governed by
M.S. Chapter 238, as it may be amended from time to time, including all trunks,
lines, circuits, physical connections, switching equipment, wireless
communication equipment of all kinds and any necessary appurtenances owned,
leased or operated by a company on, over, in, under, across or along public
ground.
   PUBLIC GROUND.  Highways, roads, streets, alleys, public ways, utility
easements and public grounds in the city.
(1990 Code, § 1703.010)  (Ord. 131, passed 2-6-1996)
§ 114.02  PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Permit required. A company may not construct, install, repair, remove
or relocate facilities, or any part thereof, in, on, over, under or along
public ground without first obtaining a permit from the city.
   (B)   Application. Application for a permit is made to the City Clerk-
Administrator.
   (C)   Issuance of permit. If the City Clerk-Administrator determines that
the applicant has satisfied the requirements of this chapter the City Clerk-
Administrator may issue a permit to the company. An applicant may contest a
permit denial or the conditions of approval by written notice to the Clerk-
Administrator requesting a City Council review within 14 days of the Director’s
action. The Council shall hear any contest of the City Clerk-Administrator’s
actions under this chapter within 45 days of the City Clerk-Administrator’s
receipt of the contest notice. Nothing in this chapter precludes the city from
requiring a franchise agreement with the applicant, as allowed by law, in
addition to the issuance of a permit set forth herein.
   (D)   Permit fee. The application must be accompanied by the permit fee set
by the City Council by resolution.
   (E)   Security for completion of work. Prior to commencement of work, the
company must deposit with the city security in the form of certified check,
letter of credit or construction bond, in a sufficient amount as determined by
the Director for the completion of the work. The securities will be held until
the work is completed plus a period of two months thereafter to guarantee that
restoration work has been satisfactorily completed. Upon application of the
company, providing such information as the Director may require, if two or more
work projects are to be constructed during a calendar year, the Director may
accept, in lieu of separate security for each project, a single security for
multiple projects in such form and amount as determined, in the discretion of
the Director, to be sufficient to assure completion of all projects which may
be in progress at any one time during that calendar year and to guaranty that
restoration work will be satisfactorily completed. The security will then be
returned to the company with interest if required by law and then interest at
the applicable statutory rate.
   (F)   Inspection. When the work is completed the company must request an
inspection by the Director. The Director will determine if the work has been
satisfactorily completed and provide the company with a written report of the

general area of the work, including paving and its foundations, to the same
condition that existed prior to commencement of the work and must exercise
reasonable care to maintain the same condition for two years thereafter. The
work must be completed as promptly as weather permits. If the company does not
promptly perform and complete the work, remove all dirt, rubbish, equipment and
material and restore the public ground to the same condition, the city may put
in the same condition at the expense of the company. The company must, upon
demand, pay to the city the direct and indirect costs of the work done for or
performed by the city, including but not limited to the city’s administrative
costs. To recover its costs, the city will first draw on the security posted by
the company and then recover the balance of the costs incurred from the company
directly by written demand. This remedy is in addition to any other remedies
available to the city.
   (B)   Company initiated relocation. The company must give the city written
notice prior to a company initiated relocation of facilities. A company
initiated relocation must be at the company’s expense and must be approved by
the city, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.

expense, with due regard for seasonal working conditions, permanently relocate
its facilities whenever the city requires such relocation.
   (D)   Relocation where public ground vacated. The vacation of public ground
does not deprive the company of the right to operate and maintain its
facilities in the city. If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the
company, the company must pay the relocation costs. If the vacation proceedings
are initiated by the city or other persons, the company must pay the relocation
costs unless otherwise agreed to by the city, company and other persons.
(1990 Code, § 1703.030)  (Ord. 131, passed 2-6-1996)  Penalty, see §

requirements, for more than 30 days after receiving written notice from the
city of the default, the city may terminate the rights of the company under the
permit. The notice of default must be in writing and specify the provisions of
the permit under which the default is claimed and state the grounds of the
claim. The notice must be served on the company by personally delivering it to
an officer thereof at its principal place of business in the state or by
certified mail to that address.
   (B)   City action on default. If the company is in default in the
performance of the work authorized by the permit, the city may, after the above
notice to the company and failure of the company to cure the default, take such
action as may be reasonably necessary to abate the condition caused by the
default.
      (1)   The company must reimburse the city for the city’s reasonable
costs, including costs of collection and attorney fees incurred as a result of

officials, officers, employees and agents free and harmless from any and all
claims and actions on account of injury or death of persons or damage to
property occasioned by the construction, installation, maintenance, repair,
removal, relocation or operation of the facilities affecting public ground,
unless such injury or damage is the result of the negligence of the city, its
elected officials, employees, officers or agents. The city will notify the
company of claims or actions and provide a reasonable opportunity for the
company to accept and undertake the defense.
   (B)   Claim defense. If a claim or action is brought against the city under
circumstances where indemnification applies, the company, at its sole expense,
shall defend the city if written notice of the claim or action is given to the
company within a period wherein the company is not prejudiced in the defense of
such claim or action by lack of such notice. If the company undertakes the
defense, the company shall have complete control of such claim or action, but
it may not settle without the consent of the city, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of
any defense or immunity otherwise available to the city. In defending any
action on behalf of the city, the company is entitled to assert every defense
or immunity that the city could assert in its own behalf.

its right to reject the location of facilities by failure to respond within the
45 days.
   (C)   Emergency work. A company may open and disturb the surface of public
ground without a permit where an emergency exists requiring the immediate
repair of its facilities. In such event the company must request a permit not
later than the second working day thereafter and comply with the applicable
conditions of the permit. In no event may the company undertake such an
activity which will result in the closing of a street or alley without prior
notification to the city.
   (D)   Street improvements, paving or resurfacing. The city will give the

is performed to maintain the original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, or
original purpose of the facility. (NOTE - The community may wish to change this
to a smaller disturbance area. A smaller area is more restrictive than the
state/federal requirements, so it would be allowable for a local government.)
      DEVELOPMENT, NEW.  Any development that results in the conversion of land
that is currently prairie, agriculture, forest, or meadow and has less than 15%
impervious surface. Land that was previously developed, but now razed and
vacant, will not be considered NEW DEVELOPMENT.

the entire existing building foundation and re-roofing of an existing building
are not considered fully reconstructed.
      GENERAL CONTRACTOR.  The party who signs the construction contract with
the owner or operator to construct the project described in the final plans and
specifications. Where the construction project involves more than one
contractor, the GENERAL CONTRACTOR could be the party responsible for managing

operator may be the GENERAL CONTRACTOR. In these cases, the owner may contract
an individual as the operator who would become the co-permittee.
      GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE.  A wide array of practices at multiple scales that
manage wet weather and that maintains or restores natural hydrology by
infiltrating, evapotranspiring, or harvesting and using stormwater. On a
regional scale, green infrastructure is the preservation or restoration of
natural landscape features, such as forests, floodplains and wetlands, couples
with policies such as infill and redevelopment that reduce overall
imperviousness in a watershed. On a local scale, green infrastructure consists
of site and neighborhood-specific practices, such as bioretention, trees, green
roofs, permeable pavements and cisterns.
      IMPERVIOUS SURFACE.  A constructed hard surface that either prevents or
retards the entry of water into the soil and causes water to run off the
surface in greater quantities and at an increased rate of flow than prior to

limited to, development, redevelopment, demolition, construction,
reconstruction, clearing, grading, filling, stockpiling, excavation, and borrow
pits. Routine vegetation management, and mill and overlay/resurfacing
activities that do not alter the soil material beneath the pavement base, are
not considered land disturbance. In addition, other maintenance activities such
as catch basin and pipe repair/replacement, lighting, and pedestrian ramp
improvements shall not be considered land disturbance for the purposes of
determining permanent stormwater management requirements.
      LINEAR PROJECT.  Construction or reconstruction of roads, trails,

of the work the balance of the financial security falls below 50% of the total
required deposit, the applicant shall make another deposit in the amount
necessary to restore the cash deposit to the required amount. If the applicant
does not bring the financial security back up to the required amount within
seven days after notification by the city that the amount has fallen below 50%
of the required amount the city may:
      (1)   Withhold inspections. Withhold the scheduling of inspections and/or
the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
      (2)   Revoke permits. Revoke any permit issued by the city to the
applicant for the site in question or any other of the applicant's sites within
the city's jurisdiction.
   (G)   Action against the financial security. The city may access the
financial security for remediation actions if any of the conditions listed
below exist. The city shall use the financial security to pay for remedial work
undertaken by the city, or a private contractor under contract with the city,
or to reimburse the city for all costs incurred in the process of remedial work
including, but not limited to, staff time and attorney's fees.
      (1)   Abandonment. The applicant ceases land disturbing activities and/or
filling and abandons the work site prior to completion of the grading plan.
      (2)   Failure to implement the SWPPP or ESC Plan. The applicant fails to
conform to the grading plan and/or the SWPPP as approved by the city.
      (3)   Failure to perform. The BMPs utilized on the project fail within

third of the applicant's maximum exposed soil area achieves final
stabilization, the city can reduce the total required amount of the financial
security by one-third. When more than two-thirds of the applicant's maximum
exposed soil area achieves final stabilization, the city can reduce the total
required amount of the financial security to two-thirds of the initial amount
this reduction in financial security will be determined by the city.
   (I)   Returning the financial security. The security deposited with the city
for faithful performance of the SWPPP or the ESC Plan and any related remedial
work shall be released one full year after the completion of the installation
of all stormwater pollution control measures, including vegetation
establishment, as shown on the SWPPP or ESC Plan.
   (J)   Emergency action. If circumstances exist such that noncompliance with
this subchapter poses an immediate danger to the public health, safety and
welfare, as determined by the city, the city may take emergency preventative
action. The city shall also take every reasonable action possible to contact
and direct the applicant to take any necessary action. Any cost to the city for
emergency action may be recovered from the applicant's financial security.
(Ord. 507, passed 4-18-2016)
§ 150.46  ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.
   (A)   notification of failure of the permit. The city shall notify the
permit holder of the failure of the permit's measures.

parties listed on the application and/or the SWPPP as contacts. Except during
an emergency action, 48 hours after notification by the city or 72 hours after
the failure of erosion and sediment control measures, whichever is less, the
city at its discretion, may begin corrective work. Such notification should be
in writing, but if it is verbal, a written notification should follow as
quickly as practical. If after making a good faith effort to notify the
responsible party or parties, the city has been unable to establish contact,
the city may proceed with corrective work. There are conditions when time is of
the essence in controlling erosion. During such a condition the city may take
immediate action, and then notify the applicant as soon as possible.
      (2)   Erosion off-site. If erosion breaches the perimeter of the site,
the applicant shall immediately develop a cleanup and restoration plan, obtain
the right-of-entry from the adjoining property owner, and implement the cleanup
and restoration plan within 48 hours of obtaining the adjoining property
owner's permission. In no case, unless written approval is received from the
city, may move than seven calendar days go by without corrective action being
taken. If in the discretion of the city, the permit holder does not repair the
damage caused by the erosion, the city may do the remedial work required. When
restoration to wetlands and other resources are required, the applicant shall
be required to work with the appropriate agencies to ensure that the work is
done properly.
      (3)   Erosion into streets, wetlands or water bodies. If eroded soils
(including tracked soils from construction activities) enter or appear likely
to enter streets, wetlands, or other water bodies, cleanup and repair shall be
immediate. The applicant shall provide air traffic control and flagging
required to protect the traveling public during the cleanup operations.
      (4)   Failure to do corrective work. When an applicant fails to conform
to any provision of this policy within the time stipulated, the city may take
the following actions.
         (a)   Stop work order. Issue a stop work order, withhold the
scheduling of inspections, and/or withhold the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy.
         (b)   Permit revocation. Revoke any permit issued by the city to the
applicant for the site in question or any other of the applicant's sites within
the city's jurisdiction.
         (c)   Correction by city. Correct the deficiency or hire a contractor
to correct the deficiency.
            1.   The applicant will be required to reimburse the city for all
costs incurred in correcting stormwater pollution control deficiencies. If
payment is not made within 30 days after costs are incurred by the city,
payment will be made from the applicant's financial securities as described in
§
150.45.
            2.   If there is an insufficient financial amount in the
applicant's financial securities as described in §
150.45, the city may assess the remaining amount against the property. As a
condition of the permit, the owner shall waive notice of any assessment hearing
to be conducted by the city, concur that the benefit to the property exceeds
the amount of the proposed assessment, and waive all rights by virtue of M.S. §
429.081 to challenge the amount or validity of assessment.
   (B)   Misdemeanor. Any person, firm or corporation failing to comply with,
or violating any of these regulations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor
and be subject to a fine or imprisonment or both.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The legislature of the state has, in M.S. Chapters 103F and 462, as they may
be amended from time to time, delegated the responsibility to local government
units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the
City Council does ordain as follows in this chapter.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 152.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   This chapter is based upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the State
Department of Natural Resources.
   (C)   This chapter is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of
the national flood insurance program codified as 44 C.F.R. parts 59 through 78,
as amended, so as to maintain the city’s eligibility in the national flood
insurance program.
(Ord. passed - - )
§ 152.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize those losses described in §
152.02(A) by provisions contained herein.
(Ord. passed - - )
§ 152.04  LANDS TO WHICH ORDINANCE APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city
shown on the official zoning map and/or the attachments thereto as being
located within the boundaries of the Floodway and Flood Fringe Districts.
(Ord. passed - - )
§ 152.05  ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   The official zoning map together with all materials attached thereto is
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The
attached material shall include the Flood Insurance Study for Washington
County, Minnesota and Incorporated Areas and Flood Insurance Rate Map Panel
therein numbered 27163C0367E, both dated February 3, 2010 and prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. The official zoning map shall be on file
in the office of the City Clerk-Administrator.
(Ord. passed - - )
§ 152.06  REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION.
   The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower
than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in
flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from
designation of a floodway.
(Ord. passed - - )
§ 152.07  INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the City Council and shall not be deemed a limitation or
repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
   (B)   The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling
distances on the official zoning map. Where interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the official
zoning map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the
decision of the Zoning Administrator, the Board of Adjustment shall make the
necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on elevations on the
regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the
site at the time the city adopted its initial floodplain ordinance or on the
date of the first national flood insurance program map showing the area within
the 100-year floodplain if earlier, and other available technical data. Persons
contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to present their case to the Board of Adjustment and to submit
technical evidence.
(Ord. passed - - )
§ 152.08  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All
other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the
extent of the inconsistency only.
(Ord. passed - - )
§ 152.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or
land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. passed - - )
§ 152.10  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY USE OR STRUCTURE.  A USE or STRUCTURE on the same lot with, and of
a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or

feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
      (2)   As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that
constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at its
largest projection may be floodproofed in accordance with the following
standards.
         (a)   Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
         (b)   Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally
dry floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing
classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory
structure may be floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classification
in the State Building Code and, for a detached garage, the detached garage must
be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage.
         (c)   Floodproofed accessory structures must meet the following
additional standards:
            1.   The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed
to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
            2.   Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be
elevated to or above
the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly floodproofed; and
            3.   To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of two automatic openings in the outside walls of the
structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at
least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no
higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using
human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy
this requirement for automatic openings.
      (3)   The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of
1,000 cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a
conditional use, unless said fill is specifically intended to elevate a
structure in accordance with division (B)(1) above.
      (4)   The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill
to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
      (5)   The provisions of division (E) below shall apply.
   (C)   Conditional uses. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or
floodproofed in accordance with divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) above and/or any
use of land that does not comply with the standards in divisions (B)(3) and (B)
(4) above shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An application for a
conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation
procedures specified in divisions (D) and (E) above and §
152.28.
   (D)   Standards for Flood Fringe conditional uses.
      (1)   Alternative elevation methods. Alternative elevation methods other
than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure’s lowest floor
above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These alternative methods may
include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls and the like or above-grade,
enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages.
         (a)   The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-
grade and not a structure’s basement or lowest floor if:
            1.   The enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the
structure;
            2.   It is designed to internally flood and is constructed with
flood resistant materials; and
            3.   It is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage.
         (b)   The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the
following additional standards.
            1.   Design and certification. The structure’s design and as-built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State Building
Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and
air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water
from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
            2.   Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas. Above-
grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be
designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
               a.   A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. There shall be a minimum
of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all
openings shall be no higher than one-foot above grade. The automatic openings
shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional
engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The
automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood waters without any form of human intervention; and
               b.   That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State
Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles
or storage.
      (2)   Basements. Basements, as defined by §
152.10, shall be subject to the following.
         (a)   Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
         (b)   Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry
floodproofed in accordance with division (D)(3) below.
      (3)   Floodproofing. All areas of non-residential structures including
basements to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be
floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing
classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally dry floodproofing must
meet the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the State Building Code
and this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-
4 classification shall not be permitted.
      (4)   Storage of materials and equipment.
         (a)   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
         (b)   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning
and in accordance with a plan approved by the City Council.
      (5)   Other provisions. The provisions of division (E) below shall also
apply.
   (E)   Standards for all Flood Fringe uses.
      (1)   Commercial uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad
tracks and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the
employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in
feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four upon
occurrence of the regional flood.
      (2)   Manufacturing and industrial uses.  Measures shall be taken to
minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams
having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards
and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in
division (E)(1) above. In considering permit applications, due consideration
shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be
located in floodplain areas.
      (3)   Fill. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be
properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable
method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria
for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA’s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
      (4)   Hydraulic capacity. Floodplain developments shall not adversely
affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any
tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment
limit has not been specified on the official zoning map.
      (5)   Recreational vehicles. Standards for recreational vehicles are
contained in §
152.45(B).
      (6)   Manufactured homes. All manufactured homes must be securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation,
collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to
be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements
for resisting wind forces.
(Ord. passed - - )  Penalty, see §
152.99
§ 152.43  SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   Review criteria. No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for
the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment
facilities. All lots within the floodplain districts shall be able to contain a
building site outside of the Floodway District at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment
facilities that comply with the provisions of this chapter and have road access
both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two
feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. For all subdivisions in
the floodplain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries, the
regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access
roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and
platting documents.
   (B)   Removal of Special Flood Hazard Area designation. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the
special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated
on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA’s requirements incorporate
specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-
structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated
prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard
area designation will be requested.
(Ord. passed - - )  Penalty, see §
152.99
§ 152.44  UTILITIES, RAILROADS, ROADS AND BRIDGES.
   (A)   Public utilities. All public utilities and facilities such as gas,
electrical, sewer and water supply systems to be located in the floodplain
shall be floodproofed in accordance with the State Building Code or elevated to
above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
   (B)   Public transportation facilities. Railroad tracks, roads and bridges
to be located within the floodplain shall comply with §§
152.41 and
152.42. Elevation to the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be
provided where failure or interruption of these transportation facilities would
result in danger to the public health or safety or where such facilities are
essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or
railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption
of transportation services would not endanger the public health or safety.
   (C)   On-site sewage treatment systems. Where public utilities are not
provided, new or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject to
impairment or contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment
system designed in accordance with the state’s current statewide standards for
on-site sewage treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with
this section.
   (D)   On-site water supply systems.
      (1)   Where properties are not connected to public utilities, on-site
water supply systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
flood waters into the systems.
      (2)   Where public utilities are provided, connections to the municipal
water system shall be required for failing systems within the time frame set
forth in the city’s comprehensive plan.
(Ord. passed - - )  Penalty, see §
152.99
§ 152.45  MANUFACTURED HOMES/TRAVEL TRAILERS AND TRAVEL VEHICLES.
   (A)   New manufactured home parks. Section
157.095 prohibits manufactured homes in the city outside of an approved mobile
home park. Section
157.095 allows mobile home park development only pursuant to a conditional use
permit, and pursuant to the performance standards set forth in §
157.096. Accordingly, manufactured homes in the Floodway or Flood Fringe
District are prohibited.
   (B)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles that do not meet the
exemption criteria specified in division (B)(1) below shall be subject to the
provisions of this chapter and as specifically spelled out in divisions (B)(3)
and (B)(4) below.
      (1)   Exemption.  Recreational vehicles are exempt from the provisions of
this chapter if they are placed in any of the areas listed in division (B)(2)
below and further they meet the following criteria:
         (a)   Have current licenses required for highway use;
         (b)   Are highway ready meaning on wheels or the internal jacking
system are attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
commonly used in campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks and the
recreational vehicle has no permanent structural type additions attached to it;
and
         (c)   The recreational vehicle and associated use must be permissible
in any pre-existing, underlying zoning use district.
      (2)   Areas exempted for placement of recreational vehicles.
         (a)   Individual lots or parcels of record;
         (b)   Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds;
and
         (c)   Existing condominium type associations.
      (3)   Loss of exemption. Recreational vehicles exempted in division (B)
(1) above lose this exemption when development occurs on the parcel exceeding
$500 for a structural addition to the recreational vehicle or exceeding $500
for an accessory structure such as a garage or storage building. The
recreational vehicle and all additions and accessory structures will then be
treated as a new structure and shall be subject to the elevation/floodproofing
requirements and the use of land restrictions specified in §§
152.41 and
152.42 of this chapter. There shall be no development or improvement on the
parcel or attachment to the recreational vehicle that hinders the removal of
the recreational vehicle to a flood free location should flooding occur.
      (4)   New parks or expansion. New commercial recreational vehicle parks
or campgrounds and new residential type subdivisions and condominium
associations and the expansion of any existing similar use exceeding five units
or dwelling sites shall be subject to the following:
         (a)   Any new or replacement recreational vehicle will be allowed in
the Floodway or Flood Fringe Districts provided said recreational vehicle and
its contents are placed on fill above the regulatory flood protection elevation
and proper elevated road access to the site exists in accordance with Section
5.51 of this chapter. No fill placed in the floodway to meet the requirements
of this section shall increase flood stages of the 100-year or regional flood.
         (b)   All new or replacement recreational vehicles not meeting the
criteria of division (B)(4)(a) above may, as an alternative, be allowed as a
conditional use if in accordance with the following provisions and the
provisions of §
152.28.
            1.   The applicant must submit an emergency plan for the safe
evacuation of all vehicles and people during the 100-year flood. Said plan
shall be prepared by a registered engineer or other qualified individual, shall
demonstrate that adequate time and personnel exist to carry out the evacuation,
and shall demonstrate the provisions of divisions (B)(1)(a) and (B)(1)(b) above
will be met.
            2.   All attendant sewage and water facilities for new or
replacement recreational vehicles must be protected or constructed so as to not

§ 152.99  PENALTY.
   (A)   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with
any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with grants of variances or conditional uses) shall
constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as defined by law.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. Such actions
may include but are not limited to:
      (1)   In responding to a suspected chapter violation, the Zoning
Administrator and local government may utilize the full array of enforcement
actions available to it including but not limited to prosecution and fines,
injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a
request to the national flood insurance program for denial of flood insurance
availability to the guilty party. The city must act in good faith to enforce
these official controls and to correct chapter violations to the extent
possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the national flood
insurance program.
      (2)   When a violation is either discovered by or brought to the
attention of the Zoning Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall
immediately investigate the situation and document the nature and extent of the
violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible, this
information will be submitted to the appropriate Department of Natural
Resources and Federal Emergency Management Agency regional office along with
the city’s plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall notify the suspected party of the
requirements of this chapter and all other official controls and the nature and
extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If the structure and/or
use is under construction or development, the Zoning Administrator may order
the construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or
approval is granted by the city. If the construction or development is already
completed, then the Zoning Administrator may either:
         (a)   Issue an order identifying the corrective actions that must be
made within a specified time period to bring the use or structure into
compliance with the official controls; or
         (b)   Notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact
permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30
days.
      (4)   If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the
Zoning Administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day
that lapses shall constitute an additional violation of this chapter and shall
be prosecuted accordingly. The Zoning Administrator shall also upon the lapse
of the specified response period notify the landowner to restore the land to
the condition which existed prior to the violation of this chapter.

allowed to extend laterally (parallel to the river or bluff) when the
improvement is in compliance with the dimensional standards of this chapter and
the side yard standards of this chapter.
         (c)   Exterior decks attached to the structure which do not extend any
roof or foundation may be permitted to extend laterally (parallel to the river
or bluffline) at the same setback as the substandard structure if said deck is
visually inconspicuous in summer months as viewed from the river, and provided
the deck has no roof or building foundation.
         (d)   Substandard structures which do not meet the bluffland and/or
shoreland setbacks shall not be raised in elevation or roof line, except in
floodplain areas and then only to protect the structure.
      (4)   If a substandard structure needs replacing due to destruction,
deterioration or obsolescence, such replacement shall comply with the
dimensional standards of this chapter.
   (B)   Substandard lots.
      (1)   A lot or parcel of land for which a deed has been recorded in the

§ 153.07  SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   Land suitability. No land shall be subdivided which is found by the
City Council to be unsuitable for reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, soil
and rock formations with severe limitations for development, severe erosion
potential, unfavorable topography. Inadequate water supply or sewer disposal
capabilities or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety or
welfare of the future residents of the proposed subdivision or the city. The
City Council, in applying the provisions of this section, shall in writing cite
the particular features upon which it bases its conclusions that the land is

written review and approval of the project.
 
   (D)   Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be granted where there are practical
difficulties in complying with the official control. PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES, as
used in connection with the granting of a variance, means that the property
owner proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner not permitted by an
official control; the plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to
the property not created by the landowner; and the variance, if granted, will
not alter the essential character of the locality. Economic considerations
alone do not constitute PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES. PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES include,
but are not limited to, inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy
systems. Variances shall be granted for earth sheltered construction as defined
in M.S. § 216C.06, subdivision 15, when in harmony with the ordinance. No
variance may be granted that would allow any use that is not allowed in the
zoning district in which the subject property is located. The variance, if
granted, must be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the
ordinance and consistent with the comprehensive plan. Conditions may be imposed
in the granting of a variance. A condition must be directly related to and must
bear a rough proportionality to the impact crated by the variance.
      (2)   The formal public hearing for a variance shall be held by the City
Council as set forth in the zoning ordinance.
   (E)   Requirements of the applicant for a public hearing.  The applicant
shall submit sufficient copies of the following information and additional
information as requested to the local authority 30 days prior to the public
hearing on the application for a conditional use, variance or subdivision:
      (1)   Plat of survey showing the property location, boundaries,
dimensions, elevations, blufflines, utility and roadway corridors, the ordinary
high water mark, floodway and floodplain;
      (2)   The most recent aerial photo of the property with property lines
drawn in;
      (3)   Location of existing and proposed structures including height and
setback dimensions;
      (4)   Location of existing and proposed alterations of vegetation and
topography;
      (5)   Adjoining water-oriented uses;
      (6)   Suitability of the area for on-site waste disposal.  Type, size and
location of the system shall be indicated. If a public or municipal wastewater
collection and treatment system is to be utilized, the applicant must submit a
written agreement from the municipality or sanitary authority indicating that
the system has the capacity to handle the development;
      (7)   Water supply system; and
      (8)   An estimate of permanent and transient residents.
   (F)   Factors to be considered. When considering a proposal or zoning
amendment within the St. Croix River District, the City Council shall address
the following items in making its decisions:
      (1)   Preserving the scenic and recreational resources of the St. Croix
Riverway, especially in regard to the view from and use of the river;
      (2)   The maintenance of safe and healthful conditions;
      (3)   The prevention and control of water pollution, including
sedimentation;
      (4)   The location of the site with respect to floodways, floodplains,
slopes and blufflines.
      (5)   The erosion potential of the site based on degree and direction of
slope, soil type and vegetative cover;
      (6)   Potential impact on game and fish habitat;
      (7)   Location of the site with respect to existing or future access
roads;
      (8)   The amount of wastes to be generated and the adequacy of the
proposed disposal systems;
      (9)   The anticipated demand for police, fire, medical and school
services and facilities; and
      (10)   The compatibility of the proposed development with uses on
adjacent land.

§ 153.09  SEVERABILITY.
   It is hereby declared to be the intention that the several provisions of
this chapter are separable in accordance with the following.
   (A)   If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge any provision of
this chapter to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect any other provisions
of this chapter not specifically included in said judgment.
   (B)   If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge invalid the
application of any portion of this chapter to a particular property, building
or other structure, such judgment shall not affect the application of said
provision to any other property, building or structure not specifically
included in said judgment.
   (C)   Nothing contained in this chapter repeals or amends any ordinance
requiring a permit or license to engage in any business or occupation.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 153.10  ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   It is declared unlawful for any person to violate any of the terms and
provisions of this chapter. Violation thereof shall be a misdemeanor. Each day
that a violation is permitted to exist shall constitute a separate offense. In
the event of a violation or a threatened violation of this chapter, the City
Council or the Commissioner of Natural Resources, in addition to other
remedies, may institute appropriate actions or proceedings to prevent,
restrain, correct or abate such violations or threatened violations and it is
the duty of the City Attorney to institute such action.
   (B)   All misdemeanor violations shall be punishable to the extent specified

§ 154.01  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
   (A)   The city finds that certain areas within the city are characterized by
certain soil types, slopes and water levels which, without proper corrective
action, are unsuitable for development of any type; inappropriate development
in these areas increases the amount of soil materials entering groundwater,
encourages pollution, destroys ecological and natural resources and requires
expenditures of public funds to correct deficiencies; thereby acting to the
detriment of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city.
   (B)   Therefore, the purposes of this chapter are to provide for the
regulation of development on restrictive soils in such a way as to minimize the
risk of environmental damage and to protect private homeowners and governmental
units from incurring high maintenance and capital costs resulting from the
necessity of correcting deficiencies encountered as a result of development on
poorly suited soils.
(1990 Code, § 404.010)
§ 154.02  DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   This chapter shall apply to areas within the city which are delineated on
the official soils maps of the county as contained in the county soil survey,
and have soil types set forth in Table I below. For purposes of determining the
application of this chapter to any particular parcel of land, the above-
referenced map shall be on file in the office of the City Clerk-Administrator,
and shall be available for inspection and copying.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 156.001  INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   General introduction.
      (1)   The city is but one of the land areas making up the Saint Paul-
Minneapolis seven county Metropolitan Area. Its present land use character is
varied — as in any area, but predominantly it is made of agricultural land
units. Its proximity to the core of the metropolitan area suggests that with
the forecasted expansion of population, the land use in the city will continue
to change as it has in the last 15 years. In regard to land use, the changes
will be in the direction of smaller pieces of land for housing and commercial
uses, and finally large scale commercial use such as sales, office, multiple
dwelling or concentrated housing developments.
      (2)   During the course of such change, on a large or small scale, land
holdings are divided into lots with provision for new streets and for the basic
utilities such as power, telephone, water and sewer. This conversion of land
into building sites is a process which requires careful regulation to ensure an
attractive, efficient and safe city environment. Provision must also be made
for possible future resubdivision, for after the subdivision of a land parcel
has been approved and buildings permitted, the same standards must be met by
future resubdivision. The division, combination or resubdivision of land
parcels are the first step in shaping the physical character of a city and as
such are important processes which should be subject to public regulation.
      (3)   Adequate, up-to-date subdivision regulations, as well as good
administration and enforcement, are the tools to control the change in land
use. These subdivision regulations must reflect the desire of the city as
outlined in its comprehensive development plan. Because the city’s outlook will
vary as an area progresses toward urbanization, both the comprehensive plan and
subdivision regulations need periodic review. Finally, of course, the zoning
requirements outline the actual land area usage controlled by the subdivision
regulations within the framework of the comprehensive plan.
   (B)   Why plat.
      (1)   The land use pattern of the city is changing from an agricultural
land use, which required large parcels of land, to an urban land use, requiring
much smaller parcels. Land has been bought and sold using metes and bounds
descriptions, but now with smaller parcels being bought and sold the practice
of describing them by metes and bounds is no longer practical.
      (2)   Many metes and bounds descriptions, past and present, written by
unqualified people do not properly describe conveyance of land. Overlaps and
gaps have been created by these poor descriptions and can only be corrected by
the courts. Descriptions based on a good boundary survey can be checked,
therefore the record plat is a highly desirable instrument. The underlying
description of the property to be platted can be adjusted or corrected, based
on a boundary survey. The recorded plat then becomes a legal document denoting
lots and blocks as the subdivision of the described tract of land. Clean,
simple and accurate conveyances can then be made and described as Lot, Block-
Plat Name.
      (3)   The present platting system was established to provide a simple
system for keeping records of the division and ownership of land. State
statutes give the registered land surveyor exclusive rights to prepare plats.
The statutes also set minimum standards that the surveyor must meet, and
regulate the plat itself, as to information required, size, number and kind.
The reader is referred to M.S. Chapter 505, as it may be amended from time to
time, and the standard procedures for platting in the county.
   (C)   How platting is accomplished.
      (1)   Prior to the preparation of a plat, the subdividers or owners
should meet with city officials, with the Planning Commission, and the City
Engineer in order to be made fully aware of all applicable ordinances,
regulations and plans in the area to be subdivided. At this time or at a
subsequent informal meeting, the subdivider should submit a general sketch plan
of the proposed subdivision and preliminary proposals for the provision of
water supply and waste disposal. The sketch plan can be presented in simple
form but should show any zoning changes which would be required, and should
show that consideration has been given to the relationship of the proposed
subdivision to existing city facilities that would serve it, to neighboring
subdivisions and development, and to the topography of the site. The subdivider
is urged to avail himself or herself of the advice and assistance of the
Planning Commission and the City Council at this point in order to save time
and effort and facilitate the approval of the plat.
      (2)   The next step is for the subdivider to prepare a preliminary plat
for the area to be subdivided. The preliminary plat is a very detailed drawing
showing the proposed development and necessary accessory information. It
contains more detail than is required on the sketch plan and serves as the
basis for the public hearing. It also serves as the master plan for a
development where subdividing a piece of land is carried out stepwise, by a
series of plats, where the first plat which is approved and recorded may be
only part of the total plan, and may later be followed by other plats, all in
conformity with the overall plan.
      (3)   After the preliminary plat is approved, the subdivider will have
his or her surveyor prepare a final plat covering all or part of the land to be
subdivided. The final plat is a legal document designed primarily to record in
the city offices the exact boundaries and location of parcels of land. Before
the City Council will approve the plat, it will usually require the subdivider
to agree to do certain things, such as pave streets. The City Council will make
sure that all such matters are agreed to by the subdivider, and are covered as
necessary by written contract, and by bond, before the plat is approved.
      (4)   The following briefly outlines the platting process for the city.
         (a)   Prepare sketch plan. Meet with city officials and the Planning
Commission to discuss zoning requirements and platting procedure.
         (b)   Prepare preliminary plat. Submit seven copies to the County
Surveyor in order to be placed on the agenda for the County Plat Commission.
         (c)   Submit preliminary plat to city. Submit preliminary plat to city
officials for review and public hearing after review by the County Plat
Commission.
         (d)   Submit preliminary plat to watershed district for review and
approval. If lakeshore property, preliminary plat must also be submitted to the
State Department of Natural Resources.
         (e)   Prepare final plat. After the County Plat Commission and City
Council has given preliminary plat approval, submit copies to the County
Surveyor and to the County Plat Commission for approval.
         (f)   Submit final plat. Submit final plat to city officials for
approval.
         (g)   Signatures and final approval. Obtain all required signatures
and final approval by the County Board.

§ 156.002  PURPOSE.
   (A)   The process of dividing raw land into home sites, or separate parcels
for other uses, is one of the most important factors in the growth of any city.
Few activities have a more lasting effect upon its appearance and environment.
Once the land has been subdivided into urban lots and the streets, homes and
other structures have been constructed, the basic character of this permanent
addition to the city has become firmly established. It is then virtually
impossible to alter its basic character without substantial expense. In most
subdivisions, roads and streets must be maintained and various public service
must be provided. The welfare of the entire city is thereby affected in many
important respects. It is, therefore, to the interest of the general public,
the developer and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived, designed
and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper standards.
   (B)   All subdivisions of land hereafter submitted for approval shall fully
comply, in all respects, with the regulations set forth herein.
   (C)   It is the purpose of these regulations to:
      (1)   Encourage well planned, efficient and attractive subdivisions by
establishing adequate standards for design and construction;
      (2)   Provide for the health and safety of residents by requiring
properly designed streets and adequate sewage and water service;
      (3)   Place the cost of improvements against those benefiting from their
construction;
      (4)   Secure the rights of the public with respect to public lands and
waters; and
      (5)   Set the minimum requirements necessary to protect the public
health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 156.003  SCOPE.
   The rules and regulations governing plats and subdivision of land contained
herein shall apply within the city and other land as permitted by state
statutes. In the event of overlapping jurisdiction within the prescribed area,
the extent of jurisdiction shall be determined and agreed upon between the city
and the other municipality or municipalities concerned. Except in the case of
resubdivision, this chapter shall not apply to any lot or lots forming a part
of a subdivision recorded in the office of the County Recorder prior to the
1972 effective date of the county’s first subdivision ordinance, nor is it
intended by this chapter to repeal, annul or in any way impair or interfere
with existing provisions of other laws or ordinances except those specifically

prescribed by law.
   (B)   Streets shall be logically related to the topography so as to produce
usable lots and reasonable grades.
   (C)   Access shall be given to all lots and portions of the tract in the
subdivision, and to adjacent unsubdivided parcels unless the topography clearly
indicates that such connection is not feasible. Reserved strips and land-locked
areas shall not be created.
   (D)   The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provisions
for the appropriate continuation of the existing streets in adjoining areas.
   (E)   Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, but may be subdivided, the
arrangement of streets in a new subdivision shall make provision for the proper
projection of streets into adjoining areas by carrying the new streets to the
boundaries of the new subdivision at appropriate locations. Streets must be
rough graded or documented that grading can be accomplished within the right-
of-way.
   (F)   Minor streets shall be laid out to discourage their use by through
traffic. Thoroughfares shall be reserved for through traffic by providing
marginal access streets, interior streets for serving lots, or other means.
   (G)   Half or partial streets will not be permitted, except where essential
to reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with the other requirements
and standards of this chapter and where, in addition, satisfactory assurance
for dedication of the remaining part of the street can be secured.
   (H)   Wherever a tract to be subdivided adjoins an existing half, or partial
street, the part of the street within such tract shall be platted.
   (I)   Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs to permit future
street extension into adjoining tracts, or when designed as cul-de-sac streets.
   (J)   Private streets and reserve strips shall be prohibited and no public
improvements shall be approved for any private street. All streets shall be
dedicated for public use except in cluster developments or planned unit
developments.
   (K)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or planned major
thoroughfare or a railroad right-of-way, a street approximately parallel to and
on each side of such thoroughfare and right-of-way may be required for adequate
protection of residential properties and separation of through and local
traffic. Such service streets shall be located at a distance from the major
thoroughfare or railroad right-of-way suitable for the appropriate use of the
intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or for
commercial and industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances
shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach
grades and future grade separations.

feet in subdivisions in which lots are less than two and one-half acres in
size. In subdivisions where lots are two and one-half acres in size or greater,
cul-de-sacs shall not exceed one-quarter mile in length. A variance may only be
granted to this requirement if it can be clearly shown that by reason of
unfavorable land form, or the irregular shape of the land from which the
subdivision is being made,  a normal street pattern cannot be established, or
that land would be wasted by not granting such a variance. Lots with frontage
at the end of the cul-de-sac shall have a minimum of 60 feet of road frontage
and meet the lot width requirement at the building setback line for the zoning
district in which the property is located.
   (B)   Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the
turnaround right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to a property line and a
right-of-way of the same width as the street shall be carried to said property
line in such a way as to permit future extension of the street into the
adjoining tract. At such time as such a street is extended, the acreage covered
by the turnaround outside the boundaries of the extended street shall revert in
ownership to the property owner fronting on the temporary turnaround. To assure
such streets can be constructed according to this code, the street shall be
rough graded or typical sections shall be submitted and approved by the City
Engineer.

shall be subject to soil and percolation tests to determine whether the lot
size proposed will meet minimum standards of health and sanitation due to
limitations of soils as shown on existing soils maps. The lot area and
topography must be such that it will accommodate an adequate disposal system to
serve the residence for the estimated unsewered years, as determined by the
City Council. Such test shall be made at the expense of the subdivider, and a

REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
§ 156.080  IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
   Prior to the approval of a plat by the City Council, the subdivider shall
have agreed, in the manner set forth below, to install, in conformity with
approved construction plans and in conformity with all applicable standards and
ordinances, the following improvements on the site.
   (A)   Survey monuments. All subdivision boundary corners, block and lot
corners, road intersection corners and points of tangency and curvature shall
be marked with survey monuments meeting the minimum requirements of state law.
All U.S., state, county and other official bench marks, monuments or
trangulation stations in or adjacent to the property shall be preserved in
precise position unless a relocation is approved by the controlling agency.
   (B)   Grading. The full width of the right-of-way of each street and alley
dedicated in the plat shall be graded for an urban design roadway.
   (C)   Pavement. All streets and alleys shall be improved with concrete or
bituminous surface except as may be approved by action of the City Council.
   (D)   Curb and gutter. Along both sides of an urban designed street, curb
and gutter shall be installed. Concrete curb and gutter is recommended,
however, bituminous curbing would be permitted if approved by the City Council.
   (E)   Sidewalks. These may be required along both sides of all streets in
areas where residential density equals or exceeds three dwelling units per net
acre of residentially used land or in commercial areas.
   (F)   Water mains. In the case where mains from a public water system are
available, the subdivider shall be required to install water mains in the plat
and connect the same to such public water system.
   (G)   Public sanitary sewer. In all cases where trunk line sanitary sewer
facilities are available, the subdivider shall be required to install sanitary
sewers in the plat and connect the same to such trunk line sewers. If such
facilities are not available but it is expected they will be within five years,
the City Council may require that such sewers, together with all necessary
laterals extending from the main sewer to the street curb shall be installed
and capped for future connection as service becomes available. In that event
the subdivider may also install on-site disposal units provided they are so
located as to permit easy and the least expensive connection to the sewer when
it becomes available and usable. Where such on-site units are installed, the
subdivider shall provide underground plumbing to extend three feet beyond the
footing which plumbing shall be plugged. The area around the stack shall be
scored so that the septic tank line can be disconnected and connection can be
made with the public sanitary sewer system.
   (H)   Drainage facilities. Such facilities and easements shall be installed
as will adequately provide for the drainage of surface waters; a storm sewer
system may be required. Drainage way easements or land dedication may be
required when such easements or land is needed in the public interest for
purposes of floodplain management, proper drainage, prevention of erosion,
pedestrian access to water bodies, or other public purpose. If there is a
watershed district, that Board must approve all surface water drainage.
   (I)   Miscellaneous facilities. Tree planting, street name signs, traffic-
control signs, oversized utility trunk lines, pedestrian ways and other
improvements may be required.

§ 156.081  PAYMENT FOR INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   The required improvements as listed elsewhere are to be furnished and
installed at the sole expense of the subdivider. However, if the cost of an
improvement would by general policy be assessed only in part to the improved
property and the remaining cost paid out of general tax levy, provision may be
made for the payment of a portion of the cost by the city. Further, if any
improvement installed within the subdivision will be of substantial benefit to
lands beyond the boundaries of the subdivision, provision may be made for
causing a portion of the cost of the improvements, representing the benefit to
such lands, to be assessed against the same. In such a situation, the
subdivider will be required only to pay for such portion of the whole cost of
said improvement as will represent the benefit to the property within the
subdivision.
(Ord. passed - -)  Penalty, see §
156.999

with the city requiring the subdivider to furnish and construct said
improvements at his or her sole cost and in accordance with plans and
specifications and usual contract conditions. This shall include provisions for
supervision of details of construction by the City Engineer and shall grant to
the Engineer authority to correlate the work to be done under said contract by
any subcontractor authorized to proceed thereunder and with any other work
being done or contracted by the city in the vicinity. The agreement shall
require the subdivider to make an escrow deposit or, in lieu thereof, to
furnish a performance bond, the amount of the deposit or penal amount of the
bond to be equal to 125% of the Engineer’s estimate of the total cost of the
improvements to be furnished under the contract, including the cost of
inspection. On request of the subdivider, the contract may provide for
completion of part or all of the improvements covered thereby prior to
acceptance of the plat. In such event the amount of the deposit or bond may be
reduced in a sum equal to the estimated cost of improvements so completed prior
to the acceptance of the plat. The time for connection of the work and the
several parts thereof shall be determined by the City Council upon
recommendation of the Engineer after consultation with the subdivider. It shall
be reasonable with relation to the work to be done, the seasons of the year,
and proper correlation with construction activities in the plat and
subdivision.
   (B)   No subdivider shall be permitted to start work on any other
subdivision without special approval of the City Council if he or she has
previously defaulted on work or commitments.

subdivider pursuant to the subdivision agreement. The total costs shall include
costs of inspection by the City Engineer. The city shall be entitled to
reimburse itself out of such deposit for any cost or expense incurred by the
city for completion of the work in case of default of the subdivider under such
contract, and for any damages sustained on account of any branch thereof.
   (B)   Performance bond. The subdivider may furnish a performance and payment
bond with corporate surety, in a penal sum equal to 125% of the total cost, as
estimated by the Engineer, of all the improvements to be furnished and
installed by the subdivider pursuant to the subdivision agreement. The total
costs shall include costs for inspection by the City Engineer. The bond shall
be approved as to form by the City Attorney and filed with the City Clerk-
Administrator.
   (C)   Letter of credit. The subdivider may deposit with the city, from a
bank or other reputable institution or individual subject to the approval of
the City Council, an irrevocable letter of credit which shall certify the
following:

total cost as estimated by the City Engineer, or completing all required
improvements;
      (2)   In the case of failure on the part of the subdivider to complete
the specified improvements within the required time period, the creditor shall
pay to the city immediately, and without further action, such funds as are

improvement. Upon approval, such plans shall become a part of the required
contract. The tracings of the plans approved by the engineer plus two prints
shall be furnished to the city to be filed as a public record.
   (B)   All required improvements on the site that are to be installed under
the provisions of this chapter shall be inspected during the course of
construction by the City Engineer at the subdivider’s expense, and acceptance
by the city shall be subject to the Engineer’s certificate of compliance with
the contract.

improvements pursuant to a cash escrow agreement on other financial
arrangements with the subdivider.
   (B)   It is hereby the announced policy of the city that full and complete
utility systems be installed in all needed areas as soon as is practicable and
feasible. Accordingly, the city shall proceed as soon as it is practicable
after final approval of a subdivision with installation within the subdivision
of such improvements as may be determined to be necessary. In the event of
small subdivisions or in subdivisions in which development may proceed slowly,
or in other events in which the construction of surfaced streets, sidewalks,
utility lines or other improvements is clearly not feasible immediately
following the approval of the plat, the City Council may elect to commence
assessment proceedings, utilize funds of a cash escrow agreement or otherwise
move to finance and install improvements when the subdivision is developed to
the point of warranting the improvements. Such improvements are required in
order to provide greater assurance of public health, assure reliability of
water supply, provide for economy of installation, provide more effective fire
fighting through hydrants, and otherwise protect the public health, safety,
convenience and general welfare.

§ 157.005  NON-CONFORMING USES, BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Definitions of non-conforming uses, buildings and structures. For the
purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      NON-CONFORMING USE.  Any lawful use of land or any lawful use of a
building or structure existing on the effective date of this chapter, or any
amendment thereto, which use does not conform with the regulations for the
district in which it is located after the effective date of this chapter or
such amendment.
      SUBSTANDARD BUILDING or SUBSTANDARD STRUCTURE.  Any building or structure
lawfully existing on the effective date of this chapter or any amendment
thereto which building or structure does not conform with the regulations,
including dimensional standards, for the district in which it is located after
the effective date of this chapter or such amendment.
   (B)   Preservation of non-conforming uses. Except as hereinafter provided in
this section, the lawful use of land or the lawful use of a building or
structure existing on the effective date of this chapter or  on the effective
date of any amendment thereto may be continued although such use does not
conform to the provisions of this chapter, except as otherwise provided in this
section.
   (C)   Preservation of dimensionally substandard buildings or structures.
Except as hereinafter provided in this section, buildings or structures
lawfully existing on the effective date of this chapter or on the effective
date of any amendment thereto may be maintained although such building or
structure does not conform to the dimensional standards of this chapter. Any
such building or structure shall not be altered or improved beyond normal
maintenance, except that any lawful dimensional substandard residential
building, accessory building or structure may be altered or improved if the
existing substandard dimension relates only to setback requirements and does
not exceed 10% of the minimum
setback requirements. Such alteration or improvement shall conform to all of
the provisions of this chapter and shall not increase the existing substandard
square footage.
   (D)   Unlawful uses, buildings and structures. No unlawful use of property
existing on the effective date of this chapter or any amendment thereto nor any
building or structure which is unlawfully existing on such date shall be deemed
a non-conforming use or a non-conforming building or structure.
   (E)   Permit holders and permit applicants. Any non-conforming structure
that is ready for or under construction on the effective date of this chapter
or any amendment thereto may be completed and occupied in accordance with the
requirements of any valid building permit issued therefor prior to such
effective date.
   (F)   Change from one non-conforming use to another. A non-conforming use
may be changed only to a use permitted in the district in which it is located;
except that if no structural alterations are made, a non-conforming use of a
building may be changed to another non-conforming use of the same or a more
restrictive classification, and provided such change is approved by the Board
of Adjustment and Appeals as hereinafter provided. Once changed to a conforming
use, no building or land shall be permitted to revert to a non-conforming use.
   (G)   Change of use with approval of the Board of Adjustment. A non-
conforming use, all or partially conducted in a building or buildings, may be
changed to another non-conforming use only upon determination by the Board of
Adjustment, after a public hearing, that the proposed new use will be no more
detrimental to its neighborhood and surroundings than is the use it is to
replace. In determining relative “detriment,” the Board of Adjustment shall
take into consideration, among other things: traffic generated; nuisance
characteristics, such as emission of noise, dust and smoke; fire hazards; and
hours and manner of operation.
   (H)   Restoration of non-conforming buildings or structures. A non-
conforming building or structure which is damaged or destroyed by fire, flood,
wind, earthquake or other calamity may be restored and the occupancy or use of
such building, structure or part thereof, which existing at the time of such
partial destruction, may be continued or resumed, provided that the restoration
is started within a period of one year and is diligently prosecuted to
completion, unless the damage to such building or structure is equal to 50% or
more of the replacement cost thereof (as determined by the Building Inspector)
in which case, the reconstruction shall conform to the provisions of this
chapter, except by conditional use permit and not to exceed the gross square
footage of the previous structure.
   (I)   Abandonment of use. When any non-conforming use of land or of a
building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of one year, such
land, building or structure shall, thereafter, be used only as provided by this
chapter.
(Ord. passed - -)  Penalty, see §
157.999
§ 157.006  SUPREMACY AND EFFECTIVE DATE.
   (A)   Separability. Every section, provision or part of this chapter or any
permit issued pursuant to this chapter is declared separable from every other
section, provision or part thereof to the extent that if any section, provision
or part of this chapter or any permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall be
held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, it shall not invalidate any
other section, provision or part thereof.
   (B)   Supremacy. When any condition imposed by any provision of this chapter
on the use of land or buildings or on the bulk of buildings is either more
restrictive or less restrictive than similar conditions imposed by any
provision of any other city ordinance or regulation, the more restrictive
conditions shall prevail.
   (C)   More restrictive provisions. This chapter is not intended to abrogate
any easements, restrictions or covenants relating to the use of land or imposed
on lands within the city by private declaration or agreement, but where the
provisions of this chapter are more restrictive than any such easement,
restriction or covenant or provision of any private agreement, the provisions
of this chapter shall prevail.
   (D)   Effective date. This chapter shall be in full force and effect from
and after             , or the date of its passage and publication according to

(Ord. passed - -)
§ 157.021  APPEALS AND VARIANCES; BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT AND APPEALS.
   (A)   There is hereby established a Board of Adjustment and Appeals; the
Board shall have the following powers with respect to this chapter:
      (1)   The exclusive power to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination
made by an administrative officer in the enforcement of this chapter;
      (2)   The exclusive power to hear requests for variance from the literal
provisions of this chapter in instances where their strict enforcement would
cause practical difficulties because of circumstances unique to the individual
property under consideration, and to grant such variances only when it is
demonstrated that such actions will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of
this chapter.
         (a)   The Board of Adjustment and Appeals may not permit as a variance
any use that is not permitted under this chapter for property in the zoning
district where the land is located. The Board may permit as a variance the
temporary use of a one-family dwelling as a two-family dwelling. The Board may
impose conditions in the granting of a variance to ensure compliance and to
protect adjacent properties.
         (b)   Hardship means the proposed use of the property and associated
structures in question cannot be established under the conditions allowed by
this chapter or its amendments and no other reasonable alternate use exists;
however, the plight of the landowner must be due to physical conditions unique
to the land, structure or building involved and are not applicable to other
lands, structures or buildings in the same zoning district. These unique
conditions of the site cannot be caused or accepted by the landowner after the
effective date of this chapter or its amendments.
         (c)   Economic considerations alone shall not constitute a hardship.
      (3)   If an official map has been adopted by the city, to hear and decide
on appeal by the owner of land who has been denied a permit to build within the
limits of lands delineated on an official map which has been adopted and filed
by the city as provided by M.S. § 462.359, as it may be amended from time to
time, and to grant a permit for building in such location in any case in which
the Board finds, upon the evidence and the arguments presented to it:
         (a)   The entire property of the appellant of which such area
identified for public purposes forms a part that cannot yield a reasonable
return to the owner unless such permit is granted;
         (b)   Balancing the interest of the City Council in preserving the
integrity of the official map and of the city comprehensive plan and the
interest of the owner of the property in use of his or her property and in the
benefits of ownership, the granting of such permit is required by
considerations of justice and equity; and
         (c)   In addition to the notice of hearing required by this chapter, a
notice shall be published in the official newspaper once at least ten days
before the date of the hearing. If the Board of Adjustment authorizes the
issuance of a permit, the Council or other board or commission having
jurisdiction shall have six months from the date of the decision of the Board
to institute proceedings to acquire such land or interest therein, and if no
such proceedings are started within that time, the officer responsible for
issuing building permits shall issue the permit if the application otherwise
conforms to city ordinances.  The Board shall specify the exact location,
ground area, height and other details as to the extent and character of the
building for which the permit is granted.
   (B)   The Board of Adjustment and Appeals shall consist of three members and
one alternate member.  The members of the Board of Adjustment and Appeals shall
be appointed by the City Council. Each member, including the alternate member,
shall serve for a period of three years and the terms of the three members
shall be staggered so that no more than one term expires in any year; provided
however, the term of the alternate member may expire during the same year as
the term of one regular member.
      (1)   The term of each member, including the alternate member, shall
begin on January 1 and continue through December 31 of the last year of his or
her term. Provided, however, any member shall continue to serve after
expiration on this term until his or her successor is appointed.
      (2)   Any member of the Board of Adjustment and Appeals including the
alternate member may, for good cause shown for nonperformance of duty or
misconduct in office, be removed from office by four-fifths vote of the City
Council.
      (3)   In the event a vacancy occurs as a result of death, incapacity,
resignation or removal of any member of the Board of Adjustment and Appeals, in
eluding the alternate member, a new member shall be appointed as above
provided, but only for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor.
   (C)   The Board of Adjustment and Appeals shall elect a Chairperson and
Vice-Chairperson from its members and shall appoint a Secretary who need not be
a member of the Board. Subject to such limitations as may be imposed by the
City Council, the Board may adopt rules for the conduct of proceedings before
it. Such rules may include provisions for giving of oaths to witnesses and the
filing of written briefs by the parties. The Board shall provide for a record
of its proceedings which shall include minutes of its meetings, its findings
and the action taken on each matter heard by it, including the final order.
   (D)   The meetings of the Board of Adjustment and Appeals shall be held at
the call of its Chairperson and at such other times as the Board in its rules
of procedure may specify. The alternate Board member shall, when directed by
the Chairperson, attend all meetings of the Board and participate fully in its
activities, but shall not vote on any issue unless authorized to do so by the
Chairperson; the Chairperson shall authorize the alternate Board member to vote
on an issue when a regular member is absent, physically incapacitated, abstains
because of a possible conflict of interest or is prohibited by law from voting
on that issue. Any question of whether a particular issue involves a conflict
of interest sufficient to disqualify a regular Board member from voting
thereon, shall be decided by a majority vote of all regular members, except the
member who is being challenged.
   (E)   An appeal from any order, requirement, decision or determination of
any administrative official may be taken by any person affected thereby, or by
any officer, department, board or bureau of a town, municipality, county or
state within 30 days from the date of any such order, requirement, decision or
determination by filing with the Zoning Administrator a written notice of
appeal.
      (1)   The notice of appeal shall state:
         (a)   The particular order, requirement, decision or determination
from which the appeal is taken;
         (b)   The name and address of the appellant;
         (c)   The grounds for the appeal; and
         (d)   The relief requested by the appellant.
      (2)   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from unless the Board of Adjustment and Appeals, to whom the appeal is
taken, certifies that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate, a stay
would cause imminent peril to life or property.
      (3)   The Board of Adjustment and Appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly
or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination
appealed from and to that extent shall have all the powers of the officer from
whom the appeal was taken, and may direct the issuance of a permit.
   (F)   An application for a variance shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator; the application shall be accompanied by development plans
showing such information as the Zoning Administrator may reasonably require for
purposes of this chapter.
      (1)   The plans shall contain sufficient information for the Board of
Adjustment and Appeals to determine whether the proposed variance will meet all
applicable development standards if the variance is granted. In all cases, the
application shall include:
         (a)   Name and address of the applicant;
         (b)   The legal description of the property involved in the request
for variance, including the street address, if any, of the property;
         (c)   The name and address of the owners of the property and any other
persons having a legal interest therein;
         (d)   A site plan drawn to scale showing the property dimensions;
         (e)   Location of all existing and proposed buildings and their size,
including square footage;
         (f)   Curb cuts, driveways, access roads, parking spaces, off-street
loading areas and sidewalks;
         (g)   The variance requested and the reasons therefor; and
         (h)   The applicant’s certificate showing the names and the addresses
of the record owners of all property located within a minimum of 500 feet of
all the contiguous property owned by the variance applicant.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment and Appeals may impose conditions in the
granting of a variance which the Board may reasonably determine to be necessary
to protect adjacent properties, preserve the public health, safety and welfare
and comply with the intent and purposes of this chapter.
      (3)   The Board of Adjustment and Appeals may also impose such conditions
and requirements as are necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of the
variance.
   (G)   The Zoning Administrator shall, upon the filing of a notice of appeal
or an application for a variance, refer the matter to the Board of Adjustment
and Appeals and establish a time for the hearing thereof by said Board no less
than 15 days after the filing of the said notice or application and no more
than 45 days after the filing thereof. The Zoning Administrator shall notify
the appellant or applicant, the Chairperson of the City Planning Commission,
the City Building Inspector and in the case of an appeal, the officer from whom
the appeal is taken, of the time and place of the hearing. The notice shall be
in writing and shall be served on said person personally at least ten days
preceding the hearing. In lieu of such personal service, the notice may be
served on such person by mail, provided in such case the notice shall be mailed
at least 13 days preceding the date of the hearing.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall also cause the notice of such

proceeding in District Court for such equitable relief as may be appropriate
including cancellation of the permit or appropriate orders preventing,
restraining, correcting or abating such violations or threatened violations.
   (J)   Expiration and suspension of conditional use permit. A conditional use

of 100 units; and
      (12)   Conversion of 40 or more contiguous acres of forest cover to a
different land use.
   (D)   An option EAW may be required by the City Zoning Administrator or City
Council or by any project applicant on any proposed action to determine if the
project has the potential for significant environmental effects or if the
project is of more than city significance, provided any of the following
situations exist:
      (1)   The proposed project is in or near an area recognized in the city
comprehensive plan as being environmentally sensitive due to steep slopes,
bluffline, exposed bedrock, floodplain or wetlands, streams or drainage areas,
ground water, erodible soils, prime agricultural soils or unique vegetation;
      (2)   The proposed project is in or near an area of natural aesthetics,
scenic views, delineated critical area or unique natural beauty as recognized
by the comprehensive plan, Planning Commission or City Council;
      (3)   The proposed project significantly alters existing traffic patterns
or increases the noise level on such roads or streets by more than 10%;

residential subdivisions that include 50 or more lots in an unsewered area.
   (E)   The City Zoning Administrator or City Council shall prepare or cause
to be prepared by consultants, an environmental assessment worksheet which is
mandatory or optionally required. The project proposer shall provide the Zoning
Administrator with sufficient detailed information to complete the worksheet or
shall submit a draft worksheet. If sufficient detailed information is not made
available from the project proper or if the Zoning Administrator cannot
complete the EAW because of time or interest conflicts, the Zoning
Administrator may utilize professional consultants to gather necessary
information and to complete the worksheet.
   (F)   Upon completion of said worksheet, the Zoning Administrator shall
write a recommended finding from the worksheet on whether or not there are
significant environmental effects or effects of more than local significance
which shall require a state environmental impact statement.
   (G)   The Zoning Administrator shall submit the environmental assessment
worksheet and his or her recommendation finding to the Planning Commission at
its next regular meeting or special meeting before the next regularly scheduled
board meeting. After reviewing the Zoning Administrator’s written findings, the
Planning Commission shall recommend to the City Council whether or not there
are significant environmental effects from the project to require the writing
of an impact statement. The Planning Commission may hear appeals of the Zoning
Administrator’s recommendation at this meeting.
   (H)   Within 45 days of the date the project proponent filed a planning
request, the City Council shall have reviewed any appeals, the Zoning
Administrator’s written finding, the Planning Commission recommendation and
shall have forwarded its final decision on the necessity for preparing an
environmental impact statement to the State Environmental Quality Board to be
officially published in the Environmental Quality Board Monitor.
   (I)   Copies of the Zoning Administrator’s written findings on the worksheet
and the City Council’s final decision shall be mailed to all points on the
official Environmental Quality Board distribution list and to adjacent counties
and municipalities likely to be directly impacted by the proposed project. The
Zoning Administrator shall also submit an affidavit certifying the date and
places copies of the worksheet were submitted.
   (J)   Thirty days after the date of the publication of the City Council’s
decision in the Environmental Quality Board Monitor, if no objections are filed
with the EQB, the decision stands.
   (K)   If preparation of an EIS is required, the proponent shall follow the
procedure outlined in the State Quality Board regulations concerning
environmental impact statements. A draft impact statement, as prepared by or
under the direction of the Zoning Administrator, shall be prepared and filed
with the EQB within 120 days of the decision to require an environmental impact
statement.
   (L)   Any proposed project or use on which an EIS is required shall be
considered a conditional use as defined in this chapter and shall comply with
the procedure for approval of a conditional use permit.  Mitigating
recommendations of the EIS shall be incorporated as conditions of issuance on
the conditional use permit.
   (M)   Time delays in the normal permit process caused by the filing and
review of the EAW and/or EIS shall not be considered part of the permit
approval time requirements within this chapter. Such delays shall be considered
as additional required time for each required permit. The permit process for
the proposed project may be continued from the point it was interrupted by the
Worksheet/EIS process.
   (N)   Construction begun on projects requiring an EAW shall be halted at
such time as an EIS is officially required by the Environmental Quality Board
or City Council regulations.
   (O)   Any applicant shall agree in writing as part of his or her application
to reimburse the City Council prior to the issuance of any permits, for all
reasonable costs, including legal and consultant fees incurred by the City
Council in review of the applicant’s project and its impact on the city.
   (P)   The applicant shall deposit with the city from time to time an amount
determined by the Zoning Administrator, necessary to cover such costs prior to
commencement of the review or stage of the review. The applicant shall
reimburse the security fund for any deficits caused if the amount actually
expended or billed to the city by the consultants exceeds the security fund
balance. The city shall refund any money deposited in the security fund and not
expended within 30 days after final action on the application. The city shall
not pay interest on such security deposits.

ZONING DISTRICTS, PERMITTED USES AND DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS
§ 157.040  DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Basic zoning districts. For the purpose of this chapter, the city is
hereby divided into the following basic zoning use districts:
 
District Symbol Intent and Primary Use
                Preserve land to be utilized for interim agriculture and
                commercial food production on lots smaller than those required
A-1             in CFP Districts. A-1 Districts provide areas of rural lot
                density housing with lots large enough for significant
                agricultural activity to occur.
                Provide rural low density housing in agricultural districts on
A-2             lands not capable of supporting long term, permanent commercial
                food production. A-2 District lot sizes will provide for
                marginal agriculture and hobby farming.
                Preserve, protect and manage environmentally sensitive areas
C               having wet soils, steep slopes, exposed bedrock or unique
                natural and biological characteristics in accordance with
                compatible uses.
                Provide districts for a general mix of commercial businesses.
GB              General Business Districts will be located in areas where there
                is a demand for diversified business districts and in areas
                capable of supplying the utilities for such development.
                Provide areas adjacent to major thoroughfares and in areas
                where public utilities are available for the express use of
I               industrial developments. Designation of Industrial Districts
                will help attract industry; and therefore, stabilize the tax
                base and increase the employment of the city.
LB              Provide areas specifically designated for Limited Business such
                as professional offices.
                Provide areas capable of supporting multiple-family dwellings
MF              in terms of public utilities and services, and thereby allowing
                a variety of housing types in greater densities.
                Provide low density residential areas in rapidly developing
                rural settings. R-1 Districts will provide lots large enough to
R-1             maintain a semi-rural setting, but lots not large enough to
                support commercial agriculture. R-1 Districts will provide a
                buffer between agricultural districts and urban, or rapidly
                developing districts.
                Provide residential estates in areas slated for future staged
R-2             public utilities. These R-2 Districts will require lots large
                enough to support on-site sewage treatment facilities until
                such time public sewer and other utilities are available.
                Provide residential suburban lots in areas where public
R-3             utilities exist for those people who desire larger lots on
                urban fringes.
R-4             Provide residential urban lots in areas where the full range of
                public utilities and services are available.
                Provide land for Retail Business, primarily shopping, in areas
RB              where there is, or will be, the greatest demand for such
                services and in areas capable of supporting the intensive use
                of the land demanded by retail businesses.
 
   (B)   Overlay zoning use districts. At the time of adoption of this chapter
or at some future date, the City Council may adopt overlay districts to promote
specific orderly development or to protect some specific sensitive natural
resource.
      (1)   The following overlay regulations are in addition to regulations
imposed by the existing basic zoning use districts:
 
District Symbol Intent and Primary Use
AZ              Protect life from potential aircraft catastrophe and noise by
                restricting development in Airport Zones.
                Preserve commercial agriculture as a viable permanent land use
CFP             and a significant economic activity within the city. Areas
                designated CFP would provide land area for permanent
                economically viable commercial food production.
                Protect the natural environment, homes and other structures
FP              from flood waters by preserving the natural overflow areas of
                lakes, streams and rivers.
                Allow innovative and flexible design for developments that are
PUD             more sympathetic to both humans and nature, and which are not
                possible under current regulations.
 
      (2)   The following overlay regulations are in lieu of regulations
imposed by the existing basic zoning use districts:
 
District Symbol Intent and Primary Use
                Protect the ecological and scenic values of natural,
LS-1            undeveloped water bodies from the harmful effects of
                development.
LS-2            Protect the recreational value of a water body while allowing
                residential development along the shoreline.
LS-3            Encourage development on those water bodies currently being
                developed for residential and recreational uses.
                Protect the environmentally sensitive qualities of the
                Mississippi River Corridor Critical Area yet maintain the
MR              economic importance of the corridor by guiding industrial,
                commercial, residential and recreational developments as well
                as transportation throughout the Mississippi River Corridor.
                Conserve and protect the natural scenic values and resources of
SCR             the St. Croix River Valley in order to maintain the high
                standard of environmental quality indicative of one of the few
                remaining wild rivers in the nation.

   (B)   Additions and exceptions to minimum area, height and other
requirements.
      (1)   Definition. For the purpose of this chapter, the following
definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         EXISTING LOT.  A lot or parcel of land which was of record as a
separate lot or parcel in the office of the County Recorder or Registrar of
Titles, on or before the date of adoption of this chapter.
      (2)   Exemption. Any such lot or parcel created in accordance with
Chapter 156 and is at least two and one-half acres in size, shall be exempt
from the requirements of divisions (B)(3) and (B)(4) below and shall be
considered buildable if the lot or parcel can comply with the remaining
requirements of this division (B).
      (3)   Undersize lots. Any such lot or parcel of land less than two and
one-half acres which is in a residential or agricultural district may be used
for single-family detached dwelling purposes provided the area and width
thereof are within 60% of the minimum requirements of this section; provided
all setback requirements of this chapter can be maintained; and provided it can
be demonstrated that a safe and adequate sewage treatment system can be
installed to serve such permanent dwelling.
      (4)   Group lots. If in a group of two or more contiguous lots or parcels
of land owned or controlled by the same person, any individual lot or parcel
does not meet the full width or area requirements of this chapter, such
individual lot or parcel cannot be considered as a separate parcel of land for
purposes of sale or development, but must be combined with adjacent lots or
parcels under the same ownership so that the combination of lots or parcels
will equal one or more parcels of land each meeting the full lot width and area
requirements of this chapter.
      (5)   Subdivision of lots. Any lot or parcel of land subdivided by any
means after the effective date of this chapter for purposes of erecting a
structure, must be approved as required by
Chapter 156.
      (6)   Lake and stream frontage lots. All lots having frontage on a lake
or stream shall be subject to the provisions of
Chapter 153 as well as the regulations provided by this chapter. All lots on
unclassified bodies of water in
Chapter 153 shall meet the minimum setback requirements for a general
development lake, except as provided in
Chapter 153.
      (7)   Lots in the floodplain. All lots in a designated floodplain shall
be subject to
Chapter 152 as well as the regulations provided by this chapter.
      (8)   Reduction of required yard of lot size prohibited. No yard shall be
reduced in area or dimension so as to make it less than the minimum required by
this chapter, and if the existing yard is less than the minimum required, it
shall not be further reduced. No required yard currently used for a building or
dwelling group shall be used to satisfy minimum lot area requirements for any
other building.
      (9)   Sloping or erodible building sites. On sites with slopes of greater
than 25% or on easily erodible soils as defined on the city soils maps and
compiled by the County Soils Conservation District, no structure shall be
constructed. (Also see §
157.106.)
      (10)   Heavily wooded sites. On any lot, clear cutting shall require a
conditional use permit. A certificate of compliance shall be required for all
cutting on all slopes in excess of 18%. On such slopes, a revegetation plan
shall also be required prior to issuance of a building permit. (See §§
157.106 and
157.112.)
      (11)   Minimum area requirements for lots without public sanitary sewer.
In areas without public sanitary sewer, but where public sanitary sewer is
proposed in the city’s capital improvement program, single- and two-family
homes shall demonstrate suitable soil conditions for a minimum on-site sewage
treatment area of .50 acres per dwelling unit.
      (12)   High-rise multiple dwelling structures.
         (a)   The density standards applicable to multiple dwellings in
structures exceeding three and one-half stories in height shall be as follows:
 
Number of Stories Lot Area Required Per Dwelling Unit
3-1/2 - 6         2,000 square feet
6 - 12            1,500 square feet
12+               1,000 square feet
 
         (b)   Said requirements shall apply regardless of the number of
bedrooms per dwelling unit.
   (C)   Permitted encroachments on required yards.  The following shall be
permitted encroachments into setback and height requirements, except as
restricted by other sections of this chapter:
      (1)   In any yards: posts, off-street parking, flues, leaders, sills,
pilasters, lintels, cornices, eaves (up to three feet), gutters, awnings, open
terraces, steps, chimneys, flag poles, open fire escapes, sidewalks, fences,
essential services, exposed ramps (wheelchair), uncovered porches, stoops or
similar features provided they do not extend above the height of the ground
floor level of the principal structure or to a distance less than three feet
from any lot line nor less than one foot from any existing or proposed
driveway; yard lights and nameplate signs; trees, shrubs, plants; floodlights
or other sources of light illuminating authorized illuminated signs, or light
standards for illuminating parking areas, loading areas or yards for safety and
security reasons, provided the direct source of light is not visible from the
public right-of-way or adjacent residential property.
      (2)   In side and rear yards: fences 25% open; walls and hedges six feet
in height or less; bays not to exceed a depth of three feet or containing an

and ten feet above the centerline grades of the intersecting streets within 100
feet of such intersection.
      (4)   In no event shall off-street parking, structures of any type,
buildings or other improvements cover more than 75% of the lot areas. In no
event shall the landscaped portion of the lot be less than 25% of the entire
lot as a result of permitted encroachments.
   (D)   Setbacks.
      (1)   Front setbacks. Where a vacant buildable lot is adjacent to
structures existing at the time of adoption of this chapter having a
substandard setback from that required by this section, the Zoning
Administrator shall determine a reasonable, average, calculated front yard
setback to implement the requirements of this section, and to fulfill its
purpose and intent. However, in no case shall a building be required to be
setback more than 180 feet from the street centerline, except where an
industrial district is adjacent to a residential district. In a residential
district, the front yard setback shall conform to the established setback line,
unless the Zoning Administrator determines that another setback is more
appropriate as provided herein.
      (2)   Side and rear setbacks. Subject to regulations contained in the
Building Code and other applicable regulations, side and rear setback
requirements may be waived provided party walls are used and the adjacent
buildings are constructed as an integral unit and are part of an approved
shopping center, townhouse development or other similar development. Such
waiver shall only be by issuance of a conditional use permit.
      (3)   Setbacks adjacent to residential areas. Where a commercial district
is adjacent to a residential district, the minimum commercial building setback
from the lot line shall be 35 feet. In the case of industrial districts, such a
minimum setback shall be 75 feet.
      (4)   Setbacks along arterials. Along roads and streets designated as
“Arterials” in the comprehensive plan, the minimum front setback for principal
buildings shall be 150 feet from the nearest planned street centerline.
      (5)   Setbacks from private roads. All setback requirements of this
section shall also be applicable to private roads and easement access rights-
of-way.
   (E)   Height.
      (1)   No structure shall exceed 45 feet in height, including church
spires, bellfries, cupolas and domes, monuments, chimneys and smokestacks, flag
poles, public facilities, transmission towers of private radio broadcasting
stations, television antennae, except barns, silos and other farm structures,
utility transmission services and transmission towers of commercial
broadcasting stations.
      (2)   Parapet walls shall not extend more than four feet above the height
permitted of the buildings.
   (F)   Cluster development standards.  The purpose of this section is to
provide a method by which parcels of land in the Residential, A-1 and A-
2 Districts having unusual building characteristics due to sub-soil conditions,
elevation of water table, water area, relative location or shape of the parcel,
may be more efficiently used.
      (1)   Cluster development may also provide a means to preserve good
agricultural land, open green space, scenic views and other desirable features
of the natural environment.
      (2)   The owner of any tract of land in any Residential, A-1 and A-
2 District may submit a plan on the use and development of such tract of land
as a cluster development to the City Council for a conditional use permit
authorizing completion of the project according to the plan.
      (3)   The plan for the proposed project shall conform to the requirements
of the use district within which the plan is located, except as hereinafter
provided:
         (a) The entire tract of land for which a cluster development is
proposed shall not be less than three acres in size;
         (b)   The applicant shall state precisely the unusual characteristics
of the land or other reason justifying the granting of a conditional use permit
for a cluster development;
         (c)   A preliminary plat shall be submitted that complies with
Chapter 156;
         (d)   The number of dwelling units proposed for the entire site shall
not exceed the total number of permitted for the R-1, A-1 or A-2 Districts
within which the land is located, in all other Residential Districts, including
R-2, R-3, R-4 and Multiple-Family Districts with public sewer and water, the
number of dwelling units shall not exceed 50% more than the total number of
dwelling units permitted if the development was based on the minimum lot size
requirements for single-family residential subdivision.
         (e)   That land which is to be set aside as common land shall be
clearly identified and dedicated as such on the plan. Provisions shall be
required for continual maintenance of any common land not dedicated as public
property and accepted by the city.

§ 157.042  ZONING DISTRICT MAP.
   (A)   The boundaries of the districts as established by this chapter are as
shown on the map published herewith and made part of this chapter, said map is
designated as the official zoning map of the city and shall be maintained as
provided herein by the City Zoning Administrator. The district boundary lines
on said map are intended to follow street right-of-way lines, street
centerlines or lot lines unless such boundary line is otherwise indicated on
the map. In the case of unsubdivided property or in any case where street or
lot lines are not used as boundaries, the district boundary lines shall be
determined by use of dimensions or the scale appearing on the map. All of the
notations, references and other information shown thereon shall have the same
force and effect as if fully set forth herein and are hereby made a part of
this chapter by reference and incorporated herein as fully as if set forth
herein at length, whenever any street or other public way is vacated, any
zoning district line following the centerline of said vacated street or way
shall not be affected by such vacation.
   (B)   When any permit is issued for a planned unit development or any other
permit which affects any zoning district in a substantial way, said permit
shall be coded and noted on the zoning district map by the Zoning Administrator
so as to clearly indicate the use so permitted which may not otherwise be
clearly evident from the map or text of this chapter.
   (C)   When uses in a district are listed as both permitted and as
conditional uses, or when any other conflict appears in this chapter with
respect to permitted uses within a district, the more restrictive portion shall
be applied.

§ 157.046  AIRPORT OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Permitted uses, accessory uses and conditional uses are as
specifically provided in this section and in addition to other use regulations
covering the same land. The Airport Zoning District applies to private or
publicly owned and operated airfields and the adjacent areas. The specific
regulations in this district are in addition to rather than in lieu of
regulations imposed by any other zoning classifications for the same land.
   (B)   The purpose of these regulations is to:
      (1)   Limit the development and future construction to a reasonable
height and use so as not to constitute a hazard for planes operating from the
airfields; and
      (2)   Control the type and extent of land development adjacent to and
near the airfields so as not to impede present or future air operations of
public benefit and to protect the public from hazards, air traffic noise and
other disturbances.
   (C)   The following zones are hereby established:
      (1)   Qualified land use zone. Uses shall not be permitted within this
zone which might result in an assembly of persons; manufacturing or storage of
materials which explode on contact; and the storage of flammable liquid above
ground. Prohibited uses shall include educational, institutional, amusement and
recreational. Permitted uses shall include single-family homes, commercial and
industrial uses. No use may be permitted in such a manner as to create
electrical interference with radio communications between airport and aircraft,
make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport and other lights,
result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in
the vicinity of the airport or otherwise endanger the landing, taking off or
maneuvering of aircraft.
      (2)   Airport zoning. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter and
except as required necessary and incidental to airport operations or
recommended by or in accordance with the rules of the Federal Aviation Agency,
no structure shall be constructed, altered or maintained, and no trees shall be
allowed to grow so as to project above the landing area or any of the airports
referenced imaginary surfaces described below:
         (a)   Horizontal surface. A circular plane, 150 feet above the
established airport elevation, with a radius from the airport reference point
of 5,000 feet;
         (b)   Conical surface. A surface extending from the periphery of the
horizontal surface outward and upward at a slope of 20 to 1 for the horizontal
distance of 7,000 feet and to the elevation above the airport elevation of 500
feet;
         (c)   Primary surface. A surface longitudinally centered on a runway
and extending in length 200 feet beyond each end of a runway. The elevation of
any point on the longitudinal profile of a primary surface, including the
extensions, coincides with the elevation of the centerline of the runway, or
the extension, as appropriate. The width of a primary surface is 250 feet;
         (d)   Approach surface. A surface longitudinally centered on the
extended centerline of the runway, beginning at the end of the primary surface,
with slopes and dimensions as follows: The surface begins 250 feet wide at the
end of the primary surface and extends outward and upward at a slope 20 to 1,
expanding to a width of 2,250 feet at a horizontal distance 10,000 feet; and
         (e)   Transitional surfaces. These surfaces extend outward and upward
at right angles to the runway centerline at a slope of seven to one from the
edges of the primary and the approach surfaces until they intersect the
horizontal or conical surface.
   (D)   Airport landing area, approach area, width, slope, horizontal surface
and conical surface; maximum height of buildings, structures and trees below a
runway approach surface.
      (1)   Approach surface plan view.
      (2)   Approach surface elevation. All height limitations are computed
from the established airport elevation.

dwelling unit shall be prohibited.
   (H)   All existing principal buildings in residential districts with non-
winterized construction or inadequate non-conforming year-round on-site sewage
treatment systems as described in Chapters 1 and 4 shall be considered a
seasonal principal building. No building permit shall be issued for the
improvement of a seasonal principal building to a continuous year-round (365
days) inhabitable dwelling unit unless the existing building conforms or the
building after such improvement (including septic systems) will conform with
all the requirements of the County Development Code and any applicable state
requirements.
   (I)   Any alterations, modifications or enlargements of an existing seasonal
principal building for the purpose of continuing the seasonal use shall require
a conditional use permit.
