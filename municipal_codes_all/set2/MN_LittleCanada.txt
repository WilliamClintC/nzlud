therefore, shall, when subsequently securing such permit, be required to pay double the fees
provided by this Code for such permit and shall be subject to all the penal provisions of this
Code.
(2) Permits shall only be issued when the applications show that the work is to be
done by persons, firms or corporations (other than the owner-occupant of residential property)
who have been duly licensed by the City to engage in the business of sewer installation within
205-2
the City, who have paid the required fee and have filed the bonds and insurance certificates
required under this section.
Upon completion of the work, a copy of the permit shall be signed and dated by the
licensed individual or firm making the sewer installation and delivered to the City Inspector at
the time he makes his final inspection of the work. The City Inspector shall sign the permit to
show that the work and material conform to the City Code. The permit shall also be filled out
showing the kind and size of pipe, the kind of joint used, the length of house connection, the
depth at the street, the depth at the house, the distance from either side of the house where the
connection is made to the house plumbing, and any other information listed on the permit form
or required by the City Inspector.
(3) Before any person, firm or corporation engages in the business of sewer
installation within the City, he shall make application to the City for a license, shall pay a fee,
and shall file with the City Administrator a bond and certificate of insurance per Section
302.020. This license must be obtained before a permit shall be issued.
(4) The City Council may revoke any license at any time if the licensee shall violate
the provisions of this or any other provision of the City Code. No licensee shall allow his name
to be used by any other person for the purpose of doing any work within the City, except that
this provision shall not prevent a licensed plumber from employing the services of a licensed
pipe layer or licensed sewer installer.
205.050. CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS. The following materials and
construction methods, and none other, shall be used in making sewer connections to the
municipal system.
(1) Materials. All pipe shall be 4" diameter or larger, and constructed of materials
approved by the Public Works Director.
(2) Joints and Connections. All joints and connections shall be constructed of
materials approved by the Public Works Director.
(a) Unless otherwise approved by the Public Works Director, all house
sewers shall have a grade of not less than one-eighth inch (1/8”) per foot. A
grade of one-quarter inch (1/4”) per foot should be used wherever practical. The
contractor shall check grades before construction proceeds. Wherever possible,
the connecting sewer shall join the building at an elevation which is below the
basement floor of such building.
(b) In the event that a sewer service exists from the main sewer to a point
outside of the street, the contractor shall excavate and expose the upper end of
the service pipe. The elevation of the pipe leaving the structure shall be
205-3
determined, and the difference between the two (2) pipes shall be sufficient so
that a minimum grade of one-eighth inch (1/8”) per foot is maintained.
(c) All sewer services shall have tracer wire run from the right-of-way line to
the structure. The tracer wire and installation shall meet current specifications
for the installation of tracer wire.
(d) Any sanitary sewer service longer than 75-feet shall have a cleanout
placed at a maximum of every 75 feet for the length of the service.
(3) Alignment. No connecting sewer shall contain bends or a combination of bends
which at any point shall be greater than 45 degrees, and no more than two bends, regardless of
angle, shall be permitted in any single house connection, except where manholes are constructed
at such points and in such manner as directed by the Public Works Director. No connecting
sewer shall be laid parallel to any bearing wall or footing unless further distance than three (3)
feet from any such bearing wall or footing. No connecting sewer shall be laid within twenty
(20) feet of any well.
(4) Trenching and Backfilling.
(a) All excavations shall be open-trench work unless otherwise authorized by
the City Engineer. The foundation in the trench shall be formed to prevent any
subsequent settlement of the pipes. If the foundation is good and firm earth, the
earth shall be pared or molded to give a full support to the lower third of each
pipe. Bell holes shall be dug to provide ample space for pouring of joints. Care
must be exercised in backfilling below the center line of the pipe in order to give
it proper support.
(b) Backfilling shall be placed in layers and solidly tamped or packed up to
two (2) feet above the pipe. Backfilling shall not be done until the section to be
backfilled has been inspected and approved by the City Inspector.
(5) Use of Existing Sewers. Existing sewer services or portions of such sewers may
be approved for use by the Public Works Director. The Public Works Director may request that
the old sewer be excavated for the purpose of facilitating inspection. No cesspool or septic tank
shall be connected to any portion of the house sewer that is also laid across or over any existing
cesspool or septic tank, the existing cesspool or septic tank shall first be pumped clean and filled
with earth to the surrounding ground level. Where a sewer is laid across or over any existing
cesspool or septic tank, only material approved by the Public Works Director shall be used for
that portion of the connecting sewer which is laid across or over the existing cesspool or septic
tank.
(6) Connections at “Y” Only. Every connecting sewer shall be connected to the
Municipal sewer system at the “Y” designated for the property served by the connection, except
205-4
where otherwise expressly authorized by the Public Works Director. Where expressly
authorized by the Public Works Director, all connections made at points other than the
designated “Y” shall be made only under the direct supervision of the Public Works Director in
such manner as the Public Works Director may direct.
(7) Cesspools. If the cesspool or septic tank on a property is being abandoned and
the building is being connected to City sewer, the sewer installer shall be permitted to pump the
clear liquid content of septic tanks and cesspools into the lateral line in the street with a
centrifugal pump having a discharge line of 1 1/2 inches maximum diameter and he shall then
flush the stub connection clean with a garden hose for at least 15 minutes under the supervision
of the City Inspector. Sludge which cannot be removed in the above manner shall be pumped
into tank wagons and removed.
All cesspools and septic tanks of every kind and type of construction, the use of which
shall be discontinued, shall be pumped, holes punched through the bottom, and filled with sand
to prevent the possibility of future cave-in and to prevent future contamination of adjacent soil
and water.
(8) Tunneling. Tunneling for distances of not more than six feet is permissible in
yards, courts or driveways of any building site. When pipes are driven, the drive pipe shall be at
least one size larger than the pipe to be laid.
(9) Cover. The minimum cover over house connections shall be six (6) feet in order
to prevent freezing. Wherever possible the cover shall be maintained at seven (7) feet. Any
sewer pipe laid with less than six-feet of cover shall be insulated with a minimum of 2-inches of
insulation per foot shallower than six feet. Insulation shall be a minimum of four-feet wide
unless an alternate width is approved by the City Inspector.
205.060. INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS.
(1) The drainage and plumbing system of each new building and of new work
installed in an existing building shall be separate from and independent of that of any other
building except where provided in (2) of this section, and every building shall have an
independent connection with a public sewer when such is available.
(2) Where one building stands to the rear of another building on an interior lot and
no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining
alley, court, yard or driveway, the building drain from the front building may be extended to the
rear building and the whole will be considered as one building drain. Where such a building
drain is extended, a clean out shall be provided immediately inside the rear wall of the front
building.
205-5
205.070. PROHIBITED DISCHARGES. All discharge into the City’s sanitary sewer
system shall be in conformance with the Waste Discharge Rules adopted by the Metropolitan
Council Environmental Services.
205.080. DISCHARGE OF SURFACE WATERS PROHIBITED. The discharged
water from roof, surface, ground water, sump pump, footing tile, swimming pool, or other
natural precipitation into the City’s sanitary sewer system results in large and needless
expenditures to treat the water at the Metropolitan Council’s sewage treatment plant. Therefore,
the City Council finds it in the best interest of the City to prohibit such discharges.
(1) No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any substance not requiring
treatment or any substance not acceptable for discharge, as determined by the City or the
Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, into the sanitary sewer system. Only sanitary sewage
from approved plumbing fixtures may be discharged into the sanitary sewer system.
(2) No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged, directly or indirectly, any
storm water, surface water, ground water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, or cooling water to
any sanitary sewer. Any person having a roof drain, sump pump, unauthorized swimming pool
discharge, cistern overflow pipe or surface drain connected and/or discharging into the sanitary
sewer shall disconnect and remove any piping or system conveying such water to the sanitary
sewer system by August 1, 1998.
(3) All construction involving the installation of clear water sump pits shall include a
sump pump with minimum size one and one-half inch (1 ½”) diameter discharge pipe. The pipe
attachment must be a rigid permanent type plumbing such as PVC or ABS plastic pipe with
glued fittings, copper or galvanized pipe. All discharge piping shall be installed in accordance
with the plumbing code. Discharge piping shall start at the sump pit, extend through the
exterior of the building, and terminate with not less than six (6) inches of exposed pipe. The
discharge pipe shall be provided for all clear water sump installations with no regard as to
whether the pump is actually installed. Sump pump discharge location and flow shall be
consistent with the approved development drainage plan for the lot. The discharge may not be
pumped directly onto any public right-of-way unless approved by the Public Works Director or
her/his designee. Any disconnects or openings in the sanitary sewer shall be closed and
repaired in compliance with applicable codes.
(4) All properties in the City that discharge into the City’s sanitary sewer system
shall be subject to an inspection by authorized city employees or agents to confirm there is no
sump pump or other prohibited discharge into the sanitary sewer system. The purpose of the
inspection shall be to confirm that there is no sump pump or other prohibited discharge into the
sanitary sewer system.
(5) Any owner of any property found to be in violation of this Section shall make the
necessary charges to comply with this Section within fourteen (14) calendar days of notification
from the City and such change shall be verified by authorized City employees or its agents
205-6
through a re-inspection of the property. A surcharge as established by City Council resolution
is hereby imposed and shall be added to every sewer billing, to property owners who are found
not in compliance with this Section. The surcharge shall be added every quarter until the
property is verified to be in compliance through the City’s inspection program.
(6) Upon verified compliance with this Section, the City reserves the right to request
re-inspection of such property or structure at least annually to confirm continued compliance.
(7) The Public Works Director, shall review and decide written requests for
temporary waivers from the provisions of this Section where strict enforcement would cause a
threat to public safety because of circumstances unique to the individual property under
consideration. Any request for a temporary waiver from the provisions of this Section, the
property owner shall agree to pay an additional fee for sanitary sewer services based on the
number of gallons discharged into the sanitary sewer system as estimated by the Public Works
Director or his/her designee.
(8) Any new buildings with sumps for which a building permit is issued after June 1,
1998, shall have a pump and shall be piped to the outside of the dwelling before a certificate of
occupancy is issued.
(9) Violation of this Section is a misdemeanor and each day that the violation
continues is a separately prosecutable offense. The imposition of the surcharge shall not limit
the City’s authority to prosecute the criminal violations, seek an injunction in District Court
ordering the person to disconnect the nonconforming connection to the sanitary sewer, or for the
City to correct the violation and certify the costs of connection as an assessment against the
property on which the connection was made.
(10) The Public Works Director, and any other City employee or agent duly
authorized and bearing the proper credentials and identification, may at reasonable times request
from the property owner the right to enter upon all properties for the purpose of inspection,
observation, measurement, testing, and sampling in connection with the operation of the City
sanitary sewer system. If any person refuses to allow their property to be inspected, the City
reserves the right to seek an administrative search warrant in order to conduct an inspection in
accordance with this Section.
205.090. TAMPERING WITH MUNICIPAL SEWER SYSTEM PROHIBITED. No
person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or
tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the municipal sewer
system. No person shall attach any prohibited or unreported lead or line to that system without
having a permit to do so, nor shall any unreported connection be made on the owner’s premises,
inside or outside of the building thereon, which would introduce waters or substances prohibited
or forbidden by this Code.
205-7
205.100. CERTAIN CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED. No buildings located on
property lying outside the limits of the City shall be connected to the municipal sanitary sewer
system unless express authorization therefore is obtained from the City Council.
205.110. ENTRY UPON PRIVATE PROPERTY. The Public Works Director and
other duly authorized employees of the City, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall
at reasonable times be permitted to enter upon all properties for the purpose of inspection,
observation, measurement, sampling and testing in connection with the operation of the
municipal sanitary sewer system.
205.120. REPAIR OF PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY AND GAS LINES.
(1) No connection to the municipal sanitary sewer system shall be finally approved
until all streets, pavements, curbs and boulevards or other public improvements thereon have
been restored to their former condition to the satisfaction of the Public Works Director.
(2) Whenever any licensee hereunder or any other person engaged in making a
connection to the municipal sanitary sewer system shall damage the coating on any gas mains or
gas lines, such damage shall be promptly reported by the person causing such damage to Xcel
Energy or its successors before such gas line or gas main is covered with earth. Failure to make
such report shall be considered a violation of this Code subject to penalties herein imposed.
205.130. VARIANCES. The Public Works Director may permit variations from the
strict application of any of the provisions of this Code if he is satisfied that there are special
circumstances or conditions affecting the premises for which the variance is requested and that
the granting of such variance will not materially adversely affect the public health, safety or
general welfare or public or private property. Any variation permitted under this provision must
be noted on the permit.
205.140. SEWER RATES AND COLLECTION OF CHARGES.
(1) There shall be a quarterly charge for use of the municipal sanitary sewer system.
This quarterly charge and the penalty in (E) below shall be set forth and are subject to change
by resolution of the City Council of Little Canada and shall at all times be subject to provisions
of pertinent contracts with the Metropolitan Council Environmental Services.
(2) All accounts shall be kept by the street number and under the account number
assigned thereto, and by the name of the owner. All bills and notices shall be sent to the
owner’s address. If a non-residing owner desires bills and notices be sent to a different address,
they shall notify the Utility Billing Department. If the property owner has requested bills and
notices be sent to the property’s tenant, and should a tenant be delinquent in payment of account
balances, the property owner shall be ultimately responsible for payment of the sewer charges.
205-8
(3) Where service is for less than a quarterly period, the quarterly charges will be
pro-rated on a monthly basis.
(4) Where an automatic sprinkler or irrigation system is connected to the Municipal
water supply and metered separately, there shall be no sewer charged in association with that
water usage.
(5) Rates due and payable by each sewer user located beyond the territorial
boundaries of the City shall be determined by a special contract.
(6) Statements for sewer charges for the preceding quarterly period shall be mailed
to each customer on or before the 15th day of January, April, July, and October of each year.
Any account which remains unpaid thirty (30) or more days after the bill is mailed is a
delinquent account. A penalty in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid balance shall
be added to each delinquent account. Any pre-payment or overpayment of charges may be
retained by the City and applied on subsequent quarterly statements.
(7) As deemed necessary by City staff, notice shall be provided to account holders
and owners with a delinquent balance notifying them of the delinquency. If the delinquent
accounts remain unpaid after the payment date specified in the notice, an administrative charge
as established by City Council resolution shall be assessed on these delinquent accounts, and
this charge along with the delinquent sewer charges, including penalties, shall be certified by
the City Council to the Ramsey County Department of Property Taxes for collection with taxes
due against said premises. In the event that the administrative charge is to be certified for
unpaid water charges, pursuant to Section 1601.300(G), the administrative charge for unpaid
sewer charges shall be waived.
(8) Exceptions to the sewer rates set forth above and the water service charge set
forth in Section 1601.300(A) shall apply to senior citizens and disabled citizens who otherwise
would be subject to sewer use charges. Any such senior citizen or disabled citizen, as
hereinafter defined, shall become eligible for reduced sewer and water service charge rates as
established by City Council resolution by signing an application provided by the City affirming
that he or she is owner and head of household at his or her address and is receiving Retirement
Survivors Insurance or Disability Insurance under the Social Security Act. The applicant must
also verify that their annual household income is below the low income level established by the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. For the purpose of this subsection, a
senior citizen shall be a person sixty-five (65) years of age or older, the owner and head of a
household, and entitled to benefits under the Social Security Act. A disabled person is defined
as one who is sufficiently disabled as to qualify for Disability Insurance benefits under the
Social Security Act and is also the owner and head of his or her household.
205.150. PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT.
205-9
(1) Any person violating any provisions of this Code shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine as established by City
Council resolution or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed ninety (90)
days, or by both.
(2) Whenever any building has not been connected to the municipal sanitary sewer
system as required in Section 205.020 hereof, the Building Official of the City shall serve a
written notice upon the owner or occupant to install plumbing and make such connection as
required by this Code within thirty (30) days after service of said notice, and if the owner or
occupant fails to install plumbing and make a sewer connection to the City sanitary sewer
system within thirty (30) days after such written notice is given and proof of such service of
notice has been filed with the City Administrator, the Council may by resolution direct that
sanitary plumbing and sewer connection be made and the cost of the installation shall be paid in
the first instance by the City out of the general fund of the City and the actual cost thereof shall
thereafter be assessed against the property benefited. After such installation and connection is
completed there shall be served a written notice of such assessment and an order directing the
owner of the property, or his representative, to pay the assessment within ten (10) days after
service of the written notice, to the City Treasurer, and after proof of such notice and order if
the assessments have not been paid within the ten (10) days, the same shall be certified to the
County Auditor for collection as other assessments for benefits, except that such assessments
may be spread over a term of three (3) years, if so requested when certified, and the said
assessment shall become a lien upon the property until paid.
205.160. RECITALS. The Metropolitan Waste Control Commission, a metropolitan
commission organized and existing under the laws of the State of Minnesota (the
"Commission"), in order to receive and retain grants in compliance with the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and regulations thereunder (the "Act"), has
determined to impose an industrial user sewer strength charge upon users of the Metropolitan
Disposal System (as defined in Minnesota Statutes, Section 473.121, Subdivision 24) to recover
operation and maintenance costs of treatment works attributable to the strength of the discharge
of industrial waste, such sewer strength charge being in addition to the charge based upon the
volume of discharge. In order for the City to pay such costs based upon strength of charges and
a formula for the computation thereof for all industrial users receiving waste treatment services
within or served by the City. Furthermore, Minnesota Statutes, Section 444.075, Subdivision 3,
empowers the City to make such sewer charge a charge against the owner, lessee, occupant or
all of them and certify unpaid charges to the County Auditor as a tax lien against the property
served.
205.170. ESTABLISHMENT OF STRENGTH CHARGES. For the purpose of paying
the costs allocated to the City each year by the Commission that are based upon the strength of
discharge of all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within or served by the City,
there is hereby approved, adopted and established, in addition to the sewer charge based upon
the volume of discharge, a sewer charge upon each person, company or corporation receiving
205-10
waste treatment services within or served by the City, based upon strength of industrial waste
discharged into the sewer system of the City (the "Strength Charge").
205.180. ESTABLISHMENT OF STRENGTH CHARGE FORMULA. For the
purpose of computation of the Strength Charge established by Section 205.170 hereof, there is
hereby established, approved and adopted in compliance with the Act the same strength charge
formula designated in Resolution No. 76-172 adopted by the governing body of the
Commission on June 15, 1976, such formula being based upon pollution qualities and difficulty
of disposal of the sewage produced through an evaluation of pollution qualities and quantities in
excess of an annual average base and the proportionate costs of operation and maintenance of
waste treatment services provided by the Commission.
205.190. STRENGTH CHARGE PAYMENT. It is hereby approved, adopted and
established and the Strength Charge established by Section 205.170 hereof shall be paid by each
industrial user receiving waste treatment services and subject thereto before the twentieth (20th)
day next succeeding the date of billing thereof to such user by or on behalf of the City, and such
payment thereof shall be deemed to be delinquent if not so paid to the billing entity before such
date. Furthermore, it is hereby established, approved and adopted that if such payment is not
paid before such date, an industrial user shall pay interest compounded monthly at the rate of
two-thirds of one percent (2/3 of 1%) per month on the unpaid balance due.
205.200. ESTABLISHMENT OF TAX LIEN. As provided by Minnesota Statutes,
Section 444.075, Subdivision 3, it is hereby approved, adopted and established that if payment
of the Strength Charge established by Section 205.170 hereof is not paid before the sixtieth (60)
day next succeeding the date of billing thereof to the industrial user by or on behalf of the City,
said delinquent sewer strength charge, plus accrued interest established pursuant to Section
205.190 hereof, shall be deemed to be a charge against the owner, lessee and occupant of the
property served, and the City or its agent shall certify such unpaid delinquent balance to the
County Auditor with taxes against the property served for collection as other taxes are collected;
provided, however, that such certification shall not preclude the City or its agent from recovery
of such delinquent sewer strength charge and interest thereon under any other available remedy.
205.205. SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS – SEWAGE TREATMENT.
(1) Public Sanitary Sewage.
(a) Buildings, unless specifically exempted by the City Council on the
grounds that no human beings occupy or use such buildings and no sewage wastes
are generated therein, located on property adjacent to a sewer main, or in a block
through which the system extends, shall be connected to the municipal sanitary
sewer system within one (1) year from the time a connection is available Any
buildings used for human habitation or for human occupancy, including all
business to any such property.
205-11
(b) All buildings hereafter constructed within the City on property adjacent
to a sewer main or in a block through which the system extends, shall be provided
with a connection to the municipal sanitary system for the disposal of all human
wastes.
(2) Individual Sewage Treatment Systems.
(a) Purpose, Intent, Applicability, and Authority
1. Purpose: It is the purpose of this ordinance to establish standards

Subsurface Sewage Treatment Systems (SSTS).
2. Intent: It is the intent of this ordinance to protect public health and
safety, ground water quality, and prevent or eliminate the development of
public nuisances. The Little Canada Subsurface Sewage Treatment
System (SSTS) Ordinance is a conventional SSTS ordinance allowing the
use of trenches, seepage beds, mounds, and at-grade systems to safely
treat sewage.
3. Applicability: This ordinance shall apply to any premises in the
City that utilize a subsurface sewage treatment system to treat sewage.
4. Authority: This ordinance is adopted pursuant to Minnesota
Statutes, Section 115.55; Minnesota Statute, Section 145A.01 through
145A.08; Minnesota Statutes, Section 375.51; or successor statutes, and
Minnesota Rules, Chapter 7080, Chapter 7081, Chapter 7082, or
successor rules.
(b) Standards Adopted
1. Minnesota Rules Adopted: Minnesota Administrative Rules
Chapters 7080 and 7081, and 7082 that are in effect on the date of
passage of this ordinance, relating to subsurface sewage treatment
systems, and hereby adopted by reference and made a part of this
ordinance as if fully set forth herein.
2. Minnesota Rules Amended: The rules, adopted in section (b) 1.
are amended as follows: Chapter 7080.2270, 7080.2280, 7080.2350,

such public nuisance and require him or her to terminate and abate such nuisance and to remove
such conditions or eliminate such defects. Notice requiring abatement or removal must be served on
the owner, occupant, or agent of the property by certified and United States mail, or personal
service. If the owner of the property is unknown or absent and has no known representative upon

abate and enjoin further continuation of said nuisance.
601.080. ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE BY COUNCIL. If, after service of notice of
intent to abate nuisance, the person served fails to abate the nuisance or make the necessary repairs,

Council may cause such nuisance to be abated at the expense of the City and recover such costs
against the person or persons served. To cover administrative costs necessarily incurred in the
abatement and assessment procedure, an administrative fee in the amount of not more than 25% of
the cost to abate the nuisance shall be imposed, except that in no event shall the administrative fee
be less than $50.00. As to any such costs, the City Council shall direct the City Administrator to

703-2
holding a leasehold interest in the property may also use the fair market value of the property for real
estate tax purposes as determined by the City Assessor in the year the license is first issued for
determining whether the initial investment requirement has been satisfied. The Council may provide

one year from the date of issuance of the license, the license may be revoked or suspended.

A. Revocation and suspension of licenses. The City Council shall have the
power to suspend or revoke the license of any person licensed by the City
found to be in violation of the terms of their license or other applicable
laws.
1. Before taking such action, the person holding such license must be
given 20 days’ notice and granted the opportunity to be heard
before the Council or an advisory board, depending on the license,
before such action is taken.
2. The notice shall generally state: the proposed license action; the
time, place and circumstances of the allegations against the
licensee; the governing body that will conduct the hearing; and the
time and place of the hearing. If the hearing is not held before the
City Council, the notice shall advise the licensee of the time and
place of the Council’s meeting to consider the hearing panel’s
recommendation. If documents will be used to substantiate the
license action, the notice shall advise that the documents are
available at City Hall for inspection and copying.
3. The notice will clearly state, in emphasized text, that failure to
either appear at the hearing or submit a written waiver of the
hearing will result in the suspension or revocation of the license.
4. The notice shall be sent by first-class mail to the licensee’s legal
address on file with the City Clerk. If and when such notice is sent
to the legal address on file and the licensee fails or refuses to
appear at the hearing, the license will be automatically suspended
or revoked five days after the date of the hearing.
5. The Council or hearing panel shall apply any criteria supplied in
the City ordinance creating the license. If the licensee has been
convicted in a criminal court for the offense which gives rise to the
suspension or revocation action, the City may take the conviction
as conclusive proof of the offense, and determine the appropriate
license penalty.
B. When a license is suspended under 800.010(A), the period of suspension
shall not be less than 30 days nor more than one year, such period being
determined by the City Council.
800-1
C. Automatic revocation. When any person holding a license issued by the
City has been convicted for the second time by a court of competent
jurisdiction for violation of any of the sections of a City ordinance relating
to the subject matter of the license, the City Council shall revoke the
license of the person so convicted. Such person may not make application
for a new license for a period of one year.
D. Appeals of Administrative Decisions. Any licensee aggrieved by any
order, requirement or other decision of the City Administrator or other
City official which directly affects the ability of the licensee to undertake
the licensed activity may appeal the matter to the City Council. The
licensee must submit a written request for a hearing to the City
Administrator. The City Administrator must schedule a date for hearing
before the Council and notify the aggrieved person of the date. The date
chosen for hearing must be within thirty (30) days of the date an appeal
request is received, unless otherwise requested by the grievant. The
Council shall allow the grievant to speak on the appeal and present other
witnesses and documentation as may be reasonable for the grievant to
state his or her case. The Council may also allow the City staff involved
to present information supporting their action. At the close of the hearing,
the Council may make a decision to overturn the administrative action,
uphold the administrative action, or to continue the matter to the next
meeting to gather further information.

provided for by City Ordinances, the City may prosecute a violation of any provision of

802. TOBACCO PRODUCTS
802.005 PURPOSE AND INTENT
Because the City of Little Canada recognizes that tobacco use has been shown to be the
cause of several serious health problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all
levels of government; this ordinance is intended to regulate the sale of tobacco, tobacco-related
devices, and electronic delivery devices for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws,
and to protect youth and young adults against the serious effects associated with use and
initiation. Youth and young people are particularly susceptible to the addictive properties of
tobacco products, and are particularly likely to become lifelong users. National data show that
about 95 percent of adult smokers begin smoking before they turn 21. The ages of 18 to 21 are a
critical period when many smokers move from experimental smoking to regular, daily use.
Electronic delivery device use among youth has recently tripled. Young minds are particularly
susceptible to the addictive properties of nicotine. As a result, approximately 3 out of 4 teen
smokers end up smoking into adulthood.
This ordinance is intended to regulate the sale of tobacco, tobacco-related devices, and
electronic delivery devices to protect the public, especially youth and young adults, and to further
the official public policy of the state in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke
as stated in Minn. Stat. § 144.391, as it may be amended from time to time.

Licensed Products shall comprise an area no greater than fifty (50) cubic feet and

not apply these regulations in an attempt to restrain assembly or speech prior to its
occurrence.

result of the event;

public safety, regularly scheduled on-duty personnel will police the event. If
additional police protection for the event is deemed necessary by the City
Administrator upon consideration of the factors set forth in subsection (b), he

proposed parade or race would have an immediate and adverse effect upon the
welfare and safety of persons and property;

points of the parade or race will not unduly interfere with proper fire and
police protection of, or ambulance service to, areas contiguous to such parade

to persons or property and will not, on its face, violate any federal, state or

police services would have an immediate and adverse effect upon the welfare
and safety of persons and property; and

structure, whether permanent or temporary, on a city street, sidewalk or right-of810-
7
way unless advance approval for the erection or replacement of the structure is

(a) All land fill or excavating operations shall be completed within one hundred eighty
(180) days of the issuance of the permit. Upon completion the permit holder shall
notify the Building Official in writing of the date of completion. If additional time
beyond the one hundred eighty (180) days is needed for completion, the permit
holder may apply to the City and upon a satisfactory showing of need, the City
Council may grant an extension of time. If such extension is granted, it shall be for a
definite period and the City Administrator shall issue an extension permit.
Extensions shall not be granted in cases where the permit holder fails to show that
1501-5
good faith efforts were made to complete the land fill operation within one hundred
eighty (180) days and that failure to complete the operation was due to an act of God,
labor dispute or shortage of material. In the event a request for an extension is
denied, the permit holder shall be allowed a reasonable time to comply with the other
provisions of this Section relating to grading, leveling and seeding or sodding. What
constitutes such "reasonable time" shall be determined by the City Engineer after
inspecting the premises.
(b) At the completion of a land fill or excavating operation, the premises shall be graded,
leveled, and seeded or sodded with grass. The grade shall be such elevation with
reference to any abutting street or public way as the Engineer shall prescribe in the
permit. The site shall also conform to such prerequisites as the Engineer may
determine with reference to storm water drainage runoff and storm water passage or
flowage so that the land fill or excavating cannot become a source of, or an
aggravation to, storm water drainage conditions in the area. The Engineer shall
inspect the project following completion to determine if the applicant has complied
with the conditions required of him. Failure of such compliance shall result in the
withholding of any building permits for the site and notice of such withholding shall
be filed in the office of the County Recorded for the purpose of putting subsequent
purchasers on notice.

damage any structure, appurtenance, or property of the water system or fill or partially fill any
excavation, or raise or open any gate constructed or maintained for the water system.
1601.040. DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE FOR VIOLATIONS. Water service
may be shut off at any stop box connection whenever:
(1) The owner or occupant of the premises served, or any person working on any
pipes or equipment thereon which are connected with the water system, has violated or
threatens to violate any of the provisions of this Chapter.
(2) Any charge for water, service, meter or any other financial obligations imposed
on the present or former owner or occupant of the premises served is unpaid.
(3) Fraud or misrepresentation by the owner or occupant of the premises served in
connection with an application for service.
1601.050. DEFICIENCY OF WATER AND SHUTTING OFF WATER. The City
shall not be liable for any deficiency or failure in the supply of water to consumers, whether
occasioned by shutting the water off for the purpose of making repairs or connections, or from
any other cause whatever. In case of fire, or alarm of fire, or in making repairs or construction
of new works, water may be shut off at any time and kept off as long as necessary.
1601.060. SUPPLY FROM ONE SERVICE. No more than one housing unit or
building shall be supplied from one service connection except by permission of the City.
1601.070. TAPPING OF MAINS PROHIBITED. No person except persons
employed or contracted by the City shall tap any distributing main or pipe of the water supply
system or insert stop-cocks or ferrules therein without the City’s permission.
1601.080. REPAIR OF LEAKS. It shall be the responsibility of the consumer or
owner to maintain the service pipe from the curb stop box into the house or building. In case of
failure upon the part of any consumer or owner to repair any leak occurring in his pipe within
twenty-four (24) hours after verbal or written notice thereof, the water will be shut off and will
1601-2
not be turned on until the leak is repaired. When the waste of water is great, or when damage is
likely to result from the leak, the water may be turned off immediately pending repairs. If the
City becomes aware of a leak at an unoccupied property, it will attempt to shut off water service
using the outside water shutoff valve at the earliest practical opportunity. If the outside water
shutoff valve is inoperable, and the leak threatens to cause significant damage to public or
private property, to the water system itself, or to public safety, the City's agents and employees
may gain immediate entry to any building on the property in order to shut off water service.
The determination that a leak poses a threat shall be made solely by the City's agents and
employees charged with stopping the leak. If such emergency access is necessary to shut off
service, the City shall post a notice of entry on any buildings entered on the property, and will
secure the entire property to a condition similar to what existed before the emergency access
occurred. A water shutoff charge shall be made in an amount set forth by City Council
resolution. For leaks that were unmetered due to a broken water meter or the leak occurring in a
pipe prior to passing through the meter a minimum 50,000 gallons of water shall be billed.
More water may be billed if it is likely the leak exceeded the minimum amount based on the
duration of the leak.
1601.081. REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT.
(1) The property owner shall comply with instructions from the city regarding the
repair or replacement of any sewer lines or water lines or other improvements and, in the event
the property owner fails to repair any sewer lines or water lines or improvements, the city may
undertake the work and assess the property for all costs associated therewith as outlined in the
nuisance ordinance.
(2) All repairs shall be performed to city specifications. An approved licensed
contractor must perform the repairs. If the repair extends into a city street, right-of-way or
easement, prior written notice of the city is required. All such areas shall be restored to city
standards by an approved contractor.
1601.082 LIABILITY FOR REPAIRS. After the initial connection has been made
to the curb stop, the applicant, owner, or the occupant or user of such premises shall be liable
for all repairs required to any water line necessary for connection of the premises from the curb
stop box to the building, including any repairs necessary to the curb stop box. The cost for
repairs made at the curb stop box on either side will be split 50/50 between the City and the
property owner. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant, owner, occupant or user to
maintain the stop box at such height as will ensure that it remains at the finished grade of the
land or property. Should the stop box be located in a driveway, a "Ford T cover" must be
installed prior to the application of the impermeable surface. In the event a water main becomes
frozen, the city will be responsible for thawing the same. The property owner shall have the sole
responsibility of thawing the frozen water service line from its connection to the street main into
the premises. All contractors engaged in thawing water lines must comply with the directions of
the city in their activities. No water customer shall be given a credit on a water bill for allowing
water to run to prevent freezing without specific prior authorization from the council annually.

removed shall be the property of the City, and any expense of the City shall be charged to the
property.
(2) When new buildings are erected on the site of old ones, and it is desired to
increase or change the old water service, no connections with the mains shall be made until all
the old service shall have been removed and the main plugged by the City, and any expense of
the City shall be charged to the property.
1601.100. SERVICE PIPES.
(1) Every service pipe must be laid sufficiently waving to allow not less than one
(1) foot of extra length and in such manner as to prevent rupture by settlement. The service
pipe must be placed no less than seven feet below the surface and in all cases so arranged as to
prevent rupture by freezing. Any pipe laid at a depth of less than seven feet shall be approved
by the City Inspector and insulated with a minimum of two inches of insulation per foot
shallower than seven feet. The insulation shall be four-feet wide unless alternate width is
approved by City Inspector. Service pipes must extend from the curb box to the inside of the
building; or, if not taken into a building, then to the hydrant or other fixtures which it is
intended to supply. Water service pipe materials shall be water tight, corrosion resistant, and be

fee multiplied by the number of SAC units as determined by the Metropolitan Council
Environmental Services. For residential properties, including all single-family, multi-family,
duplexes, four-plexes, etc. the flat fee per quarter will be multiplied by the number of residential
units within that property. In the case of properties assigned more than four (4) SAC units, but
not yet connected to city water, the number of water service charges is determined by the water
main linear footage abutting the property and dividing that number by 75 to generate a
residential equivalency unit. That residential equivalency unit shall then be multiplied by the
water service charges flat fee in effect at the time to determine the quarterly water service
charge. These charges and the penalty in (G) below shall at all times be subject to provisions of
pertinent contracts with the St. Paul Water Department.
(B) All accounts shall be kept by the street number and under the account number
assigned thereto, and by the name of the owner. All bills and notices shall be sent to the
owner’s address. If a non-residing owner desires bills and notices be sent to a different address,
they shall notify the Utility Billing Department. If the property owner has requested bills and
notices be sent to the property’s tenant, and should the tenant be delinquent in payment of
account balances, the property owner shall be ultimately responsible for payment of the water
and water service charges.
(C) In case the meter is found to have stopped, or to be operating in a faulty manner,
the amount of water used will be estimated in accordance with the amount used previously in
comparable periods of past years.
(D) Where service is for less than a quarterly period, the quarterly charges will be
pro-rated on a monthly basis.
(E) Where a separate connection is made to the Municipal water system for an
irrigation system, the water and water service charge rates due and payable by the user shall be
1601-10
equal to the rates charged in (A) above. Should the irrigation system be supplied from the
primary service connection, water service charges shall not apply. On automatic sprinkler
accounts, the water and water service charge as delineated in (A) above shall apply regardless of
the method of connection. Individual accounts shall be established for sprinkler and irrigation
systems and water meters must be installed on such services.
(F) Rates due and payable by each water user located beyond the territorial
boundaries of the City shall be determined by special contract.
(G) Statements for water and water service charges for the preceding quarterly period
shall be mailed to each customer on or around the 15th day of January, April, July, and October
of each year. Any account which remains unpaid thirty (30) or more days after the bill is
mailed is a delinquent account. A penalty as set forth by City Council resolution shall be added
to each delinquent account. Any pre-payment or overpayment of charges may be retained by
the City and applied on subsequent quarterly statements.
(H) Once annually, or as deemed necessary by the City Administrator, notice shall be
provided to account holders and owners with a delinquent balance notifying them of the
delinquency. If the delinquent accounts remain unpaid after the date specified on the notice, an
administrative charge as established by City Council resolution shall be assessed on these
delinquent accounts, and this fee along with the delinquent utility charges, including penalties,
shall be certified by the City Council to the Ramsey County Department of Property Taxes for
collection with taxes due against said premises.
(I) At the sole discretion of the City, water service provided to a property where a
delinquent account is present may be terminated. In such case, the City shall send a written
notice to the account holder giving them seven (7) days to pay the account in full. Water
service shall be terminated without further notice if the delinquent account is not paid in full
within the period of time specified in the notice. Additionally, a turn off/on fee as indicated in
1601.210.(3) shall be added to the amount due and full payment of the delinquent amount,
including penalties, and the turn off/on fees shall be required before water service is resumed.
Property owners requesting that their tenant’s water service be turned off due to a delinquent
account shall send a written request to the City. Upon receiving the written request, the City, at
their sole discretion, may terminate the water service following the same procedures as above.

off into two lines prior to entering the building. The small or domestic line will have a curb
stop and box shortly after the Y with easy access by City Personnel. When this is done, a meter
will be attached to the small or domestic line and a check valve as well as a 5/8-inch detection
meter shall be put on the large line.
(3) The City shall maintain and repair all meters when rendered unserviceable
through ordinary wear and tear and shall replace them, if necessary. However, where
replacement, repair or adjustment of any meter is rendered necessary by the act, neglect,
including damage from hot water backup, or carelessness of the owner or occupant of the
premises, any expense caused the City thereby shall be charged against and collected from the
water consumer.
(4) A consumer may, by written request, have his meter tested, by depositing the
amount established by City Council resolution with the Administrator. In case a test should
show an error of over five (5%) percent of the water consumed, the deposit will be refunded to
the consumer, a correctly registering meter will be installed, and the bill will be adjusted
accordingly if the meter erred in favor of the City. Such adjustment shall not extend back more
than one (1) billing period from the date of the written request.
(5) All water meters shall be and remain the property of the City.
(6) Authorized City employees shall have free access at reasonable hours of the day
to all parts of every building and premises connected with the water system for reading,

1801. LOW LANDS, WETLANDS AND MARSHES
1801.010. DECLARATION OF POLICY. The City Council of Little Canada has
determined that it is in the public interest to prevent irreparable harm to valuable natural resources
by encouraging a coordinated land and water management program of those areas within the City
which comprise low lands, wetlands, marshes and all lands adjacent to lakes and watercourses. The
specific intent of this Ordinance is as follows:
(a) To minimize health hazards by protecting surface and ground waters from pollution
by providing proper drainage.
(b) To encourage the type of land development which will have the least adverse effect
on the natural flow of flood water and at the same time protect life and property.
(c) To encourage land uses which lead to the preservation of marshes and natural
vegetation in those areas where such conditions are an important factor in the
maintenance of constant water flow.
(d) To utilize the ponding concept and other methods to minimize fast run off of surface
waters from developed areas and to minimize the introduction of pollutional
materials from those areas into the natural waterways, ditches and lakes.
(e) To prevent the obstructing of the free flow of water in the streams and ditches.
1801.020. DEFINITION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF WETLAND AREA. The wetland
conservation area within the City of Little Canada is defined and established to be the shorelines of
Gervais Lake, Savage Lake, Round Lake and Twin Lake and the low areas adjoining any
watercourse and drainage way, natural or man-made, subject to meandering, flowing or overflow,
including areas of marsh, wooded marsh, submerged marsh and inundation areas as shown on the
wetlands map, attached hereto and made a part hereof by reference.
1801.030. REGULATION OF DEVELOPMENT. Any person, firm or corporation desiring
to develop, improve or alter land or build any structure upon land located within the wetland
conservation area or change the shoreline of any lakes within the area shall first
submit a development plan to the City Council which shall contain provisions for water
management, sediment control, maintenance of landscape features and any other matters which
pertain to the quality of the environment. Said plan shall show all changes proposed in the natural
condition of the soils, destruction of or relocation of trees, grade changes and the anticipated affects,
if any, such changes may have upon the immediate surrounding area.
1801.040. CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT PROHIBITED. No development, including
excavation, filling, dredging, grading and construction shall be allowed within the wetland
conservation area if such is incompatible with the policies expressed in this Ordinance and the
preservation of said wetlands in their natural state. No changes in the shorelines of any of the lakes
1801-1
within the City of Little Canada shall be permitted in any way, including excavation or filling,
without issuance of a permit by the City for such change.
1801.050. LAND DEVELOPMENT AND PLATTING. No part of any land within the
wetlands conservation area shall be platted for residential or any other use in contravention of the

subdivided, an easement over the low lands shall be dedicated by the subdivider for the purpose of
improving and protecting the are for drainage or other purposes expressed in this Ordinance.
Streets, driveways, culverts and other similar structures shall not be built unless prior approval has
been obtained from the City Council and such structures shall be designed so as not to obstruct the
flow of water.
1801.060. LAND AREA CREDIT. When land to be developed is connected to a public
sanitary sewer line and includes land within the wetland conservation area, the owner or developer
thereof will be credited with an amount of his land within the protected area equal to but not
exceeding the amount of his adjacent land which otherwise qualifies for development under these
Ordinances for purposes of complying with the land use density, open space, building unit to land
area ratios or other similar requirements of the land development and zoning ordinances of the City,
except for requirements for recreational uses.
1801.070. SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS. The land area in the wetland conservation area
which will not be developed and which is dedicated as an easement shall be exempt from special
assessments, including but not limited to sanitary sewer, storm sewer and water line improvements.
1801.080. VARIANCES. Variances may be granted by the City Council in extraordinary
cases, but only when the proposed use is in the public interest. Variances shall not be granted when
the result would tend to:
1. Restrict the passage of storm and flood water in such a manner as to increase the
height or area of flooding;
2. Be detrimental to the surface and ground water supplies;
3. Be dangerous to life or property;
4. Be contrary to land use plans and planning objectives of the City;
5. Be inconsistent with the objectives of encouraging land uses compatible with the
preservation of natural land forms, vegetation and marshes and wetlands within the
City.
In no case shall a variance be allowed until the applicant has submitted a development plan
as required in Section 1801.030. The City Council may, before granting a variance, attach such
conditions as it deems necessary to insure compliance with the policy of intent of this Ordinance.
1801-2

the City, an artificial obstruction if found within the wetland conservation area, a notice shall be sent
to the land owner requesting removal of such obstruction. If the owner shall fail to remove such
obstruction within a reasonable time, or if the owner cannot be located, the City shall have the power
to cause removal of such obstruction and any cost to the City resulting therefrom shall be borne by
the land owner. A special assessment may be levied against such land in the same manner as
prescribed by law for the levy of special assessments for municipal improvements not withstanding
the provisions of Section 1801.070 herein.
1801.100. SEPARABILITY. Every section or part of this Ordinance is declared to be
separable from every other section or part and if any section or part shall be held invalid if shall not
effect any other section or part.
1801.110. PENALTIES. Any violation of this Ordinance shall be a misdemeanor and a
conviction therefor shall be punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both, as prescribed by law. The
imposition of a criminal penalty following conviction shall not in any way constitute a waiver by the
City of its right to remove obstructions or to seek any other civil remedy.

Code for all property within the City. The City does not impose a specific charge for fire code
inspections conducted by the City’s Fire Marshal or the Fire Marshall’s designee. However, the
incidence of multiple re-inspections has increased in recent years, and the cost of the reinspections
is detracting from the City’s ability to prevent and control fires through Fire Code
compliance.
2003.020. BASIC INSPECTION. After a property is notified of the need for a Fire Code
inspection, or requests a Fire Code inspection, the Fire Marshal will conduct an initial inspection
of the property, and one re-inspection if deficiencies are identified.

Ordinance be held to be invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not
affect the validity of the Ordinance as a whole, or of any part thereof, other than the part held to
be invalid.

2101.010. PURPOSE. This Ordinance is enacted to provide for orderly, economic and safe
development of land and urban services and facilities, and to protect and promote the public health,

Minnesota Statutes 1980, Section 462.352, for residential, commercial, industrial or other uses or as
a planned unit development which includes residential, commercial and industrial uses, or any
combination thereof, where the City Council deems it appropriate, a reasonable portion of each
proposed development shall be dedicated to the public for public use as parks, playgrounds, public
open space or storm water holding pond areas, or, at the option of the City, the person or firm
proposing the development shall donate to the City an amount in cash in lieu of land. The City
Council in determining the reasonable portion to be dedicated to the public may take into
consideration the open space, park, recreation or common areas and facilities which the developer
has provided for the exclusive use of the residents of the development. The portion of the total area
which becomes dedicated pursuant to these provisions shall be in addition to that land dedicated for
streets, alleys, easements and other public ways. No areas may be so dedicated for public use
without first having been approved by the City Council as suitable for the public purposes enunciated
in Section 2101.010 herein.
1. If the City Council, at its option, requires the developer to dedicate land, a maximum
of 10% of the total area to be subdivided shall be dedicated for public use as parks, playgrounds,
open space or storm water holding pond areas.
2. If the City Council, at its option, requires the developer to donate cash in lieu of
land, the following criteria shall be applied:

shall pay to the City a fee as set forth by City Council resolution.
(b) The developer of any land which is presently zoned for single family
dwellings and already has one or more single family dwellings situated
thereon, shall receive a credit or credits for the existing dwellings by
excluding that occupied portion of said land from the computation of
dwelling units per acre as provided herein.
(c) The developer of any land which is to be developed for commercial or
industrial use shall pay to the City an amount as established by City Council
resolution.
2101.030. LAND APPRAISAL. In those cases in which the City Council requires a cash
donation as provided herein, the value of the land shall be determined by a competent land appraiser
selected by the City. For the purposes of this Section, such a determination of the value of the
2101-2
undeveloped land shall be conclusive. Any costs incurred by the City in determining the fair market
value shall be paid by the developer. The City Council may use purchase agreements and current
market value appraisals to determine value.
2101.040. RESUBDIVISION CREDIT. In the development of any parcel of land which
previously has been subdivided and previously subjected to a cash donation pursuant to this Chapter,
the amount of such cash donation previously received shall be a credit against any new donation
required for resubdivision.
2101.050. PARK CHARGE FOR INDIVIDUAL DWELLINGS.
1. Recognizing that additional residential dwellings not part of a subdivision, also create
a need for public parks, the Council declares that this Chapter shall also apply to single family
dwellings and multiple dwellings to be constructed, providing that such dwellings are not located in
a subdivision which has already been subjected to the park charge pursuant to the provisions of this
Chapter.
2. Every applicant for a building permit for a single family dwelling through 8-unit
multi-family dwelling shall, at the time of submitting such application, pay a park charge to the City
per dwelling unit, which money shall be placed in a special fund as hereinafter provided. The park
charges are established and adopted by the City Council. Applicants for permits for remodeling or
for home additions shall be exempt from this provision.
3. Every applicant for a building permit for a multiple dwelling of nine units or more
shall, at the time of submitting such application, pay a park charge per dwelling unit, which money
shall be placed in a special fund as hereinafter provided. The park charges are established and
adopted by the City Council. Applicants for permits for remodeling or for home additions shall be
exempt from this provision.
4. Every conversion of apartment units to condominiums shall pay a park charge at the
time of the conversion, except that no charge shall be made if any park charges were previously paid
at the time of the original subdivision or development. All such charges shall be payable at the time
application for conversion is made. All conversions are subject to Council approval. Any rental
units converted to condominiums on or after November 28, 1979, shall be subject to the park charge
unless a park charge has already been paid. The park charges are established and adopted by the City
Council. It is intended that this subsection be in accord with Council Resolution 79-11-537.
2101.060. SPECIAL FUND. Cash donations received pursuant to the provisions of this
Chapter shall be held in a special fund and used only for the purposes of land acquisition, land
development and capital outlay for parks, playgrounds, public open space, storm water holding pond
areas and debt retirement in connection with land previously acquired for such public purposes.

2301. UNDERGROUND INSTALLATION OF NEW UTILITY LINES
2301.010. PURPOSE. This Ordinance is enacted to provide for orderly, economic and safe
development of land and urban services and facilities, and to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare of the inhabitants of the City of Little Canada.
2301.020. UNDERGROUND INSTALLATION OF NEW UTILITY LINES. All new
electric distribution lines (excluding main line feeders and high voltage transmission lines), CATV
lines, telephone service lines and other services constructed and providing service to customers shall
be buried underground. These regulations shall apply to all new land development proposals in the
City including, but not limited to, new subdivision, apartments, non-residential buildings, planned
unit developments, and single family dwellings.
The developer is responsible for complying with these regulations and shall submit with his
application for final plat or site plan approval, a written statement from the utility companies that the
necessary arrangements for the underground installation of utilities have been made and associated
easements incorporated into the plat.
It shall be the responsibility of the developer and all contractors involved in construction to
establish and maintain grade within utility easements to within six (6) inches of final grade and to
keep utility easements free and clear, to the end that the utility company shall have access at all
times for installation and maintenance of its utilities.
This Ordinance applies to public utility lines designed and constructed to distribute utility
services to customers in the City, but does not require underground installation of appurtenant
facilities such as lift stations, fire hydrants, meters, transformers, pedestals, and the like.
2301.030. EXCAVATION. In the interest of public safety and to avoid possible damage to
underground utilities, no person, firm or corporate body shall excavate in any easement or
right-of-way containing underground utilities without first notifying the utility company, or
companies, whose lines occupy the easement or right-of-way; provided however such excavation
shall not constitute a breach of this Ordinance unless the excavator has actual notice of the existence
of the utilities or unless the easement has been recorded with the Register of Deeds of Ramsey
County with reference to the property.
2301.040. EXCEPTIONS. The foregoing requirements may be waived by the City Council
upon recommendation by the Planning Commission and upon finding of the Council that either or
both of the following are applicable in case of the particular application:
1. The placing of utilities underground would not be compatible with the development
planned.
2. Unusual topography, soil or other physical conditions make underground installation
not feasible from an engineering viewpoint, or the cost thereof impractical.
2301-1
2301.050. EMERGENCY INSTALLATION. Temporary above-ground installation shall be
permitted when necessitated by emergency repairs to existing underground lines, and temporary
service to a construction project or customer where grade cannot be established within a reasonable
time or frozen ground conditions prevent economical placement of underground lines. Temporary
installations shall be replaced by permanent underground lines within one full construction season
following the temporary placement or such later date as may be deemed reasonable by the City
Council based upon its findings.
2301.060. VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES. Violation of this Ordinance shall be a
misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punishable by a fine of not to exceed Five
Hundred Dollars ($500) and/or imprisonment for a period of not to exceed ninety days (90) for each
offense. In the event of a violation or a threatened violation of this Ordinance, the City Council may

violations.

To provide for the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, and to ensure the integrity of its
streets and the appropriate use of the rights of way, the city strives to keep its rights of way in a
state of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances.
Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this new chapter of this code relating to right of way permits
and administration. This chapter imposes reasonable regulation on the placement and
maintenance of facilities and equipment currently within its rights of way or to be placed therein
at some future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal
agencies. Under this chapter, persons excavating and obstructing the rights of way will bear
financial responsibility for their work. Finally, this chapter provides for recovery of out-ofpocket
and projected costs from persons using the public rights of way.
This chapter shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 Session Laws, Chapter 123, substantially
codified in Minn. Stat. §§ 237.16, 237.162, 237.163, 237.79, 237.81, and 238.086 (the “Act”)
and 2017 Minn. Laws, ch. 94, art. 9, amending the Act, and the other laws governing applicable
rights of the city and users of the right of way. This chapter shall also be interpreted consistent
with Minn. R. 7819.0050–7819.9950 and Minn. R., ch. 7560 where possible. To the extent any
provision of this chapter cannot be interpreted consistently with the Minnesota Rules, that
interpretation most consistent with the Act and other applicable statutory and case law is
intended. This chapter shall not be interpreted to limit the regulatory and police powers of the
city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare
of the public.
Sec. 1.02. Election to Manage the Public Rights of Way
Pursuant to the authority granted to the city under state and federal statutory, administrative and
common law, the city hereby elects, pursuant to Minn. Stat. 237.163 subd. 2(b), to manage rights
of way within its jurisdiction.
Sec. 1.03. Definitions.
The following definitions apply in this chapter of this code. References hereafter to “sections”
are, unless otherwise specified, references to sections in this chapter. Defined terms remain
defined terms, whether or not capitalized.
Abandoned Facility. A facility no longer in service or physically disconnected from a portion of
the operating facility, or from any other facility, that is in use or still carries service. A facility is

Subd. 2. Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same obstruction or excavation,
which the city does not perform, may share in the payment of the obstruction or excavation
permit fee. In order to obtain a joint permit, registrants must agree among themselves as to the
portion each will pay and indicate the same on their applications.
Subd. 3. With city projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled obstruction or excavation
performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint application by two or more registrants or a
single application, are not required to pay the excavation or obstruction and degradation portions
of the permit fee, but a permit would still be required.
Sec. 1.16. Supplementary Applications.
Subd. 1. Limitation on Area. A right of way permit is valid only for the area of the right of way
specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work outside the area specified in the permit,
except as provided herein. Any permittee which determines that an area greater than that

end date, it must apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new
permit or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the previous permit.
This supplementary application must be submitted before the permit end date.
Sec. 1.17. Other Obligations.
Subd. 1. Compliance with Other Laws. Obtaining a right of way permit does not relieve
permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all
fees required by the city or other applicable rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply
with all requirements of local, state and federal laws, including but not limited to Minn. Stat. §§
216D.01-.09 (Gopher One Call Excavation Notice System) and Minn. R., ch. 7560. A permittee
shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and
regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right of way pursuant to its permit,
2302-15
regardless of who does the work.
Subd. 2. Prohibited Work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval of the city, no right of
way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are
unreasonable for such work.
Subd. 3. Interference with Right of Way. A permittee shall not so obstruct a right of way that
the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with. Private vehicles of those doing work in the right of way may not be parked
within or next to a permit area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The
loading or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area unless
specifically authorized by the permit.
Subd. 4. Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits, permittees employing
trenchless excavation methods, including but not limited to Horizontal Directional Drilling, shall

potholing or open cutting over existing underground utilities before excavating, as determined by
the director.
Sec. 1.18. Denial or Revocation of Permit.
Subd. 1. Reasons for Denial. The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements
and conditions of this chapter or if the city determines that the denial is necessary to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of the public or when necessary to protect the right of way and its
current use.
Subd. 2. Procedural Requirements. The denial or revocation of a permit must be made in
writing and must document the basis for the denial. The city must notify the applicant or rightof-
way user in writing within three business days of the decision to deny or revoke a permit. If
an application is denied, the right-of-way user may address the reasons for denial identified by
the city and resubmit its application. If the application is resubmitted within 30 days of receipt of
the notice of denial, no additional application fee shall be imposed. The city must approve or
deny the resubmitted application within 30 days after submission.
Sec. 1.19. Installation Requirements.
The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other work performed in the right
of way shall be done in conformance with Minn. R. 7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and other
applicable local requirements, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the Minn. Stat., §§
237.162 and 237.163. Installation of service laterals shall be performed in accordance with Minn.
R., ch 7560 and these ordinances. Service lateral installation is further subject to those
requirements and conditions set forth by the city in the applicable permits and/or agreements
referenced in Section 1.23 subd. 2 of this ordinance.

as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution of and upon
completion of the work.
Subd 3. Authority of Director.
(a) At the time of inspection, the director may order the immediate cessation of any work
which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety, or well-being of the public.
(b) The director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that does not conform to
the terms of the permit or other applicable standards, conditions, or codes. The order shall
state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within
ten (10) days after issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the director
that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the
required time, the director may revoke the permit pursuant to Sec. 1.23.
Sec. 1.21. Work Done Without a Permit.
Subd. 1. Emergency Situations. Each registrant shall immediately notify the director of any
event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant may proceed to
take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency. Excavators’ notification to
Gopher State One Call regarding an emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within
two (2) business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the
necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the requirements
necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the actions it took in response to
the emergency.
If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant’s facilities, the city will attempt
to contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the
emergency. In any event, the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the
emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.
Subd. 2. Non-Emergency Situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first
having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a right of way must subsequently
obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the
other fees required by the city code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any
damage to the right of way, and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
Sec. 1.22. Supplementary Notification.
2302-17
If the obstruction or excavation of the right of way begins later or ends sooner than the date
given on the permit, permittee shall notify the city of the accurate information as soon as this
information is known.
Sec. 1.23. Revocation of Permits.
Subd. 1. Substantial Breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any right
of way permit without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of
any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial
breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
(a) The violation of any material provision of the right of way permit.
(b) An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right of way permit, or the
perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens.
(c) Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a right of way permit.
(d) The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a permit extension is
obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to reasons beyond the permittee’s
control.
(e) The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition
indicated on an order issued pursuant to Sec. 1.20.
Subd. 2. Written Notice of Breach. If the city determines that the permittee has committed a
substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or any
condition of the permit, the city shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such
violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the
permit. A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to place
additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach.
Subd. 3. Response to Notice of Breach. Within twenty-four (24) hours of receiving notification
of the breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan, acceptable to the city, that will cure
the breach. Permittee’s failure to so contact the city, or permittee’s failure to timely submit an
acceptable plan, or permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause
for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permittee’s failure to so contact the city, or
permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee’s failure to reasonably implement
the approved plan, shall automatically place the permittee on probation for one (1) full year. Icon
Subd. 4. Cause for Probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list of conditions of
the permit, which if breached will automatically place the permittee on probation for one full
year, such as, but not limited to, working out of the allotted time period or working on right of
way grossly outside of the permit authorization.
Subd. 5. Automatic Revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a breach as outlined
above, permittee’s permit will automatically be revoked and permittee will not be allowed
further permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs.
2302-18
Subd. 6. Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse
the city for the city’s reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and
reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with such revocation.
Sec. 1.24. Mapping Data.
Subd. 1. Information Required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide mapping
information required by the city in accordance with Minn. R. 7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Within
ninety (90) days following completion of any work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall
provide the director accurate maps and drawings certifying the “as-built” location of all
equipment installed, owned, and maintained by the permittee. Such maps and drawings shall
include the horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and equipment and shall be provided
consistent with the city’s electronic mapping system, when practical or as a condition imposed
by the director. Failure to provide maps and drawings pursuant to this subsection shall be
grounds for revoking the permit holder’s registration.
Subd. 2. Service Laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of service laterals,
other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. R. 7560.0150, subp. 2, shall require the permittee’s
use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals and
the service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the director reasonably requires it.
Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the director evidence satisfactory to the director
of the installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this subdivision 2 and with applicable
Gopher State One Call law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after Dec.
31, 2005, shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for:
a) payments to contractors working on a public improvement project, including those
under Minn. Stat. ch. 429, and
b) city approval under development agreements or other subdivision or site plan approval
under Minn. Stat. ch. 462. The director shall reasonably determine the appropriate
method of providing such information to the city. Failure to provide prompt and accurate
information on the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit
issued for the work or future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors.
Sec. 1.25. Location and Relocation of Facilities.
Subd. 1. Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the Act, with other
applicable law, and with Minn. R. 7819.3100, 7819.5000, and 7819.5100, to the extent the rules
do not limit authority otherwise available to cities.

applicable right of way user and the City, Facilities in the right of way must be located or relocated and
maintained underground in accordance with Section 2301 of the City Code.

segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that is or, pursuant to current
technology, the city expects will someday be located within the right of way. All excavation,
2302-19
obstruction, or other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of
facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
Any registrant who has facilities in the right of way in a position at variance with the corridors
established by the city shall, no later than at the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of
the area where the facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the
right of way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause shown, upon
consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety,
customer service needs, and hardship to the registrant.
Subd. 3. Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any facilities found in a right of
way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any
remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or
taking possession of the facilities and restoring the right of way to a useable condition.
Subd. 4. Limitation of Space. To protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, or when
necessary to protect the right of way and its current use, the city shall have the power to prohibit
or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the right of way. In making such
decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential
users of the right of way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest,
the public’s needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right of way, the time of
year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right of way, and
future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined
to be in the public interest.
Sec. 1.26 Pre-Excavation Facilities Location.
In addition to complying with the requirements of Minn. Stat. 216D.01-.09 (“One Call
Excavation Notice System”) before the start date of any right of way excavation, each registrant
who has facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the horizontal and vertical
placement of all said facilities. Any registrant whose facilities are less than twenty (20) inches
below a concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work closely with the excavation contractor
to establish the exact location of its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
Sec. 1.27. Damage to Other Facilities.
When the city does work in the right of way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move
a registrant’s facilities to protect it, the city shall notify the local representative as early as is
reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be
paid within thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Each registrant shall be responsible for the
cost of repairing any facilities in the right of way which it or its facilities damage. Each registrant
shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant
caused during the city’s response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant’s facilities.
2302-20
Sec. 1.28. Right of Way Vacation.

the registrant’s rights in the vacated right of way are governed by Minn. R. 7819.3200.

By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a registrant or permittee
agrees to defend and indemnify the city in accordance with the provisions of Minn. Rule
7819.1250.
Sec. 1.30. Abandoned and Unusable Facilities.
Subd. 1. Discontinued Operations. A registrant who has determined to discontinue all or a
portion of its operations in the city must provide information satisfactory to the city that the
registrant’s obligations for its facilities in the right of way under this chapter have been lawfully
assumed by another registrant.
Subd. 2. Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right of way shall remove
it from that right of way if required in conjunction with other right of way repair, excavation, or
construction, unless this requirement is waived by the city.
Sec. 1.31. Appeal.
A right of way user that: (1) has been denied registration; (2) has been denied a permit; (3) has
had a permit revoked; (4) believes that the fees imposed are not in conformity with Minn. Stat. §
237.163, subd. 6; or (5) disputes a determination of the director regarding Section 1.24, subd.2 of
this ordinance may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or decision reviewed, upon
written request, by the City Council. The City Council shall act on a timely written request at its
next regularly scheduled meeting, provided the right of way user has submitted its appeal with
sufficient time to include the appeal as a regular agenda item. A decision by the City Council
affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and supported by written
findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
Sec. 1.32 Reservation of Regulatory and Police Powers
A permittee’s rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and
enforce general ordinances as necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.
Sec. 1.33. Severability.

jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and
such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. Nothing in this
chapter precludes the city from requiring a franchise agreement with the applicant, as allowed by
law, in addition to requirements set forth herein.

2701.010. DEFINITIONS. The following words and phrases used in this ordinance shall
have the meanings set forth below:
1. "Condominium" - Real estate, portions of which are designated for separate
ownership and the remainder of which is designated for common ownership solely by the owners of
the separate ownership portions. Real estate is not a condominium unless the undivided interests in
the common elements are vested in the units owners.
2. "Conversion Condominium" - A condominium containing a building which at any
time before the recording of the declaration creating a condominium contained residential rental
units.
3. "Declarant"
a. If the condominium has been created, any person who has executed a declaration
other than persons holding interests in the real estate solely as security for an
obligation, persons whose interests in real estate will not be conveyed to unit owners,
or, in the case of a leasehold condominium, a lessor who is not an affiliate of a
declarant; or
b. If the condominium has not yet been created, any person who offers to dispose of his
interest in a unit not previously disposed of.
4. "Affiliate of a Declarant" - Any person who controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with a declarant. A person "controls" a declarant if the person (i) is a general
partner, officer, director, or employee of the declarant, or (ii) directly or indirectly or acting in
concert with one or more other persons, or through one or more subsidiaries, owns, controls, holds
with power to vote, or holds proxies representing, more than twenty percent (20%) of the voting
interests of the declarant, or (iii) controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of
the declarant, or (iv) has contributed more than twenty percent (20%) of the capital of the declarant.
A person "is controlled by" a declarant if the declarant (i) is a general partner, officer, director, or
employee of the person or (ii) directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more other
persons, or through one or more subsidiaries, owns, controls, holds with power to vote, or holds

directors of the person, or (iv) has contributed more than twenty percent (20%) of the capital of the
person.
5. "Person" - A natural person, corporation, partnership, trust, or other entity, or any
combination thereof.
6. "Purchaser" - Any person, other than a declarant, who by means of a voluntary
2701-1
transfer acquires a legal or equitable interest in a unit, other than (i) a leasehold interest [including
renewal options] of less than three (3) years, or (ii) as security for an obligation.
7. "Security for an Obligation" - The vendor's interest in a contract for deed,
mortgagee's interest in a mortgage, purchaser's interest under a sheriff's certificate of sale, or the
holder's interest in a lien.
8. "Unit" - A portion of the condominium whether or not contained solely or partially
within a building designated for separate ownership.
2701.020. APPLICATION OF ORDINANCE FOR CONVERSION OF
CONDOMINIUMS. This Ordinance shall apply only to conversion condominiums for which the
declaration creating a condominium under Minnesota Statutes has been recorded on or after the
effective date of this Ordinance.
2701.030. NOTICE TO CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND PLANNING COMMISSION. On
the date of giving of the first notice of a conversion as provided in Section 2701.040 hereof, the
declarant shall send by U.S. Mail to the City Administrator and Planning Commission written notice
of conversion, which states the fact of conversion or the intent to convert.
2701.040. NOTICE TO OCCUPANTS. A declarant of a conversion condominium which
has been created or is intended to be created shall give the occupants of the building notice of
conversion which states the fact of conversion or the intent to convert at least one hundred twenty
(120) days, or in the case of a unit with an occupant on the date of delivery of this notice who is
sixty-two (62) years of age or older, under the age of eighteen (18), or who is legally handicapped as
defined under Minnesota Statutes, one hundred eighty (180) days, before the declarant will require
such parties to vacate. The notice shall be delivered once with respect to each unit and shall have
attached thereto a copy of this Chapter 2701 and a form of purchase agreement setting forth the
terms of sale contemplated by Section 2701.050 hereof. No occupant may be required by the
declarant to vacate during said one hundred twenty (120) or one hundred eighty (180) day period,
except by reason of non-payment of rent, waste, or unlawful conduct, or violation of any other term
or condition of his lease other than the expiration, and the terms of the tenancy may not be altered
during that period. Failure of a declarant to give notice as required by this Section constitutes a
defense to an action for possession. After notice of conversion has been given to any unit, the
declarant shall thereafter notify any new tenant who leases any unit in the building from the
declarant that the building is or is to become part of a condominium.
2701.050. PURCHASE RIGHTS.
1. For sixty (60) days after delivery of the notice of conversion described in Section
2701.040 hereof, the holder of the lessee's interest created by the declarant or his predecessor shall
have an option to purchase the leased unit on the terms set forth in the purchase agreement attached
to the notice. If such holder fails to exercise the option during that sixty (60) day period, the
declarant may not offer to dispose of an interest in that unit during the following one hundred eighty
2701-2
(180) days at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to such
holder. This subsection does not apply to any unit in a conversion condominium if that unit will be
restricted exclusively to non-residential use or if the boundaries of the converted unit do not
substantially conform to the dimensions of the residential unit before conversion.
2. If a declarant, in violation of this Section, conveys a unit to a purchaser for value who
has no knowledge of the violation, delivery of the deed conveying the unit extinguishes any right
which a lessee not in possession may have under this Section to purchase that unit, but does not
affect the right of such lessee to recover damages from the declarant for a violation of this Section.
3. Nothing in this Section permits termination of a lease by a declarant in violation of its
terms. The rights conferred by this Section are subject to any purchase agreement or other contract
existing prior to the effective date of this Ordinance.
2701.060. EXPRESS WARRANTIES.
1. Express warranties made by any declarant to a purchaser of a unit, if relied upon by
the purchaser, are created as follows:
a. Any affirmation of fact or promise which relates to the unit, its use, or rights
appurtenant thereto, area improvements to the condominium, creates an express
warranty that the unit and related rights and uses will conform to the affirmation or
promise;
b. Any model or description of the physical characteristics of the condominium,
including plans and specifications of or for improvements, creates an express
warranty that the condominium will conform to the model or description;
c. Any description of the quantity or extent of the real estate comprising the
condominium, including plats of surveys, creates an express warranty that the
condominium will conform to the description, subject to customary tolerance; and
d. A provision that a purchaser may put a unit to a specified use is an express warranty
that the specified use is lawful.
2. Neither formal words, such as "warranty" or "guarantee", nor a specific intention to
make a warranty, are necessary to create an express warranty, but a statement purporting to be
merely an opinion or commendation of the real estate or its value does not create a warranty.
3. Any conveyance of a unit transfers to the purchaser all express warranties made by
the declarant.
2701.070. IMPLIED WARRANTIES.
1. A declarant warrants that a unit will be in at least as good condition at the earlier of
2701-3
the time of the conveyance or delivery of possession as it was at the time of contracting, reasonable
wear and tear excepted.
2. A declarant impliedly warrants that a unit and the common elements in the
condominium are suitable for the ordinary uses of real estate of its type and that any improvements
made or contracted for by him or made by any person in contemplation of the creation of the
condominium, will be:
a. Free from defective materials; and
b. Constructed in accordance with applicable law, according to sound engineering and
construction standards, and in a workmanlike manner.
3. In addition, a declarant warrants to a purchaser of a unit which may be used for
residential use that an existing use, continuation of which is contemplated by the parties, does not
violate applicable law at the earlier of the time of conveyance or delivery of possession.
4. Warranties imposed by this Section may be excluded or modified as specified in
Section 2701.080.
5. For purposes of this Section, improvements made or contracted for by an affiliate of a
declarant are made or contracted for by the declarant.
6. Any conveyance of a unit transfers to the purchaser all of any declarant's implied
warranties of quality.
2701.080. EXCLUSION OF MODIFICATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES.
1. Except as limited by Subsection 2, implied warranties:
a. May be excluded or modified by agreement of the parties; and
b. Are excluded by expression of disclaimer, such as "as is", "with all faults", or other
language which is common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the exclusion
of warranties.
2. With respect to a purchaser of a unit which may be occupied for residential use, no
general disclaimer of implied warranties is effective, but a declarant may disclaim liability in an
instrument signed by the purchaser for a specified defect or specified failure to comply with
applicable law, if the defect or failure entered into and became a part of the basis of the bargain.
2701.090. STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS FOR WARRANTIES.
1. A judicial proceeding for breach of any obligation arising under Sections 2701.060
2701-4
and 2701.070 must be commenced within six (6) years after the cause of action arises.
2. Subject to Subsection 3 hereof, a cause of action under Section 2701.060 and
2701.070, regardless of the purchaser's lack of knowledge of the breach, arises:
a. As to a unit, when the purchaser to whom the warranty is first made enters into
possession if a possessory interest was conveyed or at the time of acceptance of the
instrument of conveyance if a nonpossessory interest was conveyed; and
b. As to each common element, the later of (i) the time of the common element is
completed, and (ii) the time the first unit in the condominium is conveyed to a bona
fide purchaser.
3. If a warranty under Section 2701.060 and 2701.070 explicitly extends to future
performance or duration of any improvements or component of the condominium, the cause of
action arises at the time the breach is discovered or at the end of the period for which the warranty
explicitly extends, whichever is earlier.
2701.100. RIGHT TO RESCIND. A lessee may rescind a purchase agreement of a unit
offered for sale hereunder by delivering to the declarant at the address stated in the purchase
agreement by registered or certified United States Mail, postage prepaid, a written notice of
rescission within five (5) days of execution of such an agreement by the lessee. Upon receipt of
such a notice of rescission the declarant shall promptly refund any earnest money received without
deduction therefrom or interest thereon whereupon the purchase agreement shall become null and
void. The rights under this Section are in addition to the rights afforded purchasers under Minnesota
Condominium Act, Section 515.215 Subdivision 6.
2701.110. DELIVERY OF NOTICE. Unless otherwise provided herein, all notices required
by this Ordinance shall be in writing and shall be either personally delivered or delivered by United
States Mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to the named tenant or "occupant" at the address of the
unit. Delivery shall be complete upon mailing.
2701.120. PERMIT REQUIRED. No declarant shall undertake to develop a condominium
conversion of a rental dwelling or building unless he shall have first obtained a permit from the City
Council. The payment of fees set forth in Section 2701.140 shall be prerequisite to issuance of such
permit.
2701.130. MANNER OF APPLYING FOR PERMIT. Application for the required permit
shall be made and filed on a form furnished by the City Administrator for such purpose and shall set
forth the following information:

2. Name and residence address of any operator or agent actively managing the rental
2701-5
dwelling or building proposed to be converted to condominium status;

months;
(d) Number of persons residing in each such unit, approximate age and length of

this Chapter, shall require the payment by the applicant of a fee in the amount of Ten Dollars
($10.00) for each unit in the rental dwelling or building proposed to be converted to a condominium
status.
2701.150. GROUNDS FOR DENIAL. The City Council may deny an application if it is
found that the proposed conversion to condominium status would tend to have an adverse city-wide
effect on displacement of law and moderate income individuals or families.
2701.160. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of Sections 2701.010 to 2701.150 or the
application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other

3100. CLANDESTINE DRUG LAB SITES
3100.010. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this chapter is to reduce public
exposure to health risks associated with hazardous chemicals or residue from a
clandestine drug lab site. Professional testing and investigations show that chemicals
used in the production of illicit drugs can condense, penetrate, and contaminate surfaces,
furnishings, and equipment of surrounding structures. The City Council finds that such
sites and the personal property within such sites may contain suspected chemicals and
residues that place people, particularly children or adults of child bearing age, at risk
when exposed through inhabiting or visiting the site or being exposed to contaminated
personal property.
3100.020. Interpretation and Application. The provisions of this chapter must be
construed to protect the public health, safety and welfare. When the conditions imposed
by this chapter conflict with comparable provisions imposed by another law, ordinance,
statute, or regulation, the regulations that are more restrictive or that impose higher
standards will prevail.
3100.030. Definitions. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the words
and phrases below are defined for the purpose of this chapter as follows:
(1) “Chemical dump site” means a place or area where chemicals or other waste
materials used in a clandestine drug lab operation have been located.
(2) “City” means the City of Little Canada.
(3) “Clandestine drug lab operation” means the unlawful manufacture or attempt
to manufacture a controlled substance.
(4) “Clandestine drug lab site” or “site” means a place or area where law
enforcement personnel have determined that conditions associated with an unlawful
clandestine drug lab operation exits. A clandestine drug lab site may include dwellings,
accessory buildings, structures or units, a chemical dump site, a vehicle, boat, trailer, or
other appliance.
(5) “Controlled substance” means a drug substance or immediate precursor
specified in Minn. Stat. § 152.02, Schedules I through V, and as the same may be
amended. The term does not include distilled spirits, wine, malt beverages, intoxicating
liquors or tobacco.
(6) “Manufacture,” in places other than a pharmacy, includes the production,
cultivation, quality control, or standardization, by mechanical, physical, chemical or
pharmaceutical means, and the packing, re-packing, tableting, encapsulating, labeling, relabeling,
or filling of drugs, by any other process.
310 0-1
(7) “Owner” means a person, firm, corporation or other entity who or which
owns, in whole or in part, the land, building, structure, vehicle, boat, trailer or other
location associated with clandestine drug lab site. Unless information is provided to
prove otherwise, the owner of real property is deemed to be the property taxpayer of
record in the Ramsey County files, and the owner of a vehicle, boat or trailer is deemed
to be the person listed as the owner on the most recent title to the vehicle, boat or trailer.
3100.040. Declaration of Public Health Nuisance. All dwellings, accessory
structures, buildings, vehicles, boats, trailers, personal property, adjacent property or
other locations, associated with a clandestine drug lab site are potentially unsafe due to
health hazards and are declared to be a public health nuisance.
3100.050. Law Enforcement Action.
(1) Law enforcement authorities who identify conditions associated with a
clandestine drug lab site that may place the public or occupants at risk for exposure to
harmful contaminants and other associated conditions may:
(a) promptly notify the appropriate municipal, child protection, and public
health authority, the United States drug enforcement administration, and the site owner
about the site and the conditions found;
(b) treat, store, transport or dispose of all waste generated from the
clandestine drug lab operation and found at the site in a manner consistent with the
Minnesota Department of Health and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency Regulations;
(c) issue a temporary declaration of public health nuisance for the affected
site and post a copy of the declaration on all doorway entrances to the site or, in the case
of bare land, in several conspicuous places on the property. This temporary declaration
will expire after the city inspects the site and determines the appropriateness of issuing a
permanent declaration of public heath nuisance;
(d) notify all people occupying the site that a temporary declaration of
public health nuisance has been issued;
(e) require all people occupying the site to immediately vacate the site,
remove all pets from the site, and not return without written authorization from the city;
(f) notify the occupants vacating the site that the personal property at the
site may be contaminated with dangerous chemical residue; and
(g) put locks on each doorway entrance to the site to prohibit people from
entering the site without authorization.
(2) The notification of the people and organizations mentioned above may be
delayed to accomplish appropriate law enforcement objectives.
310 0-2
3100.060. Seizure of Property. When a clandestine drug lab site is inside a
vehicle, boat, trailer or other form of moveable personal property, law enforcement
authorities must immediately seize it and not allow it to be transported except to a more
secure location. All other requirements of this chapter must be followed as closely as
possible given the specific type of property in which the site is discovered.
3100.070. Inspection and Declaration of Nuisance.
(1) Within 48 hours of notification that law enforcement authorities have
determined the existence of a clandestine drug lab site, the city must inspect the site. The
City may then promptly issue a permanent declaration of public health nuisance and a Do
Not Enter-Unsafe to Occupy Order for the affected site to replace the temporary
declaration. A copy of the permanent declaration and order must be posted on all
doorway entrances to the site or, in the case of bare land, in several conspicuous places
on the property.
(2) Abatement order. After issuing the permanent declaration, the city must send
written notice to the site owner ordering abatement of the public health nuisance. The
abatement order must include the following:
(a) a copy of the declaration of public health nuisance and Do Note Enter-
Unsafe to Occupy Order;
(b) information about the potentially hazardous condition of the site;
(c) a summary of the site owner’s and occupant’s responsibilities under
this chapter; and
(d) information that may help the owner locate appropriate services
necessary to abate the public health nuisance.
(3) Notice to other parties. The city must also mail a copy of the permanent
declaration of public health nuisance and a copy of this section to the following parties at
their last know addresses:
(a) occupants or residents of the site if known;
(b) neighbors in proximity to the site who may be affected by the
conditions found;
(c) the appropriate enforcement division of the United States drug
enforcement administration; and

Department, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, the Minnesota Department of
310 0-3
Health, and the Department of Natural Resources, that are known to have public and
environmental protection responsibilities applicable to the situation.
(4) Modification or removal of declaration. The city may modify or remove the
declaration of public health nuisance after the city receives documentation from a cityapproved
environmental hazard testing and cleaning firm stating that the suspected health
and safety risks, including those to neighbors and potential occupants, either do not exist
or have been sufficiently abated or corrected to justify amendment or removal of the
declaration.
3100.080. Site Owner’s Responsibility to Act.
(1) Within 10 business days after the abatement order is mailed to the site owner,
the owner must accomplish the following;
(a) provide the city, in writing, with:
1) confirmation that all persons and their pets have vacated the
site;
2) the names of all children who the owner believes were residing
at the site during the time period the clandestine drug lab is suspected to have been at the
site; and
3) confirmation that the site will remain vacated and secured until
the public health nuisance is completely abated, as required by this chapter.
(b) contract with one or more city-approved environmental hazard testing
and cleaning firms to conduct the following work in accordance with the most current
state guidelines:
1) a detailed on-site assessment of contamination at the site,
including the personal property in the site;
2) soil testing of the site and testing of all property and soil in
proximity to the site which the environmental hazard testing and cleaning firm
determines may have been affected by the conditions found at the site;
3) a complete clean-up of the site (including the clean-up or
removal of plumbing, ventilation systems, fixtures and contaminated soil) or a demolition
of the structures on the site and complete clean-up of the demolished site;
4) a complete clean-up, or disposal at an approved dump site, of
all personal property in the site that is found to have been affected by the conditions at
the site;
310 0-4
5) a complete clean-up of all property and soil in proximity to the
site that is found to have been affected by the conditions at the site; and
6) remediation testing and follow-up testing, including testing of
the ventilation system and plumbing, to determine that all health risks are sufficiently
reduced to allow safe human occupancy and use of the site, use of the personal property
in it, and use of all property and soil in proximity to the site.
(c) provide the city with the identity of the testing and cleaning firm with
which the owner has contracted for abatement of the public health nuisance as required
above; and
(d) sign an agreement with the city establishing a clean-up schedule. The
schedule must establish reasonable deadlines for completing all actions required by this
chapter for abatement of the public health nuisance. The city will consider practical
limitations and the availability of contractors in approving the clean-up schedule.
(2) The owner must meet all deadlines established in the clean-up schedule. The
owner must provide the city with written documentation of the clean-up, including a
signed statement from a city-approved environmental hazard testing and cleaning firm
that the site, all personal property in it, and all property and soil in proximity to the site is
safe for human occupancy and use and that the clean-up was conducted in accordance
with the most current state guidelines.
3100.090. Site Owner’s Responsibility for Costs. The site owner is responsible
for all costs of dealing with and abating the public health nuisance, including contractor’s
fees and the city’s costs for services performed in connection with the clandestine drug
lab site clean up. The city’s costs may include:
(1) posting of the site;
(2) notification of affected parties;
(3) securing the site, providing limited access to the site, and prosecution of
unauthorized persons found at the site;
(4) expenses related to the recovery of costs, including the special assessment
process;
(5) laboratory fees;
(6) clean-up services;
(7) administrative fees;
(8) legal fees; and
310 0-5
(9) other associated costs.
3100.100. City Action and Recovery of Costs.
(1) If the site owner fails to comply with any of the requirements of this section,
the city is authorized to take all reasonable actions necessary to abate the public health
nuisance, including contracting with a city-approved environmental hazard testing and
cleaning firm to complete the necessary clean-up. The city is also authorized to provide a
copy of the declaration of public health nuisance to the holders of mortgage or lien
interests in the affected site.
(2) If the costs to clean the site or to clean the personal property at the site are
prohibitively high in relation to the value of the site or the personal property, the city is
authorized to remove or demolish the site, structure or building and dispose of the
personal property in it. These actions must be taken in accordance with the provisions of
Minn. Stat. §§ 463.15 through 463.261.
(3) If the city abates the public health nuisance, the city is entitled to recover all
of its actual costs, plus an additional 25% of such costs for administrative expense, in
addition to any other legal remedy. The city may recover costs by civil action against the
site owner or by assessing the costs against the site as a lien against the property and
certifying the same to Ramsey County for collection in the same manner as ad valorem
taxes and special assessments are collected.
3100.110. Recovery of Costs from Persons Causing Damage. Nothing in this
ordinance limits the right of the site owner or the City to recover clean-up costs from the
tenant or operators of the clandestine drug lab.
3100.120. Entry Into or Onto the Site. While a declaration of public health
nuisance for a site is in effect and has been posted at the site, no person, other than a law
enforcement officer or a person authorized by the city, is permitted to be inside or on a
site.
3100.130. Removal of Personal Property from the Site. While a declaration of
public health nuisance for a site is in effect and has been posted at the site, no personal
property may be removed from the site without prior written consent from the city.
Consent to remove personal property may be granted at the reasonable discretion of the
city, and only in cases of hardship after:
(1) a city-approved environmental hazard testing and cleaning firm has advised
the city, in writing, that the item(s) of personal property can be sufficiently cleaned to
remove all harmful contamination; and
(2) the owner of the personal property agrees in writing that the owner:
310 0-6
(a) is aware of the danger of using the contaminated property;
(b) will thoroughly clean the property to remove all contamination before
the property is used; and
(c) releases and agrees to indemnify the city from all liability to the owner
and third parties for injuries or damages alleged to have been caused by the contaminated
property.

3200. RENTAL HOUSING LICENSING
3200.010. PURPOSE AND INTENT: The City Council has concluded that the
regulation of the rental practices of single family and multi-tenant residential dwelling units
through licensing will thereby promote the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City,

The purpose of the Property Licensing Code is to establish minimum standards, and procedures
for their enforcement consistent with the right to personal privacy, for the protection of life, limb,
health, property, safety, and welfare of the general public and the owners and occupants of all

to intrude upon the fair accepted contractual relationship between tenant and landlord. The City
does not intend to intervene as an advocate of either party, or to act as an arbiter. It is determined
that certain conditions within existing buildings, lawful at the time of construction of the
building, and not creating a hazardous condition, may not comply with the minimum
requirements of this Code. Such conditions are referred to as "built-in deficiencies," and the
Code official, in administering this Code, may consider built-in deficiencies as being beyond
reasonable correction and accept them as an alternate method of meeting the intent of the Code.

statement the Licensee has a screening process the Licensee used during the
approval process of each tenant and occupant prior to occupancy to ensure quality
tenants are occupying the Rental Dwelling. While it is the intent of this provision
to aggressively utilize screening criteria to ensure rental units are not occupied by
people with inappropriate criminal or behavioral backgrounds, each property
owner shall be responsible for determining how information obtained through this
screening process shall be utilized in accordance with State and Federal laws. For
Licensees with four or more rental units in the complex to be licensed, tenant
screening shall, at a minimum, include the following:
1. A statewide (Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension) criminal
history check of all prospective tenants covering at least three years; the
check must be done utilizing the most recent update of the state criminal
history files;
2. A statewide criminal history check from the prospective tenant’s previous
state of residence, if available, if the tenant is moving directly from the
previous state;
3. A criminal history check of any prospective tenant in their previous states
of residence, if available, covering the last three years if they have not
resided in Minnesota for three years or longer;
3200-6
4. A criminal history check of any prospective tenant must be conducted in
all seven counties in the Twin City Metropolitan Area (Anoka, Carver,
Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington) covering at least the
last three years, subject to juvenile record restrictions, including all
misdemeanor, gross misdemeanor, and felony convictions. A criminal
history check shall also be made with the county law enforcement agency
containing the jurisdiction where the prospective tenant last resided, if
residency was not within the seven-county Twin City Metropolitan Area.
L. Notification Requirements for Public Hearings. The Owner must, as a continuing
obligation of the license, provide written notice to tenants or in the alternative,
post the written notice in the lobby or common area of the Rental Dwelling for
any public hearing received by the Owner that pertains to the property on which
the Rental Dwelling is located or any adjacent rights of way.
M. Display of License Certificate. The license certificate must be exhibited in a
conspicuous place at or near the entrance to the Rental Dwelling. One license
certificate must be displayed for each building. For buildings containing 1-3
Dwelling Units, the certificate must be visible from the street. For buildings
containing more than three (3) Dwelling Units, the certificate must be displayed
in the rental office or other common area accessible to all tenants of the licensed
building.
N. Compliance with Minn. Stat. §211B.20. Owners must comply with the
requirements of Minn. Stat. §211B.20 and allow access to candidates who have
filed for election to public office and seek admittance to the Rental Dwelling

A. Fees Doubled. A person or entity found by the City Administrator to be leasing a
unit upon rental property without a license from the City must obtain a license
before allowing continued occupancy of the rental unit or letting new leases of the
rental unit. The application fees for any application made in this circumstance
shall be twice those published by the City Council for license applications made
under this Chapter.
B. Misdemeanor. Any person, partnership, business entity or corporation leasing a
unit upon real property without first obtaining a license from the City as required
by Section 3200.040(A) shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Each day on which an
unlicensed rental unit is occupied in violation of this Chapter shall be a separate
violation. Upon conviction, the offending party may be fined and confined up to
3200-7
the maximum amount permitted by Minnesota Statutes for each misdemeanor
offense.
C. Injunction. If the City Administrator believes that an unlicensed unit upon real
property continues to be occupied following written notice to the person or entity
owning the real property, the Administrator may direct that the City Attorney
proceed with an action to have the unlawful occupancy enjoined in Ramsey
County District Court. A misdemeanor summons for violation of this Chapter
served upon the owner of the property is sufficient written notice for purposes of
this section.
D. Remedies Non-exclusive. The City may take one or more of the enforcement
actions described above in response to any one violation. Use of one remedy does
not preclude the City from seeking enforcement of this Ordinance through any
legal means authorized by the city code, state or Federal law.

State-licensed residential care facilities, assisted living facilities or nursing homes.

Units, and the lot on which the dwelling unit is located. It is ultimately the
responsibility of the Licensee to assure that every Rental Dwelling and Rental
Dwelling Unit is maintained in compliance with all City Ordinances and state
laws. The owner of rental housing must maintain all units, common space and
exteriors of such buildings in compliance with the City Code and state and federal
laws and regulations. The owner of such rental housing shall perform a periodic
assessment of all portions of the building and correct any inadequacies to ensure the
building is maintained in good repair. A violation of any of the following laws and

Rental Dwelling Unit shall give the Owner, the Owner’s agent or authorized City
official access to any part of such Rental Dwelling or Rental Dwelling Unit at
reasonable times for the purpose of inspection, maintenance, repairs or alterations
as are necessary to comply with the provisions of this Ordinance. If any Owner,
Owner’s agent or Occupant of a Rental Dwelling or Rental Dwelling Unit fails or

inspection pursuant to this Ordinance, the inspector may seek an administrative
search warrant authorizing such inspection.
3200.080. CODE OF CONDUCT

occupants do not conduct themselves accordingly, the Licensee shall take
appropriate, lawful actions in an attempt to achieve proper conduct up to and

date passed and approved by the City, the right to transmit and furnish electric energy for light, heat,
power and other purposes for public and private use within and through the limits of the City as its
boundaries now exist or as they may be extended in the future. For these purposes, Company may
construct, operate, repair and maintain Electric Facilities in, on, over, under and across the Public
Ways and Public Grounds of City, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance. Company may do all
reasonable things necessary or customary to accomplish these purposes, subject, however, to such
reasonable regulations as may be imposed by the City pursuant to ordinance and to the further
provisions of this franchise agreement.
2.2 Effective Date; Written Acceptance. This franchise agreement shall be in force
and effect from and after passage of this Ordinance and publication as required by law and its
acceptance by Company. If Company does not file a written acceptance with the City within 60
days after the date the City Council adopts this Ordinance, or otherwise places the City on notice,
before that time, that the Company does not accept all terms of this franchise, the City by Council
resolution may revoke this Ordinance or seek its enforcement in a court of competent jurisdiction.
2.3 Service and Rates. The service to be provided and the rates to be charged by

Minnesota Statutes, Section 216B.40.
2.4 Publication Expense. The expense of publication of this Ordinance will be paid by
City and reimbursed to City by Company.

breach of contract, or either party may take any other action permitted by law.
2.6 Continuation of Franchise. If the City and Company are unable to agree on the
terms of a new franchise by the time this franchise expires, this franchise will remain in effect

Appendix A-3
franchise continue for more than one year after expiration of the 20-year term set forth in Section
2.1.
SECTIO 3. LOCATIO, OTHER REGULATIOS.
3.1 Location of Facilities. Electric Facilities shall be located, constructed and
maintained so as not to interfere with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel along and over
Public Ways and so as not to disrupt or interfere with normal operation of any City Utility System
previously installed therein. Electric Facilities may be located on Public Grounds as determined by
the City. Company's construction, reconstruction, operation, repair, maintenance and location of
Electric Facilities shall be subject to permits if required by separate ordinance and to other
reasonable regulations of the City to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this franchise
agreement. Company may abandon underground Electric Facilities in place, provided at the City’s
request, Company will remove abandoned metal conduit, concrete encased conduit, or similar
Electric Facilities interfering with a City improvement project, but only to the extent such conduit is
uncovered by excavation as part of the City improvement project.
3.2 Field Locations. Company shall provide field locations for its underground
Electric Facilities within City consistent with the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, Chapter
216D.
3.3 Street Openings. Company shall not open or disturb any Public Way or Public
Ground for any purpose without first having obtained a permit from the City, if required by a
separate ordinance, for which the City may impose a reasonable fee. Permit conditions imposed on
Company shall not be more burdensome than those imposed on other utilities for similar facilities
or work. Company may, however, open and disturb any Public Way or Public Ground without a
permit if (i) an emergency exists requiring the immediate repair of Electric Facilities and (ii)
Company gives telephone, e-mail or similar notice to the City if reasonably possible,
commencement of the emergency repair. Not later than the second working day thereafter,
Company shall obtain any required permits and pay any required fees.
3.4 Restoration. After undertaking any work requiring the opening of any Public Way
or Public Ground, Company shall restore the same, including paving and its foundation, to as good
a condition as formerly existed, and shall maintain any paved surface in good condition for two
years thereafter. The work shall be completed as promptly as weather permits, and if Company
shall not promptly perform and complete the work, remove all dirt, rubbish, equipment and
material, and put the Public Way or Public Ground in the said condition, the City shall have, after
demand to Company to cure and the passage of a reasonable period of time following the demand,
but not to exceed five days, the right to make the restoration at the expense of Company. Company
shall pay to the City the cost of such work done for or performed by the City. This remedy shall be
in addition to any other remedy available to the City for noncompliance with this Section 3.4, but
the City hereby waives any requirement for Company to post a construction performance bond,
certificate of insurance, letter of credit or any other form of security or assurance that may be
required, under a separate existing or future ordinance of the City, of a person or entity obtaining
the City’s permission to install, replace or maintain facilities in a Public Way.
Appendix A-4
3.5 Avoid Damage to Electric Facilities. Nothing in this Ordinance relieves any
person from liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid damaging
Electric Facilities while performing any activity.
3.6 otice of Improvements. The City must give Company reasonable notice of plans
for improvements to Public Ways or Public Ground where the City has reason to believe that
Electric Facilities may affect or be affected by the improvement. The notice must contain: (i) the
nature and character of the improvements, (ii) the Public Ways and Public Grounds upon which the
improvements are to be made, (iii) the extent of the improvements, (iv) the time when the City will
start the work, and (v) if more than one Public Way or Public Ground is involved, the order in
which the work is to proceed. The notice must be given to Company a sufficient length of time in
advance of the actual commencement of the work to permit Company to make any necessary
additions, alterations or repairs to its Electric Facilities.
3.7 Shared Use of Poles. Company shall make space available on its poles or towers
for City fire, water utility, police or other City facilities whenever such use will not interfere with
the use of such poles or towers by Company, by another electric utility, by a telephone utility, or by
any cable television company or other form of communication company. In addition, the City shall
pay for any added cost incurred by Company because of such use by City.
3.8 Mapping Information. The Company must promptly provide mapping
information for any of its underground Electric Facilities in accordance with Minnesota Rules
parts7819.4000 and 7819.4100.
SECTIO 4. RELOCATIOS.
4.1 Relocation of Electric Facilities in Public Ways. If the City determines to vacate
a Public Way for a City improvement project, or at City’s cost to grade, regrade, or change the line
of any Public Way, or construct or reconstruct any City Utility System in any Public Way, it may
order Company to relocate its Electric Facilities located therein if relocation is reasonably necessary
to accomplish the City’s proposed public improvement. Except as provided in Section 4.3,
Company shall relocate its Electric Facilities at its own expense. The City shall give Company
reasonable notice of plans to vacate for a City improvement project, or to grade, regrade, or change
the line of any Public Way or to construct or reconstruct any City Utility System. If a relocation is
ordered within five years of a prior relocation of the same Electric Facilities, which was made at
Company expense, the City shall reimburse Company for non-betterment costs on a time and
material basis, provided that if a subsequent relocation is required because of the extension of a
City Utility System to a previously unserved area, or to avoid interference with a joint project of the
City with another governmental unit, Company may be required to make the subsequent relocation
at its expense. Nothing in this Ordinance requires Company to relocate, remove, replace or
reconstruct at its own expense its Electric Facilities where such relocation, removal, replacement or
reconstruction is solely for the convenience of the City and is not reasonably necessary for the
construction or reconstruction of a Public Way or City Utility System or other City improvement.
4.2 Relocation of Electric Facilities in Public Ground. City may require Company at
Company’s expense to relocate or remove its Electric Facilities from Public Ground upon a finding
Appendix A-5
by City that the Electric Facilities have become or will become a substantial impairment to the
existing or proposed public use of the Public Ground. Such relocation shall comply with applicable
City ordinances consistent with law.
4.3 Projects with Federal Funding. Relocation, removal, or rearrangement of any
Company Electric Facilities made necessary because of the extension into or through City of a
federally-aided highway project shall be governed by the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, Section
161.46, as supplemented or amended. It is understood that the right herein granted to Company is a
valuable right. City shall not order Company to remove or relocate its Electric Facilities when a
Public Way is vacated, improved or realigned because of a renewal or a redevelopment plan which
is financially subsidized in whole or in part by the Federal Government or any agency thereof,
unless the reasonable non-betterment costs of such relocation and the loss and expense resulting
therefrom are paid to Company, when available to the City, but the City has no obligation to pay
those portions of such for which reimbursement to it is not available.
4.4 o Waiver. The provisions of Section 4 apply only to Electric Facilities
constructed in reliance on a franchise from the City and Company does not waive its rights under
an easement or prescriptive right or state or county permit.
SECTIO 5. TREE TRIMMIG.
Company may trim all trees and shrubs in the Public Ways and Public Grounds of City to
the extent Company finds necessary to avoid interference with the proper construction, operation,
repair and maintenance of any Electric Facilities installed hereunder, provided that Company shall
save the City harmless from any liability arising therefrom, and subject to permit or other
reasonable regulation by the City.
SECTIO 6. IDEMIFICATIO.
6.1 Indemnity of City. Company shall indemnify, keep and hold the City free and
harmless from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to property
occasioned by the construction, maintenance, repair, inspection, the issuance of permits, or the
operation of the Electric Facilities located in the Public Ways and Public Grounds. The City shall
not be indemnified for losses or claims occasioned through its own negligence except for losses or
claims arising out of or alleging the City's negligence as to the issuance of permits for, or inspection
of, Company's plans or work.
6.2 Defense of City. In the event a suit is brought against the City under circumstances
where this agreement to indemnify applies, Company at its sole cost and expense shall defend the
City in such suit if written notice thereof is promptly given to Company within a period wherein
Company is not prejudiced by lack of such notice. If Company is required to indemnify and
defend, it will thereafter have control of such litigation, but Company may not settle such litigation
without the consent of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This section is
not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the City; and
Company, in defending any action on behalf of the City shall be entitled to assert in any action
every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf. This franchise agreement
Appendix A-6
shall not be interpreted to constitute a waiver by the City of any of its defenses or immunity or
limitations on liability under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 466.
SECTIO 7. VACATIO OF PUBLIC WAYS.
The City shall give Company at least two weeks prior written notice of a proposed vacation
of a Public Way. Except where required solely for a City improvement project, the vacation of any
Public Way, after the installation of Electric Facilities, shall not operate to deprive Company of its
rights to operate and maintain such Electric Facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating the
same and the loss and expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to Company. In no case,
however, shall City be liable to Company for failure to specifically preserve a right-of-way under
Minnesota Statutes, Section 160.29. In accordance with Minnesota Rules Part 7819.3200, if the
City’s order directing vacation of the Public Way does not require relocation of the Company’s
Electric Facilities, the vacation proceedings shall not be deemed to deprive Company of its right to
continue to use the right-of-way of the former Public Way for its Electric Facilities installed prior to
such order of vacation.
SECTIO 8. CHAGE I FORM OF GOVERMET.
Any change in the form of government of the City shall not affect the validity of this
Ordinance. Any governmental unit succeeding the City shall, without the consent of Company,
succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the City provided in this Ordinance.
SECTIO 9. FRACHISE FEE.
9.1 Fee Schedule. During the term of the franchise hereby granted, and in lieu of any
permit or other fees being imposed on Company, the City may impose on Company a franchise
fee by collecting the amounts indicated in a Fee Schedule set forth in a separate ordinance from
each customer in the designated Company Customer Class. The parties have agreed that the
franchise fee collected by the Company and paid to the City in accordance with this Section 9
shall not to exceed the following amounts.
Class Fee Per Premise Per Month
Residential $2.75
Sm C & I – Non-Dem $5.25
Sm C & I – Demand $40.00
Large C & I $230.00
Public Street Ltg $15.50
Muni Pumping –N/D $2.00
MuniPumping – Dem $3.00
9.2 Separate Ordinance. The franchise fee shall be imposed by a separate ordinance
duly adopted by the City Council, which ordinance shall not be adopted until at least 60 days
after written notice enclosing such proposed ordinance has been served upon Company by
certified mail. The fee shall not become effective until at least 60 days after written notice
Appendix A-7
enclosing such adopted ordinance has been served upon Company by certified mail. Section 2.5
shall constitute the sole remedy for solving disputes between Company and the City in regard to
the interpretation of, or enforcement of, the separate ordinance. No action by the City to
implement a separate ordinance will commence until this Ordinance is effective.
9.3 Terms Defined. For the purpose of this Section 9, the following definitions apply:
9.3.1 “Customer Class” shall refer to the classes listed on the Fee Schedule and as
defined or determined in Company’s electric tariffs on file with the Commission.
9.3.2 “Fee Schedule” refers to the schedule in Section 9.1 setting forth the various
customer classes from which a franchise fee would be collected if a separate ordinance were
implemented immediately after the effective date of this franchise agreement. The Fee Schedule
in the separate ordinance may include new Customer Class added by Company to its electric
tariffs after the effective date of this franchise agreement.
9.3.3 The term “Gross Revenues” means all sums received by the Company from
the sale of electricity to its retail customers within the corporate limits of the City, excluding any
surcharge, sales tax, miscellaneous tariff charges or any similar addition to the Company’s
charges to customers for the purpose of reimbursing the Company for the franchise fee, sales tax,
or similar charge.
9.4 Collection of the Fee. The franchise fee shall be payable quarterly and shall be
based
on the amount collected by Company during complete billing months during the period for which
payment is to be made by imposing a surcharge equal to the designated franchise fee for the
applicable customer classification in all customer billings for electric service in each class. The
payment shall be due the last business day of the month following the period for which the payment
is made. The franchise fee may be changed by ordinance from time to time; however, each change
shall meet the same notice requirements and not occur more often than annually and no change
shall require a collection from any customer for electric service in excess of the amounts
specifically permitted by this Section 9. The time and manner of collecting the franchise fee is
subject to the approval of the Commission. No franchise fee shall be payable by Company if
Company is legally unable to first collect an amount equal to the franchise fee from its customers in
each applicable class of customers by imposing a surcharge in Company’s applicable rates for
electric service. Company may pay the City the fee based upon the surcharge billed subject to
subsequent reductions to account for uncollectibles, refunds and correction of erroneous billings.
Company agrees to make its records available for inspection by the City at reasonable times
provided that the City and its designated representative agree in writing not to disclose any
information which would indicate the amount paid by any identifiable customer or customers or any
other information regarding identified customers. In addition, the Company agrees to provide at the
time of each payment a statement summarizing how the franchise fee payment was determined,
including information showing any adjustments to the total surcharge billed in the period for which
the payment is being made to account for any uncollectibles, refunds or error corrections.
Appendix A-8
9.5 Equivalent Fee Requirement. The separate ordinance imposing the fee shall not
be effective against Company unless it lawfully imposes and the City monthly or more often
collects a fee or tax of the same or greater equivalent amount on the receipts from sales of energy
within the City by any other energy supplier, provided that, as to such a supplier, the City has the
authority to require a franchise fee or to impose a tax. The “same or greater equivalent amount”
shall be measured, if practicable, by comparing amounts collected as a franchise fee from each
similar customer, or by comparing, as to similar customers the percentage of the annual bill
represented by the amount collected for franchise fee purposes. The franchise fee or tax shall be
applicable to energy sales for any energy use related to heating, cooling or lighting, or to run
machinery and appliances, but shall not apply to energy sales for the purpose of providing fuel for
vehicles. If the Company specifically consents in writing to a franchise or separate ordinance
collecting or failing to collect a fee from another energy supplier in contravention of this Section
9.5, the foregoing conditions will be waived to the extent of such written consent.
SECTIO 10. PROVISIOS OF ORDIACE.
10.1 Severability. Every section, provision, or part of this Ordinance is declared
separate from every other section, provision, or part; and if any section, provision, or part shall be
held invalid, it shall not affect any other section, provision, or part. Where a provision of any
other City ordinance conflicts with the provisions of this Ordinance, the provisions of this
Ordinance shall prevail.
10.2 Limitation on Applicability. This Ordinance constitutes a franchise agreement
between the City and Company as the only parties and no provision of this franchise shall in any
way inure to the benefit of any third person (including the public at large) so as to constitute any
such person as a third party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more of the terms
hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto.
SECTIO 11. AMEDMET PROCEDURE.
Either party to this franchise agreement may at any time propose that the agreement be
amended to address a subject of concern and the other party will consider whether it agrees that the
amendment is mutually appropriate. If an amendment is agreed upon, this Ordinance may be
amended at any time by the City passing a subsequent ordinance declaring the provisions of the
amendment, which amendatory ordinance shall become effective upon the filing of Company’s
written consent thereto with the City Clerk within 90 days after the date of final passage by the
City of the amendatory ordinance.
SECTIO 12. PREVIOUS FRACHISES SUPERSEDED.
This franchise supersedes any previous electric franchise granted to Company or its
predecessor.

before that time, that the Company does not accept all terms of this franchise, the City by Council
resolution may revoke this Ordinance or seek its enforcement in a court of competent jurisdiction.
2.3 Service and Rates. The service to be provided and the rates to be charged by
Company
for Gas service in City are subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission.
2.4 Publication Expense. The expense of publication of this Ordinance will be paid by
City and reimbursed to City by Company.
2.5 Dispute Resolution. If either party asserts that the other party is in default in the
performance of any obligation hereunder, the complaining party shall notify the other party of the
default and the desired remedy. The notification shall be written. Representatives of the parties
must promptly meet and attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the dispute. If the dispute
is not resolved within 30 days of the written notice, the parties may jointly select a mediator to
facilitate further discussion. The parties will equally share the fees and expenses of this mediator. If
a mediator is not used or if the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days after first
meeting with the selected mediator, either party may commence an action in District Court to
interpret and enforce this franchise or for such other relief as may be permitted by law or equity for
breach of contract, or either party may take any other action permitted by law.
2.6 Continuation of Franchise. If the City and Company are unable to agree on the
terms of a new franchise by the time this franchise expires, this franchise will remain in effect
Appendix B-2
until a new franchise is agreed upon, or until 90 days after the City or Company serves written
Notice to the other party of its intention to allow the franchise to expire, but in no event shall this
franchise continue for more than one year after expiration of the 20-year term set forth in Section
2.1.
SECTION 3. LOCATION, OTHER REGULATIONS.
3.1 Location of Facilities. Gas Facilities shall be located, constructed and maintained
so as not to interfere with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel along and over Public Ways
and so as not to disrupt or interfere with normal operation of any City Utility System previously
installed therein. Gas Facilities may be located on Public Grounds as determined by the City.
Company's construction, reconstruction, operation, repair, maintenance and location of Gas
Facilities shall be subject to permits if required by separate ordinance and to other reasonable
regulations of the City to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this franchise agreement.
Company may abandon underground gas facilities in place, provided, at City’s request, Company
will remove abandoned metal pipe interfering with a City improvement project, but only to the
extent such metal pipe is uncovered by excavation as part of the City’s improvement project.
3.2 Field Locations. Company shall provide field locations for its underground Gas
Facilities within City consistent with the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 216D.
3.3 Street Openings. Company shall not open or disturb any Public Way or Public
Ground for any purpose without first having obtained a permit from the City, if required by a
separate ordinance, for which the City may impose a reasonable fee. Permit conditions imposed on
Company shall not be more burdensome than those imposed on other utilities for similar facilities or
work. Company may, however, open and disturb any Public Way or Public Ground without a
permit if (i) an emergency exists requiring the immediate repair of Gas Facilities and (ii) Company
gives telephone, e-mail, or similar notice to the City if reasonably possible, commencement of the
emergency repair. Not later than the second working day thereafter, Company shall obtain any
required permits and pay any required fees.
3.4 Restoration. After undertaking any work requiring the opening of any Public Way
or Public Ground, Company shall restore the same, including paving and its foundation, to as good a
condition as formerly existed, and shall maintain any paved surface in good condition for two years
thereafter. The work shall be completed as promptly as weather permits, and if Company shall not
promptly perform and complete the work, remove all dirt, rubbish, equipment and material, and put
the Public Way or Public Ground in the said condition, the City shall have, after demand to
Company to cure and the passage of a reasonable period of time following the demand, but not to
exceed five days, the right to make the restoration at the expense of Company. Company shall pay
to the City the cost of such work done for or performed by the City. This remedy shall be in addition
to any other remedy available to the City for noncompliance with this Section 3.4, but the City
hereby waives any requirement for Company to post a construction performance bond, certificate of
insurance, letter of credit or any other form of security or assurance that may be required, under a
separate existing or future ordinance of the City, of a person or entity obtaining the City’s
permission to install, replace or maintain facilities in a Public Way.
Appendix B-3
3.5 Avoid Damage to Gas Facilities. Nothing in this Ordinance relieves any person
from liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid damaging Gas Facilities
while performing any activity.
3.6 Notice of Improvements. The City must give Company reasonable notice of plans
for improvements to Public Ways or Public Ground where the City has reason to believe that Gas
Facilities may affect or be affected by the improvement. The notice must contain: (i) the nature and
character of the improvements, (ii) the Public Ways and Public Grounds upon which the
improvements are to be made, (iii) the extent of the improvements, (iv) the time when the City will
start the work, and (v) if more than one Public Way or Public Ground is involved, the order in which
the work is to proceed. The notice must be given to Company a sufficient length of time in advance
of the actual commencement of the work to permit Company to make any necessary additions,
alterations or repairs to its Gas Facilities.
3.7 Mapping Information. The Company must promptly provide mapping information
for any of its underground Gas Facilities in accordance with Minnesota Rules parts 7819.4000 and
7819.4100.
SECTION 4. RELOCATIONS.
4.1 Relocation of Gas Facilities in Public Ways. If the City determines to vacate a
Public Way for a City improvement project, or at City’s cost to grade, regrade, or change the line of
any Public Way, or construct or reconstruct any City Utility System in any Public Way, it may order
Company to relocate its Gas Facilities located therein if relocation is reasonably necessary to
accomplish the City’s proposed public improvement. Except as provided in Section 4.3, Company
shall relocate its Gas Facilities at its own expense. The City shall give Company reasonable notice
of plans to vacate for a City improvement project, or to grade, regrade, or change the line of any
Public Way or to construct or reconstruct any City Utility System. If a relocation is ordered within
five years of a prior relocation of the same Gas Facilities, which was made at Company expense, the
City shall reimburse Company for Non-Betterment Costs on a time and material basis, provided that
if a subsequent relocation is required because of the extension of a City Utility System to a
previously unserved area, or to avoid interference with a joint project of the City with another
governmental unit, Company may be required to make the subsequent relocation at its expense.
Nothing in this Ordinance requires Company to relocate, remove, replace or reconstruct at its own
expense its Gas Facilities where such relocation, removal, replacement or reconstruction is solely for
the convenience of the City and is not reasonably necessary for the construction or reconstruction of
a Public Way or City Utility System or other City improvement.
4.2 Relocation of Gas Facilities in Public Ground. City may require Company at
Company’s expense to relocate or remove its Gas Facilities from Public Ground upon a finding by
City that the Gas Facilities have become or will become a substantial impairment to the existing or
proposed public use of the Public Ground. Such relocation shall comply with applicable City
ordinances consistent with law.
4.3 Projects with Federal Funding. Relocation, removal, or rearrangement of any
Company Gas Facilities made necessary because of the extension into or through City of a
Appendix B-4
federally-aided highway project shall be governed by the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, Section
161.46, as supplemented or amended. It is understood that the right herein granted to Company is a
valuable right. City shall not order Company to remove or relocate its Gas Facilities when a Public
Way is vacated, improved or realigned because of a renewal or a redevelopment plan which is
financially subsidized in whole or in part by the Federal Government or any agency thereof, unless
the reasonable non-betterment Costs of such relocation and the loss and expense resulting therefrom
are first paid to Company, when available to the City, but the City has no obligation to pay those
portions of such for which reimbursement to it is not available.
4.4 No Waiver. The provisions of Section 4 apply only to Gas Facilities constructed
in reliance on a franchise from the City and Company does not waive its rights under an easement or
prescriptive right or state or county permit.
SECTION 5. TREE TRIMMING.
Company is also granted the permission and authority to trim all shrubs and trees, including
roots, in the Public Ways of City to the extent Company finds necessary to avoid interference with
the proper construction, operation, repair and maintenance of Gas Facilities, provided that Company
shall save City harmless from any liability in the premises.
SECTION 6. INDEMNIFICATION.
6.1 Indemnity of City. Company shall indemnify, keep and hold the City free and
harmless from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to property occasioned
by the construction, maintenance, repair, inspection, the issuance of permits, or the operation of the
Gas Facilities located in the Public Ways and Public Grounds. The City shall not be indemnified for
losses or claims occasioned through its own negligence except for losses or claims arising out of or
alleging the City's negligence as to the issuance of permits for, or inspection of, Company's plans or
work.
6.2 Defense of City. In the event a suit is brought against the City under circumstances
where this agreement to indemnify applies, Company at its sole cost and expense shall defend the
City in such suit if written notice thereof is promptly given to Company within a period wherein
Company is not prejudiced by lack of such notice. If Company is required to indemnify and defend,
it will thereafter have control of such litigation, but Company may not settle such litigation without
the consent of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This section is not, as to
third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the City; and Company, in
defending any action on behalf of the City shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or
immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf. This franchise agreement shall not be
interpreted to constitute a waiver by the City of any of its defenses or immunity or limitations on
liability under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 466.
SECTION 7. VACATION OF PUBLIC WAYS.
The City shall give Company at least two weeks prior written notice of a proposed vacation
of a Public Way. Except where required for a City improvement project, the vacation of any Public
Appendix B-5
Way, after the installation of Gas Facilities, shall not operate to deprive Company of its rights to
operate and maintain such Gas Facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating the same and the loss
and expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to Company. In no case, however, shall
City be liable to Company for failure to specifically preserve a right-of-way under Minnesota
Statutes, Section 160.29. In accordance with Minnesota rules Part 7819.3200, if the City’s order
directing vacation of Public Way does not require relocation of the Company’s Gas Facilities, the
vacation proceedings shall not be deemed to deprive Company of its right to continue to use the
right-of-way of the former Public Way for its Gas Facilities installed prior to such order of vacation.
SECTION 8. CHANGE IN FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
Any change in the form of government of the City shall not affect the validity of this
Ordinance. Any governmental unit succeeding the City shall, without the consent of Company,
succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the City provided in this Ordinance.
SECTION 9. FRANCHISE FEE.
The City at the time of adopting this franchise agreement does not desire to require that
Company collect a franchise fee from its customers in the City. At a future date during the term
of this franchise agreement, the City may determine that it desires Company to collect a
franchise fee. If so, the City may give Company Notice to amend this franchise agreement to
authorize collection of a franchise fee by separate ordinance in an amount and upon such terms
and conditions as Company has incorporated in its Gas franchise agreements with other cities of
the second, third or fourth class in the seven-county metropolitan area in the two years preceding
the date of such Notice or the last five gas franchise agreements entered by the Company prior to
such Notice, whichever is the greater number of franchise agreements. Upon receipt of such
Notice Company shall negotiate in good faith with City to so amend this franchise agreement.
SECTION 10. PROVISIONS OF ORDINANCE.
10.1 Severability. Every section, provision, or part of this Ordinance is declared
separate from every other section, provision, or part; and if any section, provision, or part shall
be held invalid, it shall not affect any other section, provision, or part. Where a provision of any
other City ordinance conflicts with the provisions of this Ordinance, the provisions of this
Ordinance shall prevail.
10.2 Limitation on Applicability. This Ordinance constitutes a franchise agreement
between the City and Company as the only parties and no provision of this franchise shall in any
way inure to the benefit of any third person (including the public at large) so as to constitute any
such person as a third party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more of the terms
hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto.
SECTION 11. AMENDMENT PROCEDURE.
Either party to this franchise agreement may at any time propose that the agreement be
amended to address a subject of concern and the other party will consider whether it agrees that the
Appendix B-6
amendment is mutually appropriate. If an amendment is agreed upon, this Ordinance may be
amended at any time by the City passing a subsequent ordinance declaring the provisions of the
amendment, which amendatory ordinance shall become effective upon the filing of Company’s
written consent thereto with the City Clerk within 90 days after the date of final passage by the
City of the amendatory ordinance.
SECTION 12. PREVIOUS FRANCHISES SUPERSEDED.
This franchise supersedes any previous Gas franchise granted to Company or its predecessor.

ELECTRIC FRACHISE FEE
CITY OF LITTLE CAADA, RAMSEY COUTY, MIESOTA
A ORDIACE IMPLEMETIG A ELECTRIC FRACHISE FEE O ORTHER
STATES POWER D/B/A XCEL EERGY FOR PROVIDIG ELECTRIC SERVICE
WITHI THE CITY OF LITTLE CAADA.
THE CITY OF LITTLE CAADA ORDAIS:
SECTIO 1. The City of Little Canada Municipal Code is hereby amended to include reference
to the following Special Ordinance.
Subd. 1. Purpose. The Little Canada City Council has determined that it is in the best
interest of the City to impose a franchise fee on those public utility companies that provide natural
gas and electric services within the City of Little Canada.
(a) Pursuant to City Ordinance #550, a Franchise Agreement between the City and
Northern States Power, d/b/a Xcel Energy, the City has the right to impose a franchise fee
on Xcel Energy in amount and fee design as set forth in Section 9.1 of the Xcel Energy
Franchise and in the fee schedule attached as Exhibit A.
Subd. 2. Franchise Fee. A franchise fee is hereby imposed on Xcel Energy under its
Electric Franchise in accordance with the schedule attached hereto and made a part of this
ordinance, commencing with the Xcel Energy’s October 2003 billing month.
This fee is an account-based fee and not a meter-based fee. In the event that an entity
covered by this ordinance has more than one meter at a single premise, but only one account, only
one fee shall be assessed to that account. If a premise has two or more meters being billed at
different rates, the Company may have an account for each rate classification, which will result in
more than one franchise fee assessment for electric service to that premise. In the event any entities
covered by this ordinance have more than one premise, each premise (address) shall be subject to
the appropriate fee. In the event a question arises as to the proper fee amount for any premise, the
Company’s manner of billing for energy used at that premise before this ordinance was adopted
will control.
Subd. 3. Payment. The said franchise fee shall be payable to the City in accordance with
the terms set forth in Section 9.4 of the Franchise.
Subd. 4. Surcharge. The City recognizes that the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission
allows the utility company to add a surcharge to customer rates to reimburse such utility company
for the cost of the fee and that Xcel Energy will surcharge its customers in the City the amount of
the fee.
Subd. 5. Record Support for Payment. Xcel Energy shall make each payment when due
and, if requested by the City, shall provide at the time of each payment a statement summarizing
Appendix C-2
how the franchise fee payment was determined, including information showing any adjustments to
the total surcharge billed in the period for which the payment is being made to account for any
uncollectibles, refunds, or error corrections.
Subd. 6. Enforcement. Any dispute, including enforcement of a default regarding this
ordinance will be resolved in accordance with Section 2.5 the Franchise Agreement.
Subd. 7. Effective Date of Franchise Fee. Notwithstanding the effective date of this
ordinance and notwithstanding any contrary provisions in the Franchise, the effective date of the
franchise fee collected under Subdivision 2 of this ordinance is the later of ten (10) days after the
publication or after the sending of written notice enclosing a copy of this adopted ordinance upon
Xcel Energy by certified mail. It has been agreed to in advance by Xcel Energy’s representatives
that Xcel Energy will abide by the provisions of this Subdivision 7, provided fee collection will not
commence before the later of the Company billing month set forth in Subdivision 2 or the first
billing month commencing 20 days after the foregoing effective date of the franchise fee.
Subd. 8. Sunset Clause. This Ordinance shall automatically sunset upon expiration of the
Electric Franchise. The City Council may unilaterally renew or extend the fee on the same terms
and conditions. Without waiver of any rights under Minnesota law, the City Council shall seek
agreement from Company if the City intends to change the fee rate or fee design.
SECTIO 2. This ordinance takes effect as provided herein.

overcrowding of land and undue concentration of structures by regulating land, buildings, yards
and density of population; to provide for compatibility of different land uses; to provide for
administration of this Ordinance, to provide for amendments; to prescribe penalties for violation
of such regulations; and to define powers and duties of the City staff, the Board of Adjustment

regulation of land use and development in accordance with the policies and purpose herein set
forth.

903.010. NON-CONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES.
A. Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section to provide for the regulation of nonconforming
buildings, structures and uses and to specify those requirements, circumstances and
conditions under which non-conforming buildings, structures and uses will be operated
and maintained. The Zoning Ordinance establishes separate districts, each of which is an
appropriate area for the location of uses which are permitted in that district. It is
necessary and consistent with the establishment of these districts that non-conforming
buildings, structures and uses not be permitted to continue without restrictions.
Furthermore, it is the intent of this Section that all nonconforming uses shall be
eventually brought into conformity.
B. Any non-conforming structure or use lawfully existing upon the effective date of this
Ordinance shall not be enlarged, but may be continued at the size and in the manner of
operation existing upon such date except as hereinafter specified or subsequently
amended.
C. Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent the placing of a structure in safe condition when
said structure is declared unsafe by the Building Official, providing the necessary repairs
shall not constitute more than fifty (50) percent of fair market value of such structure.
Said value shall be determined by the City Assessor or the City will obtain an appraisal at
the owner/applicant’s expense.
D. No non-conforming building, structure or use shall be moved to another lot or to any
other part of the parcel of land upon which the same was constructed or was conducted at
the time of this Ordinance adoption unless such movement shall bring the nonconformance
into compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance.
E. When any lawful non-conforming use of any structure or land in any district has been
changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed to any nonconforming
use.
F. A lawful non-conforming use of a structure or parcel of land may be changed to lessen
the non-conformity of use. Once a non-conforming structure or parcel of land has been
changed, it shall not thereafter be so altered to increase the non-conformity.
G. Subject to the requirements of MN Stat. Chapter 462.357, Subd. 1.e., if at any time a nonconforming
building, structure or use shall be destroyed to the extent of more than fifty
(50) percent of its fair market value, said value to be determined by the City Assessor,
and where no building permit has been applied for within one hundred eighty (180) days
of said destruction, then without further action by the Council, the building and the land
on which such building was located or maintained shall, from and after the date of said
destruction, be subject to all the regulations specified by these zoning regulations for the
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance General Provisions
903-2
district in which such land and buildings are located. Any building which is damaged to
an extent of less than fifty (50) percent of its value may be restored to its former extent.
Estimate of the extent of damage or destruction shall be made by the Building Official.

of one (1) year, any future use of said structure or land shall be made to conform with the
provisions of this Ordinance.

use is permitted, including necessary non-structural repairs and incidental
alterations which do not physically extend or intensify the non-conforming use.
J. Alterations may be made to a building containing lawful non-conforming residential units
when they will improve the livability thereof, provided they will not increase the number
of dwelling units or the non-conformity.
K. Non-conforming, non-income producing, residential units may be expanded to improve
livability as a conditional use, provided that the non-conformity of the structure will not
be increased.
L. Any proposed structure which will, under this Ordinance, become non-conforming but
for which a building permit has been lawfully granted prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance, may be completed in accordance with the approved plans; provided
construction is started within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Ordinance, is not
abandoned for a period of more than one hundred twenty (120) days, and continues to
completion within two (2) years. Such structure and use shall thereafter be a legally nonconforming
structure and use.
M. For the purposes of applying Sections 903.010.D. and 903.010.G. to Mobile Home Parks
which are made non-conforming by land use zoning district, such Mobile Home Parks

least ten feet from the nearest adjacent manufactured home position. The
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance General Provisions
903-3
requirements of this paragraph shall not apply to recreational camping areas and
variances may be granted by the State Commissioner of Health in manufactured
home parks when the variance is applied for in writing and in the opinion of the

manufactured home park occupants.
2. A non-conforming mobile home park shall be permitted to replace individual
mobile home units which are damaged as a result of catastrophic destruction from
fire, weather, or natural disaster, providing that no more than fifty (50) percent of
the capacity of the mobile home park is so destroyed. If at any time, an event of
destruction damages more than fifty (50) percent of the capacity of said park, the
mobile home park shall be put to a use which is in full conformance with the
applicable zoning ordinance and other federal, state and local codes.

Council. The shelter shall be located no closer than ten (10) feet to any perimeter
lot line or private street right-of-way. Said shelter shall meet the standards of the
Minnesota Commissioner of Health as may be adopted or amended. No shelter
building shall be utilized for the storage of materials, equipment or property of the
park operators, owners, residents, or any other person. Prior to construction, the
shelter shall be reviewed and approved according to the process outlined in the
Zoning Ordinance for Conditional Use Permits (Section 921). However, the

the property, and shall be subject to the rest of the provisions of Section 903.010

(irrigation, grading, etc.) influences].
5. Trees, shrubs, or ground covers shall meet the standards of the American
Association of Nurserymen.
6. Regular maintenance of said landscaping, as dictated by the site conditions (soils,
climate, groundwater, etc.) shall be required. Failure of said landscaping to
consistently comply with and meet the intent of this section shall constitute a
violation of this ordinance. The property owner shall be required to maintain all
landscaping as a condition of any occupancy, including removal and replacement
of dead, diseased, or overgrown plant materials.
a. The owner, tenant, and their respective agent, shall be jointly and severely
responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping in a condition
presenting a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance free from refuse and
debris. On a continuing basis, all dead and/or missing plants must be

landscaped islands shall be provided at a rate of one island per fifteen (15)
surface spaces or fraction thereof. For the purposes of this ordinance, an
island shall be required to consist of one hundred (100) square feet of
landscaped surface. Such islands shall be contained in raised, curbed beds
consistent with parking lot construction requirements of this ordinance
except that infiltration basins and rain-gardens may be allowed in

trees on the site are to be saved which do not have to be removed for
street, buildings, utilities, or drainage. Trees over six (6) inches in
diameter that are to remain are to be marked with a red band and to be
protected with snow fences or other suitable enclosure prior to any
excavation. The City may further require that the developer retain a
professional forester to prepare a forest inventory and management plan
for the development, in order to control and abate any existing or potential
shade tree disease. Prior to construction, the developer or contractor shall
schedule an on-site inspection with the Building Official to identify
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance General Provisions
903-17
significant trees to be removed. Significant trees shall be defined as those
existing trees of six (6) caliper inches or more, as measured five (5) feet
above the existing grade level. All such trees to be removed to
accommodate the project shall be tagged and catalogued by size. The
landscape plan shall be required to show replacement of the lost

shall be arranged as to deflect light away from any adjoining residential zone or from the
public streets. Direct or sky-reflected glare, whether from floodlights or from high
temperature processes such as combustion or welding, shall not be directed into any
adjoining property. The source of lights shall be hooded or controlled in some manner so
as not to light adjacent property. Bare incandescent light bulbs shall not be permitted in
view of adjacent property or public right-of-way. Any light or combination of lights
which cast light on a public street shall not exceed one (1) foot candle (meter reading) as
measured from the center line of said street. Any light or combination of lights which cast

nuisance and may abate such nuisance pursuant to City Code.
N. Refuse. Passenger automobiles, station wagons, trucks, trailers, boats, recreational
vehicles, and other vehicles which require license, but which are not currently licensed by
the state, or which are because of mechanical deficiency incapable of movement under
their own power, parked or stored outside in violation of the City Ordinance are
considered refuse or junk and shall be disposed of. The piling of junk in yards in all
residential districts shall be considered to be a non-conforming use and shall be removed
within a period of three (3) months after the effective date of this Ordinance. This does
not intend to prohibit the legitimate and timely restoration of antique vehicles.

903.110. SIGNS.
A. Purpose. This section is established to protect and promote health, safety, general welfare
and order within the City of Little Canada through the establishment of a comprehensive
and impartial set of standards, regulations and procedures governing the type, numbers,
size, structure, location, height, lighting, erection, use and/or display of devices, signs or
symbols serving as a visual communication media to persons situated within or upon
public rights-of-way or properties. The provisions of this subdivision are intended to
encourage opportunity for effective, orderly communication by reducing confusion and
hazards resulting from unnecessary and/or indiscriminate use of communication facilities,
as well as to provide adequate opportunity for travelers to find their way through the
community, and to specific points within the community. Such hazards result in unsafe
traffic conditions, including threats to vehicular and pedestrian travelers. The regulations
herein have been narrowly tailored to meet these purposes.
B. Permitted and Prohibited Signs. For each type of commercial message permitted by the
regulations in Section 903.110 of this Ordinance, a non-commercial message may
substituted which complies with all of the size, location, and other applicable
performance standards of the ordinance.
1. Permitted Signs. The following signs are allowed without a permit, license, or fee,
but shall comply with all other applicable provisions of this Ordinance:
a. Public Signs.
b. Identification Signs. There may be one per premise, not to exceed two (2)
square feet in area. If the sign is freestanding, the total height may not
exceed five (5) feet.

number, in accordance with Minn. Statute.
e. Temporary Displays, including Holiday displays. A noncommercial

City Building Official or his agent. One (1) sign shall be permitted for
each major street the project abuts. No sign may exceed sixty-four (64)
square feet.
g. Real Estate Sale or Rental Signs. The City finds that the sale or rental of
real estate requires additional signage allowance due to the unique and
specific geographic location aspects of real property. As such, additional
signage shall be permitted for the sale or rental of real estate, as follows:
(1) On-site Signs. Signs must be removed within seven (7) days after
sale or rental of property. Signs may not measure more than six (6)
square feet in residential districts. Signs for all non-residential
zoning districts shall not exceed a ratio of one (1) square foot of
sign area for each thousand (1,000) square feet of lot area up to a

(24) hours prior to and/or after the hours in which a real estate
agent is available at the subject property. In the case of a house for
sale by owner, signs shall be allowed twenty-four (24) hours prior
to and/or after a scheduled open house. Such signs shall not be
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance General Provisions

Little Canada Zoning Ordinance General Provisions
903-43
3. Regulations for Dynamic Signs. Based on studies related to the use of dynamic
sign displays and driver distraction, the City finds that dynamic signs, as defined
by the zoning ordinance, have a unique potential to create driver distraction, a
major cause of traffic crashes. As a result, the City has adopted special
regulations that relate to such signs. These regulations shall apply to all proposed
dynamic signage in the City, whether new or existing, conforming or nonconforming
at the time of adoption of this ordinance.
a. No dynamic sign shall have lettering smaller than the Letter Height listed
in Figure 903-4.

d. No dynamic display shall change more often than the Duration of Display
shown in Figure 903-4, except time and temperature displays which may
change once every three (3) seconds.

owned and maintained by the owners of the residential units in the
project. The sign and the outlot shall be located and be of
appropriate size to protect the sign from vehicular traffic, avoid
conflicts with traffic visibility or movement, and avoid conflicts
with street maintenance operations. The City may adopt a standard
minimum design for such signs, subject to additional requirements
based on the proposed location. The City Council may approve
such outlots, and may impose any conditions necessary to promote
the public health, safety, and welfare of the community.
(2) Within Public Right-of-way. Notwithstanding other provisions of
this ordinance relating to use of the public right-of-way, residential
project monument signs may be located with the public right-ofway
under a specific license issued by the City Council, subject to
other provisions of this Section and the following:

silhouette area of the front of the building. Where the principal building is
on a corner or through lot and thus faces two (2) public streets, both sides
may be counted. If, however, the building has only one (1) frontage and
the owner elects to erect two (2) signs, the total square footage of both
signs may not exceed the maximum allowable square footage determined
from the front building silhouette. For purposes of determining the gross
area of the silhouette of the principal building, the silhouette shall be
defined as that area within an outline drawing of the principal building as
viewed from the front lot line or from the related public street(s).In

size, location and height of all signs. The Comprehensive Sign Plan shall
be an administrative permit, provided the plan meets all size, location, and
other standards of this Section and any applicable Architectural Guidelines
applicable to the district in which the sign would be located. A maximum
of fifteen (15) percent of the building silhouette shall apply to the principal

of limited access freeways, the maximum sign height shall be
allowed to be thirty (30) feet regardless of the building size. Sign

sign and setback provisions of this ordinance.
6. “PUD” District: Within a PUD District, a comprehensive sign plan shall be
required which designates the number, type, size, and design of all signs proposed
for the PUD project. The aggregate signage allowed by the PUD sign plan shall
be the amount of signage which would be allowed under 903.110.E.5. of this
Ordinance, based on the proposed uses within the PUD and the zoning districts in
which each use would be allowed, except as follows:
a. Each principal building within a PUD shall be allowed one (1)

903.120. HOME OCCUPATIONS.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this subdivision is to prevent competition with business districts
and to provide a means through the establishment of specific standards and procedures by
which home occupations can be conducted in residential neighborhoods without
jeopardizing the health, safety and general welfare of the surrounding neighborhood. In
addition, this subdivision is intended to provide a mechanism enabling the distinction
between permitted home occupations and special or customarily "more sensitive" home
occupations. While permitted home occupations may be allowed as a matter of right,
special home occupations shall require a permit in accordance with the terms of this
subdivision.

surrounding residential uses.
d. No home occupation shall require internal or external alterations or
involve construction features not customarily found in dwellings except
where required to comply with local and state fire and police
recommendations.

903-55
2. Requirements - Permitted Home Occupations.

secretarial services, professional offices and teaching with musical,
dancing and other instructions which consist of no more than one (1) pupil

sale of merchandise produced off the premises, except for those
brand name products that are not marketed and sold in a wholesale or
retail outlet.
E. Special Home Occupation - Permit Procedure.
1. Any home occupation which does not meet the specific requirements for a
permitted home occupation as defined in this subdivision shall require a "special
home occupation permit" which shall be applied for and reviewed in accordance
with the provisions of Section 921 of this Ordinance.
2. Declaration of Conditions. The Planning Commission and City Council may
impose such conditions on the granting of a special home occupation permit as
may be necessary to carry out the purpose and provisions of this subdivision.
3. Effect of Permit. A "special home occupation permit" may be issued for a period
of one (1) year, after which the permit may be reissued for periods of up to three
(3) years each. Each application for permit renewal shall be reviewed and subject
to approval of the Zoning Administrator. In consideration of an application for
license renewal where written complaints have been received or where there has
been a change in conditions or violation, the Zoning Administrator shall have the
discretion to process the application in accordance with the procedural
requirements of the initial special home occupation license.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance General Provisions
903-56

5. Lapse of Special Home Occupation Permit by Non-Use. Whenever within one (1)
year after granting a permit the use as permitted by the permit shall not have been
initiated, then such permit shall become null and void unless a petition for
extension of time in which to complete the work has been granted by the City
Council. Such extension shall be requested in writing and filed with the Zoning
Administrator at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the original permit.
There shall be no charge for filing of such petition. The request for extension
shall state facts showing a good faith attempt to initiate the use. Such petition
shall be presented to the Planning Commission for a recommendation and to the
City Council for a decision.
6. Reconsideration. Whenever an application for a permit has been considered and
denied by the City Council, a similar application for a permit affecting
substantially the same property shall not be considered again by the Planning
Commission or City Council for at least six (6) months from the date of its denial
unless a decision to reconsider such matter is made by not less than four-fifths
(4/5) vote of the full City Council.
7. Renewal of Permits. An applicant shall not have a vested right to a permit renewal
by reason of having obtained a previous permit. In applying for and accepting a
permit, the permit holder agrees that his monetary investment in the home
occupation will be fully amortized over the life of the permit and that a permit
renewal will not be needed to amortize the investment. Each application for the
renewal of a permit will be considered as a new permit without taking into
consideration that a previous permit has been granted. The previous granting or
renewal of a permit shall not constitute a precedent or basis for the renewal of a
permit.
8. Additional Requirements - Special Home Occupation.
a. No person other than a resident shall conduct the home occupation, except
where the applicant can satisfactorily prove unusual or unique conditions
or need for non-residential assistance and that this exception would not

teaching with musical, dancing and other instruction of more than one (1)
pupil at a time.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance General Provisions
903-57
d. Special home occupations may be allowed to accommodate their parking
demand through utilization of on-street parking. In such cases where onstreet
parking facilities are necessary, however, the City Council shall
maintain the right to establish the maximum number of on-street spaces
permitted and increase or decrease the maximum number when and where
changing conditions require additional review.
F. Non-Conforming Use. Existing home occupations lawfully existing on the date of this
Ordinance may continue as non-conforming uses. They shall, however, be required to
obtain permits for their continued operation. Any existing home occupation that is
discontinued for a period of more than thirty (30) days, or is in violation of the Ordinance
provisions under which it was initially established, shall be brought into conformity with
the provisions of this subdivision.
G. Inspection. The City of Little Canada hereby reserves the right upon issuing any home
occupation permit to inspect the premises in which the occupation is being conducted to
insure compliance with the provisions of this subdivision or any conditions additionally
imposed.

Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-1
916. FP”, FLOODPLAI DISTRICT
916.010. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION AND PURPOSE.
A. Statutory Authorization. The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in
Minnesota Statutes Chapter 103F and Chapter 462, delegated the responsibility
to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
B. Purpose. The intent of this Section is:
1. To provide for the protection and preservation of water channels and
those portions of the adjoining floodplains which are reasonably required
to carry and discharge a regional flood and are subject to inundation by
regional floods;
2. To promote the public health, safety, and general welfare;
3. To minimize potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce, utilities, and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare; and
4. To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance
Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59 -78, as
amended, so as to maintain the community’s eligibility in the National
Flood Insurance Program.
916.020. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
A. Lands to which Ordinance applies. This Ordinance shall apply to all lands within
the jurisdiction of the City of Little Canada shown on the Official Zoning Map
and/or the attachments thereto as being located within the boundaries of the
Floodway or Flood Fringe Districts.
B. Establishment of Official Zoning Map. The Official Zoning Map, together with all
materials attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a
part of this Ordinance. The attached material shall include the Flood Insurance
Study for Ramsey County, Minnesota (All Jurisdictions) and Flood Insurance
Rate Map panels therein numbered 27123C0036G, 27123C0037G,
27123C0038G, 27123C0039G, 27123C0041G and 27123C0043G, all dated
June 4, 2010 and prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The Official Zoning Map shall be on file in the Office of the City Clerk and the
Zoning Administrator.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-2
(Note: For future annexation of floodplain lands, it is a requirement of the
National Flood Insurance Program that a community legally apply the provisions
of its floodplain ordinance to the annexed land on the date of annexation (see
Section 916.020.I that follows). The flood insurance rate map panels adopted
into Section 916.020.B above must be inclusive enough so that they encompass
all of the unincorporated area of the county that may be annexed into the city into
the foreseeable future. This may mean that a city will need to adopt flood
insurance rate map panels in addition to those flood map panels that contain the
current corporate boundaries of the city.)
C. Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. The regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional
flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood
plain that result from designation of a floodway.
D. Interpretation.
1. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Ordinance shall
be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in
favor of the Governing Body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal
of any other powers granted by state statutes.
2. The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling
distances on the Official Zoning Map. Where interpretation is needed as to
the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the Official
Zoning Map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between
a mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal
appeal of the decision of the Zoning Administrator, the Board of Adjustment
shall make the necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on
elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations
that existed on the site at the time the Community adopted its initial
floodplain ordinance or on the date of the first National Flood Insurance
Program map showing the area within the 100-year floodplain if earlier, and
other available technical data. Persons contesting the location of the
district boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their
case to the Board of Adjustment and to submit technical evidence.
E. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this Ordinance to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this Ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this Ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-3
F. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. This Ordinance does not imply that areas
outside the flood plain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This Ordinance shall not create liability on
the part of the City of Little Canada or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this Ordinance or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
G. Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this Ordinance is
adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
remainder of this Ordinance shall not be affected thereby.
H. Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this
Ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they
have in common usage and so as to give this Ordinance its most reasonable
application.
1. Accessory Use or Structure - a use or structure on the same lot with, and
of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or
structure.
2. Basement - means any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having
its floor or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides,
regardless of the depth of excavation below ground level.
3. Conditional Use - means a specific type of structure or land use listed in
the official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review
procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in
the official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that:
a. Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist.
b. The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land
use plan if one exists and are compatible with the existing
neighborhood.
4. Equal Degree of Encroachment - a method of determining the location of
floodway boundaries so that flood plain lands on both sides of a stream
are capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
5. Flood - a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the
stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry
areas.

flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-4

basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor.
12. Manufactured Home - a structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities.
The term “manufactured home” does not include the term “recreational

13. Obstruction - any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile,
abutment, projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building,
wire, fence, stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or
projecting into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory flood plain which
may impede, retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in
itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by such water.
14. Principal Use or Structure - means all uses or structures that are not
accessory uses or structures.
15. Reach - a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of

square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck,
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District

17. Regional Flood - a flood which is representative of large floods known to
have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of
what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude
of the 100-year recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with
the term "base flood", 1-percent annual chance flood or 100-year flood
elevation.
18. Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation - The regulatory flood protection

recreational vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in
Section 916.090.C11 of this Ordinance and other similar items.
20. Substantial Damage - means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure where the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
21. Substantial Improvement - within any consecutive 365-day period, any
reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair),
repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the
cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the
structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term
includes structures that have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of
the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include
either:
a. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure
safe living conditions.
b. Any alteration of an “historic structure,” provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an “historic
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-6
structure.” For the purpose of this Ordinance, “historic structure”
shall be as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1.
22. Variance - means a modification of a specific permitted development
standard required in an official control including this Ordinance to allow an
alternative development standard not stated as acceptable in the official
control, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose of

defined and elaborated upon in a community's respective planning and
zoning enabling legislation.
I. Annexations. The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference into
Section 916.020.B above may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the
corporate boundaries of the City of Little Canada at the time of adoption of this
ordinance. If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed into the City of
Little Canada after the date of adoption of this ordinance, the newly annexed

below are only allowable in the floodway if not prohibited by any other underlying zoning
district classifications of the City of Little Canada and if not prohibited by any applicable
state or federal law.
A. Permitted Uses:
1. General farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture,
and wild crop harvesting.
2. Boat launching ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature
preserves, and fishing areas.
3. Residential lawns, gardens and play areas.
B. Standards for Floodway Permitted Uses:
1. The use shall have a low flood damage potential.
2. The use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists.
3. The use shall not obstruct flood flows or increase flood elevations and
shall not involve structures, fill, obstructions, excavations or storage of
materials or equipment.
C. Conditional Uses:
1. Extraction and storage of sand, gravel, and other materials.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-8
2. Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves, and water control structures.
3. Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines, and pipelines.
4. Placement of fill.
D. Standards for Floodway Conditional Uses:
1. All Uses. No fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction,
or other use may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any
increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an
increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected.
2. All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and
standards contained in Section 916.100.D of this Ordinance.
3. The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if
one exists.
4. Fill:
a. Fill, dredge spoil, and all other similar materials deposited or stored
in the flood plain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative
cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method.
b. Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be
allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is
submitted which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention
element to the plan.
c. As an alternative, and consistent with Subsection (b) immediately
above, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may
allow temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials which
would have caused an increase to the stage of the 100-year or
regional flood but only after the Governing Body has received an
appropriate plan which assures the removal of the materials from
the floodway based upon the flood warning time available. The
conditional use permit must be title registered with the property in
the Office of the County Recorder.
5. Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of other materials or
equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the
time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan
approved by the Governing Body. The storage or processing of materials
that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious
to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-9
6. Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to remove
areas from the regulatory flood plain shall not be allowed in the floodway.
916.050. FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF).
A. Permitted Uses: Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed
as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district(s). If no pre-existing,
underlying zoning use districts exist, then any residential or non residential
structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted use in the Flood Fringe
District provided such use does not constitute a public nuisance. All permitted
uses shall comply with the “Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses” listed in
Section 916.050.B and the "Standards for all Flood Fringe Uses" listed in Section
916.050.E.
B. Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses:
1. All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so
that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the regulatory
flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be
no lower than one (1) foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation
and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least fifteen (15) feet beyond
the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
2. As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a
minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at its largest
projection may be flood proofed in accordance with the following
standards:
a. Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
b. Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry
flood proofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing
classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an
accessory structure may be flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 flood
proofing classification in the State Building Code and, for a
detached garage, the detached garage must be used solely for
parking of vehicles and limited storage. Flood proofed accessory
structures must meet the following additional standards:
(1) The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and
shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls;
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-10
(2) Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be
elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation
or properly flood proofed; and
(3) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of two “automatic” openings in the
outside walls of the structure having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at least
two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings
must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent
grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a
garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement
for automatic openings.
3. The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of onethousand
(1,000) cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be
allowable only as a conditional use, unless said fill is specifically intended
to elevate a structure in accordance with Section 916.050.B1 of this
ordinance.
4. The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
5. The provisions of Section 916.050.E of this Ordinance shall apply.
C. Conditional Uses: Any structure that is not elevated on fill or flood proofed in
accordance with Section 916.050.B1 – B2 and or any use of land that does not
comply with the standards in Section 916.050.B3 – B4 shall only be allowable as
a conditional use. An application for a conditional use shall be subject to the
standards and criteria and evaluation procedures specified in Sections
916.050.D–E and 916.100.D of this Ordinance.
D. Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses:
1. Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to
elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection
elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings,
parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces
or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be
considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if:
1) the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure;
2) it is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant
materials; and 3) it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access
or storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to
the following additional standards:
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-11
a. Design and Certification - The structure's design and as-built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect as being in compliance with the general design standards
of the State Building Code and, specifically, that all electrical,
heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from
entering or accumulating within these components during times of
flooding.
b. Specific Standards for Above-grade, Enclosed Areas - Abovegrade,
fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under
garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans
must stipulate:
(1) A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a flood proofing technique. There
shall be a minimum of two openings on at least two
sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall
be no higher than one-foot above grade. The automatic
openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than
one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding unless a registered professional
engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would
suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with
screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices
provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood waters without any form of human intervention; and
(2) That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4
classifications in the State Building Code and shall be used
solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage.
2. Basements, as defined by Section 916.020.H2 of this Ordinance, shall be
subject to the following:
a. Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
b. Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry
flood proofed in accordance with Section 916.050.D3 of this
Ordinance.
3. All areas of non residential structures including basements to be placed
below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be flood proofed in
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-12
accordance with the structurally dry flood proofing classifications in the
State Building Code. Structurally dry flood proofing must meet the FP-1 or
FP-2 flood proofing classification in the State Building Code and this shall
require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components
having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and
the effects of buoyancy. Structures flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4
classification shall not be permitted.
4. When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar
material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage,
landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil
disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation
control plan must be submitted unless the community is enforcing a state
approved shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a state
approved shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to
be used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the
100-year or regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified
by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual
acceptable to the Governing Body. The plan may incorporate alternative
procedures for removal of the material from the flood plain if adequate
flood warning time exists.
5. Storage of Materials and Equipment:
a. The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding,
flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
b. Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily
removable from the area within the time available after a flood
warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the Governing
Body.
6. The provisions of Section 916.050.E of this Ordinance shall also apply.
E. Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses:
1. All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an
elevation not more than two (2) feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the Board of
Adjustment must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of
the structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate
flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-13
2. Commercial Uses - accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks,
and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by
the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of
a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the
area would be inundated to a depth and velocity such that when
multiplying the depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the
product number exceeds four (4) upon occurrence of the regional flood.
3. Manufacturing and Industrial Uses - measures shall be taken to minimize
interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having
protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards
and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set
out in Section 916.050.E2 above. In considering permit applications, due
consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business
requires that it be located in flood plain areas.
4. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected
by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria
for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain
structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation -
FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope
protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These
standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if
a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
5. Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity
of the channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse or
drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not
been specified on the Official Zoning Map.
6. Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in Section 916.090.C.
7. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited
to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement
is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for
resisting wind forces.
916.060. PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINING 1% ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD
ELEVATIONS (100-YR FLOOD ELEVATIONS) IN ZONE A.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-14
A. Reserved for Future Use
B. Procedures for determining 1% annual chance flood elevations (100-YR flood
elevations) in Zone A
1. Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within a Zone
A, the Zoning Administrator will use the 1% annual chance flood elevation
for that basin that has previously been determined in accordance with
approved FEMA methods, if available. If the 1% annual chance flood
elevation has not been previously determined, the applicant shall be
required to furnish all necessary information as deemed necessary by the
Zoning Administrator for the determination for the 1% annual chance flood
elevation in accordance with approved FEMA methods.
2. The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above
information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for
technical assistance in determining the 1% annual chance flood elevation
(100-year flood elevation). Procedures consistent with Minnesota
Regulations 1983, Parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200 and 44 Code of Federal
Regulations Part 65 shall be followed in this expert evaluation. The
designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the
proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective
Department of Natural Resources' Area Hydrologist prior to commencing
the analysis.
3. Once the 1% annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation) has
been determined, the Zoning Administrator shall process the permit
application consistent with the applicable provisions of Section 916.040
and Section 916.050 of this Ordinance.
916.070. SUBDIVISIONS.
A. Review Criteria: No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for the reason
of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. All
lots within the flood plain districts shall be able to contain a building site outside
of the Floodway District at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. All
subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that comply with
the provisions of this Ordinance and have road access both to the subdivision
and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory
flood protection elevation. For all subdivisions in the flood plain, the Floodway
and Flood Fringe District boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation
and the required elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all
required subdivision drawings and platting documents.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-15
B. Procedures for determining 1% annual chance flood elevation (100-YR flood
elevation) in Zone A: In a designated Zone A area, applicants shall provide the
information required in Section 916.060.B of this Ordinance to determine the 1%
annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation) and the regulatory flood
protection elevation for the subdivision site.
C. Removal of Special Flood Hazard Area Designation: The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special
flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill
above the 1% annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation). FEMA's
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special
flood hazard area designation will be requested.
916.080. PUBLIC UTILITIES, RAILROADS, ROADS, AND BRIDGES.
A. Public Utilities. All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer, and
water supply systems to be located in the flood plain shall be flood proofed in
accordance with the State Building Code or elevated to above the regulatory
flood protection elevation.
B. Public Transportation Facilities. Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges to be located
within the flood plain shall comply with Sections 916.040 and 916.050 of this
Ordinance. Elevation to the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be
provided where failure or interruption of these transportation facilities would result
in danger to the public health or safety or where such facilities are essential to
the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads may be
constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption of transportation
services would not endanger the public health or safety.
C. On-site Sewage Treatment and Water Supply Systems: Where public utilities
are not provided: 1) On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 2) New or
replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the
systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject to impairment or
contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment system designed
in accordance with the State's current statewide standards for on-site sewage
treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with this Section.
916.090. MANUFACTURED HOMES AND MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS AND
PLACEMENT OF RECREATIONAL VEHICLES.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-16
A. New manufactured home parks and expansions to existing manufactured home
parks shall be subject to the provisions placed on subdivisions by Section
916.070 of this Ordinance.
B. The placement of new or replacement manufactured homes in existing
manufactured home parks or on individual lots of record that are located in flood
plain districts will be treated as a new structure and may be placed only if
elevated in compliance with Section 916.050 of this Ordinance. If vehicular road
access for pre-existing manufactured home parks is not provided in accordance
with Section 916.050.E1, then replacement manufactured homes will not be
allowed until the property owner(s) develops a flood warning emergency plan
acceptable to the Governing Body.
1. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited
to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement
is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for
resisting wind forces.
C. Recreational vehicles that do not meet the exemption criteria specified in Section
916.090.C1 below shall be subject to the provisions of this Ordinance and as
specifically spelled out in Section 916.090.C3 – C4 below.
1. Exemption - Recreational vehicles are exempt from the provisions of this
Ordinance if they are placed in any of the areas listed in Section
916.090.C2 below and further they meet the following criteria:
a. Have current licenses required for highway use.
b. Are highway ready meaning on wheels or the internal jacking
system, are attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities commonly used in campgrounds and recreational vehicle
parks and the recreational vehicle has no permanent structural type
additions attached to it.
c. The recreational vehicle and associated use must be permissible
in any pre-existing, underlying zoning use district.
2. Areas Exempted For Placement of Recreational Vehicles:
a. Individual lots or parcels of record.
b. Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds.
c. Existing condominium type associations.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-17
3. Recreational vehicles exempted in Section 916.090.C1 lose this
exemption when development occurs on the parcel exceeding $500 for a
structural addition to the recreational vehicle or exceeding $500 for an
accessory structure such as a garage or storage building. The
recreational vehicle and all additions and accessory structures will then be
treated as a new structure and shall be subject to the elevation/flood
proofing requirements and the use of land restrictions specified in
Sections 4.0 and 5.0 of this Ordinance. There shall be no development or
improvement on the parcel or attachment to the recreational vehicle that
hinders the removal of the recreational vehicle to a flood free location
should flooding occur.
4. New commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds and new
residential type subdivisions and condominium associations and the
expansion of any existing similar use exceeding five (5) units or dwelling
sites shall be subject to the following:
a. Any new or replacement recreational vehicle will be allowed in the
Floodway or Flood Fringe Districts provided said recreational
vehicle and its contents are placed on fill above the regulatory flood
protection elevation and proper elevated road access to the site
exists in accordance with Section 916.050.E1 of this Ordinance.
No fill placed in the floodway to meet the requirements of this
Section shall increase flood stages of the 100-year or regional
flood.
b. All new or replacement recreational vehicles not meeting the
criteria of (a) above may, as an alternative, be allowed as a
conditional use if in accordance with the following provisions and
the provisions of 916.100.D of the Ordinance. The applicant must
submit an emergency plan for the safe evacuation of all vehicles
and people during the 100 year flood. Said plan shall be prepared
by a registered engineer or other qualified individual, shall
demonstrate that adequate time and personnel exist to carry out
the evacuation, and shall demonstrate the provisions of Section
916.090.C1 (a) and (b) of this Ordinance will be met. All attendant
sewage and water facilities for new or replacement recreational
vehicles must be protected or constructed so as to not be impaired
or contaminated during times of flooding in accordance with Section
916.080.C of this Ordinance.
916.100. ADMINISTRATION.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-18
A. Zoning Administrator. A Zoning Administrator or other official designated by the
Governing Body shall administer and enforce this Ordinance. If the Zoning
Administrator finds a violation of the provisions of this Ordinance the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the person responsible for such violation in accordance
with the procedures stated in Section 966.120 of the Ordinance.
B. Permit Requirements.

conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance shall be secured prior to
the erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation (including normal
maintenance and repair), or alteration of any building, structure, or portion
thereof; prior to the use or change of use of a building, structure, or land;
prior to the construction of a dam, fence, or on-site septic system; prior to
the change or extension of a nonconforming use; prior to the repair of a
structure that has been damaged by flood, fire, tornado, or any other
source; and prior to the placement of fill, excavation of materials, or the
storage of materials or equipment within the flood plain.
2. Application for Permit. Application for a permit shall be made in duplicate
to the Zoning Administrator on forms furnished by the Zoning
Administrator and shall include the following where applicable: plans in
duplicate drawn to scale, showing the nature, location, dimensions, and
elevations of the lot; existing or proposed structures, fill, or storage of
materials; and the location of the foregoing in relation to the stream
channel.
3. State and Federal Permits. Prior to granting a permit or processing an
application for a conditional use permit or variance, the Zoning
Administrator shall determine that the applicant has obtained all necessary
state and federal permits.
4. Certificate of Zoning Compliance for a New, Altered, or Nonconforming
Use. It shall be unlawful to use, occupy, or permit the use or occupancy of
any building or premises or part thereof hereafter created, erected,
changed, converted, altered, or enlarged in its use or structure until a
certificate of zoning compliance shall have been issued by the Zoning
Administrator stating that the use of the building or land conforms to the
requirements of this Ordinance.
5. Construction and Use to be as Provided on Applications, Plans, Permits,
Variances and Certificates of Zoning Compliance. Permits, conditional
use permits, or certificates of zoning compliance issued on the basis of
approved plans and applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and
construction set forth in such approved plans and applications, and no
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-19
other use, arrangement, or construction. Any use, arrangement, or

7. Record of First Floor Elevation. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a
record of the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new
structures and alterations or additions to existing structures in the flood
plain. The Zoning Administrator shall also maintain a record of the
elevation to which structures or alterations and additions to structures are
flood proofed.
8. Notifications for Watercourse Alterations. The Zoning Administrator shall
notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the Commissioner
of the Department of Natural Resources prior to the community
authorizing any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. If the applicant
has applied for a permit to work in the beds of public waters pursuant to
Minnesota Statute, Chapter 103G, this shall suffice as adequate notice to
the Commissioner of Natural Resources. A copy of said notification shall
also be submitted to the Chicago Regional Office of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
9. Notification to FEMA. When Physical Changes Increase or Decrease the
100-year Flood Elevation. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six
(6) months after the date such supporting information becomes available,
the Zoning Administrator shall notify the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA
of the changes by submitting a copy of said technical or scientific data.
C. Variances, Amendments, and Appeals. All amendments, appeals, and variances
to this Section (916) shall comply with the standards, provisions, requirements,

Floodplain District. The Commissioner of Natural Resources shall be
advised in writing of all decisions made regarding amendments and
variances within ten (10) days of such action.
2. No appeal, amendment, or variance shall have the effect of allowing in
any district uses prohibited in that district, permit a lower degree of flood
protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for that particular
area, or permit standards lower than those required by state law.
3. The City shall maintain a record of all appeal, amendment, and variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to the Administrator of the
National Flood Insurance Program.
4. Variances.
a. Applicant Notification. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the
applicant for a variance of the following:
(1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 or $100 of
insurance coverage; and
(2) Such construction below the 100-year or regional flood level
increases risks to life and property.
(3) Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all
variance applications.
b. Variance Criteria. The following variance criteria of the Federal
Emergency Management agency (FEMA) must be satisfied in
granting a variance to this Section, in addition to the criteria
established in Section 922:
(1) Variances shall not be issued within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the
base flood discharge would result.
(2) Variances shall only be issued upon the following:
(i) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(ii) A determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
and
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance FP, Floodplain District
916-21
(iii) A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
(3) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief.
c. Conditions Attached to Variances. In granting a variance to this
Section, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards as it deems necessary to fulfill the
purposes of this Ordinance. Violations of such conditions and

Little Canada Zoning Ordinance S, Shoreland District
917-5
4. Stairways, lifts, and landings may be either constructed above the ground on post
or pilings, or placed into the ground, provided they are designed and built in a
manner that ensures control of soil erosion;
5. Stairways, lifts, and landings must be located in the most visually inconspicuous
portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the public water assuming summer,
leaf-on conditions, whenever practical; and
6. Facilities such as ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for physically handicapped
persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore areas, provided that the
dimensional and performance standards of Sections 917.020.K.1 through
917.020.K.5 of this Ordinance are complied with in addition to the requirements
of Minnesota Regulations, Chapter 1340.
917.040. SHORELAND ALTERATIONS. Alterations of vegetation and topography will
be regulated to prevent erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland aesthetics,
preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping, and protect fish and wildlife habitat.
A. Vegetation Alterations:
1. Vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of structures and sewage
treatment systems and the construction of roads and parking areas regulated by
this Ordinance are exempt from the vegetation alteration standards that follow.
2. Removal or alteration of vegetation, except for agricultural and forest
management uses as regulated by this Ordinance is allowed subject to the
following standards:
a. Intensive vegetation clearing within the shore and bluff impact zones and
on steep slopes is not allowed. Intensive vegetation clearing for forest
land conversion to another use outside of these areas is allowable as a
conditional use if an erosion control and sedimentation plan is developed
and approved by the soil and water conservation district in which the
property is located.
b. In shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes, limited clearing of
trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning, and trimming of trees is allowed to
provide a view to the water from the principal dwelling site and to
accommodate the placement of stairways and landings, picnic areas,
access paths, beach and watercraft access areas, and permitted wateroriented
accessory structures of facilities, provided that:
(1) The screening of structures, vehicles, or other facilities as viewed
from the water, assuming summer, leaf on conditions, is not
substantially reduced;
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance S, Shoreland District
917-6
(2) The above provision is not applicable to the removal of trees,
limbs, or branches that area dead, diseased, or pose safety hazards.
B. Topographic Alterations/Grading and Filling:
1. Grading and filling and excavations necessary for the construction of structures,
sewage treatment systems, and driveways under validly issued construction
permits for these facilities do not require the issuance of a separate grading and
filling permit. However, the grading and filling standards in this section must be
incorporated into the issuance of permits for construction of structures, sewage
treatment systems, and driveways.
2. Public roads and parking areas are regulated by Section 903.050 of this
Ordinance.
3. Notwithstanding Sections 917.040.B.1 and 917.040.B.2 of this Ordinance, a
grading and filling permit will be required for:
a. The movement of more than ten (10) cubic yards of material on steep
slopes or within shore or bluff impact zones; and
b. The movement of more than fifty (50) cubic yards of material outside of
steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones.
4. The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to during the
issuance of construction permits, grading and filling permits, conditional use
permits, variances and subdivision approvals:
a. Grading or filling in any type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 wetland, as defined in
the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Circulation No. 39 (1971
Edition), must be evaluated to determine how extensively the proposed
activity would affect the following functional qualities of the wetland*:
(1) Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention;
(2) Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce flood damage;
(3) Fish and wildlife habitat;
(4) Recreational use;
(5) Shoreline or bank stabilization; and
(6) Noteworthiness, including special qualities such as historic
significance, critical habitat for endangered plants and animals, or
others.
* This evaluation must also include a determination of whether the
wetland alteration being proposed requires permits, reviews, or
approvals by other local, state, or federal agencies such as a
watershed district, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance S, Shoreland District
917-7
or the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The applicant will be
so advised.
b. Alterations must be designed and conducted in a manner that ensures only
the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest time
possible;
c. Mulches or similar materials must be used, where necessary, for
temporary bare soil coverage, and a permanent vegetation cover must be
established as soon as possible.
d. Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments before they reach
any surface water feature must be used;
e. Altered areas must be stabilized to acceptable erosion control standards
consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil and water
conservation districts and the United States Soil Conservation Service;
f. Fill or excavated material must not be placed in a manner that creates an
unstable slope;
g. Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes must be reviewed
by qualified professionals for continued slope stability and must not create
finished slopes of thirty (30) percent or greater;
h. Fill or excavated material must not be placed in bluff impacted zones;
i. Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of public waters must
first be authorized by the Commissioner under Minnesota Statutes,
Chapter 103G.241;
j. Alterations of topography must only be allowed if they are accessory to
permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent or
nearby properties; and
k. Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading of the
shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the finished
slope does not exceed three (3) feet horizontal to one foot vertical, the
landward extent of the riprap is within ten (10) feet of the ordinary high
water level, and the height of the riprap above the ordinary high water
level does not exceed three (3) feet.
C. Placement and Design of Roads, Driveways and Parking Areas:
1. Public and private roads and parking areas must be designed to take advantage of
natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening from view from
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance S, Shoreland District
917-8
public waters. Documentation must be provided by a qualified individual that all
roads and parking areas are designed and constructed to minimize and control
erosion to public waters consistent with the field office technical guides of the
local soil and water conservation district, or other applicable technical materials.
2. Roads, driveways, and parking areas must meet shoreland setbacks and must not
be placed within bluff and shore impact zones, when other reasonable and feasible
placement alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist, they may be placed within
these areas, and must be designed to minimize adverse impacts.
3. Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads, and access-related
parking areas may be placed within shore impact zones provided the vegetative
screening and erosion control conditions of this sub-part are met. For private
facilities, the grading and filling provisions of Section 917.040.B.4 of this
Ordinance must be met.
D. Storm Water Management. (The following regulations shall be applied to all land
alterations in the Shoreland District, in addition to the requirements of the Little Canada
Stormwater Ordinance, Section 927):
1. When possible, existing natural drainage ways, wetlands, and vegetated soil
surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain storm water runoff before
discharge to public waters.
2. Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will minimize the
extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential, and reduce and
delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and protected as soon as
possible in accordance with Best Management Practices. Facilities or methods
shall be used to retain sediment on the site.
3. When development density, topographic features, and soil and vegetation
conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle storm water runoff using natural
features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities such as diversions,
settling basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways, and ponds may be used.
Preference must be given to designs using surface drainage, vegetation, and
infiltration rather than buried pipes and man-made materials and facilities.
4. When constructed facilities are used for storm water management, documentation
must be provided by a qualified individual that they are designed and installed
consistent with the field office technical guide of the local soil and water
conservation districts.
5. New construction storm water outfalls to public waters must provide for filtering
or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface debris before discharge.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance S, Shoreland District
917-9
917.050. SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND
PUBLIC/SEMI-PUBLIC: Uses without water-oriented needs must be located on lots or
parcels without public waters frontage, or if located on lots or parcels with public waters
frontage, must either be set back double the normal ordinary high water level setback or be
substantially screened from view from the water by vegetation or topography, assuming summer,
leaf on conditions. Water-oriented need shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator.
917.060. CONDITIONAL USES: Conditional uses allowable within shoreland areas
shall be subject to the review and approval procedures, and criteria and conditions for review of
conditional uses established in Section 921 of this Ordinance. The following additional
evaluation criteria and conditions apply within shoreland areas:
A. Evaluation Criteria. A thorough evaluation of the waterbody and the topographic,
vegetation, and soils conditions on the site must be made to ensure:
1. The prevention of soil erosion or other possible pollution of public waters, both
during and after construction;
2. The visibility of structures and other facilities as viewed from public waters is
limited;
3. The site is adequate for water supply and on-site sewage treatment; and
4. The types, uses, and numbers of watercraft that the project will generate are
compatible in relation to the suitability of public waters to safely accommodate
these watercraft.
B. Conditions Attached to Conditional Use Permits: The City Council, upon consideration
of the criteria listed above and the purposes of this Ordinance, shall attach such
conditions to the issuance of the conditional use permits as it deems necessary to fulfill
the purposes of this Ordinance. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, the
following:
1. Increased setbacks from the ordinary high water level;
2. Limitations on the natural vegetation to be removed or the requirement that
additional vegetation be planted; and
3. Special provisions for the location, design, and use of structures, sewage
treatment systems, watercraft launching and docking areas, and vehicle parking
areas.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance S, Shoreland District
917-10
917.070. VARIANCES.
A. Variances may only be granted in accordance with Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 462, as
applicable. A variance may not circumvent the general purposes and intent of this
Ordinance. No variance may be granted that would allow any use that is prohibited in the
zoning district in which the subject property is located. Conditions may be imposed in
the granting of a variance to ensure compliance and to protect adjacent properties and the
public interest. In considering a variance request, the City Council must also consider
whether the property owner has reasonable use of the land without the variance, whether
the property is used seasonally or year-round, whether the variance is being requested
solely on the basis of economic considerations, and the characteristics of development on
adjacent properties.
B. The City Council shall hear and decide requests for variances in accordance with the
rules that it has adopted for the conduct of business. When a variance is approved after
the Department of Natural Resources has formally recommended denial in the hearing
record, the notification of the approved variance required in Section 917.090 shall also
include the City Council's summary of the public record/testimony and the findings of
facts and conclusions which supported the issuance of the variance.
917.080. SUBDIVISION/PLATTING PROVISIONS.
A. Land Suitability: Each lot created through subdivision, including planned unit
development authorized under Section 917.080 of this Ordinance, must be suitable in its
natural state for the proposed use with minimal alteration. Suitability analysis by the
local unit of government shall consider susceptibility to flooding, existence of wetlands,
soil and rock formations with severe limitations for development, severe erosion
potential, steep topography, inadequate water supply or sewage treatment capabilities,
near-shore aquatic conditions unsuitable for water-based recreation, important fish and
wildlife habitat, presence of significant historic sites, or any other feature of the natural
land likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of future residents of the

Little Canada Zoning Ordinance S, Shoreland District
917-13
determine the suitable area for the dwelling unit/dwelling site density evaluation in
Section 917.110.F of this Ordinance.
1. The project parcel must be divided into tiers by locating one or more lines
approximately parallel to a line that identifies the ordinary high water level at the
following intervals, proceeding landward.
Shoreland Tier Dimensions
Sewered
(feet)
General Development Lakes-
First Tier 200
Second and Addl. Tiers 200
Recreational Development Lakes 267
2. The suitable area within each tier is next calculated by excluding from the tier
area all wetlands, bluffs, or land below the ordinary high water level of public
waters. This suitable area and the proposed project are then subject to either the
residential or commercial planned unit development density evaluation steps to
arrive at an allowable number of dwelling units or sites.
D. Residential and Commercial PUD Density Evaluation: The procedures for determining
the "base" density of a PUD and a density increase multipliers is as follows. Allowable
densities may be transferred from any tier to any other tier further from the waterbody,
but must not be transferred to any other tier closer.
1. Residential PUD "Base" Density Evaluation.
a. The suitable area within each tier is divided by the single residential lot
size standard for lakes, unless the local unit of government has specified
an alternative minimum lot size for rivers which shall then be used to yield
a base density of dwelling units or sites for each tier. Proposed locations
and numbers of dwelling units or sites for the residential planned unit
developments are then compared with the tier, density, and suitability
analysis herein and the design criteria in Section 917.110.F of this
Ordinance.
2. Commercial PUD "Base" Density Evaluation.
a. Determine the average inside living area size of dwelling units or sites
within each tier, including both existing and proposed units and sites.
Computation of inside living area sizes need not include decks, patios,
stops, steps, garages, or porches and basements, unless they are habitable
space.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance S, Shoreland District
917-14
b. Select the appropriate floor area ratio from the following table.

1,400 .142 .072
1,500 .150 .075
* For average unit floor areas less than shown, use the floor area ratios
listed for 200 square feet. For areas greater than shown, use the ratios
listed for 1,500 square feet. For recreational camping areas, use the
ratios listed at 400 square feet. Manufactured home sites in recreational
camping areas shall use a ratio equal to the size of the manufactured
home, or if unknown, the ratio listed for 1,000 square feet.
c. Multiply the suitable area within each tier by the floor area ratio to yield
total floor area for each tier allowed to be used for dwelling units or sites.
d. Divide the total floor area by tier computed in Section 917.100.D.2.c. of
this Ordinance by the average inside living area size determined in Section
917.100.D.2.a. of this Ordinance. This yields a base number of dwelling
units and sites for each tier.
e. Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or sites for the
commercial planned unit development are then compared with the tier,
density and suitability analysis herein and the design criteria in Section
917.110.F of this Ordinance.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance S, Shoreland District
917-15
3. Density Increase Multipliers.
a. Increases to the dwelling unit or dwelling site base densities previously
determined are allowable if the dimensional standards in Section 917.020
of this Ordinance are met or exceeded and the design criteria in Section
917.110.F of this Ordinance are satisfied. The allowable density increases
in Section 917.100.D.3.b. of this Ordinance will only be allowed if
structure setbacks from the ordinary high water level are increased to at
least fifty (50) percent greater than the minimum setback, or the impact on
the waterbody is reduced an equivalent amount through vegetative
management, topography, or additional means acceptable to the City of
Little Canada and the setback is at least twenty-five (25) percent greater
than the minimum setback.
b. Allowable dwelling unit or dwelling site density increases for residential
or commercial planned unit developments:

F. Maintenance and Design Criteria.
1. Maintenance and Administration Requirements.
a. Before final approval of a planned unit development, adequate provisions
must be developed for preservation and maintenance in perpetuity of open
spaces and for the continued existence and functioning of the
development.
b. Open Space Preservation. Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent
easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective
and permanent means must be provided to ensure long-term preservation
and maintenance of open space. The instruments must include all of the
following protections:
(1) Commercial uses prohibited (for residential PUDs);
(2) Vegetation and topographic alterations other than routine
maintenance prohibited;
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance S, Shoreland District
917-16
(3) Construction of additional buildings or storage of vehicles and
other materials prohibited; and
(4) Uncontrolled beaching of watercraft prohibited.
c. Development organization and functioning. Unless an equally effective
alternative community framework is established, when applicable, all
residential planned unit developments must use an owners association
with the following features:
(1) Membership must be mandatory for each dwelling unit or site
purchaser and any successive purchasers;
(2) Each member must pay a pro rata share of the association's
expenses, and unpaid assessments can become liens on units or
sites;
(3) Assessments must be adjustable to accommodate changing
conditions; and
(4) The association must be responsible for insurance, taxes, and
maintenance of all commonly owned property and facilities.
2. Open Space Requirements. Planned unit developments must contain open space
meeting all of the following criteria:
a. At least fifty (50) percent of the total project area within the Shoreland
District must be preserved as open space;
b. Dwelling units or sites, road rights-of-way, or land covered by road
surfaces, parking areas, or structures, except water-oriented accessory
structures or facilities, are developed areas and shall not be included in the
computation of minimum open space;
c. Open space must include areas with physical characteristics unsuitable for
development in their natural state, and areas containing significant historic
sites or unplatted cemeteries;
d. Open space may include outdoor recreational facilities for use by owners
of dwelling units or sites, by guests staying in commercial dwelling units
or sites, and by the general public;
e. Open space may include subsurface sewage treatment systems if the use of
the space is restricted to avoid adverse impacts on the systems;
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance S, Shoreland District
917-17
f. Open space must not include commercial facilities or uses, but may
contain water-oriented accessory structures or facilities;
g. The appearance of open space areas, including topography, vegetation,
and allowable uses, must be preserved by use of restrictive deed
covenants, permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance, or
other equally effective and permanent means; and
h. The shore impact zone, based on normal structure setbacks, must be
included as open space. For residential PUDs, at least fifty (50) percent of
the shore impact zone area of existing developments or at least seventy
(70) percent of the shore impact zone area of new developments must be
preserved in its natural existing state. For commercial PUDs, at least fifty
(50) percent of the shore impact zone must be preserved in its natural
state.
3. Erosion Control and Storm Water Management. Erosion control, storm water
management plans, and Best Management Practices must be developed and the
PUD must:
a. Be designed, and the construction managed, to minimize the likelihood of
serious erosion occurring either during or after construction. This must be
accomplished by limiting the amount and length of time of bare ground
exposure. Temporary ground covers, sediment entrapment facilities,
vegetated buffer strips, or other appropriate techniques must be used to
minimize erosion impacts on surface water features. Erosion control plans
approved by a soil and water conservation district may be required if
project size and site physical characteristic warrant; and
b. Be designed and constructed to effectively manage reasonably expected
quantities and qualities of storm water runoff. Impervious surface
coverage within any tier must not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the
tier area, except that for commercial PUDs thirty-five (35) percent
impervious surface coverage may be allowed in the first tier of general
development lakes with an approved storm water management plan and
consistency with Section 917.030 of this Ordinance.
c. Be designed to be consistent with the City of Little Canada Erosion
Control Ordinance (Section 928) and Stormwater Ordinance (Section
927).
4. Centralization and Design of Facilities. Centralization and design of facilities and
structures must be done according to the following standards:

located on suitable areas of the development. They must be designed and
located to meet or exceed the following dimensional standards for the
relevant shoreland classification: setback from the ordinary high water
level, elevation above the surface water features, and maximum height.
Setbacks from the ordinary high water level must be increased in
accordance with Section 917.030 of this Ordinance for developments with
density increases;
c. Shore recreation facilities, including but not limited to swimming areas,
docks, and watercraft mooring areas and launching ramps, must be
centralized and located in areas suitable for them. Evaluation of suitability
must include consideration of land slope, water depth, vegetation, soils,
depth to groundwater and bedrock, or other relevant factors. The number
of spaces provided for continuous beaching, mooring, or docking of
watercraft must not exceed one for each allowable dwelling unit or site in
the first tier (notwithstanding existing mooring sites in an existing
commercially used harbor). Launching ramp facilities, including a small
dock for loading and unloading equipment, may be provided for use by
occupants of dwelling units or sites located in other tiers;
d. Structures, parking areas, and other facilities must be treated to reduce
visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by
vegetation, topography, increased setbacks, color, or other means
acceptable to the City of Little Canada, assuming summer, leaf-on
conditions. Vegetative and topographic screening must be preserved, if
existing, or may be required to be provided;
e. Accessory structures and facilities, except water oriented accessory
structures, must meet the required principal structure setback and must be
centralized; and

922. ADMINISTRATION – VARIANCES
922.010. GENERAL PROVISIONS AND STANDARDS.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to provide for the consideration of variances from
the literal provisions of this Ordinance in instances where their strict enforcement would
cause practical difficulties because of circumstances unique to the individual property
under consideration, and to grant such variances only when it is demonstrated that such
actions will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of the Ordinance.
B. The City Council shall act as the Board of Adjustment and Appeals.
C. Conditions Governing Consideration of Variance Requests:
1. In considering all requests for a variance and in taking subsequent action, the City
staff, the Planning Commission, and the City Council serving as the Board of
Adjustment and Appeals shall make a finding of fact that the proposed action will
not:
a. Impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property.
b. Unreasonably increase the congestion in the public street.
c. Increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety.
d. Unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the
neighborhood, or in any way be contrary to the intent of this Ordinance.
e. Violate the intent and purpose of the City Comprehensive Plan.
2. A variance from the terms of this Ordinance shall not be granted unless it can be
demonstrated that:
a. Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land,
structure, or building involved.
(1) Special conditions may include exceptional topographic or water
conditions or, in the case of an existing lot or parcel of record, narrowness,
shallowness, insufficient area or shape of the property.
(2) Special conditions and circumstances may not be primarily economic
in nature.
b. Literal interpretation of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the
applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same
district under the terms of this Ordinance.
c. The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of
the applicant.
d. Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any
special privilege that is denied by this Ordinance to other lands, structures,
or buildings in the same district.

application of this Ordinance so as to relieve such difficulties to the degree
considered reasonable, provided such relief may be granted without impairing the
intent of this Zoning Ordinance. However, no variance may be granted that
would have the effect of permitting a land use not allowed by the zoning district
in which the subject property is located. The Planning Commission, based upon a

923-1
923. ADMINISTRATION –PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
923.010. PURPOSE. This Ordinance is established to provide comprehensive procedures
and standards designed for both district and conditional use permit planned unit development to
allow the development of neighborhoods or portions thereof incorporating a variety of residential
types and non-residential uses. Recognizing that traditional density, bulk, setbacks, use and
subdivision regulations which may be useful in protecting the character of substantially
developed areas may be inappropriate to control development in less developed areas. Specially,
PUD is intended to encourage:
A. Innovations in residential development to the end that the growing demands for housing
at all economic levels may be met by greater variety in tenure, type, design, and siting of
dwellings and by the conservation and more efficient use of land in such developments;
B. Higher standards of site and building design through the use of trained and experienced
land planners, architects and landscape architects;
C. More convenience in location of accessory commercial and service areas;
D. The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such as natural
topography and geologic features and the prevention of soil erosion;
E. A creative use of land and related physical development which allows a phased and
orderly transition of land from rural to urban uses;
F. An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets thereby lower
housing costs and public investments;
G. A development pattern in harmony with the objectives of the City Comprehensive Plan.
H. A more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of
zoning and subdivision regulations of the City.
I. To give the landowner and developer reasonable assurance of ultimate approval before
expending complete design monies while providing City officials with assurances that the
project will retain the character envisioned at the time of concurrence.
J. To allow variation from the provisions of this Ordinance including setbacks, height, lot
area, width and depth, yards, etc.

by the petitioner that divergence from the points above will not cause an unreasonable
burden upon the City of Little Canada in providing services and utilities or cause a

f. City Council reviews all recommendations and approves/denies
application(s).
3. Optional Submission of Development Stage Plan. In cases of single stage PUDs
or where the applicant wishes to begin the first stage of a multiple stage PUD,
immediately he may, at his option, submit Development Stage Plans for the
proposed PUD simultaneously with the submission of the General Concept Plan.
In such case, the applicant shall comply with all provisions of the ordinance
applicable to submission of the Development Stage Plan. The Planning
Commission and Council shall consider such plans simultaneously and shall grant
or deny Development Stage Plan approval in accordance with the provisions of
Section 923.040.C. below.

with development in accordance with the plans as approved or shall in any other
manner fail to comply with any condition of this Ordinance or of any approval
granted pursuant to it, a General Concept Plan which has been approved and a
PUD Agreement signed by the applicant shall not be modified, revoked or
otherwise impaired pending the application for approval of Development Stage
and Final Plans by any action of the City of Little Canada without the consent of
the applicant.

within six (6) months from the date the Council grants General Concept Plan
approval, or in any case where the applicant fails to file Development Stage and
Final Plans and to proceed with development in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance and of an approved General Concept Plan, the approval may be
revoked by Council action. In such case, the Council shall forthwith adopt a
resolution repealing the General Concept Plan approval for that portion of the
PUD that has not received final approval and re-establishing the zoning and other
ordinance provisions that would otherwise be applicable. Upon application by the
applicant, the Council at its discretion may extend for additional periods not in
excess of six (6) months each, the filing deadline for any Development Stage
Plan, when, for good cause show, such extension is necessary.
C. Development Stage.
1. Purpose. The purpose of the Development Stage Plan is to provide a specific and
particular plan upon which the Planning Commission will base its
recommendation to the Council and with which substantial compliance is
necessary for the preparation of the Final Plan.

soils engineering or geology report. The report shall include the
following as requested by the City.
(1) Data and information obtained from the requested site
investigation.
(2) A description of the types, composition, permeability,
stability, erodibility and distribution of existing soils on
site.
(3) A description of site geology.
(4) Conclusions and revisions, if any, to the proposed landdisturbing
activity at the site or the erosion control plan,
including revisions of plans and specifications.
c. The SWPPP shall be modified when there is a change in design,
operation, maintenance, weather or seasonal conditions that have a
significant effect on discharge and/or inspections indicate that the
plan is not effective and existing BMPs are not controlling
pollutants and discharges from the site.
C. SWPPP Performance Standards and Design Criteria. All SWPPPs shall be
reviewed by the City for effectiveness of erosion and sediment control measures
in the context of the site topography and drainage. Proposed design, suggested
location and phased implementation of effective, practicable stormwater pollution
prevention measures for SWPPPs shall be designed, engineered and implemented
using the following performance standards and design criteria.
1. Runoff easements - If a stormwater management plan involves directing
some or all runoff from the site, the applicant shall obtain from adjacent
property owners any necessary easements or other property interests
concerning flowage of water.
2. Scheduling site activities - The applicant shall schedule site activities to
lessen their impact on erosion and sediment creation.
3. Minimize exposed soil - The applicant shall minimize the amount of
exposed soil. Mass grading should be avoided and sequencing promoted.
4. Perimeter sediment controls - Perimeter sediment control measures shall
be properly installed by the builder before construction activity begins.
Such structures may be adjusted during dry weather to accommodate short
term activities, such as those that require very large vehicles. As soon as
this activity is finished or before rainfall, the erosion and sediment control
structures must be returned to the configuration specified by the City. A
sediment control inspection as part of the footing inspection will be done.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Erosion Control Ordinance
927-7
5. Channel protection - Channels shall be diverted around disturbed areas if
practical, or other channel protection measures will be required. The
normal wetted perimeter of any temporary or permanent drainage channel
must be stabilized within 200 lineal feet from the property edge, or from a
point of discharge to any surface water. Stabilization must be completed
within 24 hours of connecting to surface water. Sediment control is
required along channel edges to reduce sediment reaching channel.
6. Outlet Protection- pipe outlets must have energy dissipation installed
within 24 hours of connection to a surface water.
7. Erosion and sediment control methods - The applicant shall control runoff
as follows (a and b or a and c):
a. All exposed soil areas with a continuous positive slope that are
within 200 lineal feet of any surface water, or any conveyance
(curb, gutter, storm sewer inlet, drainage ditch, etc.) to a surface
water, must have temporary or permanent cover year round. The
area shall be stabilized if it has not been worked for seven (7) days
on slopes greater than three feet horizontal to one foot vertical
(3:1), fourteen (14) days on slopes ranging from 3:1 to 10:1 and
twenty-one (21) days for flatter slopes. On sensitive sites exposed
soil areas with a greater than three feet horizontal to one foot
vertical (3:1) shall be stabilized in three (3) days and all other cases
seven (7) days. All exposed soil areas must have temporary
erosion protection or permanent cover no later than November 1st
regardless of the stabilization requirements listed above. All
exposed soils from construction activities taking place after
November 1st must provide temporary erosion protection or
permanent cover by the end of the work day.
b. If more than 10 acres are disturbed and drained to a single point of
discharge temporary sediment basins must be installed. When site
restrictions do not allow for a temporary sediment basin,
equivalent measures such as smaller basins, check dams, and
vegetated buffer strips can be included.
c. For disturbed areas less than ten (10) acres sedimentation basins
are encouraged, but not required. The applicant shall install erosion
and sediment controls at locations directed by the City. Minimum
requirements include silt fences, rock check dams, or other
equivalent control measures along slopes. Silt fences, rock check
dams, etc. must be regularly inspected and maintained.
8. Sediment basins related to impervious surface area - Where a project’s
ultimate development replaces surface vegetation with one or more
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Erosion Control Ordinance
927-8
cumulative acres of impervious surface, and all runoff has not been
accounted for in a City’s existing stormwater management plan or
practice, runoff from the 2 ½-inch 24-hour storm event shall be treated.
9. Silt fence – Silt fence shall be properly installed by being trenched and
buried at least six inches into the soil. Generally, sufficient silt fence will
be required to contain sheet flow runoff generated at an individual site.
10. Stockpile protections - For soil stockpiles greater than ten (10) cubic yards
the toe of the pile must be more than twenty-five (25) feet from a road,
drainage channel or stormwater inlet. If left for more than seven (7) days,
they must be stabilized with mulch, vegetation, tarps or other means. If
left for less than seven (7) days, erosion from stockpiles must be
controlled with perimeter control devices such as silt fence. If for any
reason a soil stockpile is located closer than twenty-five (25) feet from a
road, drainage channel or stormwater inlet, it must be controlled with
perimeter control devices immediately.
11. Vehicle entrances - Temporary rock construction entrances must be
installed and maintained wherever vehicles enter and exit a site. The
design of this entrance shall take into consideration the amount of traffic
that will be entering and exiting the site. Construction entrances shall be
stabilized with 1-1/2” –3” clear aggregate or an approved equal. On sites
with high traffic, the City may require wash racks, wash ponds or other
means of minimizing sediment leaving the site.
12. Street cleaning - Streets shall be cleaned and swept by the conclusion of
each day or as directed by the City and before sites are left idle for
weekends and holidays. If street sweeping is not being completed as
described the City shall have the right to complete the sweeping and bill
all associated costs back to the owner.
13. Dewatering treatment required – Sediment laden water that is being
removed from the site by pumping or trenching shall be treated to remove
a minimum of 80 percent removal of suspended solids before discharge.
Water may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion to receiving
channels or flooding of the discharge site.
14. Storm drain protection - All storm drain inlets shall be protected during
construction with control measures as approved by the City. These
devices shall remain in place until final stabilization of the site. A regular
inspection and maintenance plan shall be developed and implemented to
assure these devices are operational at all times. Storm drain protection
devices along with all erosion control measures shall be inspected by the
developer or his assignees a rainfall.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Erosion Control Ordinance
927-9
D. Applicant inspections and maintenance - The applicant shall be responsible for
inspections and maintenance on the site.
1. Inspections and maintenance must be documented and readily available
for review. Inspections are required as follows:
a. Once every 7 days on exposed soil areas.
b. Within 24 hours after a one half inch rain event over 24 hours.
c. Once every 30 days on stabilized areas.
d. As soon as runoff occurs or prior to resuming construction on
frozen ground.
2. Maintenance is required as follows:
a. When sediment reaches 1/3 the height of the BMP on perimeter
control devices, sediment must be removed within 24 hours.
b. If the perimeter control device is not functional it must be repaired
or replaced within 24 hours.
c. Temporary sediment basins shall be maintained when sediment
reaches ½ the outlet height or ½ the basin storage volume. Basin
must be drained or sediment removed within 72 hours.
d. Construction site vehicle entrance and exit locations sediment must
be removed from paved surfaces within 24 hours of discovery.
E. Review – The City shall complete a review the SWPPP concurrent with the
grading and erosion control plan from the developer.
1. Permit Required - Prior to commencement of any work, written
documentation of approval of the SWPPP must be gained.
2. Denial - If the City of Little Canada determines that the SWPPP does not
meet the requirements of this ordinance, the City shall not issue a permit
for the land disturbance activity. The SWPPP must be resubmitted for
approval before the land disturbance activity begins. All land use and
building permits shall be suspended until the developer has an approved
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan.
3. City inspections and enforcement - The City of Little Canada shall
conduct inspections on a regular basis to ensure that erosion and sediment
control measures are properly installed and maintained. In all cases the
inspectors will attempt to work with the builder or developer to maintain
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Erosion Control Ordinance
927-10
proper erosion and sediment control at all sites. A charge will be assessed
for any inspections pursuant to fees approved by the fee schedule annually
adopted by the City Council that are necessary. In cases where cooperation
is withheld, construction stop work orders shall be issued by the City, until
erosion and sediment control measures meet the requirements of this
ordinance. An inspection must follow before work can commence.
Inspections are required as follows:
a. For residential construction, at the time of footing inspections
b. At the completion of the project
c. Prior to the release of financial securities
F. Modification of Plan. The applicant must amend the SWPPP as necessary to
include additional requirements such as additional or modified BMPs designed to
correct problems identified or address situations whenever:
1. A change in design, construction, operation, maintenance, weather, or
seasonal conditions that has a significant effect on the discharge of
pollutants to surface waters or underground waters.
2. Inspections indicate the SWPPP is not effective in eliminating or
significantly minimizing the discharge of pollutants to surface waters or
underground waters or that the discharges are causing water quality
standard exceedances.
3. The SWPPP is not achieving the general objectives of controlling
pollutants or is not consistent with the terms and conditions of this permit.
G. Variance Requests. The City may grant a variance on a case-by-case basis. The
content of a variance shall be specific, and shall not affect other approved
provisions of a SWPPP.
1. The variance request shall be in writing and include the reason for
requesting the variance.
2. Economic hardship is not sufficient reason for granting a variance.
3. The City shall respond to the variance request in writing and include the
justification for granting or denying the request.
a. Financial Securities. If financial security is not required by
development agreement, then the applicant shall provide security
for the performance of the work described and delineated on the
approved Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan and related
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Erosion Control Ordinance
927-11
remedial work. The amount shall be defined in the City of Little
Canada Fee Schedule.
This security shall save the City of Little Canada free and harmless
from all suits or claims for damages resulting from the negligent
grading, removal, placement or storage of rock, sand, gravel, soil
or other like material within the city.
H. Maintaining the Financial Security. If at anytime during the course of the work
this amount falls below 50% of the required deposit, the City may require the
developer to make another deposit in the amount necessary to restore the cash
deposit to the required amount. If the applicant does not bring the financial
security back up to the required amount within seven (7) days after notification by
the City that the amount has fallen below 50% of the required amount the City
may:
1. Withhold inspections - Withhold the scheduling of inspections and/or the
issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.
2. Revocation of permits - Revoke any permit issued by the City of Little
Canada to the applicant for the site in question or any other of the
applicant’s sites within the City’s jurisdiction.
I. Action Against the Financial Security. The City may access financial security for
remediation actions if any of the conditions listed below exist. The City of Little
Canada shall use the security to finance remedial work undertaken by the City, or
a private contractor under contract to the City, and to reimburse the City for all
direct cost incurred in the process of remedial work including, but not limited to,
staff time and attorney’s fees.
1. Abandonment - The developer ceases land disturbing activities and/or
filling and abandons the work site prior to completion of the grading plan.
2. Failure to implement SWPPP - The developer fails to conform to the
grading plan and/or the SWPPP as approved by the City of Little Canada.
3. Failure to perform - The techniques utilized under the SWPPP fail within
one year of installation.
4. Failure to reimburse City - The developer fails to reimburse the City of
Little Canada for corrective action taken.
J. Emergency Action. If circumstances exist such that noncompliance with this
ordinance poses an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare, as
determined by the City of Little Canada, the City may take emergency
preventative action. Any cost to the City may be recovered from the applicant’s
financial security.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Erosion Control Ordinance
927-12
K. Returning the Financial Security. The security deposited with the City for faithful
performance of the SWPPP and any related remedial work shall be released one
full year after the completion of the installation of all stormwater pollution control
measures as shown on the grading and/or the SWPPP and vegetation has been
established on the entire site. No interest shall accrue or be paid to the applicant.
L. Notification of Failure of the SWPPP. The City shall notify the permit holder of
the failure of the SWPPP’s measures.
1. Initial contact. The initial contact will be to the party or parties listed on
the application and/or the SWPPP as contacts. Except during an
emergency action, forty-eight (48) hours after notification by the City or
seventy-two (72) hours after the failure of erosion control measures,
whichever is less, the City at its discretion, may begin corrective work.
Such notification should be in writing, but if it is verbal, a written
notification should follow as quickly as practical. If after making a good
faith effort to notify the responsible party or parties, the City has been
unable to establish contact, the City may proceed with corrective work.
There are conditions when time is of the essence in controlling erosion.
During such a condition the City may take immediate action, and then
notify the applicant as soon as possible.
2. Erosion off-site. If erosion breaches the perimeter of the site, the applicant
shall immediately develop a cleanup and restoration plan, obtain the rightof-
entry from the adjoining property owner, and implement the cleanup
and restoration plan within forty-eight (48) hours of obtaining the
adjoining property owner’s permission. In no case, unless written approval
is received from the City, may more than seven (7) calendar days go by
without corrective action being taken. If in the discretion of the City, the
permit holder does not repair the damage caused by the erosion, the City
may do the remedial work required. When restoration to wetlands and
other resources are required, the applicant should be required to work with
the appropriate agency to ensure that the work is done properly.
3. Erosion into streets, wetlands or water bodies. If eroded soils (including
tracked soils from construction activities) enter or appear likely to enter
streets, wetlands, or other water bodies, cleanup and repair shall be
immediate. The applicant shall provide all traffic control and flagging
required to protect the traveling public during the cleanup operations.
927.040. FAILURE TO DO CORRECTIVE WORK.
A. Failure to do corrective work. When an applicant fails to conform to any
provision of this policy within the time stipulated, the City may take the following
actions.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Erosion Control Ordinance
927-13
a. Issue a stop work order, withhold the scheduling of inspections, and/or the
issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.
b. Revoke any approval granted by the City to the applicant for the site in
question or any other of the applicant’s sites with in the City’s jurisdiction.
c. Correct the deficiency or hire a contractor to correct the deficiency. The
approval of the plan constitutes a right-of-entry for the City or its
contractor to enter upon the construction site for the purpose of correcting
deficiencies in erosion control.
d. Require reimbursement to the City for all costs incurred in correcting
stormwater pollution control deficiencies. If payment is not made within
thirty (30) days after costs are incurred by the City, payment will be made
from the applicant’s financial securities as described in Section G above.
e. If there is an insufficient financial amount in the applicant’s financial
securities as described in Section G above then the City may assess the
remaining amount against the property. As a condition of the permit, the
owner shall waive notice of any assessment hearing to be conducted by the
City, concur that the benefit to the property exceeds the amount of the
proposed assessment, and waive all rights by virtue of Minnesota Statute
429.081 to challenge the amount or validity of assessment.
927.050. ENFORCEMENT.
A. The City or its designee shall be responsible for enforcing this ordinance.
1. This Ordinance shall be administered and enforced by the Zoning
Administrator who is appointed by the City Council. This Zoning
Administrator may institute in the name of the City of Little Canada any
appropriate actions or proceedings against a violator as provided by
statute, charter, or ordinance.
2. The City Administrator or designee (including, but not limited to a Code
Enforcement Officer, Zoning Administrator, Sheriff, or other person)
may issue a citation for violation of any of the provisions of this
Ordinance. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this
Ordinance shall be guilty, upon conviction, of a misdemeanor and shall
be fined not more than the maximum penalty for a misdemeanor
prescribed under state law. Each day that a violation is permitted to exist
shall constitute a separate offense.
927.060. RIGHT OF ENTRY AND INSPECTION.

APPENDIX A—GENERAL
A. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
All requirements in this Appendix are in addition to BMPs already specified in the ordinance.
Where provisions of Appendix A conflict with requirements elsewhere in the ordinance, the
provisions in Appendix A take precedence. All BMPs used to comply with this Appendix
must be documented in the SWPPP for the project.
B. REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCHARGING TO WETLANDS
If the project has any storm water discharges with the potential for significant adverse
impacts to a wetland (e.g., conversion of a natural wetland to a storm water pond), the
Permittee(s) must demonstrate that the wetland mitigative sequence has been followed in
accordance with D.1 or D.2 of this appendix.
1. If the potential adverse impacts to a wetland on a specific project site have been
addressed by permits or other approvals from an official statewide program (U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers 404 program, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, or the
State of Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act) that are issued specifically for the project
and project site, the Permittee may use the permit or other determination issued by these
agencies to show that the potential adverse impacts have been addressed. For the
purposes of this permit, deminimus actions are determinations by the permitting agency
that address the project impacts, whereas a non-jurisdictional determination does not
address project impacts.
2. If there are impacts from the project that are not addressed in one of the permits or other
determinations discussed in Appendix A, Part D.1 (e.g., permanent inundation or
flooding of the wetland, significant degradation of water quality, excavation, filling,
draining), the Permittee must minimize all adverse impacts to wetlands by utilizing
appropriate measures. Measures used must be based on the nature of the wetland, its
vegetative community types and the established hydrology. These measures include in
order of preference:
a. Avoid all significant adverse impacts to wetlands from the project and post project
discharge.
b. Minimize any unavoidable impacts from the project and post project discharge.
c. Provide compensatory mitigation when the Permittee determines that there is no
reasonable and practicable alternative to having a significant adverse impact on a
wetland. For compensatory mitigation, wetland restoration or creation shall be of
the same type, size and whenever reasonable and practicable in the same watershed
as the impacted wetland.
E. DISCHARGES REQUIRING ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
This permit does not replace or satisfy any environmental review requirements, including
those under the Minnesota Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) or the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA). The owner must complete any environmental review required by law,
including any required Environmental Assessment Work Sheets or Environmental Impact
Statements, Federal environmental review, or other required review.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Erosion Control Ordinance
927-16
F. DISCHARGES AFFECTING ENDANGERED OR THREATENED SPECIES
This permit does not replace or satisfy any review requirements for Endangered or
Threatened species, from new or expanded discharges that adversely impact or contribute to
adverse impacts on a listed endangered or threatened species or adversely modify a
designated critical habitat. The owner must conduct any required review and coordinate with
appropriate agencies for any project with the potential of affecting threatened or endangered
species, or their critical habitat.
G. DISCHARGES AFFECTING HISTORIC PLACES OR ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES
This permit does not replace or satisfy any review requirements for Historic Places or
Archeological Sites, from new or expanded discharges which adversely affect properties
listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or affecting known or
discovered Archeological Sites. The owner must be in compliance with National Historic
Preservation Act and conduct all required review and coordination related to historic
preservation, including significant anthropological sites and any burial sites, with the
Minnesota Historic Preservation Officer.

2. "Best Management Practices (BMPs)" means erosion and sediment control and water
quality management practices that are the most effective and practicable means of
controlling, preventing, and minimizing degradation of surface water, including avoidance
of impacts, construction-phasing, minimizing the length of time soil areas are exposed,
prohibitions, and other management practices published by state or designated area-wide
planning agencies.
Individual BMPs found in this permit are described in the current version of Protecting
Water Quality in Urban Areas, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency 2000. BMPs must be
adapted to the site and can be adopted from other sources. However, they must be similar in
purpose and at least as effective and stringent as MPCA’s BMPs. (Other sources include
manufacturers specifications, Storm Water Management for Construction Activities:
Developing Pollution Prevention Plans and Best Management Practices, U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency 1992, and Erosion Control Design Manual, Minnesota
Department of Transportation, et al, 1993).
3. “Commissioner” means the Commissioner of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency or
the Commissioner's designee.
4. “Common Plan of Development or Sale” means a contiguous area where multiple separate
and distinct land disturbing activities may be taking place at different times, on different
schedules, but under one proposed plan. One plan is broadly defined to include design,
permit application, advertisement or physical demarcation indicating that land-disturbing
activities may occur.
5. "Construction Activity" For this permit, construction activity includes construction
activity as defined in 40 C.F.R. part 122.26(b)(14)(x) and small construction activity as
defined in 40 C.F.R. part 122.26(b)(15). This includes a disturbance to the land that results in
a change in the topography, existing soil cover (both vegetative and non-vegetative), or the
existing soil topography that may result in accelerated storm water runoff, leading to soil
erosion and movement of sediment into surface waters or drainage systems. Examples of
construction activity may include clearing, grading, filling and excavating. Construction
activity includes the disturbance of less than one acre of total land area that is a part of a
larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately
disturb one (1) acre or more.
6. “Dewatering” means the removal of water for construction activity. It can be a discharge
of appropriated surface or groundwater to dry and/or solidify a construction site. It may
require Minnesota Department of Natural Resources permits to be appropriated and if
contaminated may require other MPCA permits to be discharged.
7. "Energy Dissipation" means methods employed at pipe outlets to prevent erosion. Examples
include, but are not limited to: concrete aprons, riprap, splash pads, and gabions that are
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Erosion Control Ordinance

a. All soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and a uniform (e.g., evenly
distributed, without large bare areas) perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70% of
the native background vegetative cover for the area has been established on all unpaved
areas and areas not covered by permanent structures, or equivalent permanent
stabilization measures (such as the use of riprap, gabions, or geotextiles) have been
employed;
b. For individual lots in residential construction by either: (a) The homebuilder completing
final stabilization as specified above, or (b) the homebuilder establishing temporary
stabilization including perimeter controls for an individual lot prior to occupation of the
home by the homeowner and informing the homeowner of the need for, and benefits of,
final stabilization. (Homeowners typically have an incentive to put in the landscaping
functionally equivalent to final stabilization as quick as possible to keep mud out of their
homes and off sidewalks and driveways.); or
c. For construction projects on land used for agricultural purposes (e.g., pipelines across
crop or range land) final stabilization may be accomplished by returning the disturbed
land to its preconstruction agricultural use. Areas disturbed that were not previously used
for agricultural activities, such as buffer strips immediately adjacent to surface waters
and drainage systems, and areas which are not being returned to their preconstruction
agricultural use must meet the final stabilization criteria in (a) or (b) above.
10. "General Contractor" means the party who signs the construction contract with the
applicant to construct the project described in the final plans and specifications. Where the
construction project involves more than one contractor, the general contractor will be the
party responsible for managing the project on behalf of the applicant. In some cases, the
applicant may be the general contractor. In these cases, the applicant may contract an
individual as the operator who would become the Co-Permittee.
11. “Homeowner Factsheet” means a fact sheet developed by the MPCA to be given to
homeowners at the time of sale by a builder to inform the homeowner of the need for, and
benefits of, final stabilization.
12. "Impervious Surface" means a constructed hard surface that either prevents or retards the
entry of water into the soil and causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities and at
an increased rate of flow than prior to development. Examples include rooftops, sidewalks,
patios, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, and concrete, asphalt, or gravel roads.
13. "National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)" means the program for
issuing, modifying, revoking, reissuing, terminating, monitoring, and enforcing permits under
the Clean Water Act (Sections 301, 318, 402, and 405) and United States Code of Federal
Regulations Title 33, Sections 1317, 1328, 1342, and 1345..
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Erosion Control Ordinance
927-19
14. “Normal Wetted Perimeter” means the area of a conveyance, such as a ditch, channel, or
pipe that is in contact with water during flow events that are expected to occur once every
year.
15. "Notice of Termination" means notice to terminate coverage under this permit after
construction is complete, the site has undergone final stabilization, and maintenance
agreements for all permanent facilities have been established, in accordance with all
applicable conditions of this permit. Notice of Termination forms are available from the
MPCA.
16. “Operator” means the person (usually the general contractor), designated by the applicant,
who has day to day operational control and/or the ability to modify project plans and
specifications related to the SWPPP. The person must be knowledgeable in those areas of
the permit for which the operator is responsible, (Part II.B. and Part IV.) and must perform
those responsibilities in a workmanlike manner.
17. "Permanent Cover" means final stabilization. Examples include grass, gravel, asphalt, and
concrete.
18. "Permittee" means a person or persons, firm, or governmental agency or other institution that
signs the application submitted to the MPCA and is responsible for compliance with the
terms and conditions of this permit.
19. “Saturated Soil” means the highest seasonal elevation in the soil that is in a reduced
chemical state because of soil voids being filled with water. Saturated soil is evidenced by
the presence of redoximorphic features or other information.
20. "Sediment Control" means methods employed to prevent sediment from leaving the site.
Sediment control practices include silt fences, sediment traps, earth dikes, drainage swales,
check dams, subsurface drains, pipe slope drains, storm drain inlet protection, and temporary
or permanent sedimentation basins.
21. “Small Construction Activity” means small construction activity as defined in 40 C.F.R.
part 122.26(b)(15) . Small construction activities include clearing, grading and excavating
that result in land disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and less than five acres.
Small construction activity includes the disturbance of less than one (1) acre of total land
area that is part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan
will ultimately disturb equal to or greater than one and less than five (5) acres.
22. "Stabilized" means the exposed ground surface has been covered by appropriate materials
such as mulch, staked sod, riprap, wood fiber blanket, or other material that prevents erosion

B. Stormwater Management Performance Standards and Design Criteria
The applicant shall consider reducing the need for stormwater management
performance standards by incorporating the use of natural topography and land
cover such as natural swales and depressions as they exist before development to
the degree that they can accommodate the additional flow of water without
compromising the integrity or quality of the receiving waterbody. The
development shall minimize impact to significant natural features. Review the
site for steep slopes (greater than 12%), wetlands, wooded areas of significance,
rare and endangered species habitat, areas designated by the County Biological
Survey, metro greenways, or County parks and open space. These areas should
not be developed. The development shall limit impervious surface coverage.
Impervious surface coverage of a site shall not exceed that allowed by City
Ordinance. Proposed design, suggested location and phased implementation of
effective, practicable stormwater management measures for plans shall be
designed, engineered and implemented to achieve the following results:
1. Volume Control - Stormwater runoff volume retention shall be achieved
onsite in the amount equivalent to the runoff generated from a one inch
rainfall over the impervious surfaces of the development for new
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Stormwater Management
928-7
development and from a half inch rainfall over the impervious surfaces of
the development for redevelopment. The required stormwater runoff
volume reduction shall be calculated as follows:
New Development
Required Volume (ft3) = Impervious surfaces (ft2) x 1.0 (in) x 0.9 coefficient x 1/12 (ft/in)
Redevelopment
Required Volume (ft3) = Impervious surfaces (ft2) x 0.5 (in) x 0.9 coefficient x 1/12 (ft/in)
a. When using infiltration for volume reduction, the following
requirements must be met:
(1) Infiltration volumes and facility sizes shall be calculated
using the appropriate hydrological soil group classification
and design infiltration rate from Table 1. Select the design
infiltration rate from Table 1 based on the least permeable
soil horizon within the first five feet below the bottom
elevation of the proposed infiltration BMP.
(2) The applicant may complete double-ring infiltrometer test
measurements at the proposed bottom elevation of the
infiltration BMP to the requirements of ASTM D3385. The
measured infiltration rate shall be divided by the
appropriate correction factor selected from the Minnesota
Stormwater Manual. This test must be completed by a
licensed soil scientist or engineer.
(3) The infiltration area shall be capable of infiltrating the
required volume within 48 hours for surface and subsurface
BMPs.
(4) Infiltration areas shall be limited to the horizontal areas
subject to prolonged wetting.

(5) Areas of permanent pools tend to lose infiltration capacity
over time and shall not be accepted as an infiltration
practice.
(6) Stormwater runoff must be pretreated to remove solids
before discharging to infiltration areas to maintain the long
term viability of the infiltration areas.
(7) Design and placement of infiltration BMPs shall be done in
accordance with the Minnesota Department of Health
guidance called “Evaluating Proposed Stormwater
Infiltration Projects in Vulnerable Wellhead Protection
Areas.” (Final version to govern.)
(8) Specific site conditions may make infiltration difficult,
undesirable, or impossible. Some of these conditions are
listed in Table 2 and may qualify the applicant for
Alternative Compliance Sequencing. The applicant may
also submit a request to the City for Alternative
Compliance Sequencing for site conditions not listed
below. All requests shall indicate the specific site
conditions present and a grading plan, utility plan, and the
submittal requirement listed in the table below.

Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Stormwater Management
928-9
2. Water Quality - Developments must incorporate effective non-point
source pollution reduction BMPs to achieve 90% (new construction) or
45% (redevelopment) total suspended solids removal from the runoff
generated by a NURP water quality storm (2.5” rainfall). Runoff volume
reduction requirement may be considered and included in the
calculations showing compliance with achieving the 90% TSS and/or
45% TSS removal requirement. Water quality calculations,
documentation and/or water quality modeling shall be submitted to
verify compliance with the standard.
3. Runoff rate control – hydrologic calculations - A hydrograph method
based on sound hydrologic theory shall be used to analyze runoff for the
design or analysis of flows and water levels..
4. Runoff rate control - design standards - Runoff rates for the proposed
activity shall not exceed existing runoff rates for the 2-year, 10-year, and
100-year critical storm events, and runoff rates may be restricted to less
than the existing rates when the capacity of downstream conveyance
systems is limited.
5. Outlets - Discharges from new construction sites must have a stable
outlet capable of carrying designed flow at a non-erosive velocity.
Outlet design must consider flow capacity and flow duration. This
requirement applies to both the site outlet and the ultimate outlet to
stormwater conveyance or waterbody.
6. Pond Requirements – For all projects creating more than one acre of
impervious surface, ponding shall be required. At a minimum all pond
design specifications shall conform to the current City and NPDES
construction permit requirements. In addition the following are required:
a. A bench shall be provided starting at the normal water level and
ending 1 foot below normal water level with side slopes no less
than 10 feet horizontal to 1 foot vertical (10:1) for safety
considerations. Pond side slopes shall not exceed 4 feet horizontal
to 1 foot vertical (4:1) without approval of the City.
b. All public and private owned stormwater management facilities
shall provide an unobstructed access path (minimum of 10 feet)
capable of supporting light truck traffic during normal weather for
the purpose of conducting inspections of the facility and
maintenance thereof. No private stormwater facility may be
approved unless an easement is provided to the City allowing
access for maintenance and inspection. Maintenance agreements
before, during, and after development are also required.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Stormwater Management
928-10
c. To provide proper protection for adjacent property within the first
tier from the pond, the design storm interval for the ponding area is
a 100-year, 24-hour storm with correctly sized conveyances for
100-yr, 24-hour storm flows consistent with standards used by the
City in planning for the flood protection of homes and public
facilities.
7. Floodplain - No person or political subdivision shall alter or fill land
below the 100-year flood elevation of any water body, public water, or
public water wetland without first obtaining a permit from the Watershed
District.
a. Placement of fill within the 100-year floodplain is prohibited
unless compensatory storage is provided. Compensatory storage
must be provided on the development or immediately adjacent to
the development within the affected floodplain.
Compensatory storage shall result in the creation of floodplain
storage to fully offset the loss of floodplain storage.
Compensatory storage shall be created prior to or concurrently to
the permitted floodplain filling.
b. All habitable buildings, roads, and underground parking structures
on or adjacent to a project site shall comply with the following
flood control and freeboard requirements:

c. For water bodies without a piped outlet:
(1) The normal water level of a water body without a piped
outlet shall be determined by a qualified licensed geologist
or hydrogeologist. A ground water analysis using existing
or installed monitoring wells on or near the site and soil
conditions in the basin shall be used. Ideally, the peak
groundwater elevation over a continuous three-year
monitoring period shall be considered the normal water
level of a basin without a piped outlet, provided soil
conditions allow full drainage of recent storm event within
48 hours.
(2) For existing water bodies without piped outlets, mottled
soils may be considered in establishing a water body’s
normal water level in lieu of groundwater analysis.
(3) An emergency response plan shall be developed for
addressing potential flooding in homes below the overland
emergency overflow swale around each water body without
a piped outlet. The plans shall be adopted by the City and
be included in a maintenance agreement for the
development.
d. For underground parking structures:
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Stormwater Management
928-12
(1) Underground parking structures shall be flood protected to
minimize impacts from high groundwater during flood
events.
(2) All drainage structures within underground parking shall
include an anti-backflow device to prevent stormwater
from surcharging into the area.
Emergency overflow swales or areas shall be constructed to
convey the peak 100-year discharge from each water body
to the next downstream water body and away from
buildings.
8. Minimum Protection for Rivers, Lakes and Wetlands - Rivers, streams,
lakes, and wetlands shall be protected from runoff generated during
construction and after completion of the development. Runoff shall not
be discharged directly into wetlands without appropriate quality and
quantity runoff control, depending on the individual wetland’s vegetation.
Wetlands must not be drained or filled, wholly or partially, unless
replaced by either restoring or creating wetland areas of at least equal
public value. Compensation, including the replacement ratio and quality
of replacement should be consistent with the requirements outlined in the
Board of Water and Soil Resources rules that implement the Minnesota
Wetland Conservation Act 1991 including any and all amendments to it.
a. Buffer protection for Rivers, Streams, Lakes, and Wetlands –
Buffers shall meet those required by the Watershed District
guidelines. The City may allow buffer area averaging in cases
where averaging will provide additional protection to either the
resource or environmentally valuable adjacent upland habitat,
provided that the resources total buffer area remains the same.
Care should be taken in averaging so that the buffers usefulness is
not short circuited. Detailed buffer design is site specific, and
therefore, the City can require a larger buffer than the minimum
specified.
C. Stormwater and Urban Runoff Pollution Control
1. Illegal Disposal
a. No person shall throw, deposit, place, leave, maintain, or keep or
permit to be thrown, placed, left, maintained or kept, any refuse,
rubbish, garbage, or any other discarded or abandoned objects,
articles, or accumulations, in or upon any street, alley, sidewalk,
storm drain, inlet, catch basin conduit or drainage structure,
business place, or upon any public or private plot of land in City,
so that the same might be or become a pollutant, except in
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Stormwater Management
928-13
containers, recycling bags, or other lawfully established waste
disposal facility.
b. No person shall intentionally dispose of grass, leaves, dirt, or other
landscape debris into a water resource buffer, street, road, alley,
catch basin, culvert, curb, gutter, inlet, ditch, natural watercourse,
flood control channel, canal, storm drain or any fabricated natural
conveyance.
2. Illicit Discharges and Connections
a. Connection to the City’s MS4 System.
(1) New direct connections and replacement of existing
connections shall be completed using a method that is
approved by the City.
(2) Peak flow rate, the total volume of flow, and the timing of
the flow for new connections must be managed to not cause
new water conveyance problems.
b. Discharge Prohibitions.
(1) Prohibition of Illegal Discharges. No person shall discharge
or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain
system or watercourses any materials, including but not
limited to pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation
of applicable water quality standards, other than storm
water.
(2) Prohibition of Illicit Connections. The construction, use,
maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to
the storm drain system without a City permit is prohibited.
(i) This prohibition expressly includes, without
limitation, illicit connections made in the past,
regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or
prevailing at the time of connection.
(ii) A person is considered to be in violation of this
Rule if the person connects a line conveying sewage
to the City’s MS4, or allows such a connection to
continue.
c. Suspension of MS4 Access.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Stormwater Management
928-14
(1) Suspension due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency
Situations. The City may, without prior notice, suspend
MS4 discharge access when such suspension is necessary
to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or
may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to
the City’s MS4 or Waters of the United States. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in
an emergency, the City may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the City’s
MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger
to persons or the environment.
(2) Suspension due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any
person discharging to the City’s MS4 in violation of this
Rule may have their MS4 access terminated if such
termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
City shall notify a violator of the proposed termination of
its MS4 access. The violator may petition the City for a
reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense
subject to enforcement if the person reinstates MS4 access
to facilities terminated pursuant to this Section, without the
prior approval of the City.
d. Monitoring of Discharges.
(1) Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have
storm water discharges associated with industrial activity,
including construction activity.
(2) Access to Facilities.
(a) The City shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this Rule as
often as may be necessary to determine compliance
with this Rule. The discharger shall make the
necessary arrangements to allow access to
representatives of the City.
(b) Facility operators shall allow the City ready access
to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, examination and copying of
records that must be kept under the conditions of an
NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the
performance of any additional duties as defined by
state and federal law.
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Stormwater Management
928-15
(c) If the City has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which stormwater is discharged, the
City may seek issuance of a search warrant from
any court of competent jurisdiction.
e. Requirement to Prevent, Control, and Reduce Stormwater
Pollutants by the Use of Best Management Practices. The owner
or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into
the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use
of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Any person
responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the
source of an illicit discharge, may be required by the City to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to
the municipal separate storm sewer system.
f. Watercourse Protection. Every person owning property through
which a watercourse passes shall keep and maintain that part of the
watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, and other
obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard
the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner
or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within
or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures shall not
become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the
watercourse.
g. Notification of Spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law,
as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or
responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has
information of any known or suspected release of materials which
result or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging
into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S. said
person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the containment and
cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous
materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the release. In the event of a release of non-hazardous
materials, said person shall notify the City in person or by phone or
facsimile no later than the next business day following discovery
of the release.
h. Enforcement.
(1) Notice of Violation. Whenever the City finds that a person
has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Stormwater Management
928-16
this Rule, the City may order compliance by written notice
of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may
require without limitation and at the owners expense:
(a) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and
reporting;
(b) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(c) That violating discharges, practices, or operations
shall cease and desist;
(d) The abatement or remediation of storm water
pollution or contamination hazards and the
restoration of any affected property;
(e) Payment of a fine to cover administrative and
remediation costs; and/or
(f) The implementation of source control or treatment
BMPs.
(2) Abatement. If abatement of a violation and/or restoration
of affected property is required, the notice shall set forth a
deadline within which such remediation or restoration must
be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the
established deadline, the work shall be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the
expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.
(3) Appeal of Notice of Violation. Any person receiving a
Notice of Violation may appeal the determination of the
City. The notice of appeal must be received by the City
within 5 days working days from the date of the Notice of
Violation. Hearing on the appeal before the City Board of
Managers shall take place within 15 days from the date of
receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the City
shall be final.
(4) Enforcement Measures after Appeal. If the violation has
not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in
the Notice of Violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within
3 days of the decision of the City Council, then
representatives of the City are authorized to take any and
all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Stormwater Management
928-17
the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner,
agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to
allow the City or its agents to enter upon the premises for
the purposes set forth above.
(5) Cost of Abatement. The City may assess costs for
abatement. Within 30 days after abatement of the violation,
the City shall notify the property owner of the cost of
abatement, including administrative costs. The property
owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of
the assessment within 10 calendar days. If the amount due
is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the
decision of the municipal authority or by the expiration of
the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall
become a special assessment against the property and shall
constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the
assessment.
(6) Injunctive Relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the
requirements of this Rule. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this Rule, the City
may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction
restraining the person from activities which would create
further violations or compelling the person to perform
abatement or remediation of the violation.
(7) Violations Deemed a Public Nuisance. In addition to the
enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of
the provisions of this Rule is a threat to public health,
safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance,
and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's
expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise
compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
(8) Relation to Other Rules. None of the enforcement
provisions of this Rule shall abridge or alter the right of the
City to seek remedies provided for under Rule H herein.

APPENDIX A. SPECIAL WATERS
A. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
All requirements in this Appendix are in addition to BMPs already specified in the permit.
Where provisions of Appendix A conflict with requirements elsewhere in the permit the
provisions in Appendix A take precedence. All BMPs used to comply with this Appendix
must be documented in the SWPPP for the project. If the terms and conditions of this
Appendix cannot be met, an individual permit will be required in accordance with Minn. R.
ch. 7001.
B. REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCHARGING TO WETLANDS
If the project has any storm water discharges with the potential for significant adverse
impacts to a wetland (e.g., conversion of a natural wetland to a storm water pond) , the
Permittee(s) must demonstrate that the wetland mitigative sequence has been followed in
accordance with D.1 or D.2 of this appendix.
1. If the potential adverse impacts to a wetland on a specific project site have been
addressed by permits or other approvals from an official statewide program (U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers 404 program, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, or the
State of Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act) that are issued specifically for the project
and project site, the Permittee may use the permit or other determination issued by these
agencies to show that the potential adverse impacts have been addressed. For the
purposes of this permit, deminimus actions are determinations by the permitting agency
that address the project impacts, whereas a non-jurisdictional determination does not
address project impacts.
2. If there are impacts from the project that are not addressed in one of the permits or other
determinations discussed in Appendix A, Part D.1 (e.g., permanent inundation or
flooding of the wetland, significant degradation of water quality, excavation, filling,
draining), the Permittee must minimize all adverse impacts to wetlands by utilizing
appropriate measures. Measures used must be based on the nature of the wetland, its
vegetative City types and the established hydrology. These measures include in order of
preference:
a. Avoid all significant adverse impacts to wetlands from the project and post project
discharge.
b. Minimize any unavoidable impacts from the project and post project discharge.
c. Provide compensatory mitigation when the Permittee determines that there is no
reasonable and practicable alternative to having a significant adverse impact on a
wetland. For compensatory mitigation, wetland restoration or creation shall be of
the same type, size and whenever reasonable and practicable in the same watershed
as the impacted wetland.
E. DISCHARGES REQUIRING ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Stormwater Management
928-23

those under the Minnesota Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) or the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA). The owner must complete any environmental review required by law,
including any required Environmental Assessment Work Sheets or Environmental Impact
Statements, Federal environmental review, or other required review.
F. DISCHARGES AFFECTING ENDANGERED OR THREATENED SPECIES
This permit does not replace or satisfy any review requirements for Endangered or
Threatened species, from new or expanded discharges that adversely impact or contribute to
adverse impacts on a listed endangered or threatened species or adversely modify a
designated critical habitat. The owner must conduct any required review and coordinate with
appropriate agencies for any project with the potential of affecting threatened or endangered
species, or their critical habitat.
G. DISCHARGES AFFECTING HISTORIC PLACES OR ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES
This permit does not replace or satisfy any review requirements for Historic Places or
Archeological Sites, from new or expanded discharges which adversely affect properties
listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or affecting known or
discovered Archeological Sites. The owner must be in compliance with National Historic
Preservation Act and conduct all required review and coordination related to historic
preservation, including significant anthropological sites and any burial sites, with the
Minnesota Historic Preservation Officer.

928-24
APPENDIX B. DEFINITIONS
1. "Best Management Practices (BMPs)" means erosion and sediment control and water
quality management practices that are the most effective and practicable means of
controlling, preventing, and minimizing degradation of surface water, including avoidance
of impacts, construction-phasing, minimizing the length of time soil areas are exposed,
prohibitions, and other management practices published by state or designated area-wide
planning agencies.
Individual BMPs found in this permit are described in the current version of Protecting
Water Quality in Urban Areas, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency 2000. BMPs must be
adapted to the site and can be adopted from other sources. However, they must be similar in
purpose and at least as effective and stringent as MPCA’s BMPs. (Other sources include
manufacturers specifications, Storm Water Management for Construction Activities:
Developing Pollution Prevention Plans and Best Management Practices, U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency 1992, and Erosion Control Design Manual, Minnesota
Department of Transportation, et al, 1993).
2. “Commissioner” means the Commissioner of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency or
the Commissioner's designee.
3. “Common Plan of Development or Sale” means a contiguous area where multiple separate
and distinct land disturbing activities may be taking place at different times, on different
schedules, but under one proposed plan. One plan is broadly defined to include design,
permit application, advertisement or physical demarcation indicating that land-disturbing
activities may occur.
4. "Construction Activity" For this permit, construction activity includes construction
activity as defined in 40 C.F.R. part 122.26(b)(14)(x) and small construction activity as
defined in 40 C.F.R. part 122.26(b)(15). This includes a disturbance to the land that results in
a change in the topography, existing soil cover (both vegetative and non-vegetative), or the
existing soil topography that may result in accelerated storm water runoff, leading to soil
erosion and movement of sediment into surface waters or drainage systems. Examples of
construction activity may include clearing, grading, filling and excavating. Construction
activity includes the disturbance of less than one acre of total land area that is a part of a
larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan will ultimately
disturb one (1) acre or more.
5. “Dewatering” means the removal of water for construction activity. It can be a discharge
of appropriated surface or groundwater to dry and/or solidify a construction site. It may
require Minnesota Department of Natural Resources permits to be appropriated and if
contaminated may require other MPCA permits to be discharged.
6. "Energy Dissipation" means methods employed at pipe outlets to prevent erosion. Examples
include, but are not limited to: concrete aprons, riprap, splash pads, and gabions that are
designed to prevent erosion.

a. All soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and a uniform (e.g., evenly
distributed, without large bare areas) perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70% of
the native background vegetative cover for the area has been established on all unpaved
areas and areas not covered by permanent structures, or equivalent permanent
stabilization measures (such as the use of riprap, gabions, or geotextiles) have been
employed;
b. For individual lots in residential construction by either: (a) The homebuilder completing
final stabilization as specified above, or (b) the homebuilder establishing temporary
stabilization including perimeter controls for an individual lot prior to occupation of the
home by the homeowner and informing the homeowner of the need for, and benefits of,
final stabilization. (Homeowners typically have an incentive to put in the landscaping
functionally equivalent to final stabilization as quick as possible to keep mud out of their
homes and off sidewalks and driveways.); or
c. For construction projects on land used for agricultural purposes (e.g., pipelines across
crop or range land) final stabilization may be accomplished by returning the disturbed
land to its preconstruction agricultural use. Areas disturbed that were not previously used
for agricultural activities, such as buffer strips immediately adjacent to surface waters
and drainage systems, and areas which are not being returned to their preconstruction
agricultural use must meet the final stabilization criteria in (a) or (b) above.
9. "General Contractor" means the party who signs the construction contract with the owner
to construct the project described in the final plans and specifications. Where the
construction project involves more than one contractor, the general contractor will be the
party responsible for managing the project on behalf of the owner. In some cases, the owner
may be the general contractor. In these cases, the owner may contract an individual as the
operator who would become the Co-Permittee.
10. “Homeowner Factsheet” means a fact sheet developed by the MPCA to be given to
homeowners at the time of sale by a builder to inform the homeowner of the need for, and
benefits of, final stabilization.
11. "Impervious Surface" means a constructed hard surface that either prevents or retards the
entry of water into the soil and causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities and at
an increased rate of flow than prior to development. Examples include rooftops, sidewalks,
patios, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, and concrete, asphalt, or gravel roads.
12. "National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)" means the program for
issuing, modifying, revoking, reissuing, terminating, monitoring, and enforcing permits under
the Clean Water Act (Sections 301, 318, 402, and 405) and United States Code of Federal
Regulations Title 33, Sections 1317, 1328, 1342, and 1345..
13. “Normal Wetted Perimeter” means the area of a conveyance, such as a ditch, channel, or
pipe that is in contact with water during flow events that are expected to occur once every
year.
14. "Notice of Termination" means notice to terminate coverage under this permit after
construction is complete, the site has undergone final stabilization, and maintenance
agreements for all permanent facilities have been established, in accordance with all
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance Stormwater Management
928-26
applicable conditions of this permit. Notice of Termination forms are available from the
MPCA.
15. “Operator” means the person (usually the general contractor), designated by the owner,
who has day to day operational control and/or the ability to modify project plans and
specifications related to the SWPPP. The person must be knowledgeable in those areas of
the permit for which the operator is responsible, (Part II.B. and Part IV.) and must perform
those responsibilities in a workmanlike manner.
16. "Owner" means the person or party possessing the title of the land on which the construction
activities will occur; or if the construction activity is for a lease holder, the party or
individual identified as the lease holder; or the contracting government agency responsible
for the construction activity.
17. "Permanent Cover" means final stabilization. Examples include grass, gravel, asphalt, and
concrete.
18. "Permittee" means a person or persons, firm, or governmental agency or other institution that
signs the application submitted to the MPCA and is responsible for compliance with the
terms and conditions of this permit.
19. “Saturated Soil” means the highest seasonal elevation in the soil that is in a reduced
chemical state because of soil voids being filled with water. Saturated soil is evidenced by
the presence of redoximorphic features or other information.
20. "Sediment Control" means methods employed to prevent sediment from leaving the site.
Sediment control practices include silt fences, sediment traps, earth dikes, drainage swales,
check dams, subsurface drains, pipe slope drains, storm drain inlet protection, and temporary
or permanent sedimentation basins.
21. “Small Construction Activity” means small construction activity as defined in 40 C.F.R.
part 122.26(b)(15) . Small construction activities include clearing, grading and excavating
that result in land disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and less than five acres.
Small construction activity includes the disturbance of less than one (1) acre of total land
area that is part of a larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan
will ultimately disturb equal to or greater than one and less than five (5) acres.
22. "Stabilized" means the exposed ground surface has been covered by appropriate materials
such as mulch, staked sod, riprap, wood fiber blanket, or other material that prevents erosion
from occurring. Grass seeding is not stabilization.

26. “Surface Water or Waters” means all streams, lakes, ponds, marshes, wetlands, reservoirs,
springs, rivers, drainage systems, waterways, watercourses, and irrigation systems whether
natural or artificial, public or private.
27. "Temporary Erosion Protection" means methods employed to prevent erosion. Examples
of temporary cover include; straw, wood fiber blanket, wood chips, and erosion netting.
28. “Underground Waters” means water contained below the surface of the earth in the
saturated zone including, without limitation, all waters whether under confined, unconfined,
or perched conditions, in near surface unconsolidated sediment or regolith, or in rock
formations deeper underground. The term ground water shall be synonymous with
underground water.
29. “Waters of the State” (as defined in Minn. Stat. § 115.01, subd. 22) means all streams,
lakes, ponds, marshes, watercourses, waterways, wells, springs, reservoirs, aquifers, irrigation
systems, drainage systems and all other bodies or accumulations of water, surface or
underground, natural or artificial, public or private, which are contained within, flow through,
or border upon the state or any portion thereof.
30. “Water Quality Volume” means ½ inch of runoff from the new impervious surfaces
created by this project and is the volume of water to be treated in the permanent storm water

Little Canada Subdivision Ordinance General Provisions
1001-1
1001. GENERAL PROVISIONS
1001.010. SHORT TITLE. This Ordinance shall be known as the "SUBDIVISION
ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF LITTLE CANADA", and will be referred to herein as "this
Ordinance".
1001.020. PURPOSE. In order to safeguard the best interests of the City of Little Canada
and to assist the subdivider in harmonizing his interests with those of the City, the following
Ordinance is adopted so that the adherence to same will bring results beneficial to both parties. It
is the purpose of this Ordinance to make certain regulations and requirements for the platting of
land within the City of Little Canada pursuant to the authority contained in Minnesota Statutes
Annotated, which regulations the City Council deems necessary for the health, safety and general
welfare of this community.
1001.030. APPROVALS NECESSARY FOR ACCEPTANCE OF SUBDIVISION
PLATS. Before any plat shall be recorded or be of any validity, it shall be referred to the City
Planning Commission and approved by the City Council of Little Canada as having fulfilled the
requirements of this Ordinance.
1001.040. CONDITIONS FOR RECORDING. No plat of any subdivision shall be entitled
to be recorded in the Ramsey County Recorder's Office or have any validity until the plat thereof
has been prepared, approved, and acknowledged in the manner prescribed by this Ordinance.
1001.050. BUILDING PERMITS. No building permits shall be issued by the City of Little
Canada for the construction of any building, structure or improvement to the land or to any lot in
a subdivision as defined herein, until all requirements of this Ordinance have been fully
complied with.
1001.060. EXCEPTIONS. When requesting a subdivision, if the following condition or
conditions exist, the City Administrator shall deem the request to be a “simple subdivision” and
exempt the subdivider from certain procedural provisions as directed in this section.
A. In the case of a request to divide a lot where the division is to permit the adding of a
parcel of land to an abutting lot or to create three (3) or less lots and the newly created
property line will not cause the other remaining portion of the lots, or any structures
within the subdivision, to be in violation with this Ordinance or the Zoning Ordinance,
then the City Administrator shall place the request on the agenda of the Planning
Commission for recommendation to the City Council, subject to the City’s scheduling
requirements. Said subdivision may be exempted from other procedural or data
requirements as deemed appropriate by the City Administrator.
Little Canada Subdivision Ordinance General Provisions
1001-2
B. Any parcel resulting from a subdivision with a metes and bounds description shall not
thereafter be subdivided again with a new metes and bounds description while it is under
the same ownership or for a period of 10 years from the date of final approval by the
City; whichever time period is greater. Any subsequent subdivision for such parcels done
prior to this time period shall be by plat only, in accordance with the requirements of
Section 1004 of the City’s Subdivision Ordinance, without the exceptions otherwise
allowed by Section 1001 or Section 1009.
C. In the case of a request to combine two or more lots of record, where there exists a total
of no more than one (1) building on all lots subject to the request, and which request will
not cause other parcels or structures to be in violation of this Ordinance or the Zoning
Ordinance, then the City Administrator may certify that the procedural requirements of
the subdivision ordinance do not apply to the request, exempting the subdivider from the
requirements for Planning Commission recommendation and City Council approval.
Such certification shall be made within ten (10) days of the receipt of this request.
1001.070. SEPARABILITY. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this
Ordinance is for any reason found to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions of this Ordinance.
1001.080. CONFLICT.
A. Whenever there is a difference between minimum standards or dimensions specified
herein and those contained in other official regulations, resolutions or ordinances of the
City, the most restrictive standards shall apply.
B. Whenever a design feature, improvement, standard, or technique is proposed in a plat that
is not provided for in these regulations, said design feature, standard or technique shall be
considered to be a “non-standard improvement.” Non-standard improvements are
grounds for denial of a plat. The City Council may, at its sole discretion, permit nonstandard
improvements where such improvements are considered to be in the best
interests of the City.

Council may act on the preliminary plat without the Planning Commission's
recommendation.

1. Public Hearing. Upon receipt of the application, staff reports, and Planning
Commission recommendation, the City Administrator shall schedule a public
hearing for public review of the preliminary plat. The Council shall hold the

Little Canada Subdivision Ordinance Design Standards
1006-1
1006. DESIGN STANDARDS
1006.010. BLOCKS.
A. Block Length. In general, intersecting streets, determining block lengths, shall be
provided at such intervals so as to serve cross-traffic adequately and to meet existing
streets. Where no existing plats control, the blocks in residential subdivisions should not
exceed one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320) feet nor be less than four hundred
(400) feet in length, except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from
this maximum. In blocks longer than eight hundred (800) feet, pedestrian ways and/or
easements through the block may be required near the center of the block.
B. Block Width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two (2) tiers of
lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such
width as to be considered most suitable for their respective use, including adequate space
for off-street parking and deliveries.
1006.020. LOTS.
A. Area. The minimum lot area, width and depth shall not be less than that established by
the Little Canada Zoning Ordinance in effect at the time of adoption of the final plat.
B. Corner Lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have additional width to permit
appropriate building setback from both streets as required in the Zoning Ordinance.
C. Butt Lots. Butt lots shall be platted at least five (5) feet wider than the average interior
lots in the block.
D. Side Lot Lines. Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles to street lines or
radial to curved street lines.
E. Frontage. Every lot must have the minimum frontage on a City approved street other
than an alley, as required in the Little Canada Zoning Ordinance.
F. Setback Lines. Setback or building lines shall be shown on the preliminary plat for all
lots intended for residential use and shall not be less than the setback required by the
Little Canada Zoning Ordinance, as may be amended.
G. Features. In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be shown for all natural
features, such as topography, tree growth, water courses, historic spots or similar
conditions which if preserved will add attractiveness and stability to the proposed
development.
Little Canada Subdivision Ordinance Design Standards
1006-2
H. Lot Remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum area and dimensions left over after
subdividing of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots, rather than be allowed to
remain as unusable parcels.
I. Political Boundaries. No singular plat shall extend over a political boundary or school
district line without document notification to affected units of government.
J. Frontage on Two Streets. Double frontage, or lots with frontage on two (2) parallel
streets, shall not be permitted except: where lots back on arterial streets or highways, or
where topographic or other conditions render subdividing otherwise unreasonable. Such
double frontage lots shall have an additional depth of at least twenty (20) feet in order to
allow space for screen planting along the back lot line.
K. Turn Around Access. Where proposed residential lots abut a collector or arterial street,
they should be platted in such a manner as to encourage turn-around access and egress on
each lot.
L. Pipeline Setback. Where the proposed subdivision is subject to an easement for a pipeline
transporting hazardous fluids, including but not limited to natural gas, liquid petroleum,
oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, or other similar product, or the proposed subdivision is located
adjacent to such an easement, no lot may be designed that includes any buildable area
within fifty (50) feet from the edge of any such easement. Any lot subject to such an
easement shall contain a buildable area of no less than sixty (60) feet of width and sixty
(60) feet of depth outside the setback established by this Section.
1006.030. STREETS AND ALLEYS.
A. Streets, Continuous. Except for cul-de-sacs, streets shall connect with streets already
dedicated in adjoining or adjacent subdivisions, or provide for future connections to
adjoining un-subdivided tracts, or shall be a reasonable projection of streets in the nearest
subdivided tracts. The arrangement of thoroughfares and collector streets shall be
considered in their relation to the reasonable circulation of traffic, to topographic
conditions, to run-off of storm water, to public convenience and safety, and in their
appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the area to be served. Streets shall be
designed to avoid creating conflicts with zoning regulations or negative impacts to
adjoining or nearby lands.
B. Local Streets and Dead-End Streets. Local streets should be planned so as to discourage
their use by non-local traffic. Dead-end streets are prohibited, but cul-de-sacs shall be
permitted where topography or other physical conditions justify their use. Except for
“Temporary cul-de-sacs as described in Section 1006.030.(d), cul-de-sacs shall not be
longer than five hundred (500) feet in length, including a terminal turn-around which
shall be provided at the closed end, with a right-of-way radius of not less than fifty (50)
feet. Such length shall be measured from the centerline intersection with the nearest
street to the end of the cul-de-sac. The City reserves the right to require, without the need
Little Canada Subdivision Ordinance Design Standards
1006-3
for a variance, longer cul-de-sac length where additional natural resources, public
utilities, or other objectives of the City’s Comprehensive Plan and land use objectives, as
determined by the City Council, will be preserved or accomplished without negatively
impacting public safety. The requirement for a longer cul-de-sac shall not be applied
solely because a subdivider wishes to increase lot count in a subdivision.
C. Street Plans for Future Subdivisions. Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of
the tract owned or intended, a future street system for the un-subdivided portion shall be
prepared and submitted by the subdivider.
D. Temporary Cul-De-Sac. A temporary cul-de-sac is a street which is terminated pending
future extension in conjunction with future subdivision. For such temporary cul-de-sacs,
a temporary turn around facility shall be provided at the closed end, in conformance with
cul-de-sac requirements for cul-de-sac radius.
E. Provisions for Re-subdivision of Large Lots and Parcels. When a tract is subdivided into
larger than normal building lots or parcels, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to
permit the logical location and openings of future streets and appropriate re-subdivision,
with provision for adequate utility connections for such re-subdivision.
F. Street Intersections. Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as
nearly as possible at right angles, except where topography or other conditions justify
variations. Under normal conditions, the minimum angle of intersection of streets shall be
eighty (80) degrees. Street intersection jogs with an offset of less than one hundred
twenty-five (125) feet shall be avoided.
G. Subdivisions Abutting Major Rights-of-Way. Wherever the proposed subdivision
contains or is adjacent to the right-of-way of a U.S. or State Highway or thoroughfare,
provision may be made for a marginal access street approximately parallel and adjacent
to the boundary of such right-of-way, provided that due consideration is given to proper
circulation design, or for a street at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land
between such street and right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due
consideration of the minimum distance required for approach connections to future grade
separations, or for lot depths.
H. Sidewalks. In those cases where the City Council deems appropriate and necessary,
sidewalks of not less than four (4) feet in width shall be provided.
I. Pedestrianways. Pedestrianways, where permitted, shall be at least fifteen (15) feet wide.
J. Service Access, Alleys. Service access shall be provided in commercial and industrial
districts for off-street loading, unloading and parking consistent with and adequate for the
uses proposed. Except where justified by special conditions, such as the continuation of
an existing alley in the same block, alleys will not be approved in residential districts.
Alleys, where provided, shall not be less than thirty (30) feet wide in commercial areas.
Little Canada Subdivision Ordinance Design Standards
1006-4
Dead-end alleys shall be avoided wherever possible, but if unavoidable, such dead-end
alleys may be approved if adequate turnaround facilities are provided at the closed end.
K. Half Streets. Dedication of half streets shall not be considered for approval except where
it is essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision and in conformity with the
other requirements of these regulations or where it is found that it will be practical to
require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided.
L. Street Grades. Except when, upon the recommendation of the City Engineer, that the
topography warrants a greater maximum, the grades in all streets, thoroughfares, collector
streets, local streets, and alleys in any subdivision shall not be greater than eight (8)
percent. In addition, there shall be a minimum grade on all streets and thoroughfares of
not less than one-half (.50) percent.
M. Curb Radius. The minimum curb radii for arterials, collector streets, local streets and
alleys shall be as follows:
1. Arterial Streets, Collector and Local Streets. Ten (10) feet.
2. Alleys. Four (4) feet.
N. Reverse Curves. Minimum design standards for collector and arterial streets shall comply
to Minnesota State Aid Standards.
O. Reserve Strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except
under conditions accepted by the City Council.
P. Street Right-of-Way Width. Street right-of-way widths shall conform with the following
standards:
1. Arterial Streets. One hundred (100) feet.
2. Collector Streets. Eighty (80) feet.
3. Local Streets – Single Family. Fifty (50) feet.
4. All Other Local Streets. Sixty (60) feet.
Q. Private Driveway Grades. Except when, upon the recommendation of the City Engineer,
that the topography warrants a greater maximum, the grades in all private driveways and
parking lots in any subdivision shall not be greater than six (6) percent. In addition, there
shall be a minimum grade on all such driveways and parking lots of not less than .50
percent.
1006.040. EASEMENTS.
A. Width and Location. An easement for utilities at least six (6) feet wide shall be provided
along all lot lines in a division or subdivision, unless the required easements are waived
by the City Council after receipt of a written recommendation of the City Engineer. If
Little Canada Subdivision Ordinance Design Standards
1006-5
necessary for the extension of water main or sewer lines or similar utilities, easements of
greater width may be required along lot lines or across lots.
B. Continuous Utility Easement Locations. Utility easements shall connect with easements
established in adjoining properties. These easements, when approved, shall not thereafter
be changed without the approval of the City Council after a public hearing.
C. Guy Wires. Additional easements for pole guys should be provided, where appropriate, at
the outside of turns. Where possible, lot lines shall be arranged to bisect the exterior
angle so that pole guys will fall along side lot lines.
1006.050. EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL.
A. The development shall conform to the natural limitations presented by topography and
soil so as to create the least potential for soil erosion.
B. Erosion and siltation control measures shall be coordinated with the different stages of
construction. Appropriate control measures shall be installed prior to development when
necessary to control erosion.
C. Land shall be developed in increments of workable size such that adequate erosion and
siltation controls can be provided as construction progresses. The smallest practical area
of land shall be exposed at any one period of time.
D. When soil is exposed, the exposure shall be for the shortest feasible period of time, as
specified in the development agreement.
E. Where the topsoil is removed, sufficient arable soil shall be set aside for re-spreading
over the developed area. Top soil shall be restored or provided to a depth of four (4)
inches and shall be of a quality at least equal to the soil quality prior to development.
F. Natural vegetation shall be protected wherever practical.
G. Runoff water shall be diverted to a sedimentation basin before allowed to enter the
natural drainage system.
H. No graded area, whether part of a proposed public area of lot, shall exceed a four to one
(4:1) slope in its finished condition, except upon approval of the City Council with the
advice of the City Engineer. Extraordinary measures including stabilized steep slopes
and/or retaining walls shall be considered non-standard improvements, and subdivisions
which rely on them may be rejected at the discretion of the City Council.
1006.060. PROTECTED AREAS.
Little Canada Subdivision Ordinance Design Standards
1006-6
A. Where land proposed for subdivision is deemed environmentally sensitive by the City,
due to the existence of wetlands, drainage ways, water courses, floodable areas or steep
slopes, the design of said subdivision shall clearly reflect all necessary measures of
protection to insure against adverse environmental impact.
Based upon the necessity to control and maintain certain sensitive areas, the City shall
determine whether said protection will be accomplished through lot enlargement and
redesign, easement, or dedication of those sensitive areas in the form of outlots.
In general, measures of protection shall include design solutions which allow for
construction and grading involving a minimum of alteration to sensitive areas. Where
these areas are to be incorporated into lots within the proposed subdivision, the
subdivider shall be required to demonstrate that the proposed design will not require
construction on slopes over eighteen (18) percent, or result in significant alteration to the
natural drainage system such that adverse impacts cannot be contained within the plat
boundary.
1006.070. OTHER STANDARDS
A. All private utilities in any new subdivision shall be required to be installed underground
per City Code Chapter 2301, including transmission lines, service lines, and any required
extensions. The subdivider shall be responsible for coordinating the installation of such
private utilities with the City so as to avoid conflicts with City utilities in easements and
rights of way.
B. All public improvements shall be designed to comply with the standard detail plates for
such improvements as adopted by the City Council. Such improvements may include,
but are not limited to, sanitary sewer, watermain, street, curb and gutter, stormwater,
public area landscaping and restoration, and other improvements required by the City as a
part of a subdivision approval.
1. Where lift stations are proposed to be installed in the City of Little Canada, such
equipment must meet the type, make, and manufacturer of the current City standard
lift station identified in the standard detail plates, and the employment of a lift station
shall be at the sole discretion of the City. All lift stations shall have a minimum of
two pumps. The City shall review the location and all possible gravity service
options prior to making the determination of a new lift station approval. Factors
considered will include future operation and maintenance costs of a lift station and
the servicing of adjacent properties to limit the number of lift stations in the City.
Back-up power generation shall be required for all new lift stations through the use of
an on-site natural gas generator. Documentation on the size, make, and model of the
generator to be used must be submitted to the City for approval.
2. Any public watermain system extension within the City must be reviewed and
approved by the City. It is the City’s goal to provide for a looped watermain system
Little Canada Subdivision Ordinance Design Standards
1006-7
for improved serviceability and fire protection. The City shall review the location of
the extension, the surrounding watermain system, and adjacent properties to
determine if a looping will be required. If so required by the City, the water system
shall be looped to eliminate dead end sections. Subdivision requests may be denied
where compliance with City design requirements for looping or other standards are
not met.
C. The subdivider shall identify any requests for the construction of model homes prior to
the final acceptance of all improvements by the City. A subdivider may provide for up to
three (3) such model homes, provided that the subdivider makes adequate provision for
public and emergency access during construction of the subdivision and buildings, that
the subdivider restores any areas disturbed by model home construction or use, and that
the subdivider’s financial security is adequate to cover such restoration.

1007.050. Where a proposed park, playground or other recreational areas, proposed school
site or other public ground that has been indicated in the official map and/or comprehensive plan
is located in whole, or in part, within a proposed subdivision such proposed public site should be
designated as such and should be dedicated to the City, School District or other proper
governmental unit. If the subdivider chooses not to dedicate an area in excess of the land
required hereunder for such proposed public site, the City shall not be required to act to approve
or disapprove the preliminary plat of the subdivision for a period of sixty (60) days after the
subdivider meets all the provisions of the Subdivision Ordinance in order to permit the Council,
School Board or other appropriate governmental unit to consider the proposed plat and to
consider taking steps to acquire, through purchase or condemnation, all or part of the public site
proposed under the official map or master plan.
1007.060. Land area conveyed or dedicated hereunder may not be included by a subdivider
as an allowance for purposes of calculating the density requirements of the subdivision as set out

Little Canada Subdivision Ordinance Park Land Dedication Requirements
1007-2
1007.070. Where private open space for park and recreation purposes is provided in a
proposed subdivision and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future
residents of the subdivision, such areas may be used for credit at the discretion of the City
Council against the requirement of dedication for park and recreation purposes, provided the City
Council finds it is in the public interest to do so and that the following standards are met:
A. That yards, court areas, setbacks and other open space required to be maintained by the
zoning and building regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private
open space; and
B. That the private ownership and maintenance of the open space is adequately provided for
by written agreement; and
C. That the private open space is restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded
covenants which run with the land in favor of the future owners of property within the

D. That the proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and
recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography,
hydrological, geology, access and location of the private open space land; and
E. That facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the
provisions of recreational element of the Comprehensive Plan, and are approved by the
City Council; and
F. That where such credit is granted, the amount of credit shall not exceed twenty-five (25)
percent of the park land dedication requirements for the development.
1007.080. The City shall maintain a separate fund into which all cash contributions received
from owners or developers in lieu of conveyance or dedication of land for park or playground,
public open space or trail purposes shall be deposited and shall make, from time to time,
appropriations from such fund for acquisition of land for park and playground purposes, for
developing existing park and playground sites, for public open space and trails, or for debt
retirement in connection with land previously acquired for parks and playgrounds, which will
benefit the residents of the City.
1007.090. Time of Payment or Contribution: The scheduling of dedication and/or cash
payments shall be established in a development agreement between the City and subdivider.
1007.100. Amount to be Dedicated: For all development or subdivision, the amount of land

Little Canada Ordinance No. 161 as may be amended.
Little Canada Subdivision Ordinance Required Basic Improvements
1008-1
1008. REQUIRED BASIC IMPROVEMENTS
1008.010. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
A. Before a final plat is delivered by the City to the subdivider, the subdivider of the land
covered by said plat shall pay all applicable fees and execute and submit to the City
Council a developer's agreement which shall be binding on his or their heirs, personal
representatives and assigns, a part of which agreement shall be set forth that the
subdivider will cause no private construction to be made on the lands within said plat, nor
shall the subdivider file or cause to be filed any application for building permits for such
construction until all improvements required under this Ordinance have been made or
arranged for in the manner and conforming to the requirements as set forth herein.
B. Prior to the delivery of the approved final plat, the subdivider shall deposit with the City
Administrator an amount equal to a minimum of one hundred twenty-five (125) percent
of the City Engineer's estimated cost of the required improvements within the plat, either
in a cash escrow fund or letter of credit. The surety involved in said financial guarantees
shall be approved by the City. The said cash escrow letter of credit or performance and
indemnity bond shall be conditioned upon:
1. The making and installing of all of the improvements required by the terms and
conditions set forth by the City within one (1) year, except for the placement of
the final wear course pavement.
2. Satisfactory completion of the work and payment therefore, which work was
undertaken by the subdivider in accordance with the developer's agreement
referred to above.
3. The payment by the subdivider to the City of all expenses incurred by the City,
which expenses shall include but not be limited to expenses for engineering,
fiscal, legal, construction and administration. In instances where a cash escrow is
submitted in lieu of a letter of credit or performance and indemnity bond, there
shall be a cash escrow agreement which shall provide that in the event the
required improvements are not completed within one year, all amounts held under
the cash escrow agreement shall be automatically turned over and delivered to the
City and applied by the City to the cost of completing the required improvements.
If the funds available within said cash escrow agreement are not sufficient to
complete the required improvements, the necessary additional cost to the City
shall be assessed against the subdivision. Any balance remaining in the cash
escrow fund after such improvements have been made and all expenses therefore
have been paid, shall be returned to the subdivider. In instances where a letter of
credit is used in lieu of a cash escrow or performance and indemnity bond, the
said letter of credit shall be in a form satisfactory to the City and the terms thereof
shall substantially comply with the procedure as set forth for a cash escrow fund.
In instances where a performance and indemnity bond is used in lieu of a cash
Little Canada Subdivision Ordinance Required Basic Improvements
1008-2
escrow or letter of credit, the said bond shall be in a form acceptable to the City
and shall comply with all requirements as set forth in Minnesota Statutes as
amended, which Statutes relate to Surety Bonds.
C. No final plat shall be approved by the Council without first approval from the City
Engineer and the City Attorney certifying that the improvements described therein
together with the agreements and documents, required under this Chapter of the
Ordinance, meet the requirements of the City. The City Administrator shall also certify
that all fees required to be paid to the City in connection with the plat have been paid.
D. The City of Little Canada shall where appropriate require of a subdivider submission of a
letter of credit in a form and for a term suitable to the City in the amount equal to the
original cost of the improvements, which shall be in force for one (1) year following the

performance of the said improvements.
E. Reproducible "as built drawings" as required by the City Engineer shall be furnished to
the City by the subdivider of all required improvements. Such "as built drawings" shall
be certified to be true and accurate by the registered engineer responsible for the
installation of the improvements.
F. All of the required improvements to be installed under the provisions of this Ordinance
shall be approved by and subject to the inspection of the City Engineer. All of the City's
expenses incurred as the result of the required improvements shall be paid either directly,
indirectly or by reimbursement to the City by the subdivider.
1008.020. MONUMENTS.
A. Official monuments, as designated and adopted by the Ramsey County Surveyor's Office
and approved by the Ramsey County District Court for use as judicial monuments, shall
be set at each corner or angle on the outside boundary of the final plat or in accordance
with a plan as approved by the City Engineer. The boundary line of the property to be
included with the plat to be fully dimensioned; all monuments and surveyor's irons to be
indicated, each angle point of the boundary perimeter to be so monumented.

Little Canada Subdivision Ordinance Non-platted Subdivision
1009-1
1009. NON-PLATTED SUBDIVISION
1009.010. REGISTERED LAND SURVEYS. Subdivision by registered land survey shall
only be allowed for torrens property. It is the intention of this Ordinance, however, that where
used, all registered land surveys in the City of Little Canada should be presented to the Planning
Commission in the form of a preliminary plat in accordance with the standards set forth in this
Ordinance for preliminary plats and that the Planning Commission shall first approve the
arrangement, sizes, and relationships of proposed tracts in such registered land surveys, and that
tracts to be used as easements or roads should be so dedicated. Unless a recommendation and
approval have been obtained from the Planning Commission and City Council respectively, in
accordance with the standards set forth in this Ordinance, building permits will be withheld for
buildings on tracts which have been so subdivided by registered land surveys and the City may
refuse to take over tracts as streets or roads or to improve, repair or maintain any such tracts
unless so approved.
1009.020. CONVEYANCE BY METES AND BOUNDS. No division of one (1) or more
parcels in which the land conveyed is described by metes and bounds shall be made or recorded
if the parcels described in the conveyance are five (5) acres or less in area and three hundred
(300) feet or less in width unless such parcel was a separate parcel of record at the effective date
of this Ordinance. Building permits will be withheld for buildings or tracts which have been
subdivided and conveyed by this method and the City may refuse to take over tracts as streets or
roads or to improve, repair or maintain any such tracts.
In any case in which compliance with the foregoing restrictions will create an unnecessary
hardship and failure to comply does not interfere with the purpose of the Subdivision
Regulations, the City Council may waive such compliance by adoption of a resolution to that
effect.

1010. VARIANCES, PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS, STANDARDS
1010.010. FINDINGS. The Planning Commission may recommend a variance from the
minimum standards of this Ordinance (not procedural provisions) when, in its opinion, undue
hardship may result from strict compliance. In recommending any variance, the Commission
shall prescribe any conditions that it deems necessary to or desirable for the public interest. In
making its recommendations, the Planning Commission shall take into account the nature of the
proposed use of land and the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside
or work in the proposed subdivision and the probably effect of the proposed subdivision upon
traffic conditions in the vicinity. A variance shall only be recommended when the Planning
Commission finds:
A. That there are special and highly unique circumstances or conditions affecting said
property which are not common to other properties in the City and that the strict
application of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of the
reasonable use of his land.
B. That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, welfare or
injurious to other property in the territory in which property is situated.
C. That the variance is to correct inequities resulting from an extreme hardship limited to
topography, soils or other physical factors of the land.
D. That the request for variance is not based in an economic hardship.
After consideration of the Planning Commission recommendations, the City Council
serving as the Board of Adjustment and Appeals may grant variances by a vote of a
majority of the entire City Council, subject to the finding that a hardship exists according
to items (a), (b), and (c) immediately above.
1010.020. PROCEDURES.
A. Requests for a variance or appeal shall be filed with the City Administrator on an official
