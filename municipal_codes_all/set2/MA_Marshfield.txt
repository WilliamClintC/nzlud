Inspector shall determine whether the condition of the building, structure
or property represents a serious and imminent threat to public health or
safety. If the Inspector finds that the condition of the building, structure
or property poses a serious and imminent threat to public health or safety,
and that there is no reasonable alternative to the immediate issuance of a
demolition permit under the provisions of this section, the Inspector shall
file a written report describing the condition of the building, structure or

any time during the twelve-month demolition delay period, and that
said damage could have been prevented by the required security
measures, said destruction shall be considered a demolition and a

due to fire, collapse, storm or other natural disaster, provided that fire
damage was not the result of arson or other intentional destruction

Department or his designee. The owner must notify the Inspector if an
occupied property becomes vacant during the twelve-month period.
In the instance of eventual demolition of the property the owner shall
allow the Commission access to the building, structure or property to
take photographs, secure samples of wallpaper and paint or generate
any documentation deemed desirable for historical record purposes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the Commission shall, on its
own initiative or on application of the owner, determine that earlier
reconstruction, restoration or other remediation of any demolition in
violation of the bylaw better serves the intent and purpose of this bylaw,
it may, prior to the expiration of said period of three years, but no
sooner than six months from the date of completion of any demolition
in violation of this bylaw, authorize issuance of a building permit, upon
such conditions as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate to

Classifying positions in the service of the Town, other than those
filled by popular election, those under the direction and control
of the School Committee, those employees covered by a collective
bargaining agreement, and certain positions for which the

A.
Nothing in any of the Town of Marshfield's personnel rules, policies,
procedures or other documents relating to employment with the Town
of Marshfield ("the Town") creates any express or implied contract
or guarantee of continued employment for a specific term. No past
practices or procedures, whether oral or written, form any express
or implied agreement or contract to continue such practices or
procedures. No promises or assurances, whether written or oral, which
are contrary to or inconsistent with the limitations set forth in this
subsection create any contract of employment unless:
(1) The terms are put in writing;
(2) The document is labeled "contract";
(3) The document states the duration of employment; and
(4) The document is signed by the Board of Selectmen.

bylaw with proper notice provided to the Town's collective bargaining
groups.
Conflicting provisions contained in collective bargaining agreements,
to the extent required by law, shall supersede these policies. Where
collective bargaining agreements are silent, these policies and
regulations may be applied. If there is a conflict between language
in the Employee Personnel Bylaw and language in an official plan
document (such as the group health insurance policy) the official plan
document governs.
D.
Subject to the Town Administrator's review and approval, departmental
regulations that establish standards of performance, employee conduct,
or action shall continue to be applicable. Employees of the Town that
are not otherwise covered by a collective bargaining agreement,
employment agreement, or state civil service statutes are at-will
employees. Either party may terminate the employment relationship at
any time with good cause, with or without notice. The term "cause"
shall include but not be limited to the following: incapacity other than
temporary illness, inefficiency, insubordination and conduct
unbecoming the office.
E.
This bylaw is intended to be in accordance with all applicable state and
federal laws. In the event that these policies are inconsistent with the
applicable state or federal law, the applicable law shall apply.
F.
The membership of the Personnel Board (hereafter "the Board") shall
be appointed by the Board of Selectmen per the Town Charter and
subject to MGL c. 268A as follows: one member to be appointed to serve
for one year, two members to be appointed to serve for two years, and
two members to serve three years. At the expiration of each term of
office, appointments or reappointments thereafter shall be made in the
same manner for terms of three years. Each term of office shall expire
on June 30. In the event of a vacancy occurring in the membership
of the Personnel Board, the position shall be filled within 30 days in
the same manner and by the same authority as in the original method
of selection and for the remainder of such unexpired term of office.
The members of the Personnel Board shall not be employees or elected
officials of the Town. It is preferred that members of the Personnel
Board have a background in human resources, public administration
or a related field. The Board shall elect a Chairperson from its
membership who shall have the power to call meetings and who shall
preside over such meetings. Any three members shall constitute a
quorum for transaction of business. A majority vote of such a Board
shall prevail unless there is a bare quorum, in which event there must
be a unanimous vote. [Amended 4-24-2017 ATM by Art. 10]

employment agreements or collectively bargained contracts in
accordance with MGL c. 41, § 108N, between the Town and certain
employees. It is the policy of the Town to develop and maintain a
compensation plan that is competitive with the marketplace enabling
the Town to recruit and retain a quality workforce. External salary data
is collected by the Town Administrator or designee on a regular basis
at least every three years from comparable communities as determined
from the geographical recruitment area as well as operational and
demographic criteria on a position-by-position basis. The Town may
make changes to the salary ranges for each grade level as it deems
necessary in order to maintain competitiveness with the marketplace.
A.
Administration. The Town Administrator or his/her qualified designee
shall be responsible for the administration of the classification and
compensation plan.
B.
Job descriptions. The Town Administrator shall maintain written
descriptions of the jobs or positions in the plan describing the essential
characteristics, requirements and general duties. The descriptions shall
not be interpreted as either complete or restrictive and employees shall
continue to perform any duties assigned by an employee's superior(s).
C.
Salary and wage review. The Town Administrator shall, from time to
time not to exceed three years, review the wage and salary schedules
of all positions subject to the plan in order to keep informed as to pay

to recommend to the Town any action deemed desirable to maintain a
fair and equitable (competitive) pay level.

of all employees subject to the classification plan on a regular basis.

ratification of this action by formal amendment of this bylaw by
approval of Town Meeting.

information of Town Meeting and Town employees. The Town
Administrator shall make an annual report in writing to the Board of
Selectmen on or before January 15 of each year.
G.
The title of each position in the classification plan shall be the official
title for all positions and shall be used to designate the position in all
Town payrolls, budget estimates and official records and reports, and
in every connection involving personnel and fiscal processes, but any
abbreviation or code symbol approved by the Town Administrator may
be used in lieu of the title to designate the classification in any such
connection.
A.
Position titles shall be interpreted to be descriptive only and not
restrictive. They shall be construed solely as a means of distinguishing
one position from another and not as prescribing what the duties or
responsibilities of any position shall be, or as modifying, or in any
way affecting, the power of any administrative authority, as otherwise
existing, to appoint, to assign duties to, or to direct and control the
work of any employee under the jurisdiction of such authority.
B.
The Town Administrator shall keep such employment records of all
employees of the Town, including the name, age, date of employment,
classification, department in which employed, and other information as
the Town shall deem necessary. Department heads shall furnish such
information as shall be requested for this purpose.

The official employee personnel files are kept in the office of the Board
of Selectmen and shall be the official employee personnel files of the
Town of Marshfield and shall include all original documentation
pertaining to each employee in accordance with applicable state and/
or federal regulations. Department heads may maintain files supporting
departmental actions. In accordance with the state's Public Records
Law,7 official employee personnel files are confidential records that are
accessible by the Town Administrator, and are not available for public
inspection or copying. [Amended 4-24-2017 ATM by Art. 10]

person(s) to be notified in the event of an emergency and to notify
the Town Administrator's office and the Treasurer/Collector's office of
changes to an employee's personal status to ensure proper insurance
coverage.
D.
In accordance with MGL c. 149, § 52C, as amended, the Town will notify
an employee within 10 days of placing information in an employee's
personnel record that is, has been or may be used to negatively affect
an employee's qualification for employment, promotion, transfer, or
additional compensation or subject (the employee) to disciplinary
action. [Amended 4-24-2017 ATM by Art. 10]
E.
Development of the classification plan. It is the policy of the Town to
classify positions based on the application of a position rating system
that consists of a set of universal position rating criteria. [Amended
4-24-2017 ATM by Art. 10]
A.
Annual salary plan adjustments. Annual salary plan guidelines are used
to administer individual salaries throughout the fiscal year. Based upon
external market data, budget parameters, and the Town's ability to pay,
funds are provided for employee compensation purposes throughout
the year. It is the general policy of the Town of Marshfield to make
salary adjustments at the beginning of each fiscal year as well as during
the fiscal year based on an employee's years of service in a position as
B.
§ 188-5 MARSHFIELD CODE § 188-9
C:174
well as merit. An employee's movement or growth within a salary range
is not and should not be considered an automatic natural progression.
Maintenance of the compensation plan. The Town Administrator is
responsible for overseeing the administration of the Town's wage and
compensation plan(s) after adoption by the Annual Town Meeting. The
Town Administrator may correct individual discrepancies in salaries in
compliance with the classification and compensation plan.
C.
Salary adjustments.
Starting salary; salary ranges. [Amended 10-27-2014 STM by
Art. 3]
Starting salary. It is the policy of the Town of Marshfield to hire
new employees between the minimum and mid-point "hiring
range" of a salary range in each classification level as
described in § 188-11, Schedule A of the Personnel Bylaw. All
employees are to be paid within the salary range in each
classification level.
It is understood that the Town reserves the right to hire
a new employee above the "hiring range" based on the
qualifications of an employee as well as the market
conditions.
[1]
Employees are eligible for annual step increases within
the hiring range within each grade level subject to the
appropriation of funds. An employee's progression above
the fourth step in each grade level is not automatic, but
is based on both an employee's performance and years of
service in a position.
[2]
(a)
Salary ranges. It is the policy of the Town of Marshfield to
establish and maintain salary ranges that are competitive
within the marketplace on a position-by-position basis. Each
salary range is developed in a defined, consistent manner as
follows:
Salary range mid-point: the average mid-point of survey
data collected for all positions within each grade level.
[1]
Salary range minimum: a fixed percentage of the salary
range mid-point.
[2]
Salary range maximum: a fixed differential greater than
the salary range minimum.

Promotion.
(a) An employee may be promoted in two ways:
(2)
D.
§ 188-9 CHARTER § 188-9
C:175
Organizational promotion. An employee may be appointed
to a different position that is classified in a higher pay
band than the position is currently assigned; or
[1]
Job revaluation/reclassification. Duties and responsibilities
of an employee's job may be expanded and, as a result,
the position requires an employee to have additional
knowledge, skill, and/or ability, etc. Based on the
application of the Town's position rating system, the
position is assigned a new classification level. An employee
whose position has been assigned to a higher salary range
should be treated as having received a promotion at the
next common review date.
[2]
A promotional increase for a regular, full-time employee should
advance an employee to a pay rate in the new salary range
that exceeds an employee's current rate of pay by at least 3%.
Factors such as length of service and budget considerations
may affect the amount of compensation.
(b)
Step increase. If an employee is eligible for a step increase, he
or she shall be paid annually and on the anniversary date of
appointment to a position. It is understood that step increases are
not automatic but are subject to merit, years of service in a position
and the appropriation of funds by Town Meeting.
(3)
Temporary promotion. Employees filling in for a senior person for
a period of time greater than two weeks may receive special pay
consideration during or after the completion of the assignment. In
such instances, consideration should be given to the length of the
assignment, level of performance, and job level of the more senior
person.
(4)
Demotion. A demotion takes place when a position is permanently
reclassified or an employee is assigned to a position in a lower
pay band. This action may be either voluntary or involuntary. An
individual's salary may or may not be reduced upon demotion or
reduction in job classification at the discretion of the Town. An
employee's position in the new salary range will affect future salary
increases.
(5)
Merit compensation.
It is the responsibility of the Town Administrator to develop
and implement an employee performance management system
for department heads that is uniformly applied to those
employees covered by this bylaw throughout the organization.
(a)
Consideration for merit salary increases will be given at least
once each year subject to the availability of funds. To be
eligible for a merit increase, an employee must have been
actively working for the Town (in an active pay status) for at
(b)
(6)
§ 188-9 MARSHFIELD CODE § 188-9
C:176
least 30 of the 52 weeks of the relevant performance review
cycle. Merit increases are calculated using the annual
employee's salary in effect immediately preceding the effective
date of the merit increase. Merit increases are directly linked
to the employee's overall performance, provided that the
employee's current salary does not exceed the maximum of the
position's salary range.
Merit performance reviews ensure that eligible employees are
considered for merit pay increases but does not guarantee
that an individual employee will receive an increase. A merit
increase is a salary increase earned by an employee whose
performance has met or exceeded the requirements of the
position. An employee who receives an overall performance
rating of unsatisfactory is not eligible for a salary increase until
the level of performance is improved.
(c)
Notwithstanding anything contained herein, employees at Step
4 at their respective grades shall be eligible for additional
compensation subject to appropriation with 50% of increase
based on merit and 50% based on years of service. [Added
10-27-2014 STM by Art. 3]
(d)
Managing performance. It is the policy of the Town of Marshfield to
compensate employees based on an employee's years of service in
a position and performance. It is the principal responsibility of the
Town Administrator to manage the performance evaluation process
in accordance with the performance management guidelines and
performance management cycle as approved by the Board of
Selectmen.
(7)
Payment at a listed grade. All employees shall be paid at a wage
within the minimum-maximum salary range for the grade level
established for each position in accordance with the classification
schedule in § 188-11 of this bylaw.
(8)
Pay period/paydays. Normally employees are paid weekly (or
biweekly), with the payroll period ending on Saturday and checks
available on Friday. In the event that a payday occurs on a holiday,
payroll checks will be distributed on the nearest preceding
workday. Existing employees may elect to have paychecks
deposited by the Town through the ACH system directly to their
personal account(s). All new employees hired by the Town shall
be required to participate in the Town's payroll direct deposit
program. [Amended 4-24-2017 ATM by Art. 10]
(9)
Introductory hiring period. All new employees must serve an
introductory hiring period of nine months' duration. An employee
may be terminated by the Town during the introductory hiring
period or at any time with or without cause, with or without notice.

§ 188-10. Amendments.
Payroll deductions. Mandatory payroll deductions are made
depending upon the number of exemptions claimed for federal and
state income taxes and retirement contributions. Optional payroll
deductions are made based on employee authorization for health
insurance, life insurance, dental insurance, deferred compensation,
and for other contributions consistent with the law and as approved
by Town Meeting. Pursuant to the applicable federal or state law
or court-ordered wage assignments, the Town may be obliged to
retain and pay over to a third party a portion of an employee's
earnings.
(11)
Section 125 plan. The Town offers a pre-tax program for employees
who work 20 hours or more which excludes from federal income
tax purposes expenses for medical, child care or dependent care.
(12)
Unemployment compensation. Commonwealth of Massachusetts
law requires the Town to reimburse the State of Massachusetts
for unemployment benefits paid to former employees of the Town.
It is the responsibility of individuals to file claims with the State
Division of Employment and Training. The Town reserves the right
to contest claims for unemployment compensation.
(13)
Workers' compensation. To preserve rights under the law, an
employee must notify his or her department head immediately or
as soon as possible if involved in an on-the-job accident that results
in personal injury. Employees injured on the job are protected
against loss of income and medical expenses by provisions of the
Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Act.8 Employees receiving
workers' compensation benefits may, upon request, receive
vacation, sick or personal leave accrued at the time of injury to
supplement workers' compensation benefits up to the amount of
base wages the employee received each week before the injury
occurred.
(14)
Retirement system. As a condition of employment, all permanent
employees who are regularly scheduled to work and earn more
than $5,000 annually are required to join the Plymouth County
Retirement System. Retirement applications must be made by an
employee in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
Plymouth County Retirement System.
(15)
Death benefit. Upon the death of a Town employee who is on
the Town's payroll, his or her estate or designated beneficiary
is eligible to receive accrued vacation and/or sick leave, in
accordance with the provisions of this bylaw.

in a supplier does not necessarily indicate a conflict of interest. The
disclosure of such holding in most instances may be enough to make
clear that such conflict exists. The determination of a conflict of interest
is the sole responsibility of the Town.

integrity of its employees as indispensable sources of Town goodwill. It
is the obligation of the Town and its employees to preserve and protect

employees and their dependents to elect to have the current medical
coverage continued, at the employee's and dependent's expense, at group

(HIPPA).
Permanent employees regularly required to annually work 20 or more
hours per week are covered under the Federal Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPPA). HIPPA provides
employees with certain rights that create a "portability" of health
insurance coverage from one employer to the next. This does not mean
that an employee can transfer his or her current health plan into a
new employment situation. It means that an employee can receive
"credit" for prior coverage when joining a new plan provided by the
Town that may have waiting periods for preexisting conditions. This
requires a transfer of prior coverage information from the old employer
to the new employer. The Town will provide to each employee who
loses health insurance coverage a full certificate of coverage. The
certificate of coverage provides: the date of certification, identifying
information including the name of the employee, the employee's health
insurance plan identification number, names of dependents to whom
the certificate applies, name of group health plan, name of employer,
name, address, and phone number of the plan administrator and the
first and last day of coverage. A certificate will be issued whenever
an individual loses health insurance coverage or would lose coverage

Thin plastic bags are not biodegradable or compostable, are not
acceptable in Marshfield's curbside recycling bins, and only a small
percentage are returned to stores for recycling.

Duxbury, Bridgewater, and much of Cape Cod, have passed plastic
bag bans, and more have bylaws pending.

Intent. The Town of Marshfield hereby enacts this bylaw to help reduce
the deterioration of the environment and the ensuing potential health
risks by eliminating the use of thin plastic carry-out bags at the point of
sale and promoting the use of reusable bags.

Action by Town.
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters or wastes contain
the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in
Subsection D of this section, and which in the judgment of the
Town may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater facilities,
processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise
create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Town
may:
(a) Reject the wastes;
Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge
to the public sewers;
(b)
Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge;
and/or
(c)
Require payment to cover added cost of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges.
(d)
(1)
If the DPW and federal effluent limitations permit pretreatment
of waste flows, the design and installation of such facilities shall
be subject to the review and approval of the DPW and the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Division of Water Pollution
Control.
(2)
E.
Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion
of the DPW, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing floatable grease in excessive amount as specified in
Subsection D(2) or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful
ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be required for
private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a
type and capacity approved by the DPW and shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Grease and
oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious material capable of
withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall
be of substantial construction, watertight, and equipped with easily
removable covers which when bolted in place shall be gas-tight and
water-tight. In the maintaining of these interceptors, the owner(s) shall
be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate
means of the captured material and shall maintain records of the
dates and means of disposal which are subject to review by the DPW.
Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by
the owner's personnel must be performed by properly licensed waste
disposal firms.

§ 223-6 CHARTER § 223-6
C:217
§ 223-7. Powers and authority of inspectors.
Where pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided or
required for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained
continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner(s) at
his expense.
G.
The DPW shall determine the quantity and quality of all industrial
wastes which can be properly taken into the sewerage system and
treated at the sewage treatment works, in addition to the sanitary
sewage from the Town, and the Town may regulate by separate
industrial user agreement(s) approved by the DPW the flow of industrial
wastes into the sewerage system.
H.
When required by the DPW, the owner(s) of any property serviced
by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable
structure together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling,
and measurement of the wastes. Such structure, when required, shall
be accessibly and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance
with plans approved by the DPW. The structure shall be installed by the
owner(s) at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe
and accessible at all times to authorized persons.
I.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this bylaw shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods
for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the
American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the
control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said
control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by
customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon
the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life,
limb and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine
whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is
appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.)
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are
obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs
are determined from periodic grab samples. All industries discharging
into a public sewer shall perform such monitoring of their discharge
as the DPW may reasonably require, including installation, use, and
maintenance of monitoring equipment, keeping records and reporting
the results of such monitoring to the DPW. Such records shall be made
available upon request by the DPW to other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharges to the receiving waters. [Amended 4-24-2017 ATM

§ 223-8. Charges for sewer service.
The Superintendent of Public Works and other duly authorized
employees shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purposes
of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing in
accordance with the provisions of this bylaw. The duly authorized
employees shall have no authority to inquire into any process, including
metallurgical, chemical, oil, refining, ceramic, paper, or other
industries, beyond the point of having a direct bearing on the kind and
source of discharge to the sewers or waterways or facilities for waste
treatment. [Amended 4-24-2017 ATM by Art. 10]
A.
Duly authorized employees are authorized to obtain information
concerning industrial processes which has a direct bearing on the
kind and source of discharge to the wastewater collection system.
An industry may withhold information considered confidential. The
industry must establish that the revelation to the public of the
information in question might result in an advantage to competitors.
B.
Duly authorized employees shall be permitted to enter all private
properties through which the Town holds a duly negotiated easement
for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling, repair and maintenance of any portion of the
wastewater facilities lying within said easement. All entry and
subsequent work, if any, on said easement shall be done in full
accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement pertaining
to the private property involved.
C.
While performing the necessary work on private properties referred
to in Subsection A above, the duly authorized employees shall observe
all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the company
and the company shall be held harmless for injury or death to the
Town employees and the Town shall hold harmless the company against
loss or damage to its property by Town employees and against liability
claims and demands for personal injury or property damage asserted
against the company and growing out of the gauging and sampling
operation, except such as may be caused by negligence or failure
of the company to maintain safe conditions as required in § 223-6I.
[Amended 4-24-2017 ATM by Art. 10]
D.
The funding of the Town's share of Phase I of the Marshfield
Wastewater Treatment Project will be by bonding over a twenty-year
period. Annual debt retirement shall be apportioned so that 40% is
placed on the general tax rate and 60% is charged to the sewer users.
A.
Capital charges. The owner(s) of houses, buildings, or other properties
used for human occupancy, employment, recreation or other purposes
situated within the Town and abutting on any street, common driveway,
alley or right-of-way in which a public sewer has been installed shall
pay to the Town a capital charge. Said capital charge shall be applicable
whether the structure or its sanitary disposal system is connected to
B.
§ 223-7 CHARTER § 223-8
C:219
the public sewer or not. Said capital charge shall also be applicable
to any vacant lot that is potentially a buildable lot. In such cases,
the capital charge will be deferred until such time as a habitable
structure is constructed on the lot. Said capital charge for Phase I of
the Marshfield Wastewater Treatment Project shall be the owner's pro
rata share of 60% of the annual debt retirement on the net cost to the
Town for the construction of the Wastewater Treatment Project.
Betterment charges.
Sewer systems installed in streets, after the completion of Phase
I of the Marshfield Wastewater Treatment Project, shall be
constructed wholly or partially under betterments as determined
by majority vote of the Town Meeting. Whether a street will be
done under betterments shall be contingent upon an affirmative
vote by a majority of the Board of Public Works and funds being
made available to construct said betterments. The amounts of the
betterment charges shall be as established by the DPW from time
to time. Said betterment charges shall be determined so that the
total of such charges will not be greater than the actual net cost
to the Town of the sewerage collection system constructed by
the Town including the portion of the building sewers in public
streets and right-of-way, the collecting sewers, pumping stations,
treatment plant and ocean outfall. Costs associated with the
capacity of such facilities provided for expansion of the system
to presently unsewered areas will be excluded from the current
betterment charges.
(1)
Betterments shall be assessed upon the owner(s) of all properties
situated within the Town and abutting on any street, common
driveway, alley or right-of-way in which a public sewer has been
installed under the provisions of this Subsection C. Betterment
assessments shall be based upon a uniform unit method as
provided by MGL c. 83, § 15. The Board of Public Works shall,
with respect to those portions of the Wastewater Treatment Project
constructed pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, calculate
separately the cost of general benefit facilities from that of special
benefit facilities. A proportionate share of the construction costs
of the general benefit facilities shall be paid by all users, served
by those portions of the sewer system constructed under this
subsection, who receive benefit from such facilities.
(2)
C.
Sewer user charges. The owner(s) of houses, buildings or other
properties used for human occupancy, employment, recreation or other
purposes situated within the Town and abutting on any street, common
driveway, alley or right-of-way in which a public sewer has been
installed shall each pay a non-capital sewer charge; provided, however,
that such charge shall not be assessed to owners who have been
granted an extension of time to connect, pursuant to § 223-4C of these
rules and regulations, during the time such extension is in effect. The
non-capital charge shall be as established by the Department of Public

§ 223-9. Conflicting provisions; severability. [Amended 4-24-2017
ATM by Art. 10]
If a provision of this bylaw is found to be in conflict with any provision of any
zoning, building, safety or health or other bylaw or regulation of the Town of
Marshfield, the State of Massachusetts or the federal government existing
on or subsequent to the effective date of this bylaw, that provision which
in the judgment of the Town establishes the higher standard of safety and
protection of health shall prevail, and that provision which sets the lower
standard is hereby declared invalid to the extent that it is found to be in
conflict with the provision which sets the higher standard and is hereby
repealed. The invalidity of any section, clause, sentence, or provision of this
bylaw shall not affect the validity of any other part of this bylaw which can
be given effect without such invalid part or parts.
Works from time to time. The calculation of the non-capital charge
under Phase I of the Marshfield Wastewater Treatment Project shall
be the pro rata share of the summation of all the facilities' operating
and maintenance costs for a given year plus the capital cost as defined
under Subsection B. The normal non-capital charges shall be based
on water use wherever possible. If records of metered use are not
available or do not properly reflect the quantity of waste discharged,
the non-capital charge shall be based upon estimated water use or
on actual measurement of the volume of waste discharged into the
sewerage system. Sewer surcharges may be levied on users whose
waste characteristics are above normal strength. [Amended
10-19-1981 STM by Art. 2]
Industrial cost recovery. Industrial users connected to the sewerage
system shall make repayments to the Town of Marshfield for that
portion of the federal grants under Public Law 92-500 allocable to
the construction of wastewater facilities used for the collection and
treatment of industrial wastes as defined in 40 CFR Part 35, Subpart
E. The amounts and terms of the industrial cost recovery payments
shall be as established by the Board of Public Works in accordance with
40 CFR Part 35, Subpart E, and subject to the approval of the United
States Environmental Protection Agency.
E.
Sewer connection fee. For residential and commercial services a sewer
connection fee shall be paid to the Town at the time the application to
connect to the Town sewer system is filed. The sewer connection fee
shall be determined by the Board of Public Works and based on the net
value of the sewer system, capacity of the wastewater facility, capital
improvements, calculated fee per residential unit and average daily
flow for proposed connection. Said fee shall be no less than $1,000.
The Board of Public Works shall review and, if it deems appropriate,
adjust the fee every three years. The sewer connection fee or portion
thereof may be waived at the discretion of the Board of Public Works
for applicants paying sewer betterments in sewered areas developed
subsequent to Phase I. [Amended 4-26-2010 ATM by Art. 19]

C:222
Authority. This bylaw is adopted by the Town under MGL c. 40, § 21E,
and its authority to implement and regulate sewer usage and the
disposal of waste into the public sewer system of the Town of
Marshfield.
B.
Purpose. The purpose of this bylaw is to authorize the establishment
of due dates for municipal sewer and sewer use bills, charges and

expenses on unpaid and/or late charges, and, where appropriate, the
termination of sewer service and the recovery of fees and expenses to

C.
Definitions. See applicable definitions under § 223-2 which are
incorporated herein by reference. A "person" shall mean any person,
including individuals, corporations, trusts, partnerships, limited

shall mean all users of the Town's public sewer system, irrespective
of any persons responsibility for billing purposes for sewer charges

payment of municipal sewer charges and bills by any person, including

out with the Town, acting by and through its Superintendent of Public
Works and/or Treasurer-Collector.
F.

bill(s) remain unpaid, a shut-off notice in the form of a certified letter
G.
§ 223-15 CHARTER § 223-15
C:223
will be sent initiating a forty-eight-hour advance notice period prior

or agents of the Town and/or Board of Public Works, may, upon any

serious illness, a letter from a doctor, nurse practitioner, physician
assistant or the local Board of Health shall be required; however,
a phone call from the doctor's office may be accepted temporarily,
but a letter must be sent within five days to the Town, acting by
and through its Superintendent of Public Works and/or Treasurer-

environmental tobacco smoke as a known human carcinogen (U.S. DHHS,
2000, citing Cal. EPA, 1997). Therefore, the Town of Marshfield recognizes
presumptive evidence of financial hardship unless otherwise
determined by the Board of Public Works. In the event of any breach
of the payment plan, termination of services may resume in accordance
with this bylaw.
Costs, expenses and reasonable counsel fees. The Town is authorized
to recover from any person, including individuals, corporations, trusts,
partnerships, limited liability company, or other entity whose payments
are in arrears and/or sewer users or sewer consumers its costs,
expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees associated with unpaid sewer
bills, charges and assessments, interest rates on unpaid charges,
collection of fees and expenses, and costs to restore services.

§ 250-23. Permit required; indemnification; conditions.
No person, except a duly authorized officer of the Town, shall, without a
permit from the Board of Public Works, dig up any portion of a public
way. Every permit granted shall specify the length of time it shall continue
in force. Every person receiving such permit shall execute a written
agreement to indemnify and save harmless the Town against all damages,
attorneys' fees or costs by reason of any claim for damages arising out of the
existence of such excavation. The Board of Public Works may impose such
conditions, terms and limitations as it shall see fit in respect to erecting

repair or reconstruction of a publicly maintained street, the Board of Public
Works, or its representative, will give written notice to the Town
departments and to all public utilities which it knows to have pipes, wires or
other facilities in or under the street proposed for repair. Notice shall also
be given by publishing the same once in a newspaper of general circulation
in the Town. Such notices shall be given at least 60 days prior to the date
upon which construction is to begin.
§ 250-25. Installation of facilities prior to improvement.
Any person or utility wishing to install pipes, wires or other facilities under
the street proposed for repairs shall have 60 days from the date such notice
is published in which to install or lay any such facility. If an extension of
time is needed by a person or utility for the installation of such facilities,
the person or utility shall make a written application to the Board of Public
Works explaining fully the reasons for requesting such an extension of
time. In making its decision, the Board shall weigh the public interest
in expeditious completion of the proposed street improvements against
any hardship which may be suffered by the applicant if an extension is
not granted. The decision of the Board shall be final as to any requested
extension.

of three years after conclusion of construction, unless in the judgment of
§ 250-23 CHARTER § 250-26
C:269
the Board of Public Works an emergency condition exists or the necessity
for making such installation could not reasonably have been foreseen at the
time such notice was given. If a permit is granted during such three-year
period, the Town may impose extraordinary conditions on the permittee
as necessary to preserve the structural condition of the pavement to the
same extent as if the street had not been opened, and to blend the patch
necessitated by the street opening with the existing pavement.
§ 250-27. Violations and penalties.
Any person or entity found having opened the public right-of-way without
the proper authority or permit shall be assessed the appropriate fee plus a

A.
This bylaw seeks to protect wetlands values by furthering the
legislative purpose embodied in the Wetlands Protection Act through

any land under said waters or any land subject to tidal action, coastal storm
flowage, or flooding, or land within a distance of 100 feet from any of
the aforesaid resource areas (buffer zone), and land within 200 feet of a
river, without filing written notice of his intention so to remove, fill, dredge

§ 294-3. Procedure.
A notice of intent (hereinafter referred to as notice) shall be sent

A.
At the time of filing the notice, the applicant shall pay a filing fee

comply with any provisions of this bylaw, nor may these areas include any
property of which the ownership has been transferred subsequent to the
effective date of this bylaw, if such property was a part of the area required
for compliance with the dimensional regulations applicable to the lot from
which such transfer was made.
§ 305-6.04. Separation of lots.

Recognizing that parking requirements in the underlying zoning district
may hamper development of village-style land use and development, the
Board may, by way of special permit, permit the reduction of the parking
space requirements to 80% of that required in the Table of Off-Street
Parking Regulations where uses on adjacent lots generate substantially
different peak-hour parking lot use patterns. In determining the appropriate
§ 305-8.02 CHARTER § 305-8.05
C:361
reduction, if any, the Board may give consideration to the hours of usage
of the proposed use/structure, hours of usage of other uses/structures
within the district, amount of shared parking with other uses, the opinions
of merchants, residents and municipal officials as to the adequacy or
inadequacy of parking spaces within the specific area of the proposed
use/structure, as well as other relevant information to assist the Board in
determining the need for additional parking for motor vehicles.
§ 305-8.06. Location and design of parking spaces. [Amended
4-24-2017 ATM by Art. 12]
Required off-street parking spaces shall be provided on the same lot as
the principal use they are required to serve or, when practical difficulties
as determined by the Board prevent their establishment upon the same
lot, they shall be established no further than 300 feet from the premises
to which they are appurtenant. The Board may permit parking spaces to
be located greater than 300 feet but in no case further than 500 feet
from the premises to which they are appurtenant where the applicant
provides pedestrian improvements in addition to those required by this
bylaw, including but not limited to benches, lighting, bicycle racks and
street trees, to the corridor between the parking spaces and the premises
to which they are appurtenant.
Parking facilities and appurtenant driveways shall be designed to the
extent feasible so as to gather pedestrians out of vehicle travel lanes
and to maximize the safety and convenience of pedestrians walking
between parked cars and business entrances as well as between
external points and locations on site.

required by this bylaw. Such conditions shall be imposed in writing,
and the applicant may be required to post bond or other security for
compliance with said conditions in an amount satisfactory to the Board.
In order that the Board may determine that the above-mentioned
restrictions are to be met, a site plan shall be submitted, in
quadruplicate, to the Board by the applicant. Said site plan shall show,
among other things, all existing and proposed buildings, structures,
parking spaces, driveway openings, driveways, service areas, and other
open uses, all facilities for sewage, refuse, and other waste disposal and
for surface water drainage, and all landscape features, such as fences,
walls, planting areas and walks.
The Board shall, within 10 days after receipt thereof, transmit
one copy of such plan to the Planning Board. The Planning Board
may, in its discretion, investigate the case and report in writing its
recommendation to the Board.
(1)
The Board shall not take final action on such plan until it has
received a report thereon from the Planning Board or until said
Planning Board has allowed 30 days to elapse after receipt of such
plan without submission of a report thereon.

§ 305-10.12. Permit for extension or alteration of nonconforming
use or structure.
Upon written application duly made to the Board and subsequent public
hearing duly advertised by the Board, the Board may, in appropriate cases,
subject to the applicable conditions set forth in Articles XI, XII, XIII, and
XV of this bylaw and elsewhere, and subject to other appropriate conditions
and safeguards, grant a special permit for an extension or alteration of
The Board may authorize a variance for a particular use of a parcel of
land or to an existing building thereon from the terms of this bylaw
where, owing to circumstances relating to the soil conditions, shape,
or topography of such land or structures and especially affecting such
parcel or such building but not affecting generally the district in which
it is located, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this bylaw would
involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the applicant,
and where desirable relief may be granted without substantial
detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially
derogating from the intent or purpose of this bylaw. The Board may
impose conditions, safeguards and limitations both of time and of use,
including the continued existence of any particular structures but
excluding any condition, safeguards or limitations based upon the
continued ownership of the land or structures to which the variance
pertains by the applicant, petitioner or any owner. If the rights
authorized by a variance are not exercised within one year of the date
of the grant of such variance they shall lapse and may be reestablished
only after notice and a new hearing pursuant to this section.
A.
Before any variance is granted, the Board must find all of the following
conditions to be present:
Conditions and circumstances are unique to the applicant's lot,
structure or building and do not apply to the neighboring lands,
structures or buildings in the same district.
(1)
Strict application of the provisions of this bylaw would deprive
the applicant of reasonable use of the lot, structure or building
in a manner equivalent to the use permitted to be made by other
owners of their neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the
same district. [Amended 4-24-2017 ATM by Art. 12]
(2)
The unique conditions and circumstances are not the result of
actions of the applicant taken subsequent to the adoption of this
bylaw.
(3)
Relief, if approved, will not cause substantial detriment to the
public good or impair the purposes and intent of this bylaw.
(4)
Relief, if approved, will not constitute a grant of special privilege
inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the
district.

a nonconforming use or structure. The Board may, subject to the same
conditions, grant a special permit for expansion of parking and other
accessory uses appropriate to said nonconforming use or structure or
expanded nonconforming use or structure.
Before granting a special permit for extension or alteration of such
nonconforming use or structure, the Board, with due regard to the
nature and condition of all adjacent structures and uses and the district
within which the same is located, shall find all of the following general
conditions to be fulfilled:
The use requested for extension or alteration is listed in the Table
of Use Regulations as permitted, or permitted by special permit, in
at least one district within the Town.
(1)
The requested extension or alteration of the use or structure is
essential or desirable to the public convenience or welfare.
(2)
The requested extension or alteration of the use or structure will
not further create undue traffic congestion or unduly impair
pedestrian safety.
(3)
The requested extension or alteration of the use or structure will
not further overload any public water, drainage, or sewer system
or any other municipal system to such an extent that the requested
use or any developed use in the immediate area or in any other area
of the Town will be unduly subjected to hazards affecting health,
safety, or the general welfare.
(4)
Any special regulations for the use or structure as set forth in
Article XII are fulfilled.
(5)
The requested extension or alteration of the use or structure will
not impair the integrity or character of the district or adjoining
zones, nor be detrimental to the health, morals, or welfare.
(6)
The requested extension or alteration of the use or structure will
not bring the use or structure into violation of, or further violation
of, the regulations set forth in Article VI, Table of Dimensional and
Density Regulations, unless a variance is also granted subject to
the provisions of § 305-10.11 of this bylaw.
(7)
The extended or altered use or structure will not be substantially
different in character.
(8)
The extended or altered use or structure will not be more
detrimental or objectionable to the neighborhood.
(9)
The extended or altered use or structure does not cause violation
or further violation of Article VIII of this bylaw.
(10)
A.
The Board shall also impose in addition to any applicable conditions
specified in this bylaw such applicable conditions as it finds reasonably

appropriate to safeguard the neighborhood, or otherwise serve the
purpose of this bylaw, including, but not limited to, the following: front,
side, or rear yards greater than the minimum required by this bylaw;
screening buffers or planting strips, fences, or walls, as specified by
the Board; modification of the exterior appearances of the structures;
limitation upon the size, number of occupants, method or time of
operation, time duration of permit, or extent of facilities; regulation
of number and location of driveways or other traffic features; and offstreet
parking or loading or other special features beyond the minimum
required by the bylaw. Such conditions shall be imposed in writing
and the applicant may be required to post bond or other security for
compliance with said conditions in an amount satisfactory to the Board.
In order that the Board may determine that the above-mentioned
restrictions are to be met, a site plan prepared by a registered land
surveyor or registered professional civil engineer shall be submitted
with six copies to the Board by the applicant. Said site plan shall show,
among other things, all existing and proposed buildings, structures,
parking spaces, driveway openings, driveways, service areas, and other
open uses, all facilities for sewage, refuse, and other waste disposal,
and for surface water drainage, wetlands, and all landscape features,
such as fences, walls, planting areas and walks. [Amended 4-24-2017
ATM by Art. 12]
The Board shall, within 10 days after receipt thereof, transmit
one copy of such plan to the Planning Board. The Planning Board
may, in its discretion, investigate the case and report in writing its
recommendation to the Board.
(1)
The Board shall not take final action on such plan until it has
received a report thereon from the Planning Board or until said
Planning Board has allowed 30 days to elapse after receipt of such

J.
Purposes. The purpose of the bylaw is to allow for flexibility and
creativity in the design of residential developments; encourage
preservation of scenic vistas, natural resources and existing and
potential municipal water supplies; facilitate construction and
maintenance of streets, utilities and public services in a more
economical and efficient manner; encourage a less sprawling form of
development that consumes less open land and conforms to existing
topography and natural features better than a standard subdivision;
preserve open space areas for active and passive recreational use,
including the provision of neighborhood parks and trails; encourage
provision of diverse housing opportunities and integration of a variety
of housing types; and further the goals and policies of the Town's
Comprehensive Plan.
A.
Definition.
OPEN SPACE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT (OSRD)  A singlefamily
detached residential development in which the buildings are
clustered together with reduced lot sizes and frontage. The land not
included in building lots is permanently preserved as open space as
defined herein. OSRD is the preferred form of residential development
and/or redevelopment in the Town of Marshfield for residential
developments of five or more lots.
B.
Applicability. The Planning Board may grant a special permit for an
OSRD for any parcel or contiguous parcels of at least five acres in any
C.
§ 305-11.03 MARSHFIELD CODE § 305-11.04
C:380
district permitting single-family residences subject to the regulations
and conditions herein.
Procedural requirements.
Rules and regulations. The Planning Board shall adopt rules and
regulations consistent with the provisions of this bylaw and shall
file them with the Town Clerk. Such rules shall address the size,
content, and number of copies of preliminary and definitive plans
and other submittals and the procedure for the review of special
permits.32
(1)
Density/number of dwelling units.
The number of dwelling units permitted shall not exceed that
which would be permitted under a conventional subdivision
that complies with the Marshfield Zoning Bylaw and the
Subdivision Rules and Regulations of the Planning Board and
other applicable laws and regulations of the Town or the state.
The total number of dwelling units shall be determined by the
following formula:
[Total area of land subject to the application] - [Area of
wetlands/water bodies] = Applicable land area
[Applicable land area] x [0.90] divided by minimum lot area =
Total number of dwelling units
(a)
A preliminary subdivision plan may be submitted to assist in
demonstrating the allowable number of units. If the parcel lies
in more than one zoning district, the total for each district shall
be calculated separately.
(b)
(2)
Review and decision. The Planning Board shall act on applications
according to the procedure specified in MGL c. 40A, § 9, with
the exception that a decision shall be rendered within the time
frame for definitive subdivision plans specified in MGL c. 41, § 81U,
whenever this time frame is shorter. Public hearings for the
subdivision application and the special permit application shall be
held concurrently.
(3)
Criteria for special permit decision.
Findings.
The Planning Board may approve the development upon
finding that it complies with the purposes and standards
of the OSRD bylaw and is at least equivalent to a
conventional subdivision with regard to protection of
natural features and scenic resources of the site. The

D.
32.Editor's Note: See Ch. 411, Open Space Residential Development.
§ 305-11.04 CHARTER § 305-11.04
C:381
Planning Board shall consider the following criteria in
making its decision:
Upland open space as required by this bylaw has been
provided and generally conforms with Subsection H of
this bylaw.
[a]
Proposed streets have been aligned to provide
vehicular access to each house in a reasonable and
economical manner. Lots and streets have been
located to avoid or minimize adverse impacts on open
space areas and to provide views of and access to the
open space for the lots.
[b]
Lots meet the applicable dimensional requirements of
Subsection E of the OSRD bylaw and the Marshfield
Zoning Bylaw.
[c]
The Board's findings, including the basis of such findings,
shall be stated in the written decision of approval,
conditional approval or denial of the special permit. The
Board shall impose conditions in its decision as needed to
ensure compliance with the bylaw.
[2]
Time limit. Special permits are granted for a period of two
years and shall lapse if substantial use or construction has not
commenced by such date, except for good cause shown.
(b)
Relationship to Subdivision Control Law. Nothing contained
herein shall exempt a subdivision from compliance with other
applicable provisions of these bylaws or the Marshfield
Subdivision Rules and Regulations, nor shall it affect the right
of the Board of Health and Planning Board to approve,
condition or disapprove a plan in accordance with the
provisions of such rules and regulations and the Subdivision
Control Law.33
(c)
Standards and dimensional requirements. Where the requirements of
this section differ from or conflict with the requirements in the Table
of Dimensional and Density Regulations found elsewhere in this bylaw,
the requirements of this section shall prevail for OSRD developments.
Minimum lot size: 1/2 the square footage otherwise required by the
zoning district in which the project is located or 15,000 square feet,
whichever is less.
(1)
Minimum frontage. The minimum frontage may be reduced from
the frontage otherwise required in the zoning district; provided,
however, that no lot shall have less than 75 feet of frontage and
(2)
E.
33.Editor's Note: See Ch. 405, Subdivision of Land, and MGL c. 41, §§ 81K to 81GG.
§ 305-11.04 MARSHFIELD CODE § 305-11.04
C:382
provided further that such frontage reduction shall apply only to
lots fronting on proposed internal roadways.
Lot shape. All building lots must be able to contain a circle of a
minimum diameter of 75 feet from the front lot line to the rear
building line.
(3)
Setbacks. The Planning Board may permit a reduction by up to
1/2 of the setbacks otherwise listed in the Table of Dimensional
and Density Regulations in this bylaw, if the Board finds that such
reduction will result in better design and improved protection of
natural and scenic resources and will otherwise comply with the
bylaw. Notwithstanding this provision or the requirements of the
Zoning Bylaw, every dwelling fronting on the proposed roadways
shall be set back a minimum of 15 feet from the roadway rightof-
way and a minimum of 30 feet from the outer perimeter of the
land subject to the application. This thirty-foot setback shall be
maintained in a naturally vegetated state to screen and buffer the
development. Wherever feasible, construction of the dwelling at
the front setback line is encouraged.
(4)
Required open space. All land area not utilized for lots, roads, and
drainage shall be set aside as permanent open space. A minimum of
50% of the upland area of the parcel ("applicable land area") shall
be provided as open space. Applicants are encouraged to include
wetlands and water bodies within the open space; however, they do
not count toward the open space requirement. Roadway layouts do
not count toward the open space requirement.
(5)
Permissible uses of open space.
Purposes. Open space shall be used solely for recreation,
conservation, agriculture or forestry purposes by residents of the
OSRD development and/or the public. Where appropriate, multiple
use of open space is encouraged. At least half of the required open
space may be required by the Planning Board to be left in a natural
state. The proposed use of the open space shall be specified in the
application. If several uses are proposed, the plans shall specify
what uses will occur in what areas. The Board may approve or
disapprove the proposed uses.
(1)
Recreation lands. Where appropriate to the topography and natural
features of the site, the Planning Board may require that at least
10% of the open space or two acres (whichever is less) be of a
shape, slope, location and condition to provide an informal field
for recreation or community gardens for the residents of the
subdivision.
(2)
Leaching facilities. Subject to the approval of the Board of Health,
as otherwise required by law, the Planning Board may permit a
portion of the open space to be used for components of sewage
disposal systems serving the subdivision, where the Planning Board
(3)
F.
§ 305-11.04 CHARTER § 305-11.04
C:383
finds that such use will not be detrimental to the character, quality,
or use of the open space, wetlands, or water bodies and enhances
the site plan. The Planning Board shall require adequate legal
safeguards and covenants that such facilities shall be permanently
maintained by the lot owners. Where a parcel straddles the
boundary of the Water Resource Protection District, leaching
facilities shall be located outside of the district to the maximum
extent feasible.
Accessory structures. Up to 5% of the open space may be set
aside and designated to allow for the construction of structures and
facilities accessory to the proposed use of the open space including
parking. With this exception, no other impervious areas may be
included within the open space.
(4)
Ownership of open space.
Ownership options. At the developer's option and subject to
approval by the Planning Board, all areas to be protected as open
space shall be:
Conveyed to the Town to be placed under the care, custody and
control of the Conservation Commission, and be accepted by it
for a park or open space use;
(a)
Conveyed to a nonprofit organization, the purpose of which
is the conservation or preservation of open space, with a
conservation restriction as specified in Subsection G(2) below.
Such organization shall be acceptable to the Town as a bona
fide conservation organization; or
(b)
Conveyed to a corporation or trust owned or to be owned by
the owners of lots or residential units within the development
("homeowners' association") and placed under conservation
restriction as specified in Subsection G(2) below. If such a
corporation or trust is utilized, ownership thereof shall pass
with conveyance of the lots or residential units. The developer
is responsible for the maintenance of the open space and other
common facilities until such time as the association is capable
of assuming such responsibility. Thereafter, the members of
the association shall share the cost of maintaining these areas.
The Planning Board shall require the applicant to provide
documentation that the homeowners' association is an
automatic (mandatory) association that has been established
prior to the conveyance of any lots within the subdivision.
(c)
(1)
Permanent restriction. In any case where open space is not
conveyed to the Town, a permanent conservation, agricultural or
historical preservation restriction approved by Town Counsel and
enforceable by the Town, conforming to the standards of the
Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental
Affairs, Division of Conservation Services, shall be recorded to
(2)
G.
§ 305-11.04 MARSHFIELD CODE § 305-11.04
C:384
ensure that such land shall be kept in an open or natural state
and not be built for residential use or developed for accessory uses
such as parking or roadways except as permitted by this bylaw
and approved by the Planning Board. Restrictions shall provide for
periodic inspection of the open space by the Town. Such restriction
shall be submitted to the Planning Board prior to approval of
the project and recorded at the Registry of Deeds/Land Court
simultaneously with recording of the endorsed definitive
subdivision plan. A management plan may be required by the
Planning Board which describes how existing woods, fields,
meadows or other natural areas shall be maintained with good
conservation practices.
Encumbrances. All areas to be set aside as open space shall be
conveyed free of any mortgage interest, security interest, liens or
other encumbrances.
(3)
Maintenance of open space. In any case where open space is not
conveyed to the Town, the Town shall be granted an easement
over such land sufficient to ensure its perpetual maintenance as
conservation or recreation land. Such easement shall provide that
in the event the trust or other owner fails to maintain the open
space in reasonable condition, the Town may, after notice to the lot
owners and public hearing, enter upon such land to maintain it in
order to prevent or abate a nuisance. The cost of such maintenance
by the Town shall be assessed against the properties within the
development and/or to the owner of the open space. The Town may
file a lien against the lots to ensure payment of such maintenance
expenses.

10-19-2009 STM by Art. 11; 10-27-2014 STM by Art. 18]
This section of the Zoning Bylaw is to allow a Planned Mixed-Use
Development (PMUD) Overlay District within a portion of the Industrial
District as shown on the Zoning Map.
hazardous areas such as floodplains and steep slopes. The
development plan shall take advantage of the natural topography
of the parcel and cuts and fills shall be minimized.
Open space may be in more than one parcel provided that the size,
shape and location of such parcels are suitable for the designated
uses. Where feasible, these parcels shall be linked by foot trails.
(3)
Where the proposed development abuts or includes a body of water
or a wetland, these areas and a minimum fifty-foot buffer to such
areas should be incorporated into the open space. Where
appropriate, reasonable access shall be provided to shorelines.
(4)
The maximum number of house lots compatible with good design
shall abut the open space and all house lots shall have reasonable
physical and visual access to the open space through internal
roads, sidewalks or paths. An exception may be made for resource
areas vulnerable to trampling or other disturbance.
(5)
Open space shall be provided with adequate access, by a strip of
land at least 20 feet wide, suitable for a footpath, from one or more
streets in the development.
(6)
Where a proposed development abuts land held for conservation
purposes, the development shall be configured to minimize adverse
impacts to abutting conservation land. Trail connections shall be
provided where appropriate.
(7)
Purpose. The purpose of this planned mixed-use development section is
as follows:
To provide an opportunity to comprehensively plan large tracts of
land in a pedestrian-friendly, campus-like setting, around a public
green.
(1)
To ensure high-quality site planning, architecture and landscape
design to create a distinct visual character and identity for the
development that provides the Town with a mixed-use environment
with convenience and amenities.
(2)
To ensure any potential traffic impacts of the planned mixed-use
development are properly mitigated and in keeping with the
character of the Town of Marshfield.

To generate positive tax revenue, while providing the opportunity
for new business growth and additional local jobs.
(4)
Process. The applicant files a special permit application with the
Planning Board serving as the special permit granting authority (SPGA)
for an element (or combination of elements) within the planned mixeduse
district. A new element is a tract in single or consolidated
ownership at the time of application and shall be a minimum of seven
acres in size and contain at least 150 feet of frontage. An element
can be planned for and developed in phases. Existing elements shall
not require a minimum tract size. An element may be a single use
or group of uses and may be broken into phases. Each element shall
contain or provide for the overall road network, roadway drainage, a
public green, park, and/or playground, bike and pedestrian ways, lots
and proposed uses. A proposed element may, with the written approval
of the Planning Board based on an express finding that off-site public
improvements are in the public interest, provide financial support to
off-site public improvements in lieu of on-site improvements as part of
the application. When site plan approval is required for the proposed
uses in the PMUD, the site plan approval authority shall be the Planning
Board.
B.
Applicability and uses. In addition to the uses allowed in the 1-1 Zone
that are not specifically prohibited in the PMUD, the following uses may
be allowed by special permit: retail and service; eating and drinking
places; banks; membership club; hotel; educational campus; medical
facility or offices; general offices; research facilities; other amusement/
recreation service; mixed-use buildings with commercial on first floor
and residential units above with a base density of six units per acre
(subject to affordability requirements under Subsection F below); agerestricted
adult village residential units with a base density of four
units per acre (subject to affordability requirements under Subsection
F below); attached nursing, rest or convalescent home not to exceed 24
beds per acre.
C.
Required performance standards.
Uses shall be grouped together to maximize pedestrian access by
connecting sidewalks and pathways. Buildings, when abutting a
public green, shall be oriented around a public green and not Route
139 (Plain Street).
(1)
Access to Route 139 (Plain Street) from a proposed development or
elements within the PMUD shall be through a secondary street as
defined in the Planning Board Subdivision Rules and Regulations at
a signalized intersection.35

Development of the future elements within the PMUD shall be
required to balance commercial and other nonresidential
developments with residential elements. Future elements that are
all residential (age-restricted adult village) shall be preceded by a
minimum of 10,000 square feet of commercial development.
(4)
The base number of dwelling units in the PMUD shall be
determined by the following formula: Total area of land subject
to the application minus (-) wetlands/water bodies multiplied (*)
by applicable base density add (+) affordable housing and density
bonus (see Subsection F) equals (=) Total number of dwelling units.
(5)
Mixed-use residential units within the PMUD shall provide a
minimum of 1.25 parking spaces for each bedroom. Age-restricted
adult village/attached residential units within the PMUD shall
provide a minimum of two parking spaces per unit. Enclosed or
covered parking may be allowed as an accessory use in the rear of
the first floor of a mixed-use building.
(6)
The majority of the parking shall be located to the rear or sides
of buildings. All parking and loading areas shall be completely
screened from Route 139 (Plain Street) by a minimum fifty-footwide
raised and landscaped buffer. Parking lots and loading areas
(7)
§ 305-11.05 MARSHFIELD CODE § 305-11.05
C:388
shall be appropriately screened from roadways within the overlay
district by a minimum twenty-foot-wide raised and landscaped
buffer. Appropriately designed view corridors of buildings from the
roadways within the overlay district shall be allowed.
Reduction in parking space requirements may be permitted by
written request in the application as part of the granting of the
special permit where by design and use it is shown to the Planning
Board's satisfaction that the parking is compatibly shared by
multiple uses. However, in no case shall a parking requirement
reduction exceed 20% of those parking spaces required under
normal application of requirements for the nonresidential uses
proposed.
(8)
Individual retail establishments shall be limited to a maximum
gross floor area of 55,000 square feet. An individual retail
establishment may be increased to 65,000 square feet where the
Planning Board finds that individual sections of the retail
establishment front a public green with access and windows or
where the additional space is used as small retail uses lining the
wall facing the public green of the large retail establishment.
(9)
All elements that create mixed-use residential or attached
residential units are required to provide affordable housing in
compliance with Subsection F. All affordable housing created by
this bylaw shall be Local Initiative Program (LIP) dwelling units
in compliance with the requirements of the Massachusetts
Department of Housing and Community Development LIP Program.
Affordable housing units will count toward the Town's Subsidized
Housing Inventory, in accordance with MGL c. 40B.
(10)
All residential development which occurs as a result of this bylaw
shall meet the affordable housing requirements and shall be
entitled to a density bonus as follows: The number of affordable
units and density bonus units shall equal the number of base
density units multiplied by 25% and rounded up to the next even
number divided by two. [Example: A base density of 9 units will
result in 9 base density units plus 4 units (0.25 x 9 units = 2.25
units rounded up to 4 units, 2 affordable units and 2 density bonus
units) or 13 units in total. A base density of 31 units will result in 31
base density units plus 8 units (0.25 x 31 units = 7.5 units rounded
up to 8 units, 4 affordable units and 4 density bonus units) or 39
total units.]
(11)
The development site design shall be integrated into the existing
terrain and surrounding landscape to provide the least amount of
site disturbance, and shall be designed, including with appropriate
noise, light and open space buffering and screening, to protect
abutting properties, neighborhood and community amenities.
Building sites shall, to the extent deemed feasible by the Planning
Board:

driveways that in the opinion of the Planning Board have sufficient
width, suitable grades, and adequate construction to provide for
the needs of vehicular traffic generated by the proposed
development. The development shall maximize the convenience
and safety of vehicular, bike and pedestrian movement within the
site and in relation to adjacent ways through proper layout,
location and design.
(13)
All dead-end roads and driveways shall terminate in a cul-de-sac or
provide, if approved by the Planning Board as part of the special
permit, other accommodations for vehicles to reverse direction
when it is deemed in the public interest to do so. Turnaround areas
shall be designed to accommodate the largest emergency vehicles
of the Town of Marshfield. Dead-end streets and connecting
driveways shall not exceed 800 feet in length, measured from the
intersection of the road that provides access.
(14)
The mass, proportion and scale of the building, roof shape, roof
pitch, and proportions and relationships between doors and
windows should be harmonious among themselves. Plans shall
provide information and elevations to show massing of buildings,
height and spacing between buildings. Plans shall provide a table
with properties, entity, use, area (in acres) and area (in percentage)
for both the proposed element and total for the overlay district.
(15)
Architectural details, including elevation plans of all sides, shall
be submitted of new buildings and additions, and textures of walls
and roof materials should be harmonious with the building's overall
architectural style and should preserve and enhance the historic
character of Marshfield.
(16)
The building's location shall be oriented parallel or perpendicular
to the public green(s) and/or street. Where the minimum setback
cannot be maintained, the applicant shall provide adequate spatial
definitions through the use of walls, fences and/or other elements
which will maintain the street line.
(17)
The building's main entrance may be placed to the side of the front
facade to facilitate access to parking.
(18)
§ 305-11.05 MARSHFIELD CODE § 305-11.05

pedestrian activities.
(27)
A public green, playground, recreation field or other recreational
amenities (trails/paths/bikeways) shall be required for each
element of development within the PMUD. The public green(s)
shall be a minimum of 1/2 acre in size per every seven acres
within an element and shall be designed as a bike- and pedestrianfriendly
park. The public green(s) shall contain some combination
of benches, tables, playground equipment, sidewalks, lighting and
landscaping. Each green shall be used solely for active and passive
recreation purposes and shall be open to the public. The total
(28)
§ 305-11.05 CHARTER § 305-11.05
C:391
acreage of the green in each element may be used toward the
land area calculations to determine allowable density within that
element. The Planning Board may allow for an off-site location for
the public green, playground, recreation field or other recreational
improvement if determined to be in the best interest of Town.
The public green, playground, recreation field or other recreational
improvement requirement may (with Planning Board's approval) be
met by adding to an existing public green, playground or recreation
field or facility.
Setbacks for the overlay district shall be as follows:

Front setbacks for buildings facing the public green(s) may vary.
All other standards for I-1 Zoning Districts contained in the Table
of Dimensional and Density Regulations shall apply.
(30)
In cases where the proposed traffic mitigation is deemed by the
Planning Board to be out of character for the Town, the applicant
may propose additional open space from within the PMUD District
or adjacent districts or may donate an amount equal to the cost of
the proposed mitigation to the Town for the purpose of open space
acquisition. Where permanently protected open space is provided
in lieu of traffic mitigation, said open space shall be at least equal
in area to the total acreage of land of said proposed use.
(31)
Ownership of public green.
Subject to approval by the Planning Board, all areas designated
as public greens shall be either placed under a permanent
conservation restriction or deeded to the Town as a condition
of special permit and site plan approval. If placed under a
conservation restriction, said restriction shall be in a form
approved by Town Counsel and enforceable by the Town,
conforming to the standards of the Massachusetts Executive Office
of Energy and Environmental Affairs, Division of Conservation
Services, that shall be recorded to ensure that such land shall be
kept in an open state. Such restriction shall be submitted to the
Planning Board prior to approval of the project and recorded at

permit.
Maintenance of public green. The Town shall be granted an
easement over such public green sufficient to ensure its perpetual
maintenance as recreation land. Such easement shall provide that
in the event the owner fails to maintain the public green in
reasonable condition, the Town may, after notice to the lot owners
and public hearing, enter upon such land to maintain it in order
to prevent or abate a nuisance. The cost of such maintenance
by the Town shall be assessed against the properties within the
development and/or to the owner of the open space. The Town may
file a lien against the undeveloped lots within the corresponding
phase of the PMUD to ensure payment of such maintenance
expenses.
(2)
Monumentation. Where the boundaries of the public green are not
readily observable in the field, the Planning Board shall require
placement of permanent surveyed bounds sufficient to identify the
location of the public green.
(3)
Affordable housing provisions.
The requirement for affordable units shall be met by one or a
combination of the following methods:
On-site development. Constructed or rehabilitated on the locus
subject to the special permit (preferred); or
(a)
Fees in lieu of construction. The applicant may offer, and the
Planning Board, upon receiving a favorable recommendation
from the Housing Partnership, may approve fees in lieu of
construction of affordable housing units as satisfying the
requirements of Subsection D above. The applicant shall make
the payment of the fee in lieu of construction to the Marshfield
Housing Authority for the sole purpose of creating affordable
housing units in the Town of Marshfield that meet the state's
LIP and add to the Town's Subsidized Housing Inventory as
determined by the Housing Partnership. Fees in lieu of
construction are more fully addressed below. The applicant
may offer, and the Planning Board may accept, a combination
of the on-site and fees in lieu of construction, provided that in
no event shall the total number of affordable units provided
on site and the number of affordable units for which a fee
in lieu of construction is paid be less than the equivalent
number or value of affordable units required for the applicable
development by this bylaw. Note: If affordable units are for
rent, the provisions below for fees in lieu of construction are
not applicable.

The fee in lieu of construction shall be held in trust and in
separate interest-bearing accounts by the Marshfield Housing
Authority for such purpose.
(a)
For each affordable unit for which a fee in lieu of construction
is paid, the cash payment per unit shall be equal to 65% of
the average price being asked for the market-rate units in the
applicable development.
(b)
The fee in lieu of construction shall not result in an increase in
the total number of units contained in the application for the
special permit approved by the Planning Board.
(c)
The Marshfield Housing Authority shall submit to the Housing
Partnership, annually and upon request, reports and other
documentation of the use of its financial accounting for the
fees in lieu of construction.
(d)

§ 305-11.08. Age-restricted adult village. [Amended 5-5-2008 ATM
by Art. 21]
For age-restricted adult village (ARAV) housing not subject to the Table
of Dimensional and Density Regulations nor subject to § 305-10.10 of the
Zoning Bylaw, the following regulations shall apply:
Applicability and use.
The tract of single or consolidated ownership at the time of
application shall be at least six acres in size in all residential zones,
and shall be subject to approval by the Planning Board acting as
the special permit granting authority (SPGA).
(1)
The following uses shall be permitted: attached ARAV housing
units; community facilities such as religious, recreational,
educational or membership club for the exclusive use of the
residents of the ARAV.
(2)
A.
Required performance standards. In addition to other minimum
requirements stated elsewhere in this bylaw, the following
improvements, performance standards and/or conditions are required
for all age-restricted adult villages (ARAV) in the Town of Marshfield:
Yield plan. Applicants shall submit a yield plan that shows how
many acres are available for development after subtracting all
areas needed for stormwater management facilities, roads and
common driveways. The yield plan will determine the total number
of acres available for calculating the number of as-of-right (AOR)
housing units. One acre is equal to one AOR unit.
(1)
Density of housing. The total number of housing units allowed in
an ARAV in all residential zoning districts shall be determined by
the following formula that includes as-of-right units, affordable and
density bonus units. The number of affordable units and density
bonus units shall equal the number of as-of-right (AOR) units
multiplied by 25% and rounded up to the next even number, divided
by two. [Example: A 9-unit AOR development will result in 9 AOR
units plus 4 units (0.25 x 9 units = 2.25 units rounded up to 4 units,
2 affordable units and 2 density bonus units) or 13 units in total. A
31-unit AOR development will result in 31 AOR units plus 8 units
(0.25 x 31 units = 7.5 units rounded up to 8 units, 4 affordable units
and 4 density bonus units) or 39 total units.]
(2)
Natural open space.
In all residential zones, at least 50% of the total tract area
subject to the ARAV special permit application shall be upland
natural open space. The natural open space shall be set aside
as common land and shall be either deeded to the Town or
placed under a conservation restriction, as defined in Article
II, and maintained as permanent open space in private or
(a)

cooperative nonprofit ownership. The SPGA shall provide for
the disposition and control of the open space land in a manner
and form acceptable to it and approved by Town Counsel.
Natural open space is the area of the parcel(s) that is left
undisturbed, in its natural state, as described further in this
section. Areas of natural open space shall be preserved for
wildlife habitat, aquifer protection, historic preservation,
passive recreation and/or forestry management. Natural open
space shall not be used for any of the following activities:
buildings or structures, impervious surfaces, aboveground
utilities or subsurface infrastructure with the exception of
stormwater management facilities as noted below. Natural
open space areas should encompass or protect valuable
natural and cultural resources such as large tracts of forest
land, buffer zones to wetlands and water bodies, significant
trees, scenic views, river valleys, geological features,
archaeological sites, historic trails or ways and open fields.
Natural open space areas shall be contiguous areas of land.
Narrow parcels or portions of lots less than 50 feet wide cannot
be included in required natural open space calculations unless
they are used for access to a walking trail. Walking trails may
be constructed of organic materials such as wood chips or
stone dust.
(b)
For the purpose of calculating the required 50% natural open
space, the area of proposed development activity shall be
enclosed within a polygon. The inside of the polygon shall be
considered the area of the development footprint. Remaining
areas outside of the development footprint, greater than 50
feet in width, shall be used to satisfy the 50% natural open
space requirement. Areas of natural open space may be
managed utilizing standard, accepted forestry practices.
Additional landscape plantings can be planted in natural open
space areas to supplement existing vegetation. Stormwater
management facilities may be allowed within the area of
natural open space, with the approval of the SPGA, if site
conditions leave no other feasible alternatives. However, the
area of the stormwater management facilities shall not be
included in the 50% calculation for natural open space. Areas
disturbed for construction of stormwater management
facilities must be restored with native vegetation.
(c)
Mandatory affordable housing. All ARAVs are required to provide
affordable housing in compliance with § 305-11.14, Inclusionary
zoning for affordable housing. All affordable housing created by
this bylaw shall be Local Initiative Program (LIP) dwelling units

C.
§ 305-11.10 MARSHFIELD CODE § 305-11.10
C:408
a critical intersection or intersections beyond 1,000 feet of the
project boundary, particularly intersections of arterial and collector
roadways which are integral to the circulation of the proposed
development, the Board may require that such intersections
beyond 1,000 feet of the project boundary be included in the
analysis of traffic conditions.
Projected traffic conditions for design year of occupancy.
Statement of design year of occupancy, average annual background
traffic growth, and impacts of proposed developments which have
already been approved or are pending before Town boards.

Projected impact of proposed development. Projected peak hour
and daily traffic generated by the development on roads and ways
in the vicinity of the development; sight lines at the intersections of
the proposed driveways and streets; existing and proposed traffic
controls in the vicinity of the proposed development; and projected
post-development traffic volumes and levels of service of
intersections and streets likely to be affected by the proposed
development [as defined in Subsection C(1) above].
(3)
Proposed mitigation. A plan to minimize traffic and safety impacts
through such means as physical design and layout concepts,
staggered employee work schedules, promoting use of public
transit or car pooling, or other appropriate means, and an interior
traffic and pedestrian circulation plan designed to minimize
conflicts and safety problems. Measures shall be proposed to
achieve the following post-development standards:
Level of service (LOS) at nearby intersections shall not be
degraded more than one level as a result of traffic generated
by the proposed development, nor shall any nearby
intersection be degraded below the Level of D.
(a)
Adjacent streets shall not exceed design capacity at the peak
hour as a result of traffic generated by the proposed
development.
(b)
Safety hazards shall not be created or added to as a result of
traffic generated by the proposed development.
(c)
(4)
Adequacy of mitigation. If the proposed mitigation is deemed by
the Board to be inadequate to achieve the standards set forward
in Subsection C(4) above, the applicant shall provide alternative
proposals to meet the standards, including reduction in the size
of the development; change in proposed uses on the site;
contributions to off-site street and intersection improvements; or
construction of off-site street and intersection improvements.
Where the alternative proposals submitted by the applicant are
inadequate, and where it is determined by the Board that the
primary traffic impacts of the development as proposed affect
Route 139 and where the Town and/or MassHighway has

implementation stage, the applicant may be required as a condition
of special permit approval to contribute funds to a traffic mitigation
fund at least equal to $300 per parking space required to serve the
proposed use under this bylaw. For purposes of this standard:
"Level of service" (LOS) shall be determined according to
criteria set forth by the most recent edition of the manual of
the Transportation Research Board of the National Research
Council;
(a)
"Impacted" means intersections projected to receive at least
5% of the expected traffic generated by the proposed
development, either based upon the total anticipated peak
hour traffic generated by the proposed project or based upon
the total anticipated average daily traffic counts generated by
the proposed project; and
(b)
"Adequate" shall mean a level of service of "B" or better for
rural, scenic and residential streets and for all new streets and
intersections to be created in connection with the project, and
"D" or better for all other streets and intersections.

provision, "parcel" shall mean the entire property subject to an
application and any other contiguous land in common ownership or
control on or after the date of this bylaw (as amended at the Annual
Town Meeting on April 29, 1999). Lots shall not be subdivided for
the purpose of increasing the number of permissible curb cuts.
Curb cuts shall be no closer than 75 feet to existing curb cuts and

or eliminate the required side yard setback on the parcel. In such
cases, the applicant must submit proof of such an arrangement
such as reciprocal easements.
(4)
Curb cut widths shall be the minimum necessary for safe access
and egress. The maximum width of curb cuts shall be 30 feet.
Curb cuts shall be clearly defined with curbing. The special permit
granting authority may modify these width requirements where
necessary to promote safe access to or circulation within the
parcel.
(5)
Applicants proposing redevelopment or expansion of existing uses
shall correct existing access problems by better defining curb cuts
or eliminating excess curb cuts.
(6)
The SPGA may restrict curb cuts to right turn in/right turn out only
when, in the opinion of the SPGA, such restriction is necessary for
public safety and to minimize traffic congestion.
(7)
Where state curb cut approval is required, applicants are
encouraged to apply for such approval concurrently with local
approval in order to maximize coordination between local and state
review.
(8)
Administrative procedures.
The SPGA shall adopt rules and regulations relative to the issuance
of a curb cut permit and file a copy with the Town Clerk. The SPGA
shall follow the procedural requirements for special permits as set
forth in MGL c. 40A, § 9. The SPGA shall also impose, in addition
to any applicable conditions specified in this bylaw, such applicable
conditions as it finds reasonably appropriate to improve traffic flow
or conditions, safety, or otherwise serve the purpose of this bylaw.
Such conditions shall be imposed in writing, and the applicant may
be required to post a bond or other surety for compliance with said
conditions in an amount satisfactory to the Board.

reductions will result in better design and improved protection of
natural and scenic resources; provided, however, that the average
lot size in a development shall not be less than 50% of the
applicable minimum lot size listed in Article VI, § 305-6.02.
(3)
Lot shape. All building lots must be able to contain a circle of a
minimum diameter of 75 feet from the front line to the rear building

C:417
Setbacks. The Planning Board may permit a reduction by up to 1/
2 of the setbacks otherwise listed in the Table of Dimensional and
Density Regulations in the Zoning Bylaw, if the Board finds after
receiving an opinion from the Conservation Commission that such
reduction will not affect natural resources, would result in better
design and improved protection of the natural and scenic resources
and will otherwise comply with the bylaw. Notwithstanding this
provision or the requirements of the Zoning Bylaw, every dwelling
fronting on the proposed roadways shall be set back a minimum
of 15 feet from the roadway right-of-way, and a minimum of 30
feet buffer setback from the outer perimeter of the land subject

and determine the compliance of the development with the
affordability requirements, as described in the LIP Guidelines and
LIP Regulations. The auditing agency shall also ensure the

regulatory agreement and other applicable documents, for
compliance with LIP Guidelines and LIP Regulations. The auditing
agency shall evaluate the affordability of the unit and whether
the unit should remain affordable or funds should be recaptured
and turned over to the Town. Upon completion of its review of
resales information, the auditing agency will deliver to the Housing
Partnership a copy of its findings together with its
recommendations. The Housing Partnership shall make a
determination as whether the unit is to remain affordable or
whether the excess proceeds should be returned to the Town. If the

§ 305-11.15. Wind energy conversion facilities (WECF). [Added
April 2010 ATM by Art. 20]
Purpose and applicability.
Wind energy is an abundant, renewable and nonpolluting energy
resource; its conversion into electricity will reduce our dependency
on nonrenewable energy resources that adversely impact our air
and water quality.
(1)
The purpose of this bylaw is to provide by special permit for the
construction and operation of wind energy conversion facilities
(WECF) or facility and to provide standards for the placement,
design, construction, monitoring, modification and removal of
WECF. These regulations are intended to protect public health
and safety and minimize impacts on scenic, natural and historic
resources of the Town, while allowing wind energy technology to
exist. These regulations also provide adequate financial assurance
for the decommissioning of WECF.
(2)
This bylaw applies to utility-scale, building-mounted and smallscale
ground-mounted WECF proposed to be constructed after the
effective date of this bylaw. Any physical modifications made after
the effective date of this bylaw to existing WECF that materially
alter the type or increase the size of such WECF or other
equipment shall require a special permit.
(3)
A.
General requirements.
No WECF shall be erected, constructed, installed or modified, as
provided in this section, without first obtaining a special permit
from the Board of Appeals. The construction of a WECF shall
be permitted, subject to the issuance of a special permit, in
compliance with § 305-10.10, Special permits, § 305-12.02, Site
plan approval, and the requirements of § 305-5.04, Table of Use
Regulations. WECF must comply with all requirements set forth
in this bylaw. All such WECF shall be constructed and operated
in a manner that minimizes any adverse safety and environmental
impacts. No special permit shall be granted unless the special
permit granting authority, the Board of Appeals, makes findings in
writing that:
(a) The specific site is an appropriate location for such use;
There is not expected to be any serious hazard to pedestrians,
vehicles or abutting properties from the use;
(b)
Adequate and appropriate facilities will be provided for the
proper operation of the use.
(c)
(1)
The special permit decision from the Board of Appeals may impose
reasonable conditions and safeguards that may require the
(2)
B.
§ 305-11.15 CHARTER § 305-11.15
C:425
applicant to implement measures to mitigate adverse impacts of
the WECF, if it is determined by the Board of Appeals that they are
likely to occur.
Wind monitoring or meteorological towers shall be permitted in
all zoning districts that allow for WECF, as listed in § 305-5.04,
Table of Use Regulations. Wind monitoring towers are subject to
the issuance of a building permit for a temporary structure and
are also subject to reasonable regulations concerning the height of
structures, lot area and setback requirements.
(3)
Compliance with all laws, bylaws and regulations. The construction
and operation of all WECF shall be in compliance with all applicable
local, state and federal laws and regulations, including but not limited
to all applicable safety, construction, environmental, electrical,
communications and aviation requirements.
C.
Proof of liability insurance. The applicant shall be required to provide
evidence of liability insurance in an amount and for a duration of time
sufficient to cover loss or damage to persons and structures occasioned

the existing natural grade of the land. WECF may exceed 300 feet
if:
The applicant demonstrates by substantial evidence that such
height reflects industry standards for a similarly sited WECF;
(a)
The additional benefits of a higher tower outweigh any
increased adverse impacts;
(b)
The facility satisfies all other criteria for the granting of a
special permit under the provisions of this section;
(c)
The height of the facility is approved by the FAA and the MA
DOT Aeronautics Division if required.
(d)
(1)
Setbacks. WECF shall be set back a distance equal to the overall
blade tip height plus the required setback in the applicable zoning
district. The Board of Appeals may allow reduced setbacks for
municipally owned WECF if the abutting property is owned by
another Town entity and that entity/agency agrees to allow the
structure near property under its control. In no case will the
(2)
F.
§ 305-11.15 MARSHFIELD CODE § 305-11.15
C:426
setback be less than the height of the facility to any existing
structure.
Setback waiver. The Board of Appeals may reduce the minimum
setback distance as appropriate based on site-specific
considerations if the project satisfies all other criteria for the
granting of a special permit under the provisions of this section.

Establishment and delineation of the WRPD.
The WRPD includes the Zone II protection areas as shown on the
Zoning Map of the Town of Marshfield, Massachusetts, as defined
in § 305-3.03 of the Zoning Bylaw (Zoning Map). The WRPD is
superimposed over any other district established by this bylaw. In
cases of conflicting use regulations, the more restrictive zoning
requirements shall apply.
(1)
The boundaries of this district may be modified upon acceptance
of approved Zone II conformance with wellhead protection
requirements of the Massachusetts Drinking Water Regulations,
310 CMR 22.21, and through a Zoning Map amendment approved
through Town Meeting.
(2)
C.
Split lots and determination of applicability.
Where the boundary line of the WRPD divides a lot or parcel,
the requirements established by this bylaw shall apply only to the
portion of the lot or parcel located within the WRPD. The boundary
shall be shown on a site plan as required by this bylaw or through
site plan review and shall be acceptable to the reviewing authority
(1)
D.
§ 305-13.02 CHARTER § 305-13.03
C:469
in accordance with all applicable provisions from the Zoning Bylaw
and associated Planning Board rules and regulations.
The applicant shall demonstrate, through the use of site plans,
that development activity outside of the boundary shall not be
connected to land within the boundary through post-development
grading, stormwater infrastructure, wastewater infrastructure or
other potential connections that could lead to the contamination
of groundwater within the WRPD. Where development practices
create a hydrologic connection across the WRPD boundary, the
applicant shall demonstrate that any water moving into or away
from the WRPD is accounted for in any of the required pollutant
loading calculations and meets all of the standards associated with
the WRPD. Where a special permit may be required, the Planning
Board may impose such conditions as are reasonably required to
ensure that these standards are met.
(2)
If an applicant questions the accuracy of Town's Zoning Map as
referenced in Subsection C(1) above, the applicant may challenge
the extent to which his/her property is subject to the WRPD
provisions in advance of submitting an application for development
to the Building Commissioner/Zoning Enforcement Officer, Board
of Appeals, or the Planning Board. Said challenge shall be made
through a request for a determination of applicability to the
Building Commissioner/Zoning Enforcement Officer. A request for
a determination of applicability shall be made in writing to the
Building Commissioner/Zoning Enforcement Officer and shall
include the following information at a minimum:
Site plan clearly depicting the parcel boundary and boundaries
of adjacent parcels and rights-of-way;
(a)
(b) Survey benchmarks;
(c) Stamp from a Massachusetts registered surveyor;
(d) Name and address of property owner(s);

(i) Scale (minimum of one inch equals 40 feet).
(3)
Upon receipt of a request for a determination of applicability, the
Building Commissioner/Zoning Enforcement Officer may make this
determination in consultation with the Town Engineer and any
other applicable agent of the Town of Marshfield.
(4)
§ 305-13.03 MARSHFIELD CODE § 305-13.03
C:470
The burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to determine the
extent to which the property is subject to the jurisdiction of this
bylaw. At the request of the applicant the Town may engage a
professional engineer or State of Massachusetts registered land
surveyor to determine more accurately the boundaries of the
district with respect to individual parcels of land and may charge
the applicant for all or part of the cost of the investigation.
(5)
The Building Commissioner/Zoning Enforcement Officer shall file
his/her written determination with the Planning Board and the
Board of Appeals. Any application for a determination of
applicability and associated materials shall not substitute for
materials required as part of site plan review, a building permit
application, or any application for a special permit. Any
determination made by the Building Commissioner/Zoning
Enforcement Officer as part of a determination of applicability shall
be considered by other reviewing agencies in their deliberations of
separate applications but shall not constitute approval or denial of
said applications.
(6)

F.
39.Editor's Note: See Ch. 417, Water Resource Protection District.
§ 305-13.03 MARSHFIELD CODE § 305-13.03
C:474
Construction activities. Erosion and sediment control measures
shall be taken to ensure that exposed earth and debris are not
displaced by stormwater runoff or other conditions in accordance
with the requirements for site plan review or the rules and
regulations associated with a WRPD special permit.
(1)
Safeguards. Provision shall be made to adequately protect against
toxic or hazardous materials discharge or loss through corrosion,
accidental damage, spillage, or vandalism. Such measures may
include provision for spill control in the vicinity of chemical or
fuel delivery points, secure storage areas for toxic or hazardous
materials, and indoor storage provisions for corrodible or
dissolvable materials. Any proposed indoor or outdoor storage of
liquid petroleum products shall be in covered and secure
container(s) in an area that has a containment system. Said
containment system shall be designed and operated to hold the
larger of the following two volumes:
Ten percent of the cumulative storage capacity of all
containers; or
(a)
One hundred ten percent of the single largest container's
storage capacity.
(b)
(2)
Pesticides, fertilizer and manure. Storage of pesticides, as defined
in MGL c. 132B, of commercial fertilizers and soil conditioners,
as defined in MGL c. 128, § 64, and animal manure shall only
be permitted within a structure with an impermeable cover and
liner designed to prevent the generation of contaminated runoff or
leachate.
(3)
Disposal. No disposal of hazardous wastes within WRPD shall
occur. All provisions of MGL c. 21C (the Massachusetts Hazardous
Waste Management Act) shall be adequately satisfied.
(4)
Fill. Fill material used in the WRPD shall contain no solid waste,
toxic or hazardous materials, or hazardous waste. Adequate
documentation shall be provided to ensure proper condition of the
fill. Where a special permit is required, the SPGA may require soils
testing by a certified laboratory at the applicant's expense as part
of the application process or during construction.
(5)
Separation from groundwater. Permanent removal or regrading of
the existing soil cover shall be prohibited where these activities
shall result in a finished grade elevation less than five feet above
the historical high groundwater level.
Excavations for building foundations, roads or utility work or
the installation of stormwater BMPs shall be exempt from this
requirement.
(a)
(b) The high groundwater elevation may be determined by:
(6)
§ 305-13.03 CHARTER § 305-13.03
C:475
Soil color using the Munsell system, the abundance, size
and contrast of redoximorphic features, if present;
[1]
Observation of actual water table during times of annual
high water table; or
[2]
Use of USGS wells for correlating comparisons in water
tables during times when the water table is not at the
annual high range.
[3]
Groundwater elevations depicted on plans shall be stamped by
a Massachusetts registered professional engineer.
(c)
Where these requirements would severely limit the
development potential of a particular parcel, an applicant may
propose permanent removal or regrading of the existing soil
cover to a finished grade which is less than five feet above
the historical high groundwater elevation through a full WRPD
special permit application.
(d)
Wastewater. Wastewater flow in the WRPD shall not exceed 440
gallons per 40,000 square feet for the use of conventional on-site
wastewater disposal. This flow may increase to 550 gallons per
40,000 square feet through the use of a DEP-approved innovative
and alternative septic system provided the Board of Health also
approves the use of the system.
(7)
Stormwater management. Stormwater runoff from impervious
surfaces shall be recharged on site in accordance with the
standards and guidelines included in the latest version of the
Massachusetts Stormwater Management Standards unless in
conducting application review it is determined that recharge either
is unfeasible because of site conditions or is undesirable because of
uncontrollable risks to water quality from such recharge.
(8)
Performance and design standards for special permit applications. In

F.
Purpose. The purpose of the Brant Rock Village Overlay (BRVO) District
is to protect and enhance the public health, safety, environment and
general welfare by establishing minimum requirements for new
development and redevelopment of existing properties and uses located
in the BRVO District. New development and redevelopment within the
BRVO District are intended to reduce the impacts from actual and
projected coastal flooding. In addition, these regulations are intended
to promote certain types of mixed-use buildings, as defined in Article
II, Definitions, to provide for commercial uses on the first floor and
residential uses on the second floor. The Village of Brant Rock has
a historical development pattern that contains both commercial and
residential uses within a single building and other geographical areas
which are substantially residential. Many of the existing buildings have
these preexisting nonconforming uses. The BRVO will authorize certain
mixed uses within a single building provided such buildings can be
designed and constructed in a manner that preserves and respects
the historic New England architecture of the Brant Rock Village and
reduces damage caused by chronic flooding that is prevalent in the
BRVO District.
A.
Scope of authority. The Brant Rock Village Overlay District (BRVO) is
hereby established as an overlay district and shall be superimposed
over the existing Business Waterfront (B-4) Zoning District. All
regulations of the Marshfield Zoning Bylaw applicable to the underlying
districts shall remain in effect, except that where the Brant Rock Village
Overlay District allows for mixed-use buildings, these regulations shall
prevail.
B.
District boundaries. The boundaries of the Brant Rock Village Overlay
District are delineated on the Official Zoning Map. The overlay district
boundaries shall follow the boundaries of the existing Business
Waterfront (B-4) Zoning District in the Brant Rock Village area.
C.
D. Applicability.

within the overlay district if they are floodproofing a structure
at or above the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) one-hundred-year storm event
established base flood elevation (BFE).
(1)
Any new building construction, reconstruction or additions to
structures within the BRVO that include floodproofing at or above
the BFE have the option to build a mixed-use building with
commercial uses allowed on the first floor and residential uses
allowed on the second floor. Mixed-use buildings shall be subject to
the following BRVO regulations.

E.
Design requirements.
Floodproofing. All of the building shall be elevated above the FEMA
FIRM base flood elevation (BFE). Providing a BFE higher than the
minimum required by FEMA, to plan for projected sea level rise,
is encouraged. Moisture- and rot-resistant breakaway panels shall
be provided to screen the building's pilings or piers in the area
between the natural ground elevation and the first floor. These
breakaway elements should be consistent with the rest of the
building's design elements.
(1)
Outside boardwalk. All buildings shall provide an outdoor
boardwalk, farmer's porch or similar structure, elevated above the
BFE, set back from the street or sidewalk. The boardwalk or porch
on the first floor shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide measured from
the inside edge of the top of the stairs to the outermost wall of the
commercial first floor building.

uses are proposed shall be designed to incorporate the design elements
in the following design sketch:
H.
Mixed use.
Buildings shall be designed to reflect the traditional New England
coastal village architecture found within the region. The mass,
proportion, and scale of the building, roof shape, roof pitch,
proportions and relationships between doors and windows should
be harmonious among themselves.
(1)
Architectural details of new construction and proposed
reconstruction as well as any additions to existing buildings should
be harmonious with the building's overall architectural style and
should preserve and enhance the historic character of Marshfield.
(2)
Wherever possible, the building's location shall be oriented parallel
to Ocean Street and Dyke Road, unless there is a compelling reason
to do otherwise that will enhance the proposed project. Building
facades in excess of 30 feet wide shall incorporate recesses and
projections, of a minimum of two feet in depth, to break up the
building's mass. The building roofline should include variations
in pitch and height and include dormers, turrets and decks. All
building materials shall be moisture and rot resistant in
consideration of the coastal weather conditions.

§ 405-1. Authority.
Under the authority vested in the Marshfield Planning Board, or its legally
constituted successor, by MGL c. 41, §§ 81O, 81Q and 81FF, as amended,
said Board hereby adopts these rules and regulations governing the
subdivision of land in the Town of Marshfield. Furthermore, the Marshfield
Planning Board hereby adopts regulations for the construction of ways
and the installation of municipal services with respect to ways serving
lots shown on any subdivision plan, including those plans that predate
the Subdivision Control Law. Such rules and regulations shall supersede
and replace any previously adopted Subdivision Control Law rules and
regulations and may be amended in accordance with the provisions of MGL
c. 41, § 81Q.
§ 405-2. Purpose.
The Subdivision Control Law has been enacted for the purpose of protecting
the safety, convenience and welfare of the inhabitants of the Town by
regulating the laying out and construction of ways in subdivisions, providing
access to the several lots therein, but which have not become public ways,
and ensuring sanitary conditions in subdivisions and, in proper cases, parks
and open areas. The powers of the Board under the Subdivision Control
Law shall be exercised with due regard for the provision of adequate
access to all of the lots in a subdivision by ways that will be safe and
convenient for travel; for lessening congestion in such ways and in the
adjacent public ways; for reducing danger to life and limb in the operation
of motor vehicles; for securing safety in the case of fire, flood, panic and
other emergencies; for ensuring compliance with the applicable zoning
ordinances or bylaws; for securing adequate provision for water, sewerage,
drainage, and other requirements where necessary, in a subdivision; and for
coordinating the ways in a subdivision with each other and with the public
ways in the Town and with the ways in neighboring subdivisions.
§ 405-3. Approved definitive plan required.
No person shall make a subdivision of land within the Town, or proceed
with the improvement or sale of lots in a subdivision or the construction
of ways, or the installation of municipal services therein, unless and
until a definitive plan of such subdivision has been submitted to and
approved by the Board as hereinafter provided.
A.
After the approval of such plan, the location and width of ways shown
thereon shall not be changed without the approval of the Board, but the
number, shape and size of the lots shown on the plan so approved may
be changed without action by the Board, provided every lot so changed
still has frontage on a public way or a way shown on a plan approved

Emergency Management Agency, shall be provided. The scale of
said plan shall be one inch equals 40 feet or such other scale as
shall be deemed appropriate by the Planning Board to show the
property and the above-required information conveniently. Plans
shall be in accordance with MGL c. 36, § 13A, as amended.
Applications which are found to be incomplete shall be returned
to the applicant without the endorsement of the Board with the
finding that insufficient information has been provided to
determine whether or not the plan constitutes a subdivision in the
meaning of MGL c. 41, § 81L. [Amended 7-24-2017]
(3) The entire parcel(s) subject to the application.
General. A preliminary plan of a subdivision may be submitted by the
applicant for discussion, approval, conditional approval, or disapproval
by the Board. An applicant shall demonstrate ownership of the fee
interest on the land in question or else document that (s)he is acting as

Planning Board may engage such consultant services to assist
the Board in analyzing a project to ensure compliance with all
relevant laws, ordinances, bylaws and regulations. The Board
may require that applicants pay a review fee consisting of the
reasonable costs incurred by the Board for the employment
of outside consultants engaged by the Board to assist in the
review of the application.
Funds received by the Board pursuant to this section shall
be deposited with the Town Treasurer/Collector who shall
establish a special account for this purpose. Expenditures from
this special account may be made at the direction of the Board
without further appropriation. Expenditures from this special
account shall be made only in connection with the review of a
specific project or projects for which a review fee has been or
will be collected from the applicant. Failure of an applicant to
pay a review fee shall be grounds for denial of the application
or permit. [Amended 7-24-2017]
(c)
Review fees may only be spent for services rendered in
connection with the specific project from which they were
collected. Accrued interest may also be spent for this purpose.
At the completion of the Board's review of a project, any excess
amount in the account, including interest, attributable to a
specific project shall be repaid to the applicant or the
applicant's successor in interest. A final report of said account
shall be made available to the applicant or the applicant's
successor in interest. For the purpose of this regulation, any
person or entity claiming to be an applicant's successor in
interest shall provide the Board with documentation
establishing such succession in interest.
(d)
Any applicant may take an administrative appeal from the
selection of the outside consultant to the Board of Selectmen,
provided that such appeal is taken within 14 days of
notification of the Board's appointment of the consultant. The
grounds for such an appeal shall be limited to claims that
the consultant selected has a conflict of interest or does not
possess the minimum required qualifications. The minimum
qualifications shall consist either of an educational degree in,
or related to, the field at issue or three or more years of
practice in the field at issue or a closely related field. The
required time limit for action upon an application by the Board
shall be extended by the duration of the administrative appeal.
In the event that the Board of Selectmen makes no decision
within one month following the filing of the appeal, the
selection made by the Board shall stand.

Street numbers and names; referral to Historical Commission, Police
Department and Fire Department.
All proposed ways are to be referred to in all preliminary plans
by approximate street numbers in relation to existing public ways
(e.g., 1100 Careswell Street instead of "Marsh Hill"). Said numbers
are to be obtained from the office of the Town Engineer for
preliminary plan purposes. Multiple streets within a proposed
subdivision shall be referred to in a preliminary plan as Road A, B,
C, etc.
(1)
Upon submission of a formal preliminary plan (Form B),46 the
Planning Board shall refer the plan forthwith to the Historical
Commission, which shall make a recommendation to the Board
within 30 days of the referral date as to proposed street names.
If, in the Commission's view, the subject property has significant
historical association, which merits preservation, it shall forward
recommendations to the Planning Board. The Planning Board shall
consider the significance of such associations as provided by the
Commission in its final selection of street names. The applicant may
provide suggestions to the Commission and directly to the Planning
Board.
(2)
After the elapsing of 30 days from the date of referral to the

review period for preliminary plan action, the Planning Board shall
render its decision on street names as a part of its decision on the
application.
The Board shall strive to select brief names for convenience and
clarity, limiting length of names to one word, unless exceptional
historic significance is shown.
(4)
Hence forward, whether followed by a definitive plan or further
preliminary plans, the Town Engineer shall refer an applicant on
the same parcel to the approved street name(s), unless in his
judgment new access or intervening circumstances warrant
reconsideration. In that event, reference can again be made to the
procedure under this section.
(5)
Approval or disapproval. The Board shall, within 45 days after
submission, give such preliminary plan its approval, with or without
modification, or shall disapprove such plan, stating its reasons. The
Town Clerk shall be notified of the Board's decision in writing. Such
approval is valid for seven months and does not constitute approval of a
subdivision but does facilitate the procedure in securing final approval
of the definitive plan.
D.
Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to set forth the procedures
and standards by which a lot owner may determine whether one or
more lots have frontage on a way that meets the definition of "street" in
the Marshfield Zoning Bylaw.
This process is called a "street determination" and it prescribes the
requirements for construction of:
Roads that have not been built, within existing paper rights-ofway;
(a)
Unimproved roads that have not been paved and do not have
stormwater management infrastructure; and
(b)
Lots shown on a subdivision plan that predates the adoption of
the Subdivision Control Law, MGL c. 41.
(c)
(1)
These regulations for improvements to private ways are intended
to reduce the likelihood of drainage and erosion problems and
ensure that improvements, when completed, result in a positive
street determination.
(2)
A.
Authority. A building permit may not be issued by the Building
Commissioner for new construction unless the lot on which the building
is to be constructed has frontage on a "street" as defined in the
B.
§ 405-6 MARSHFIELD CODE § 405-7
C:512
Marshfield Zoning Bylaws. For private streets not approved under the
Subdivision Control Law, the Planning Board must make a
determination as to the adequacy of the way in accordance with this
definition. A "street" as defined in the Marshfield Zoning Bylaw Article
II is: "A way, over 24 feet in right-of-way width, which: A. Is a public
way laid out by a governmental entity or public authority pursuant
to Massachusetts General Laws or is shown as a public way on an
official map adopted by the Town pursuant to MGL c. 41, § 81E, or
has been accepted by the Town as a public way; or B. Is shown on a
plan approved and endorsed in accordance with the Subdivision Rules
and Regulations of Marshfield and MGL c. 41, §§ 81K to 81GG; or C.
has, in the opinion of the Planning Board, sufficient width, suitable
grades and adequate construction to provide the needs of vehicular
traffic in relation to the proposed use of the land abutting thereon or
served thereby, and for the installation of municipal services to serve
such land and buildings erected or to be erected thereon." [Amended
7-24-2017]
Application for a street determination.
Submittal requirements. Applicants for street determinations shall
submit the following items to the Planning Board:
A written request for a street determination signed by the
individual seeking the determination.
(a)
The name(s) of the street(s) for which a determination is being
sought.
(b)
The Assessor's parcel number for the lot(s) for which a
determination is being sought.
(c)
An Assessor's map or other locus map which shows adjacent
streets and is sufficient to locate the street(s) and parcel(s).
(d)
An administrative filing fee as provided in Chapter 420, Fee
Schedule. [Amended 7-24-2017]
(e)
(1)
Planning Board procedure. Upon receipt of a completed request
for a street determination, the Planning Board will schedule the
request for its next available meeting.
(2)
Review standards.
If the way is not a public way or a subdivision way, the Planning
Board will consider the following criteria in determining
whether a private way is of "sufficient width, suitable grades,
and adequate construction":
The roadway surface must be a minimum width of 20 feet
of bituminous concrete;
[1]
[2] The roadway surface was created prior to January 1, 2010;
(a)
(3)
C.
§ 405-7 CHARTER § 405-7
C:513
[3] The adequacy of or need for drainage along the roadway;
The adequacy of municipal services along the roadway
(includes water and wastewater);
[4]
[5] The number of existing and potential lots on the way;
The minimum requirement for a twenty-four-foot right-ofway
in the Zoning Bylaw;
[6]
[7] The slope of the roadway.
The Board's decision shall be based on the conditions that exist
at the time the street determination is requested.
(b)
Decision. The Planning Board will vote to issue a positive or a
negative street determination within 90 days of receipt of a
completed request. The Board's decision will be issued in writing,
with reasons set forth, and a copy shall be provided to the Building
Commissioner. [Amended 7-24-2017]
Positive street determination. Upon issuance of a positive
street determination, applicants may be issued a building
permit (assuming all other requirements of zoning are met).
(a)
Negative street determination. The Building Department will
not issue building permits when a negative street
determination is made. In such cases, roadway improvements
must be made prior to reconsideration by the Planning Board.
Such improvements fall into two categories:
Applicants seeking to create new lots on private ways/
paper streets must file a subdivision plan pursuant to the
Subdivision Control Law and the Marshfield Subdivision
Rules and Regulations.
[1]
Applicants seeking to develop existing lots must file a
subdivision plan meeting the minimum standards and
procedures outlined below.
[2]
(b)

plan by the signatures of a majority of the Board, but not until the
statutory twenty-day appeal period has elapsed following the filing of
the certificate of action of the Board with the Town Clerk, and said
Clerk has notified the Board that no appeal has been filed. The Town
Clerk shall endorse on the plan or record separately and refer to on
said plan the fact that no notice of appeal was received during the 20
days of the plan. Endorsement and recording of final plans must occur
within six months of the filing of the decision with the Town Clerk or
the Planning Board may vote to revoke its approval of the plan.
Failure of the Board to take final action regarding a street
improvement plan within 90 days after such submission, or such
further time as may be agreed upon at the written request of the
applicant, shall be deemed to be an approval thereof. After the
street improvement plan has been approved and endorsed, the
applicant shall furnish the Board with six prints and two Mylars.

Subsection E(1) and (2), which method may be selected and from time
to time varied by the applicant.
Approval by bond or money or negotiable securities. The applicant

amount determined by the Board to be sufficient to cover the cost
of all or any part of the improvements as shown on the definitive
plan and as specified in the rules and regulations. Detailed cost
estimates for all improvements shall be submitted by the
applicant's professional engineer to the Board for review. If said
estimates are found by the Board and its engineer to be
unsatisfactorily low, a revised estimate satisfactory to the Board
will be required. Such bond or security, if filed or deposited, shall
be approved as to form and manner of execution by the Board
and by Town Counsel and, in addition, as to sureties, by the Town
Accountant and shall be contingent on the completion of such
improvements within one year of the date of the bond. At the
discretion of the Board, time extensions may be granted for periods
of one year, provided that such an extension may be conditioned
upon an increase in the amount of such bond or security as
determined by the Board. The penal sum of any such bond or the
amount of any deposit held may, from time to time, be reduced by
the Board and obligations of the parties thereto released in whole
or in part. [Amended 7-24-2017]
(1)
Approval by covenant. Instead of filing a bond or depositing money
or negotiable securities, the applicant may provide covenant
restrictions. Such covenant, executed and duly recorded by the
owner of record, running with the land, shall provide that
construction of ways and installation of municipal services shall
be provided for the entire subdivision before any lot may be built
upon or conveyed. For corporations registered in Massachusetts,
covenant documents shall be executed by any two of the following
(2)
E.
§ 405-8 MARSHFIELD CODE § 405-8
C:532
officers, or by evidence of corporate vote: president, vice president,
or treasurer. Such a covenant shall comply with the requirements
of Chapter 377 of the Acts of 1958.51 Any covenant given shall be
either inscribed on the plan or contained in a separate document
referred to on the plan. Before any lot is released from the
covenant restrictions, the construction of subdivision
improvements for the segment of the street providing frontage for
said lots and for all roadway segments connecting said lots to the
roadway system of the Town shall be complete, with respect to
all utilities, curbing, drainage, roadway base course, and roadway
pavement binder course.
Certificate of approval, modification, or disapproval.
The action of the Board in respect to such plan, as to approval,
modification or disapproval thereof, shall be by vote, copies of
which shall be certified and filed with the Town Clerk and sent by
delivery or registered mail, postage prepaid, to the applicant. If
the Board modifies or disapproves such plan, it shall state in its
vote the reasons for its decision. Final approval, if granted, shall
be endorsed on the original drawing of the definitive plan by the
signatures of a majority of the Board, but not until the statutory
twenty-day appeal period has elapsed following the filing of the
certificate of action of the Board with the Town Clerk and said
Clerk has notified the Board that no appeal has been filed. The
Town Clerk shall endorse on the plan or record separately and
refer to on said plan the fact that no notice of appeal was received
during the 20 days following the filing of the Board's action on the
plan. Endorsement and recording of final plans must occur within
six months of the filing of the decision with the Town Clerk or the
Planning Board may vote to revoke its approval of the plan. Any
definitive plan evolved from the submission of a preliminary plan
which has received approval, with or without modifications, shall
be governed by the rules and regulations relative to subdivision
control in effect at the time of submission of the preliminary plan,
provided that the definitive plan is duly submitted within seven
months from the date on which the preliminary plan was submitted.
[Amended 7-24-2017]

Failure of the Board to take final action regarding a definitive plan
within 90 days when the plan was preceded by a preliminary plan
or within 135 days when not preceded by a preliminary plan, after
such submission, or such further time as may be agreed upon at the
written request of the applicant, shall be deemed to be an approval
thereof. After the definitive plan has been approved and endorsed,
the applicant shall furnish the Board with four prints thereof.
(2)
Final approval of the definitive plan does not constitute the laying
out or acceptance by the Town of streets within a subdivision.

Approval in all cases is granted for a two-year period from the
date of such approval, and if a development is not completed in its
entirety in that time, the applicant must again petition the Board
for action on the undeveloped portion.
(4)
The Board may grant extensions of this two-year deadline if
petitions for such extensions are received prior to the expiration
of the two-year period. After expiration of the two-year period, the
Board shall conduct a public hearing on the petition for action on
the undeveloped portion and may make revisions to the approval to
reflect current conditions.
(5)
Subdivision reinstatement. In the event that the subdivision
approval has expired beyond the two-year period for completion,
the applicant shall pay an administrative fee as provided in Chapter
420, Fee Schedule, and all costs associated with readvertising the
public hearing. [Amended 7-24-2017]
(6)
Subdivision modifications. Any proposed modification to conditions
of approval or a major modification that triggers the need for a
public hearing will require an administrative fee in the amount as
provided in Chapter 420, Fee Schedule. [Amended 7-24-2017]
(7)
Payment of taxes. Prior to endorsement of subdivision plans, applicants
shall provide the Planning Board with a current (within one month)
municipal lien certificate demonstrating that all taxes have been paid in
full on the property subject to the certificate of action.
G.
Recording of certificate of action, plans and associated documents. The
applicant is responsible for recording at his or her cost all approved
definitive subdivision plans, certificate of action, all easements,
covenants, declaration of homeowners' associations and any other
documents which require recording at the Registry of Deeds or Land
Court. Following recording, the applicant shall provide proof of
recording to the Planning Board.
H.
Minor changes; plan revisions; incomplete submissions. Definitive plans
submitted to the Planning Board for review under the Town Clerk's
stamp may not be revised without the consent of the Board, and only
as discussed in public session at the public hearing. Any such changes
shall be prominently noted on the plan set cover sheet and on any
individual sheets affected so as to make clear the plan of record on
which the action of the Board is being requested.
Minor changes may be allowed by the vote of the Board at any
time after the public hearing, again with the required notations on
cover sheet and affected plan sheets. A minor change is defined
by the Board as a change which has no discernible impact outside
the subdivision, does not increase rates or volumes of stormwater
runoff, does not increase the amount of cut or fill required, or does
not involve regrading of more than two lots nor more than 200

linear feet of roadway within the subdivision. The Planning Board
shall determine, in its opinion, if plan revisions are minor changes
or constitute major changes requiring refiling and rehearing.
The Board reserves the right to disapprove incomplete submissions
at any time if, in its opinion, review of the plan is hampered by the
absence of required information. In the event of such disapproval,
the plans shall be returned to the applicant as incomplete and a
copy of the certificate of action filed with the Town Clerk noting
the reason for the Board's action. The Board also reserves the right
to retain any filing and review fees, or to reimburse any portion
of such fees to the applicant, based on the extent to which the
review has proceeded and to cover administrative costs of filing,
notification, distribution, etc.
(2)
Prohibited activities. Site preparation, tree cutting, filling, grading and
other work done in anticipation of the subdivision plan approval should
not be performed prior to the submission and approval of a definitive
plan. The Planning Board reserves the right to disapprove any such
work, to order restoration of the site, and to assess fines as provided for
in these regulations upon filing of a Form A, Preliminary or Definitive
Plan Application.52
J.
Certificate of performance. Upon completion of the construction of
ways and installation of services in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the Board, security for the performance of which was
given by Subsection E(1) and/or (2), or upon the performance of any
covenant with respect to any lot, the applicant shall submit as-built
drawings of all utilities and drainage systems to the Board and a
written statement in duplicate to the Town Clerk, stating that the
necessary requirements have been met. Such statement shall contain
the address of the applicant, and the Town Clerk shall furnish the
Planning Board with one copy of the above statement with a notice
provided by the applicant from the Register or Recorder that the plan
is recorded in Book No., Page No., and date. If the Board is satisfied
that all requirements have been met, it shall release the interest of
the Town in such bond and return the bond or the deposit to the
person who furnished the same, or release the covenant by appropriate
instruments, duly acknowledged, which may be recorded.
If it is determined that the necessary work has not been completed,
the Board shall so notify the applicant in writing specifying the
details. Failure of the Board to so notify the applicant within 45
days after the receipt by the Town Clerk will cause all obligations
under the bond to cease and terminate by operation of the law. Any
deposits shall be returned and any covenant shall become void.

Design Standards and Required Improvements
§ 405-9. Streets.
Protection of natural and cultural features. Due regard shall be shown
for all natural features, such as large trees, watercourses, scenic
points, historic spots, stone walls, and similar community assets which,
if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the subdivision. If,
in the opinion of the Board, excessive vegetation is removed due to
proposed grades, a restoration plan shall be submitted for approval,
together with the definitive plan. In no case shall areas larger than
100 feet in width be clear-cut to accommodate siting of houses. Areas
larger than 150 feet in width shall not be clear-cut to accommodate
siting of roads and drainage structures. The applicant shall strive to
maintain clear-cutting within the roadway and, where necessary, within
the planting strip. Stone walls shall not be removed or buried unless
approved by the Board and shall be reconstructed and used in
subdivision design.
A.
Grading and topography.
Efforts shall be taken to maintain the continuity of the natural
topography. Cut and fill shall be avoided in all instances possible.
Except in areas where terracing is used, when excavation is
necessary, grading shall be done in such a way that the resulting
contours follow smooth natural curves that conform to the curves
of the surrounding landscape. Straight or angular slopes or cuts
that interrupt natural topography shall not normally be allowed.
Existing contours shall be preserved insofar as it is possible
through optimal location of streets and dwellings to the satisfaction
of the Planning Board. In any event, no change shall be made in
existing contours which adversely affects any land abutting the
proposed subdivision.
(1)
Street layouts shall generally follow (parallel) the existing
contours, or existing stream valley and natural swales, and should
be designed with the objective of the preservation of natural
features identified on the plan, as required in Subsection A above.
All work on the ground hereinafter specified shall be performed
by the applicant in accordance with these rules and regulations,
in conformity with approved definitive plans and specifications and
other construction requirements of the Town agencies concerned,
and to the satisfaction of such agencies. In particular, all design,
material, and construction specifications of the Marshfield
Department of Public Works (DPW) relative to road and utility
construction shall be adhered to unless otherwise provided for
in these regulations. Where no detail is given under Marshfield
DPW or the Department's specifications, reference shall be made
to construction details of the Massachusetts Municipal Engineers

Association. All streets in the subdivision shall be designed so that,
in the opinion of the Board, they shall provide safe vehicular travel.
Location of streets.
In case a tract is subdivided into parcels larger than normal
building lots, the Board may decline to approve the plan unless
such parcels are arranged so as to allow the opening of proper
future ways and logical and proper subdivision.
(1)
In case access to a subdivision crosses land in another municipality,
the Board may require certification from appropriate authorities
that such access is in accordance with the master plan and
subdivision requirements of such municipality and that a legally
adequate performance bond had been duly posted or that such
access is adequately improved to handle prospective traffic.
(2)
The Planning Board may require space reserved for future streets
(shown on said plan as paper streets) to provide for interconnecting
ways and to avoid excessive dead-end streets. All portions of the
tract being subdivided shall be taken up in lots, streets, public
lands, or other proposed uses, so that remnants and landlocked
areas shall not be created.
(3)
Provision satisfactory to the Board shall be made for the proper
projection of streets, or for access to adjoining property which is
not yet subdivided.
(4)
Reserve strips prohibiting access to streets or adjoining property
shall not be permitted except where, in the opinion of the Board,
such strips shall be in the public interest.
(5)
Roadways, culs-de-sac, detention facilities, sidewalks, and other
required infrastructure or improvements shall not be placed within
easements but within the right-of-way or on parcels not buildable
for residential, commercial or industrial structures. Sewer, water,
and drainage lines may be exempted from this position by the
express waiver of the Board. All such land parcels, common land,
or waivered easements shall be bounded with concrete bounds at
all corners.
(6)
Where the street system within the proposed subdivision does
not intersect with or have adequate access, in the opinion of the
Planning Board, from an existing public way or approved
subdivision way, the Board may require, as a condition of approval,
that such adequate access be provided by the applicant through
physical improvements from the proposed subdivision ways to the
nearest public way or approved subdivision way most suitable in
terms of width, grade and construction.

be compacted to a minimum of 92% of maximum dry unit weight
and at or near optimum moisture content as determined by the
ASTM D 1557-66T, Method D. Preparation of the subgrade shall be
approved by the Planning Board Engineer before any subsequent
construction is permitted. All soil samples for testing purposes
must be selected from the subject material by a qualified testing
laboratory in a manner and quantity which will permit it to certify
that they are representative of the material as a whole. Samples
selected by anyone else will not be allowed as valid for the purpose.
(5)
After approval of the subgrade, the above-specified base course
shall be prepared to lines and grades. Prior to paving of the base
course, the project engineer shall certify in writing to the Planning
Board that the location of survey controls is accurate and in
accordance with the approved plan so as to minimize corrective
work and changes required in the as-built plans. The base course
shall be constructed in maximum lifts of six-inch lifts and shall be
compacted to a minimum of 95% of maximum dry unit weight and
at, or near, optimum moisture content as determined by the ASTM
D 1557-66T, Method D.

The approved base course shall be paved with a minimum of three
inches of Massachusetts Highway Department Type I-1 binder
course and 1 1/2 inches of top course to lines and grades as
required. The application of the top course shall be delayed for
six months after binder course is applied. The pavement shall be
placed and constructed in accordance with the specifications of the
Marshfield Department of Public Works, shall be compacted to a
minimum of 95% of laboratory density, and surface irregularities
greater than 1/4 inch as measured with a ten-foot straight edge
shall be corrected as determined by the Planning Board Engineer.
Paving operations shall not start or continue without permission
of the Planning Board Engineer, who will determine whether
preparation, weather conditions, etc., are suitable.
Notwithstanding, all paving operations are to be concluded for the
season by November 20, regardless of weather conditions.

All clearing shall be done in accordance with that shown on the
definitive plan and with the approved erosion control and construction
management plan.
General requirements. All utilities, including drainage, ponds,
watercourses, swales, and lines, which service more than one dwelling
unit must be located within street layouts or on properties set aside
expressly for utility purposes rather than on building lots. Such utility
areas shall have the boundaries defined by concrete bounds at all
corners and shall be furnished with gated vehicle accessway for
maintenance purposes to the proposed subdivision roadway or an
existing accepted way. Such accessway shall be constructed to the
satisfaction of the Planning Board and provided with permanent
monumentation to inform abutters of location of said accessway on the
ground. All utility line and accessway properties shall be a minimum of
20 feet in width.
A.
Drainage. The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Planning Board that the project is designed to have no measurable or
significant impact as to existing vegetation, topography, wetlands, and
other natural or man-made features.
Criteria. The applicant shall review best available drainage systems
for the appropriate application on the proposed development site.
The development suitability of the site shall be based on natural
features, such as soil types, slope, vegetative cover, water table,
etc. Drainage plans shall be developed in consultation with the
Planning Department and the Board's consultants with the
following objectives and criteria in mind: [Amended 7-24-2017]
(a) Protection of surface water and groundwater quality.
(b) Public safety.
(c) Protection of existing abutting homes and septic systems.
Enhancement of and connection to natural drainage systems,
including streams, floodplains, and associated wetlands.
(d)
Attractiveness of the plan, minimizing disruption to existing
features, and successful imitation of natural systems.
(e)
Minimizing of long-term maintenance and/or reconstruction
obligations to ensure the natural operation of the system and
conserve manpower, energy, and fiscal resources.
(f)
(1)
Large developments; off-site mitigation. For developments in
excess of 50 dwelling units, 50 acres, or which create more than
three acres of impervious surfaces of all kinds, the Planning Board
may require a storm drainage design analysis for the one-hundred-
(2)
B.
§ 405-9 CHARTER § 405-10
C:543
year storm at the watershed level, from drainage divide to tidal
water, which demonstrates the adequacy of existing and proposed
structures. If no measurable impact is shown, no off-site mitigation
measures will be required by the Board. Said analysis shall include
at least the following information: consideration of the entire
watershed and the calculations used in designing the drainage
system, including area calculations, intensity of rainfall, coefficient
of runoff, time of concentration, discharge, pipe coefficients of
roughness, and quantity and velocity of flow under design
conditions at buildout capacity allowed under current zoning.
Additionally, the following information shall be supplied:
(a) Soil map for the sub area watershed.
(b) Topographic map for the sub area watershed.
(c) Land use map for the sub area watershed.
(d) Pre-development drainage patterns on the site.
(e) Post-development drainage patterns on the site.
All developments; on-site mitigation. In addition to the above
watershed area analysis, the Planning Board shall require an onsite
storm drainage design analysis for all proposed developments
that mitigates the ten-, twenty-five-, and one-hundred-year storm
events in accordance with the standards contained herein. The
following information shall be required:
(a) Calculations of wetland areas on site.
(b) Analysis of soil conditions throughout the site.
Analysis of the square footage and percent of impervious
coverage in relation to the square footage and percent of area
devoted to drainage proposed.
(c)
Considerations of density of development appropriate to the
above conditions.
(d)
Proposed use and assessment of effectiveness of water
pollution and erosion control devices (e.g., absorption pillows,
hay bales, swales, etc.).
(e)
Conformance with DPW standards for maintenance and
performance.
(f)
Consideration of existing or potential public water supplies on
or near the site.
(g)
Design calculations shall be based on the ten-, twenty-five-,
and one-hundred-year storm event for all ponding areas and
twenty-five-year storm event for pipe sizing.

Demonstration of no increase in the rate of discharge from predevelopment
to post-development conditions.
(j)
Demonstration that post-development runoff volume shall not
exceed pre-development volumes.
(k)
On-site drainage systems, including detention areas, must meet the
following performance standards: A fifty-foot buffer zone of existing
vegetation shall be retained between all detention or siltation
structures and adjacent uses or structures for protection of scenic
corridors, surface water and wetlands subject to MGL c. 130 and
c. 131 and/or local wetland bylaws. A thirty-foot buffer zone of
existing vegetation shall be retained between all point source
discharges of stormwater and surface waters and wetlands.
However, the provision of this subsection shall not prohibit the
selective clearing of trees and shrubs, the establishment of new
vegetation better suited to the proposed conditions, or the
discharge of stormwater across such buffer areas as any of these
actions may be permitted by the Conservation Commission under
an order of conditions.
(4)
Use of retention basins shall not be permitted except in
combination with detention facilities and for the express purpose
of containing the design storm for a twenty-four to forty-eighthour
period, or in Water Resource Protection Districts where the
stormwater management system includes measures to abate the
contaminants prior to recharge and where, in the Board's opinion,
retention facilities will promote recharge that will benefit surface
water or groundwater resources. Detention facilities shall be
permitted insofar as such systems are designed to function as
natural wetlands, having characteristics of side slopes, gradients,
vegetation and topographic location which follow naturally
occurring wetland types. Use of such artificial storm drainage
systems shall not substitute for proper erosion control measures,
including appropriate design for soil and slope conditions. Design
of such facilities shall observe the following guidelines:
Side slopes of wetland/detention areas shall be no steeper than
3:1 horizontal to vertical relationship.
(a)
A maximum of 2% slope shall be permitted for the bottom of
the wetland/basin.
(b)
Where clearing and/or regrading of the site may be
unavoidable for installation of the basin and necessary
structures, vegetation shall be reestablished in conformance
with the proposed landscape plan.
(c)

§ 405-10 CHARTER § 405-10
C:545
The prohibition of undesirable or unnatural accumulation of
water shall refer to stagnant, pond waters, but not to wet
systems, which are designed to have continuous stream flow
through the basin. Ground infiltration by means of leaching
pits, leaching catch basins or similar facilities is not allowed as
a means of calculating or mitigating stormwater disposal.
(d)
Drainage outfalls shall be designed in conformance with this
subsection and shall further provide rip-rapped aprons in
accordance with typical details shown in the appendix of these
regulations,56 and in every case shall provide a minimum of 30 feet
of vegetation swale before the property line and above the highwater
line of any stream, swamp, bank or wetlands. As with other
drainage structures, detention areas shall have a positive outfall
and connection to an existing water body, including wetlands as
defined above, except in Water Resource Protection Districts where
the stormwater management system includes measures to abate
the contaminants prior to recharge and where, in the Board's
opinion, retention facilities will promote recharge that will benefit
surface water or groundwater resources. Basins and swales shall
be incorporated into separate land parcels for this exclusive
purpose rather than be shown as easements over areas required
for other uses, or required to serve purposes of other bylaws or
regulations of the Town of Marshfield.
(6)
Subsurface drains or subdrains. In areas where the finished grade
of the roadway is less than four feet above the water table or in
areas where less than four feet of fill is placed above water in
swampy places, or any standing water, or in other areas where, in
the opinion of the Board, the subgrade must be drained, a system
of subdrains shall be designed for such areas. In addition, laterals
may be required as directed by the Board in areas in which an
undue amount of water could accumulate in the subgrade. The
system of subdrains shall be discharged into the storm drainage
system or otherwise disposed of in a manner satisfactory to the
Board.
(7)
Storm drains.
Storm drainage design is to conform to specifications of the
Master Drainage Plan when applicable. Design shall be on
the basis of a twenty-five-year storm. A complete storm drain
system shall be designed for each street in the subdivision and
shall be so laid out and of sufficient size to permit unimpeded
flow of all natural waterways, to provide adequate drainage
of all portions of the street system so that water does not
accumulate thereon, to intercept stormwater runoff from the
adjacent lots of the subdivision, and to eliminate undesirable
or unnatural accumulation of water on any portion of the
(a)

56.Editor's Note: See Appendix B included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 405-10 MARSHFIELD CODE § 405-10
C:546
subdivision or surrounding property to the satisfaction of the
Board. The storm drain system shall include gutters, catch
basins, manholes, culverts, drain lines, head walls and such
other items as may be required to complete the system to the
satisfaction of the Board.
Catch basins and manhole structures shall be preferably
reinforced, precast concrete. Structures are not to be
backfilled until inspected by the subdivision inspector.
(b)
Catch basins shall be located in pairs, one on each side of the
road, at all low points or sag curves in the roadway, at intervals
of 300 feet for grades up to 4%, 250 feet for grades from 4%
to 6% and 200 feet for grades more than 6% and at or near
corners of the way at intersecting streets. Catch basins will be
in conformance with Marshfield DPW standards. Double-grate
catch basins should be provided where warranted by runoff
conditions.
(c)
Manholes shall be located at all changes in direction, either
horizontally or vertically, of a drain line, or so located that no
drain line greater than 300 feet in length would exist without
either a catch basin or manhole. Manholes shall conform to
Marshfield DPW standard. [Amended 7-24-2017]
(d)
Culverts shall be designed on the basis of a one-hundred-year
storm and on the assumption that the entire drainage area is
built up to the density and in the manner which the applicable
section of the Zoning Bylaw allows. The calculations (or a copy
thereof) necessary to determine the size of any culvert which
carries a brook, stream, river or other natural waterway shall
be submitted to the Board for review. Such calculations shall
be based on a method (Rational Method or Talbot's Formula)
acceptable to the Board for determining the size of waterway
openings. All culverts shall have a head wall at each end, and
any culvert over 36 inches in diameter shall include additional
protection as approved by the Board for the roadway side
slopes at the upstream end.
(e)
All the drains shall be a minimum of 12 inches in diameter and
shall be laid on a slope of not less than 1/2 of 1%. If the system
is designed as a self-cleaning system, the Board may accept
a lesser minimum slope for the drain lines. A maximum pipe
velocity of 10 feet per second shall be allowed, with a minimum
velocity of 2 1/2 feet per second required. All final outfalls
within or serving the subdivision shall extend to a natural
waterway, or to drainage easements or pipe systems leading
to waterways, and such pipe shall have a capacity of 25%
greater than required by the calculations. Provisions shall be
made for the disposal of surface water intercepted or collected
by the system in such a manner that no flow is conducted
(f)
§ 405-10 CHARTER § 405-10
C:547
over Town ways or over the land of others unless a drainage
easement is obtained or unless such flow, in essentially the
same quantity, previously existed in the same location. Where
adjacent property is not subdivided, provision shall be made
for extension of the system by continuing appropriate drains to
the boundary of the subdivision at such size and grade as will
allow their proper projection.
A head wall with wing walls shall be provided at the outfall
end of all drains. Use of pre-formed flared end sections for this
purpose is also acceptable.
(g)
No drainage outfall shall discharge at an elevation below the
high-water line of a swamp, stream, or body of water as defined
in Article II.
(h)
Pipe outfalls shall be located away from dwellings a distance
down grade equivalent to the required lot depth in the
applicable zone.
(i)
In the event that no specific requirement is given in these
regulations, Massachusetts Highway Department standards
shall apply.
(j)
Calculations. The calculations (or a certified copy thereof) to
determine the sizes of all pipes and culverts in the drainage system
shall be submitted to the Board for review Such calculations should
be based on the Rational Method and prepared by a registered
professional engineer. A drainage analysis map shall show the
tributary watershed area and downstream area affected by runoff,
and drainage computations shall consider the entire watershed
area. Where excessive poor soils or disturbed cover exists,
calculations shall give consideration to frozen ground conditions,
soil types and cover for all affected areas, including but not limited
to lawns, base ground, graveled ways, etc.
(9)
Sewer. Sewer pipes and related equipment, such as manholes and
connecting Y's, shall be constructed in conformity with Marshfield DPW
standards. Sewer pipes shall be installed where sewering is proposed
by the Sewerage Master Plan.
C.
Water. Preliminary approval for availability of adequate water supply
must be obtained from the Board of Public Works. Design of the
proposed installations of water distribution lines and appurtenances
must also be approved by that Board. Water pipes and related
equipment, such as hydrants and main shutoff valves, and service
boxes, shall be installed within the subdivision as necessary to provide
all lots on each street with adequate water supply for domestic and fire
protection use and in conformity with specifications of the Department
of Public Works (Marshfield). Pipe size shall be as specified by the
Board of Public Works, but in no case shall be less than eight inches
in diameter. The entire cost of installation, including connection to the
D.
§ 405-10 MARSHFIELD CODE § 405-10
C:548
Town system and wages of the inspector, shall be borne by the owner.
The Water Supervisor shall approve all materials. Taps on water mains
shall be made and located as directed by the Water Division. Titles to
mains and hydrant will not be accepted until at least six months after
pressure has been put onto them, all measurements have been turned
over to the Water Division, and all lines proven tight, after which 10%
of the cost of the entire water installation or a minimum of $500 will be
held out for an additional year. No services shall be connected at the
property line until an application has been filed at the Water Division
office. Final approval of water system specifications shall be given by
the Department of Public Works. Water lines in excess of 800 feet shall
be required to be looped. [Amended 7-24-2017]
Pipes.
Sewer, water, gas and other underground utilities, if any, together
with all connections to the proposed subdivision lots on both sides
of the street, shall be laid after the roadway is subgraded but
before application of the gravel base occurs. All such pipes shall be
given a definite location as per the typical cross sections contained
in the appendix of these rules and regulations.57
(1)
Drainage pipes shall be of not less than 12 inches reinforced
concrete, coated corrugated aluminum or plastic construction. All
drainpipes shall have a minimum of 2 1/2 feet of cover, except that
reduced cover may be permitted at the discretion of the Board if
Class V reinforced concrete pipe is specified. Each length shall be
laid true to line and grade as shown on the plan. Each length shall
have a full firm bearing throughout.
(2)
The backfilling of all trenches shall be thoroughly tamped in
accordance with Article IV, Design Standards and Required
Improvements, and shall not be puddled.
(3)
E.
Underground utilities.
All electrical, telephone, cable television and other utility wires
shall be placed below ground in every subdivision unless the Board
determines that such placement is not feasible or is not in the best
interest of the Town. Such utilities shall be constructed according
to the information contained in the appendix.
(1)
All service connections for utilities shall be clearly marked at the
lot line and shall be installed so that electric, telephone, sewer, and
water services are located perpendicular to the street at the lot
line. Telephone and electric utilities shall be located at alternate
side lot lines (at every other lot corner).
(2)
F.
Easements. All easements shall comply with the following
requirements:
G.
57.Editor's Note: See Appendix A included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 405-10 CHARTER § 405-10
C:549
§ 405-11. Erosion control facilities; criteria and objectives.
As required under § 405-8 above, an erosion control plan shall be submitted
which meets the following objectives and criteria:
If a waiver is granted allowing utility pipe lines to be placed in
easements, said easements shall be 20 feet (or more if deemed
necessary) in width and shall be adjacent to or centered on
property lines unless otherwise permitted. Concrete bounds shall
be set at all corners and angle points for the information of the
landowners.
(1)
Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
wetland, stream, or channel, the Board may require that there
be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way of
adequate width to conform substantially to the lines of such
watercourse, drainageway, wetland, stream or channel and to
provide for construction, maintenance, access or other necessary
purposes.
(2)
(3) All easements must be of a form acceptable to the Town Clerk.
Stone walls. Any removal or alteration of trees/stone walls on Towndesignated
scenic roads shall require an application and public hearing
pursuant to the Scenic Road Act.58
H.
Keep disturbed areas small. No more than 50 feet wide, 100 feet
long, and 20% of a single lot, or five acres of the overall tract, are
recommended guidelines. Consideration of topographic, soil, and
vegetative characteristics shall be demonstrated through identification
of erodible soils, steep slopes, stream banks and drainageways, and
measures designed to limit disturbance of these areas.
A.
Stabilize and protect disturbed areas quickly. Exposed areas and
stockpiles should be revegetated within 30 to 60 days. Two methods
are available for stabilizing disturbed areas, mechanical (or structural)
methods and vegetative methods. In some cases, both are combined
in order to retard erosion. The selected measure should be identified
in a construction management plan submitted with the subdivision
application.
B.
Keep stormwater runoff velocities low. Acceptable velocities are in the
two to 10 feet per second range. The removal of existing vegetative
cover during development and the resulting increase in impermeable
surface area after development will increase both the volume and
velocity of runoff. These increases must be taken into account when
providing for erosion control. [Amended 7-24-2017]
C.
58.Editor's Note: See MGL c. 40, § 15C, and Ch. 250, Streets and Sidewalks, Art. VII, Scenic
Roads, of the Town General Bylaws.
§ 405-10 MARSHFIELD CODE § 405-11
C:550
§ 405-12. Other facilities.
Protect disturbed areas from stormwater runoff. Conservation
measures can be utilized to prevent water from entering and running
over the disturbed area. Diversions and other control practices to
intercept runoff from higher watershed areas, store or divert it away
from vulnerable areas, and direct it toward stabilized outlets should
be utilized. Selected measures should be identified in the proposed
construction management plan.
D.
Retain sediment within site area. Sediment can be retained by two
methods, filtering runoff as it flows and detaining sediment or detaining
runoff for a period of time so that the soil particles settle out. The best
way to control sediment, however, is to prevent erosion.
E.
Sidewalks. The Planning Board shall require sidewalks of such width
and construction to be constructed in accordance with the typical cross
section.59 In no case shall sidewalks be less than five feet in width.
They shall be of broom-finished portland cement concrete with oneinch-
deep score lines spaced five feet apart on centers. Sections shall
be a maximum of 30 feet in length, with sections separated from each
other and from driveway sections by one-half-inch-thick premolded
bitumastic filler. The depth (thickness) of concrete and of filler shall be
four inches except at driveways where it shall be six inches. Portland
cement concrete driveway aprons from the sidewalk to the gutter line
shall be constructed to the same specifications as the sidewalk where it
crosses the driveway.
A.
Driveways. Proposed driveways shall be shown on the road
construction plan and topographic plan and shall be designed to
intersect the street at a grade not greater than 3% for a distance of
25 feet back from the edge of the traveled way and shall intersect
generally at right angles and in locations having proper sight distances.
Curb cuts for driveways shall not be placed within 50 feet of street
intersections. Driveways within the lot shall not contain grades greater
than 15%.
B.
Vegetation.
Every effort shall be made to preserve the existing trees on the
right-of-way and on the lots to be sold. Filling and cutting of
roadways shall be done in such a manner as to preserve the trees
and existing soil cover whenever possible. The Planning Board shall
require that the applicant shall provide and plant suitable shade
trees spaced not less than 40 feet apart along the way, variety to
be approved by the Planning Board. Trees to be planted shall have
a minimum height of 12 feet with eight-foot head clearance and
shall be of at least three-inch caliper at the height of 42 inches from
ground level. All trees shall be planted within the way lines, except
(1)
C.
59.Editor's Note: See Appendix A included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 405-11 CHARTER § 405-12
C:551
that, with written consent of the owner, trees may be planted up to
20 feet from the exterior lines of the way if deemed desirable by
the Planning Board.
On slopes along the way where stabilization is required, or where
lawn maintenance and moving may be unfeasible, a combination of
ground covers and shrub plantings may be required by the Board.
The landscape plan shall specify species, quantities and sizes of
proposed plantings.
(2)
Streetlighting. Streetlighting shall be provided only for the purpose of
vehicular and pedestrian safety as recommended by the Police Safety
Officer at locations that may present particular hazards, e.g., street
intersections. Illumination for general residential purposes or security
is not intended in single-family residential areas. The Board of
Selectmen shall approve proposed streetlighting prior to endorsement
of the definitive plan.
D.
Fire alarm systems. Before approval of a plan, the Board may require
the plan to show location and type of fire alarm system in accordance
with recommendations of the Marshfield Fire Chief. The developer shall
pay the cost of installation.
E.
Parks and open spaces. Before approval of a plan by the Board, it
may require the plan to show a park, or parks, suitably located for
playground or recreation purposes or for providing light and air, and
not unreasonable in area in relation to the land being subdivided and
the prospective uses of such land, and make the appropriate
endorsement on the plan, requiring that no building be erected upon
such park or parks without its approval.
F.
Slope stabilization.
Slope is defined as the ratio of vertical rise over horizontal
distance. Upon completion of grading and replacement of topsoil,
slopes shall be appropriately stabilized to prevent erosion.
Excessive slopes shall not be permitted. The Board shall approve
an adequate slope stabilization plan.
(1)
The following guide is recommended:
Slopes more than 1 in 2: riprap or terracing. Not allowed
where alternative layouts permit lesser slopes.
(a)
Slopes of 1 in 8 to 1 in 2: sod or establishing vegetation
or seedlings in association with webbing or approved mulch
placed over the soil. Not allowed where alternative layouts
permit lesser slopes.
(b)
Slopes of 2 in 20 to 1 in 8: plant seed in association with
webbing or approved mulch placed over the soil.
(c)
(2)
G.
§ 405-12 MARSHFIELD CODE § 405-12
C:552
Appropriate temporary measures should be taken to prevent
erosion of bankings and slopes during construction.
(3)
Retaining walls.
Wherever retaining walls may be required, design and type of wall
construction shall be submitted to the Board for approval prior to
installation.
(1)
All retaining walls shall be constructed on the line of the street
layout.
(2)
Retaining wall shall have a maximum individual height of four feet
and a total combination of no more than 12 feet in height.
(3)
Where several retaining walls are used, a minimum five-foot
separation shall be provided between walls.
(4)
H.
Dwellings per lot. Not more than one building designed or available for
use for dwelling purposes shall be erected or placed or converted to use
as such on any lot in a subdivision, or elsewhere in the Town, without
the consent of the Planning Board, and such consent may be conditional
upon the providing of adequate ways furnishing access to each site for
such building, in the same manner as otherwise required for lots within
a subdivision.
I.
Impediments to access. In order to provide safe access and egress
for all subdivisions, no temporary or permanent gate, fence or other
obstruction may be erected on any portion of the right-of-way unless
permitted by the Board.

Stone or approved reinforced concrete bounds shall be placed on both
sides of the street at all angle points, at the beginning and end of all
curves, and at all intersections of streets and ways. Intermediate bounds
must be set where the distance between bounds would otherwise exceed
500 feet. Bounds shall be not less than three feet in length and not less
than six inches in width and breadth. No permanent monuments or bounds
shall be installed until all construction, which would destroy or disturb the
monuments, is completed and the top of the bounds shall be set to finished
grade. The bounds are to be set by a land surveyor who shall certify in
writing that they conform to the approved subdivision plan. Bounds shall
also be set for all front lot corners before utilities are installed to ensure
accurate measurement for utility location. All street monuments are to
be accurately tied into three or more suitable objects selected for their
durability and prominence. This information is to be provided to the Town
Engineer on a copy of the street layout or the subdivision plan.

When vertical or slope block granite street curbing is required, it shall be
in accordance with the standards set forth below, and all culs-de-sac and
curves with a radius of 60 feet or less shall be of vertical granite only. Cape
Cod berm when specified shall be used throughout, except that vertical
granite curb inlets with appropriate inclined transition sections (of vertical
granite) shall be provided at all catch basins. The curb inlet and catch basin
installation shall conform to the typical curb inlet detail drawing.60
Granite curbs; general. Curbstone shall be of hard and durable granite,
or a light color satisfactory to the Engineer, free from seams which
impair its structural integrity, and of a good smooth splitting

whether a major or minor change (see § 405-8I).
§ 405-16. Street signs.
Street signs to specification of the Superintendent of the DPW are to
be furnished and installed for every intersection by the developer. The
developer shall maintain street signs until the Town accepts the ways. Said
signs are required to be installed by the developer following the installation
of the base course of the roadway, and prior to issuance of building permits.
In the event that the covenant is released by the posting of surety, the
applicant shall place at least temporary street signage at all intersections
until the base course, as required above, is completed. In addition to the
sign stating the name of the street, the applicant shall be responsible for
installing a sign beneath the street name that reads "Not a Town Way." This
sign shall remain in place until the Town accepts the street.
§ 405-17. Street acceptance.
Approval of the definitive plan does not constitute the layout or
acceptance by the Town of streets shown on the plan.
A.
The developer shall provide a street layout plan suitable for recording
containing all necessary information for Town acceptance of the
streets. This street layout plan shall be provided prior to the release of
security for the subdivision.
B.
After completion of construction, the developer shall execute an
instrument, in a form acceptable to Town Counsel, transferring to the
Town, without cost, valid unencumbered title to the right-of-way and all
utilities installed therein, the drainage system, including any drainage
lots and/or easements, and any other easements associated with the
subdivision.
C.
The Board shall retain a minimum of $10,000 surety or one lot for a
period not to exceed 24 months after completion of the subdivision and
the submittal of as-built and street acceptance plans acceptable to the
Planning Board and Town Engineer or until the streets are accepted by
the Town, whichever comes first. After this date, the Board shall return
the remainder of the security to the person or persons who furnished
the same.
D.
Once street acceptance plans have been submitted and approved by the
Town, the developer shall be responsible for petitioning the Board of
Selectmen and Department of Public Works to accept the streets. The
developer shall be responsible for repairing all damage to constructed
ways and municipal services within the roadway layout and shall be

in addition to any standards prescribed elsewhere in these rules and
regulations. These objectives are intended to provide specific
guidelines for the Board and the applicant:
Architectural details. Architectural details of new buildings and
additions, and textures of walls and roof materials, should be
harmonious with the building's overall architectural style and
should preserve and enhance the historic character of Marshfield.
(1)
Building articulation. Building facades in excess of 40 feet shall
incorporate recesses and projections, of a minimum of two feet
in depth, to break up the building's mass. A minimum of 60%
of the building's public green(s) and/or street side facade shall
contain windows and other appropriate architectural elements.
The windows should be divided by muntins and framed with a
casing trim; awnings should be designed as an integral part of
the building facade; metal awnings are discouraged. Facades shall
emphasize architectural elements (including windows, balconies,
porches, entries, etc.) that create a complementary pattern or
rhythm, dividing large buildings into smaller identifiable pieces.
This standard may be waived for building facades fronting on Route
139 (Plain Street) where, in the opinion of the Planning Board, the
elevated vegetated buffer provides adequate screening.
(2)
Building form and features. The mass, proportion and scale of the
building, roof shape, roof pitch, and proportions and relationships
between doors and windows should be harmonious among
themselves.
(3)
C.
§ 414-6 CHARTER § 414-6
C:581
Building location. Proposed buildings and structures shall be
integrated as much as possible within the existing building
locations, landscape and terrain. Building location shall be oriented
parallel or perpendicular to the public green(s) and/or street and
shall be oriented around the public green and not Route 139 (Plain
Street). Where the minimum setback cannot be maintained, the
applicant shall provide adequate spatial definitions through the
use of walls, fences and/or other elements which will maintain the
street line. Uses shall be grouped together to maximize pedestrian
access by connecting sidewalks and pathways. The large retail
establishment shall either provide an entrance to the public green
or side facade to the public green shall be lined with uses to
enhance the pedestrian activities and the use of the public
green(s).
(4)
Building design. The design of proposed buildings, structures and
additions shall complement, whenever feasible, the general
setback, roofline, roof pitch, arrangement of openings, color,
exterior materials, proportion and scale of existing buildings in the
vicinity.
(5)
Spatial definition. Define various areas both public and private
with walks, plantings, walls, fences and other elements that are in
keeping with the overall architectural design.
(6)
Parking design. The majority of the parking shall be located to the
rear or sides of buildings. All parking and loading areas shall be
completely screened from Route 139 (Plain Street) by a minimum
fifty-foot-wide raised and landscaped buffer. Parking lots and
loading areas shall be appropriately screened from roadways
within the overlay district by a minimum twenty-foot-wide raised
and landscaped buffer. Appropriately designed view corridors of
buildings from the roadways within the overlay district shall be
allowed.
(7)
Parking spaces. Applicant shall demonstrate adequacy of space for
the off-street loading and unloading of vehicles, goods, products,
materials, and equipment incidental to the normal operation of
the establishment. Reduction in parking space requirements may
be permitted where by design and use it is shown to the Board's
satisfaction that the parking is compatibly shared by multiple uses.
However, in no case shall a parking requirement reduction exceed
20% of those parking spaces required under normal application of
requirements for the nonresidential uses proposed.
(8)
Special features. Exposed machinery, utility structures and areas
for parking, loading, storage, service and disposal shall be
screened from adjoining properties and streets as deemed
necessary by the SPGA.

Lighting. All lighting and other sources of illumination, whether
interior or exterior, and all intense light emanating from operations
or equipment shall be shielded from direct view at normal eye level
from adjacent properties. Lighting should match the architectural
style of the building and comply with the Zoning Bylaw, § 305-8.09.
(10)
Pedestrian furnishings. The Board shall evaluate convenience and
safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement within the site, and in
relation to adjacent streets, property, or improvements. Benches,
bicycle racks, bollards, pedestrian-scale lighting, street trees,
refuse containers, flower boxes, and canopies shall be provided
where deemed appropriate by the SPGA and shall be consistent
with the character of the development.
(11)
Disposal. The Board shall review adequacy of the methods of
disposal for sewage, refuse and other wastes resulting from the
uses permitted or permissible on the site and the methods of
drainage for surface water, including consideration of groundwater
recharge.

(22)
Findings and purposes. The Town of Marshfield requires industrial,
commercial, community facilities, and residential uses (except existing
one-family detached dwellings) to provide documentation that
demonstrates that the concentration of nitrate-nitrogen in groundwater
resulting from these uses shall not exceed five parts per million (ppm)
at the downgradient property boundary. These requirements are based
on the following findings:
Whereas the Town of Marshfield does not have a sewer system
to treat wastewater from development within its Water Resource
Protection District, the disposal of this wastewater through septic
systems within the district poses a threat to the drinking water
quality of the public supply wells the district is designed to protect.
The primary contaminant of concern coming from the septic
systems is nitrogen.
(1)
Once nitrogen released from septic systems reaches groundwater,
it is not attenuated, but it is diluted with recharge from
precipitation, road and roof runoff, and lawn irrigation. These
dilution waters also transport some nitrogen, though not as
concentrated as septic system wastewater. Wastewater contributes
between 70% and 80% of the nitrogen in groundwater in developed
areas.
(2)
Excessive nitrogen in drinking water has been linked to serious
health effects. Consumption of excessive nitrate-nitrogen by infants
has been linked to methemoglobinemia (blue baby syndrome);
nitrate occupies the hemoglobin site on red blood cells limiting
the transport of oxygen through the blood. There is also a concern
that excessive nitrogen in drinking water can be converted to
excessive nitrosamines (carcinogenic nitrogen forms) in stomach
acid. Excessive nitrogen in groundwater has also been linked to
excessive levels of other contaminants.
(3)
A.
§ 417-4 MARSHFIELD CODE § 417-5
C:590
Due to these health concerns, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP) have adopted maximum contaminant levels in
drinking water. If these levels are exceeded in a drinking water
supply well, utilization of the well must cease and an alternative
supply must be found. Treatment technology to remove excessive
nitrogen from drinking water prior to its use is currently
prohibitively expensive.
(4)
Since the Town of Marshfield has invested significant public funds
in the development of its current drinking water supply and wishes
to avoid the expense and potential health and economic concerns
that excessive nitrogen in its drinking water would cause, the
Town of Marshfield has adopted a nitrogen loading assessment
requirement in its Zoning Bylaw for development in its Water
Resource Protection District.
(5)
Applicability. The following projects which require a special permit in
accordance with the Table of Uses in the Marshfield Zoning Bylaw71
shall be subject to the provisions of this regulation:
(1) New commercial and industrial development;
(2) New community facilities;
New residential uses, including residential subdivisions of five or
more new lots; and
(3)
Existing commercial, industrial, or community facilities where a
change of use is proposed that will increase the concentration of
nitrogen on the site.
(4)
B.
Nitrogen loading assumptions and calculations.
Nitrogen loading. For the purposes of this regulation, nitrogen
loading shall be calculated using the attached form titled "Town of
Marshfield - Planning Board Nitrogen Loading Calculation Form."72
(1)
Nonresidential wastewater flow. Although Title 5 wastewater flows
will be used conventionally in the calculation of nitrogen loading,
commercial and industrial development and community facilities
may use measured water use flows to calculate nitrogen loads
from wastewater. In order to use measured water use flows, an
applicant must present annual water bills or equivalent information
to support the use of these flows. It is recommended that measured
water use information from at least three comparable
developments or three years worth of water records be provided.
The Town of Marshfield Planning Board shall determine the validity

of supporting information and may reject or modify the use of
wastewater flows other than Title 5 wastewater flows.
Residential wastewater flow. Residential developments may use a
wastewater flow that is the mean of standard Title 5 wastewater
flows and modified Title 5 flows based on occupancy data. Modified
Title 5 flows shall be calculated by multiplying actual Title 5 flows
by the fraction represented by dividing the average single-family
residence occupancy in the Town by two times the number of
proposed bedrooms. Average occupancy shall equal total Town
population divided by occupied housing units (both values from the
most recent U.S. census) unless the Planning Board determines
that alternative values should be used.
Sample Calculation for a three-bedroom home:
Base Statistics
Number of bedrooms = 3
Standard Title 5 flow = 330 gpd
Average occupancy = 2.5 people1
Step One: Calculate Modifying Fraction
Average occupancy divided by 2 times number of bedrooms:
2.5/(2 * 3) = 0.42
Step Two: Calculate Modified Title 5 Flow
Modifying fraction times Title 5 flow:
0.42 * 330 = 138.6 gpd
Step Three: Calculate Mean Estimated Flow
Mean of standard Title 5 flow and modified Title 5 flow:
(138.6 + 330)/2 = 234.3 gpd
1 For illustration purposes only. Does not necessarily represent
the actual average occupancy rate in the Town of Marshfield.
(3)
Nitrogen concentrations. Nutrient concentrations applied to
nitrogen loading calculations shall follow the following schedule:
Source of Nitrogen
Concentration of
Nitrogen
(milligrams per
liter)
Wastewater effluent from a standard onsite
system
35
Wastewater effluent from a DEP
approved denitrification system

C:592
Source of Nitrogen
Concentration of
Nitrogen
(milligrams per
liter)
Wastewater effluent from a centralized
wastewater treatment facility
10
Runoff from roadways and driveways 1.5
Runoff from rooftops 0.75
Rainfall (runoff on natural surfaces) 0.05
Nutrient loading from turf fertilization.
To calculate the loading of nitrogen from turf areas, the
applicant shall first multiply the area of turf by the estimated
application rate of 3.0 pounds of nitrogen per 1,000 square
feet of turf. The applicant shall then multiply this value by 0.25
assuming a 25% leaching rate to groundwater.
(a)
The area of turf associated with a residential development
shall be equal to 50% of the lot area. The Planning Board may
allow for a reduction in this value based upon area calculations
performed from an engineered site plan. Where landscaped
areas are proposed to be unfertilized on a site plan, the burden
of proof will be on the applicant to provide assurance that the
area will not be fertilized in the foreseeable future based on
plant selection and landscape design.
(b)
(5)
Recharge rates. Recharge rates assigned to the site shall be based
on preexisting hydrologic soils groups in accordance with the
following table:
NRCS Hydrologic Soils Group
Recharge Rate
(inches per year)
A Soils 24
B Soils 18
C Soils 10
D Soils 3
Wetlands and surface waters 0
(6)
Nutrient loading from impervious surfaces. Nitrogen loading from
impervious surfaces will be calculated by multiplying the
appropriate nitrogen loading coefficient by the recharge rate
associated with the soil that will be covered by the impervious
surface. This approach is based on the assumption that postdevelopment
recharge volumes shall approximate pre-development
recharge rates pursuant to the Massachusetts Stormwater
(7)
§ 417-5 CHARTER § 417-5
C:593
§ 417-6. Fees.
All applications shall be accompanied by two certified checks made payable
to the order of the Town of Marshfield. One check shall be for administrative
Standards. Where an alternative approach is used specifically for
redevelopment pursuant to the Massachusetts Stormwater
Standards, the Planning Board may accept annual recharge volume
calculations associated with impervious cover that are provided
and stamped by the applicant's engineer.
The final average concentration of nitrogen. The final average
concentration of nitrogen in groundwater shall be calculated by
dividing the total annual mass load of nitrogen by the total annual
volume of recharge and shall be expressed as milligrams per liter
(mg/l).
(8)
Aggregate concentration calculations. For those applicants who require
a special permit pursuant to § 305-13.03E(4)(d) of the Zoning Bylaw, an
aggregate concentration calculation shall be developed to demonstrate
that the concentration of nitrogen in groundwater shall not exceed five
mg/l at the boundary of the Zone I for the public water supply.
Description of calculation. The aggregate concentration calculation
is used to examine the aggregate effect of adding larger individual
wastewater systems to the district. These analyses determine the
area that the wastewater effluent will occupy on its way to the Zone
I boundary, and the extent to which the flow is or is not diluted
by overlying land use activity. Similar to on-site nitrogen loading
calculations, the aggregate concentration calculations will use a
mass balance approach, dividing the total load of nitrogen from
overlying land uses by the annual volume of recharge to determine
an average downgradient concentration.
(1)
Area of impact (AOI). The nitrogen aggregation calculation shall
first determine the AOI created by the plume from the leach field
of the on-site wastewater treatment system. The applicant shall
develop a flow net analysis that includes a groundwater mounding
analysis to delineate the wastewater plume as it travels from the
leach field to the edge of the Zone I.
(2)
Calculating nitrogen concentration. The concentration of nitrogen
at the Zone I boundary shall be calculated using the same
assumptions as those provided in § 417-4B of these regulations. To
estimate the different land use categories for areas within the AOI
that are off site, the applicant shall use best available information
from readily available GIS databases. Interpretation of aerial
photography to estimate the coverage of different land features
may be allowed along with any vector files that represent
impervious cover. The Planning Board shall make the final
determination as to which data is the best suited for the analysis.

additional payments required shall be made within 30 days of the billing
date.
Administrative fees. The filing fee shall be as provided in Chapter 420,
Fee Schedule, for a special permit application. [Amended 7-24-2017]
A.
Consultant review fee/special account.
Every special permit application shall be required to file the
minimum review fee to establish an individual special account. If, in
addition, this minimum amount is not sufficient to cover the entire
cost of the review, the Board shall adjust said special account.
The minimum fee and the adjustment schedule are as provided in
Chapter 420, Fee Schedule. [Amended 7-24-2017]
(1)
Where specific conditions arising from the land or the nature of
the proposal necessitate the assistance of a planning, engineering,
traffic, soils, hydrologic or other consultant(s), the Planning Board
may engage such consultant services to assist the Board in
analyzing the project to ensure compliance with all relevant laws,
bylaws, regulations, good design principles and state of the art
technology. The Board may require that applicants pay a review fee
consisting of the reasonable costs to be projected to be incurred by
the Board for the employment of consultants engaged by the Board
to assist in the review of the application.
(2)
Funds received by the Board pursuant to this section shall be
deposited with the Town Treasurer/Collector who shall establish a
special individual account for this purpose. Expenditures from this
special account may be made at the direction of the Board, without
further appropriation. Expenditures from this special account shall
be made only in connection with the review of a specific project
or projects for which a review fee has been or will be collected
from the applicant. Failure of an applicant to pay all review fees
shall be grounds for denial of the application or permit. [Amended
7-24-2017]
(3)
Review fees may only be spent for services rendered in connection
with the specific project for which they were collected. Accrued
interest may also be spent for this purpose. At the completion of
the Board's review of a project, any excess amount in the account,
including any interest, attributable to a specific project shall be
repaid to the applicant or the applicant's successor in interest. The
applicant must submit a written request for these funds. A final
report for said account shall be made available to the applicant,
upon request, or the applicant's successor in interest. For the
purpose of this regulation, any person or entity claiming to be an
applicant's successor in interest shall provide the Board with the
documentation establishing such succession in interest.

Any applicant may take an administrative appeal from the selection
of the outside consultant to the Board of Selectmen, provided that
such appeal is taken within 14 days of notification of the Board's
appointment of the consultant. The grounds for such an appeal
shall be limited to claims that the consultant selected has a conflict
of interest or does not possess the minimum required qualifications
as may be set by the Board. The minimum qualifications shall
consist either of a four-year college level educational degree in, or
one related to, the field of knowledge at issue or three or more
years of practice in the field at issue or a closely related field.
Minimum qualifications may be increased at the Board's discretion
depending upon the complexity and importance of the proposed
project. The required time limit for action upon an application by
the Board shall be extended by the duration of the administrative
appeal. In the event that no decision is made by the Board of
Selectmen within one month following the filing of the appeal, the
selection made by the Board shall stand.
(5)
Other costs and expenses. The Planning Board shall write the public
hearing notice and furnish the notice to the applicant. The applicant
is responsible for paying the cost of the legal advertisement in the
newspaper. The notice of public hearing shall be mailed certified
delivery by the applicant to all parties in interest not less than 10 days
before the date of the public hearing. The applicant is responsible for
the costs associated with mailing the notice to abutters and any parties
in interest by certified mail, return receipt requested. Return receipts
are to be addressed to the Planning Board for further verification.
C.
Modification. The administrative fee to modify an existing special
permit is established in Chapter 420, Fee Schedule. The applicant shall
submit a check made out to the Town of Marshfield at the time of the
request to modify the WRPD special permit. [Amended 7-24-2017]

granted through a majority vote of the Planning Board.
Lapse of special permit. No special permit shall be authorized by the
Board without the express condition that it will lapse if substantial
use under the permit is not commenced within two years from the
date of final action by the Board, except for good cause, or the final
determination of an appeal.
E.
Extension of special permit. Approval in all cases is granted for a twoyear
period from the date of the filing of such approval with the Town
Clerk. If a development is not completed in its entirety in that time,
the applicant must again petition the Planning Board for an extension
of time to complete the project. The applicant shall apply for the
extension 30 days prior to the lapse of the special permit. In the event
that the project has not been completed within two years of approval
and the Planning Board has not granted an extension of the time to
complete the project, the special permit approval will have expired.
If the special permit has expired, the applicant will be required to
request a reinstatement of the special permit approval. The process for
reinstatement of the special permit is the same as the process required
for a new special permit as specified in these rules and regulations, in
§ 305-13.03 of the Zoning Bylaw and as required in MGL c. 40A, § 9.
All applications under this section must comply with the bylaw and its
rules and regulations in force at the time of application. [Amended
7-24-2017]
F.
Recording. No special permit shall take effect until a copy of the
decision, bearing the certification of the Town Clerk that 20 days have
elapsed after the filing of the decision and no appeal has been filed, is
recorded in the Registry of Deeds and is indexed under the name of the
record owner of the land. Proof of recording at the Registry of Deeds or
in Land Court as applicable shall be provided to the Planning Board.

specifying the nature of the violations and a schedule of compliance,
including cleanup of any spilled materials. This compliance schedule must
be reasonable in relation to the public health hazard involved and the
difficulty of compliance. In no event shall more than 30 days be allowed for
either compliance or modification of a plan for longer-term compliance. In
the enforcement of these rules and regulations, the Building Commissioner
shall notify the Health Inspector of any violations and seek the Health
Inspector's and/or Agent's assistance.

§ 505-5 MARSHFIELD CODE § 505-5
C:606
The applicant shall pay for the cost and expense of expert
consultants to review the application or to gather additional
information as deemed necessary by the Commission. Such
consultants shall work for and represent the interests of the
Commission.
(1)
Upon receipt of a permit application or RFD, or at any point in
its deliberations, the Commission may deem it necessary to obtain
expert engineering or other outside consultant services in order to
reach a final decision on the application. The specific consultant
services may include but are not limited to resource area survey
and delineation, analysis of resource area values, including wildlife
habitat evaluations, hydrogeologic and drainage analysis, and
environmental or land use law. In such instances the Commission
shall notify the applicant of this need and the estimated costs
and provide the opportunity for the application to be amended or
withdrawn. Should an applicant choose to proceed the Commission
shall require the applicant to pay the reasonable costs and
expenses borne by the Commission for these consulting services as
listed below. This fee is called the "consultant fee."
(2)
The exercise of discretion by the Commission in making its
determination to require the payment of a consultant fee shall
be based upon its reasonable finding that additional information
acquirable only through outside consultants would be necessary for
the making of an objective decision.
(3)
Consultants must meet the minimum qualifications of:
(a) An educational degree in or related to the field at issue; or
Three or more years of practice in the field at issue or a related
field.
(b)
(4)
An applicant may appeal the choice of the consultant selected by
the Commission to the Board of Selectmen. Such an administrative
appeal is limited to claims that:
(a) The consultant has a conflict of interest.
The consultant does not possess the minimum required
qualifications.
(b)
(5)
The time required for action by the Commission on the application
for a permit or approval is extended pending the appeal. The
selection by the Commission stands unless the Board of Selectmen
decides otherwise within one month following the filing of the
appeal.
(6)
The Commission may require the payment of the consultant fee at
any point in its deliberations prior to a final decision. The applicant
shall pay the fee to be put into a special revolving fund consultant

The Commission shall return any unused portion of the consultant
fee, along with any interest accrued during the time the funds were
deposited in the special revolving fund consultant services account,
to the applicant.

all overages.
Each additional $500,000 project cost increment (over
$2,000,000) shall be charged at an additional $2,500 estimated
required fee per increment.
(a)
The project cost means the estimated entire cost of the project,
including but not limited to building construction, site
preparation, landscaping, roadway and drainage construction,
utilities, and all site improvements. The consultant fee shall
be paid pro rata for that portion of the project cost applicable
to those activities affecting all resource areas protected by
this bylaw. The project shall not be segmented to avoid being
subject to the consultant fee. The applicant shall submit
estimated project costs at the Commission's request, but the
lack of such estimated project costs shall not avoid the
payment of the consultant fee.
(b)
(9)
The Conservation Commission shall hold a public hearing within 21
days of receipt of a complete notice of intent by the Commission. The
hearing may be continued in accordance with the regulations set forth

(1)
Make a determination that the proposed activity is significant to
one or more of the interests identified by the bylaw and shall issue
an order of conditions for the protection of said interests.
(2)
A.
The order of conditions shall impose such conditions as are necessary
to protect one or more of the interests identified by the bylaw. If the
Commission finds that the proposed activity cannot be regulated so
as to protect the interests identified in the bylaw, then the order may
prohibit the proposed activity.
B.
If the Commission finds that the information submitted by the applicant
is not sufficient to describe the site, the work or the effect of the
work on the interests identified in the bylaw, it may issue an order of
conditions prohibiting the work. The order shall specify the information
lacking and why it was necessary.
C.
The order of conditions shall be valid for three years from the date
of its issuance. The order may be extended by majority vote of the

of said order of conditions or certificate of compliance in accordance with
MGL c. 249, § 4.
§ 505-10. Performance standards.
Upon completion of the activity described in the notice of intent in
accordance with the order of conditions, the applicant or his or her
successor in interest shall request the Commission, in writing, that
a certificate of compliance be issued stating that the work has been
satisfactorily completed in compliance with all conditions set forth in
the order of conditions. Unless exempted by the Commission, said
request shall be accompanied by an as-built plan, certified by a
professional engineer or surveyor who is registered in the
commonwealth, certifying that the work conforms to the plans, or
specifying how the completed work differs from that shown on the
submitted plans.
A.
In all other respects, the procedure for granting a certificate of
compliance shall be identical to those procedures set forth in 310 CMR
10.05(9).
B.
There shall be no habitable space in any structure wherein the top of
any floor elevation of the habitable space is below 11 feet above mean
sea level (MSL) or below the flood surge height as determined by the
most recent FEMA flood insurance maps. No utilities for any structure
shall be placed below 11 feet above MSL or below the flood surge
height as determined by the most recent FEMA flood insurance maps,
whichever is higher.
A.
A setback zone shall be created so that no disturbance or alteration
shall occur within 50 feet and no building or structure shall be placed
within 75 feet of any area set forth in § 505-3A(1) for any new
construction or development. No activity, including but not limited to
landscaping, mowing, or removal of vegetation, is allowed in the no

any area set forth in § 505-3A(1):
Work related to the public water supply or municipal sewer
systems.
(a)
(2)
B.
§ 505-8 MARSHFIELD CODE § 505-10
C:610
Structures related to stormwater management such as swales,
retention and detention basins, drainage pipes and headwalls.
(b)
Work related to maintaining, repairing or replacing, but not
substantially changing or enlarging, an existing and lawfully
located structure or facility used in the service of the public
to provide electric, gas, water, or telephone service, provided
that the written notice has been given to the Conservation
Commission prior to commencement of work.
(c)
Public open space nature trails, observation platforms,
boardwalks, or footbridges.
(d)
(e) Seawalls, bulkheads, and revetments.
(f) Docks, piers, and associated ramps.
Repairs or improvements to existing on-site septic systems
and their related structures in order to comply with current
standards where there is no viable alternative. No increase in
the design flow of the dwelling shall be permitted.
(g)
A vernal pool setback zone shall be created where no disturbance or
alteration shall occur within 100 feet of a vernal pool.
C.
Any proposed way or pavement within 100 feet of an area subject to
protection under these regulations must be constructed with a surface
approved by the Conservation Commission. Construction of any way
which is built in an area subject to protection under these regulations,
which constitutes a limited project as defined in the Code of
Massachusetts Regulations, 310 CMR 10.53(3), must not be
constructed in a manner which restricts the flow of water or restricts or
endangers the movement of local wildlife. Every way in an area subject
to protection must provide throughways accessible to local wildlife. The
total width of said throughways shall not be less than 5% of the length
of that portion of the way which passes through the area subject to
protection.
D.
There shall be no removing, filling, dredging, or altering of isolated
wetland subject to flooding in the Polder, which is that area identified
as the Green Harbor Reclamation Area on the plan titled "Plan Showing
Boundaries of Green Harbor Reclamation District," dated February
1925, Plymouth Registry of Deeds, Plan Book 1, Page 142.
E.
Any alteration of a vegetated wetland may be allowed up to but not
to exceed 5,000 square feet; provided, however, that the wetland so
altered is replaced in kind by an area not less than 200% of the area
so altered and the replication is conducted in accordance with the
regulations set forth in 310 CMR 10.55(4)(b). The exception provided
in 310 CMR 10.55(4)(c) is not allowed under the bylaw. Therefore,
any alteration of any bordering vegetated wetlands is subject to this
provision.
F.
§ 505-10 CHARTER § 505-10
C:611
§ 505-11. Emergencies.
§ 505-12. Enforcement orders.
There shall be no destruction or removal of woody vegetation, shrubs,
trees, and the like within 100 feet of an area subject to protection, as
set forth in these regulations at § 505-3A(1), without first obtaining the
permission of the Commission.
G.
Breakaway walls (constructed in accordance with the State Building
Code) will be required in all structures built in areas subject to flooding
or coastal storm flowage, unless specifically exempted by the
Commission.
H.
Any project, whether it is within 100 feet of an area subject to
protection under these regulations or not, where there exists a
reasonable likelihood that stormwater runoff or drainage will be
discharged into or adversely affect an area subject to protection will
be subject to the Wetlands Protection Bylaw, and the proponent must
file a notice of intent with the Commission and take action necessary to
prevent such adverse effects on the areas protected by the bylaw.
I.
Where any structure is proposed within land subject to tidal action,
coastal storm flowage or flooding, adequate access to and egress from
said structure must be proven by the applicant to be available so that
individuals can leave the structure and emergency vehicles can access
the structure during the entire course of a 100-year storm. Failure on
the part of the proponent to meet such a burden shall be reasonable
cause for the Commission to conclude that the health, welfare and
safety of individuals in the community are endangered and, therefore,
it may deny the application.
J.
Where activity is necessary to protect public health and safety, the
Commission may certify an emergency situation and allow the activity.
A.
Any person requesting permission to do an emergency project shall
specify why the project is necessary for the protection of the public
health or safety and what agency of the commonwealth or subdivision
thereof is to perform the project or has ordered the project to be
performed. If the project is certified to be an emergency by the
Commission, the certification shall include a description of the work
which is to be allowed and shall not include work beyond that necessary
to abate the emergency. A site inspection shall be made prior to
certification.
B.
An emergency certificate shall be issued only for the protection of
public health or safety.
C.
The time limitation for performance of emergency work shall not
exceed 30 days.
D.
§ 505-10 MARSHFIELD CODE § 505-12
C:612
§ 505-13. Severability.
If any provision of any part of these regulations or the application thereof
is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect any other provision of
these regulations.
§ 505-14. Variance.
When the Commission determines that an activity is in violation of the
bylaw, these regulations or an order of conditions, the Commission may
issue an enforcement order. Violations include, but are not limited to:
Failure to comply with an order of conditions, such as failure to

and safety of the residents of the Town of Marshfield. This regulation
will apply to marina moorings or other boating facilities as defined herein
serving watercraft and/or serving boats with holding tanks.

As used in these regulations, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BOARD  The duly elected members of the Board of Health in the Town of
Marshfield.

first offense by a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $200 and for a
subsequent offense by a fine of not less than $300. For the purpose of this
regulation, each day or part thereof of any violation shall be considered a
separate offense.

special permission or permit. [Amended 6-12-2017]

entire fee for the consultant will be paid for by the applicant. The mutually
agreed upon consultant will be hired by the Marshfield Board of Health. The
The Board of Health may vary the application of any provision of this
regulation, by a majority vote of the Board, when in its opinion the
enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice, provided that the
decision of the Board shall not conflict with the spirit of this regulation
and will provide the same amount of environmental protection. The
applicant must request a variance, waiver or special permission in
writing on a form provided by the Board of Health.

system.
The written report shall be based upon the following scope of
work:
[1] Geologic borings.
Water table map (one-foot interval contours) showing
groundwater flow direction.
[2]
Projections of downgradient concentrations of nitratenitrogen
(or other chemicals as requested by the Board

§ 645-3 MARSHFIELD CODE § 645-3
C:646
[6] Sewage flows as determined by Title 5 design flows.
Applicants who receive permits under this section shall install
a minimum of three downgradient and one upgradient
groundwater monitoring wells. Groundwater flow direction
will be determined from the USGS (1987) water table map
and from site-specific observation wells where necessary. Wells
will be constructed of two-inch threader flush joint PVC pipes
with locking caps. Groundwater samples will be obtained on
an annual basis utilizing a bailer following standard well
evaluation procedures (three well volumes will be removed
prior to sampling).
(c)
Evacuation is most easily accomplished using a gasoline pump
centrifugal. Water samples will be tested by a state-certified
laboratory on an annual basis for nitrate-nitrogen, ammonianitrogen,
Kjedahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, chloride, specific
conductance and volatile organic compounds (see separate
current listing). Results are to be reported to the Marshfield
Board of Health and shall meet Massachusetts Class I
groundwater standards and appropriate advisory levels for
organic chemicals at the downgradient property boundary.
Baseline samples of all applicable testing parameters will be
required. In the event that water quality standards are
violated, the following action will be undertaken by the septic
system owner:
Report test results to the Marshfield Board of Health
within 48 hours by certified mail.
[1]
Resample and retest monitoring wells for the parameters
which were above the water quality standards within five
days.
[2]
Notify the downgradient property owners who have a
private drinking water well within 48 hours of the second
testing round, if the results are above the current advisory
levels, by certified mail.
[3]
Decrease wastewater flows or increase the level of
treatment within 45 days. Notify the Board of Health of
these remedial measures.
[4]
Initiate any remedial actions deemed necessary by the
Board of Health.
[5]
All costs of complying with this section will be borne by the
applicant.

C. (2.4i) Perimeter, curtain, subsurface or french drains.
§ 645-3 CHARTER § 645-3
C:647
§ 645-4. Location. (Section 3)
The effectiveness of a perimeter drain system must be
demonstrated prior to the issuance of the disposal works
construction permit. The effect of attempting to lower the ground
or perched water table shall be monitored by installation of at least
one upgradient and one downgradient groundwater monitoring
well. The effectiveness of the underdrains shall be demonstrated by
taking ground monitoring well readings one time during the month
of March and one time during the month of April, for a period of
two high-water seasons. All groundwater monitoring well readings
must be observed by the Board's agent in order to be considered
valid groundwater readings. A separate fee will be charged for
each site visit (see separate current fee schedule for site work by
agent beyond inspection of septic system charged per inspection).
(1)
A perimeter, french, subsurface or curtain drain shall not serve
more than one lot and shall not be allowed on more than three
sides of a lot. They shall not cause accumulated water to drain
onto any abutting properties or public or private road. All work
shall be performed at the applicant's own expense and at their own
risk. This monitoring does not guarantee issuance of the disposal
works construction permit, either at the time of monitoring or at
completion, since the Board does not give conditional pre-approval
in matters relative to sewage disposal.
(2)
In order to propose a perimeter, french, curtain, or subsurface
drain system the groundwater table in question must be perched
in a relatively impermeable soil layer, have no vertical upward flux
component and be moving in a well-defined direction. If the drain
meets these criteria then the drain must be placed upgradient
of the proposed sewage system location, be of sufficient length
and geometry to intercept all groundwater affecting the location,
be keyed into the impeding layer upon which the groundwater is
perched, and have a positive discharge to the surface or to soil from
the location in question.
(3)
(2.5.3) General policy. Any reconstruction, alteration or repair of a
building to an extent of 50% or more of the assessed value of the
building shall be treated by this Board as new construction, to which
all Title 5 and Marshfield Board of Health rules and regulations for the
disposal of sanitary sewage apply.
D.
E. (2.7.1) Repealed January 24, 1991.
(2.9) Fees (supplements SEC Title 5, Regulation 2.9). See separate
current fee schedule.
F.
(2.23) All sewage disposal systems must be located in their entirety on
one lot or parcel of land, it being the same lot or parcel on which the
facility producing the sewage is located.
G.
§ 645-3 MARSHFIELD CODE § 645-4
C:648
(3.3) Subsoil and groundwater determination (adds to SEC Title 5,
Regulation 3.3). The Board of Health shall require that one or more
observation pits be dug to a depth of four feet below the bottom of
the proposed leaching facility to determine the maximum groundwater
elevation and the elevation of any impervious material. The Board may
also require additional test holes in the area reserved for expansion of
the disposal field.
A.
(3.4E) Leaching requirements. For new construction, if any percolation
test in the primary or reserve area is equal to or exceeds 20 minutes per
inch, a minimum of four percolation tests and four observation holes
shall be performed.
B.
(3.5L) Percolation tests.
In the event the Board's agent encounters soil conditions other
than coarse sand, additional percolation tests may be requested by
the Board or its agent to determine the consistency and naturally
pervious soil beneath the entire proposed leaching and reserve
areas.
(1)
The Board reserves the right to request additional percolation tests
at any time prior to the issuance of the disposal works construction
permit. The reasons for additional testing shall be provided to the
applicant in writing upon request.
(2)
C.
(3.5M) Dewatered percolation test.
The practice of conducting dewatered percolation tests will only be
allowed by a majority vote of the Board.
(1)
The Board may require consultant review, in accordance with
Section 15.28 of these regulations,77 to assess the engineering
aspects of the dewatered percolation test, to include but not be
limited to the following: site-specific soil conditions, groundwater
information, the destination of any discharged groundwater and
safety factors.
(2)
D.
(3.5N) Percolation tests. The validity of a percolation test will not
be limited to any specific number of years by the Board of Health.
Percolation test will not be required to be repeated to determine its
validity unless any of the following is applicable:
(1) The soil has been altered in any way.
Title 5 or the Marshfield rules and regulations are amended to
change any aspect pertaining to percolation tests.
(2)
E.
F. (3.7.1) Distances.

Among the 15.7% of students nationwide who currently smoke
cigarettes and were less than 18 years old, 14.1% usually obtained
them by buying them in a store (i.e., convenience store,
supermarket, or discount store) or gas station;88

The federal Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act

Although the manufacture and distribution of flavored cigarettes
(excluding menthol) is banned by federal law,101 neither federal nor
Massachusetts laws restrict sales of flavored non-cigarette tobacco
products, such as cigars, cigarillos, smokeless tobacco, hookah
tobacco, and electronic devices and the nicotine solutions used in
these devices;
(12)
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Surgeon
General have stated that flavored tobacco products are considered
to be "starter" products that help establish smoking habits that can
lead to long-term addiction;102
(13)
Data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey indicates that more
than 2/5 of U.S. middle and high school smokers report using
flavored little cigars or flavored cigarettes;103

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported
that electronic cigarette use among middle and high school
students doubled from 2011 to 2012;104

Nicotine solutions, which are consumed via electronic or batteryoperated
delivery smoking devices such as electronic cigarettes,
are sold in dozens of flavors that appeal to youth, such as cotton
candy and bubble gum;105

The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection has
classified liquid nicotine in any amount as an "acutely hazardous
waste" (310 CMR 30.136);

low levels of nicotine present in all cartridges tested, except for
one;106
According to the CDC's youth risk behavior surveillance system,
the percentage of high school students in Massachusetts who
reported the use of cigars within the past 30 days went from 11.8%
in 2003 to 14.3% in 2011;107
(19)
Survey results show that more youth report that they have smoked
a cigar product when it is mentioned by name than report that they
smoked a cigar in general, indicating that cigar use among youth is
underreported;108
(20)
In Massachusetts, youth use of all other tobacco products,
including cigars, rose from 13.3% in 2003 to 17.6% in 2009, and
was higher than the rate of current cigarette use (16%) for the first
time in history;109
(21)
Research shows that increased cigar prices significantly decreased
the probability of male adolescent cigar use and a ten-percent
increase in cigar prices would reduce use by 3.4%;110
(22)
Nicotine levels in cigars are generally much higher than nicotine
levels in cigarettes;111
(23)
Nonresidential roll-your-own (RYO) produce inexpensive
cigarettes, promote the use of tobacco resulting in a negative
impact on public health and increased health care costs, and
severely undercut the evidence-based public health benefit of high
tobacco prices;
(24)
The sale of tobacco products is incompatible with the mission of
health care institutions because these products are detrimental to
the public health and their presence in health care institutions

C:668
§ 670-2. Authority.
This regulation is promulgated pursuant to the authority granted to the
Marshfield Board of Health by MGL c. 111, § 31, which states "Boards of
health may make reasonable health regulations."
§ 670-3. Definitions.
For the purpose of this regulation, the following words shall have the
following meanings:
BLUNT WRAP  Any tobacco product manufactured or packaged as a wrap
or as a hollow tube made wholly or in part from tobacco that is designed or
intended to be filled by the consumer with loose tobacco or other fillers.
BUSINESS AGENT  An individual who has been designated by the owner
or operator of any establishment to be the manager or otherwise in charge
of said establishment.
CHARACTERIZING FLAVOR  A distinguishable taste or aroma, other than

or detectable either prior to or during consumption of a tobacco product
or component part thereof, including but not limited to tastes or aromas
relating to any fruit, chocolate, vanilla, honey, candy, cocoa, dessert,
alcoholic beverage, herb or spice; provided, however, that no tobacco
product shall be determined to have a characterizing flavor solely because
of the provision of ingredient information or the use of additives or
flavorings that do not contribute to the distinguishable taste or aroma of the
product.
CIGAR  Any roll of tobacco that is wrapped in leaf tobacco or in any
substance containing tobacco with or without a tip or mouthpiece not
otherwise defined as a cigarette under MGL c. 64C, § 1, Paragraph 1.

limited to the tobacco, filter and paper, but not including any constituent.
undermines efforts to educate patients on the safe and effective use
of medication, including cessation medication;

population which is particularly at risk for becoming smokers and
such sale of tobacco products is incompatible with the mission of
educational institutions that educate a younger population about
social, environmental and health risks and harms;
(26)
The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has held that "...[t]he
right to engage in business must yield to the paramount right of
government to protect the public health by any rational means."112
(27)
Now, therefore it is the intention of the Marshfield Board of Health to
regulate the sale of tobacco products.

by a recognized voter. If the results of a voice vote or a show of
hands vote are questioned by seven voters standing immediately after
the announced vote, a standing vote will be taken without debate. A
majority of the voters must approve any motion for a roll-call vote or
a vote by secret ballot. No voter will be subject to declaring his vote
before said vote is called.
C.
All matters shall be decided by a majority vote unless a two-thirds or
greater vote is required. If more than a majority vote is required, the
Moderator shall announce the required percentage for passage before
calling for the vote.
D.
In order for Town Meeting to act on or discuss an article, a motion
must be made. The Moderator will call for a motion on each article. If
no motion is made after the second call, the Moderator will pass over
the article and move on to the next article. In order to bring back a
passed over article for discussion, a motion for reconsideration must be
approved by a majority vote.
E.
A motion may be reconsidered once by a majority vote. No further
reconsideration will be permitted unless the Moderator determines that
there has been a significant procedural error or that there is new
information likely to affect the vote. There will be no reconsideration
of a vote either on a subsequent evening or after 10:30 p.m. on the
evening of the vote in question.
F.
Articles may be postponed by a majority vote or advanced by approval
of the Moderator and a two-thirds vote.
G.
§ A900-3 CHARTER § A901-1
C:691
To address Town Meeting, a speaker must first be recognized by the
Moderator then give his or her name and address for the record. No
speaker will be recognized while another person is speaking except
to raise a point of order, which is used to question a ruling of the
Moderator or the conduct of the Town Meeting. Points of order are not
to address the subject matter being discussed.
H.
The Moderator may set time limits on all presentations and may
terminate debate on a motion when he deems it appropriate. Debate
on a motion may also be terminated by a recognized voter moving the
question, which, if accepted by the Moderator as not being premature,
shall be voted on without discussion or debate. A motion to move the
question requires a two-thirds vote for passage. The Moderator may set
limits on the number of times a voter can speak on an article.
I.
Articles in the warrant give notice of the subjects to be discussed
at Town Meeting and establish the parameters of matters that can
be debated and acted upon. Amendments, motions, and/or debate
determined by the Moderator, with the advice of Town Counsel, to be
beyond the scope of the articles may not be permitted.
J.
Only two amendments to a motion may be on the floor at any particular
time. Generally, amendments shall be voted on in the order made and
prior to the vote on the motion to be amended. Amendments over 10
words must be submitted to the Moderator in writing and, if over 50
words, sufficient copies must be available at the entrance of the hall
before the start of that particular session.
K.
Consideration of differing dollar amounts to be appropriated shall be
voted on in descending order, the largest number first, until an amount
gains approval.
L.
Nonvoters will be seated in a special section unless permission is
granted by the Town Meeting to be seated elsewhere. Nonvoters may
be allowed to address the Town Meeting with permission of the
Moderator unless a majority of voters choose to deny such a privilege.
M.
A resolution is a nondebatable, nonbinding motion on any matter calling
for a consensus of the Town Meeting. If a resolution is over 10 words,
it must be submitted to the Moderator in writing and, if over 50 words,
sufficient copies must be available at the entrance of the hall to those
attending.
N.
O. No new business will be taken up after 10:30 p.m. on any evening.
When justice or order requires, the Moderator may make exceptions
to these rules as he/she, in his/her discretion, deems it appropriate
under the circumstances and with the concurrence of the majority of
the voters.
P.
Q. The Town Clerk shall report to Town Meeting on signage.
