After every citizen who desires to speak has done so, any person who has

2-2.19   Action by the Board of Commissioners.



   Each ordinance, municipal order or resolution on the proposed agenda
shall first be read in summary by the City Clerk.  The Mayor, City
Commissioner or City Manager who sponsored the ordinance, municipal order or
resolution shall speak first on the proposed item; provided, however,
discussion may not occur until the Mayor or any of the Commissioners orally
make a motion to approve or disapprove of that item under consideration. 
All such motions shall require a second.  If applicable, a City staff person
may speak on the item to provide additional information to the Board of
Commissioners and to the public.  Following those comments, the remaining
members of the Board of Commissioners may speak on the proposed item,
followed by comments from the public.  When debate is concluded, the
presiding officer shall call for a roll call vote.  The roll call vote shall
be called in alphabetical order and shall rotate at each meeting of the Board
such that the Commissioner who votes first shall vote last at the next
meeting; provided, however, that the Mayor or presiding officer shall vote
last on all items under consideration and shall not be included in the
alphabetical rotation.  The alphabetical rotation shall start at the first
meeting of the Board of Commissioners following the commencement of the new
term of office following the General Election.  A vote of the majority of a
quorum is necessary to approve the motion before the Board of Commissioners,
unless a larger voting majority is required by state law.  Every
Commissioner present for the vote on a motion shall vote for the motion,
against the motion or abstain on the vote.  A Commissioner may abstain only
if that Commissioner has a conflict of interest which has been disclosed to
the remaining Commissioners and to the public.  If a Commissioner abstains
from voting, that Commissioner shall not participate in any discussions

unlawful practice has been committed, setting forth the facts upon which the
complaint is based, and setting forth facts sufficient to enable the
Commission to identify the person charged, hereinafter called the
respondent.  The complaint must be filed within one hundred eighty (180)
days after the alleged unlawful practice occurs.



   b.   The Commission shall make a prompt and full investigation of
each complaint, shall notify the aggrieved party that the complaint has been
received and shall serve on the respondent a copy of the complaint within
five (5) days.

believe that the  respondent has engaged in an unlawful action shall be made
within thirty (30) days after the complaint has been filed.



   d.   If it is determined after investigation that there is probable
cause to believe that the respondent has engaged in an unlawful practice, the
Commission shall endeavor to eliminate the alleged unlawful practice by
conference, conciliation and/or persuasion.  The terms of a conciliation
agreement reached with a respondent, and approved by the Commission, may
require him to refrain from committing unlawful practices in the future, and
make such further provisions as may be agreed upon between the Commission or
its staff and the respondent.  Except for the terms of the conciliation
agreement, neither the Commission nor any officer or employee thereof shall
make public, without the written consent of the complainant and the
respondent, information concerning efforts in a particular case to eliminate
an unlawful practice by conference, conciliation or persuasion, whether or
not there has been a determination of probable cause or a conciliation
agreement.  The Commission shall monitor compliance with the approved
conciliation agreement and may take appropriate action upon a finding that
the terms of the agreement are not being complied with by the respondent.



   e.   In any case of failure to eliminate the alleged unlawful
practice by means of conference, conciliation and/or persuasion, the
Commission may hold a public hearing to determine whether or not an unlawful
practice has been committed.  The Commission shall serve upon the respondent
a statement of the charge made in the complaint and a notice of the time and
place of the hearing.  The respondent shall have the right to file an
answer, to appear at the hearing in person, or to be represented by an
attorney, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses.  All testimony shall
be taken under oath and recorded.  Formal rules of evidence shall not apply,
but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the
proceedings.



   f.   If the Commission determines that the respondent has not
engaged in an unlawful practice, the Commission shall state its findings of
fact and conclusion of law and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint,
and shall furnish a copy of the order to the complainant.  The complainant,
within ten (10) days after receiving a copy of the order dismissing the
complaint, may file with the Commission an application for reconsideration of
the order.  The Commission shall make a new determination within ten (10)
days of receipt of the application.



   g.   If the Commission determines that the respondent has engaged in
an unlawful practice, the Commission shall state its findings of fact and
conclusion of law and shall issue an order requiring the respondent to cease
and desist from the unlawful practice and to take such affirmative action as
in the judgment of the Commission will carry out the purposes of this
Subchapter.



   h.   In connection with an investigation of a complaint filed under
this Subchapter, the Commission or its designated representative at any
reasonable time may request access to premises, records and documents
relevant to the complaint and the right to examine, photograph and copy
evidence.



   i.   At any time after a complaint has been filed, the Commission
may file an action in the Circuit Court seeking appropriate temporary relief
against the respondent pending final determination of proceedings under this
Subchapter as provided in KRS 344.200.



   j.   In the event the respondent fails to comply with any order
issued by the Commission, the Commission may file a complaint for enforcement
in the Circuit Court pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 344 of the
Kentucky Revised Statutes (Kentucky Civil Rights Act KRS 344.340).

2-21.09   Enforcement Proceedings.



   The following requirements shall govern all enforcement proceedings
before the Board:



   a.   Enforcement proceedings before the Board shall be initiated by
the issuance of a citation by a Code Enforcement Officer.



   b.   Except as provided below, if a Code Enforcement Officer
believes, based on his personal observation or investigation, that a person
has violated a City ordinance, he is authorized to issue a citation to the
violator.  In lieu of a citation, the Code Enforcement Officer may give the
violator a notice that a violation has occurred and allow the violator a
specified period of time to remedy the violation without fine.  The time
allowed by the Code Enforcement Officer shall depend on the nature of the
violation and the time necessary to remedy the violation.  If the violator
fails or refuses to remedy the violation within the time specified, the Code
Enforcement Officer is authorized to issue a citation.  Informal settlement
of matters is encouraged.



   c.   The notice of violation or citation shall be in writing and
shall be reasonably calculated to inform the violator of the nature of the
violation.  The notice of violation shall be delivered to the violator by
any method chosen by the Code Enforcement Officer.  The citation shall be
delivered to the violator: (1) by personal delivery; (2) by leaving a copy of
the citation with any person who is eighteen (18) years of age or older who
is on the premises, if the alleged violator is not on the premises at the
time the citation is issued; (3) by mailing a copy of the citation by regular
first-class mail to the last known record mailing address of the alleged
violator; or (4) if in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the issuance of
a citation using the methods set out above is not possible, then the citation
is properly served by posting a copy of the citation in a conspicuous place
on the premises.  When the violation involves a fire damaged structure, a
copy of the notice of violation or citation shall also be delivered to any
mortgage company, lien holder and any insurance company with verified
interest in the property.  Every reasonable attempt shall be made to
determine all verified interest.  After issuing a citation, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall deliver a copy of the citation to the person
designated by the Board.



   d.   The citation issued by the Code Enforcement Officer shall
contain the following information:



      1.   A description of the real estate sufficient for
identification;



      2.   The name and address of the person to whom the citation
is issued;



      3.   The date and time of issuance of the citation and date
and time the offense was committed;



      4.   The facts constituting the violation;



      5.   The section of the ordinance or other code violated;



      6.   The name of the Code Enforcement Officer;



      7.   The procedure for the person to follow in order to pay
the civil fine or to contest the citation;



      8.   The civil fine that may be imposed per day for the
violation if the person does not contest the citation;



      9.   The maximum civil fine that may be imposed per day for
the violation if the person elects to contest the citation; and,



      10.   A statement that if the person fails to pay the civil
fine set forth in the citation or to contest the citation within the time
allowed, the person shall be deemed as having waived the right to a hearing
before the Code Enforcement Board to contest the citation and that the
determination that a violation was committed shall be final and the alleged
violator shall be deemed to have waived the right to appeal the final order
to District Court.



   e.   Nothing in this Subchapter shall prohibit the City from
correcting the violation through self-help or taking immediate action to
remedy a violation of its ordinances when there is reason to believe that
there is imminent danger or that the violation presents a serious threat to
the public health, safety and welfare, or if in the absence of immediate
action, the effects of the violation will be irreparable or irreversible.



   f.   The person to whom the citation is issued shall respond to the
citation within seven (7) days of the date the citation is issued by either
paying the civil fine set forth in the citation or requesting in writing a
hearing before the Code Enforcement Board to contest the citation.  If the
person responds by paying the civil fine, the person to whom the citation is
issued shall still be required to remedy the violation.  If the person fails
to remedy the violation or to request a hearing within seven (7) days, the
Code Enforcement Officer is authorized to issue another citation.  If the
person does not contest the citation within seven (7) days by requesting a
hearing, the person shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and
the determination that a violation was committed shall be considered final. 
In this event, the citation as issued shall be deemed a final order
determining that the violation was committed and imposing the civil fine as
set forth in the citation and the person shall be deemed to have waived the
right to appeal the final order to District Court.  A copy of the final
order shall be served on the person guilty of the violation by regular
first-class mail; certified mail, return receipt requested; personal
delivery; or by leaving the final order at the person’s usual place of
residence with any individual residing therein who is eighteen (18) years of
age or older and who is informed of the contents of the notice.

   a.   When a hearing has been requested, the Board shall schedule a
hearing for the next regular meeting of the board that will permit adequate
notification to be made to all parties.



   b.   Not less than seven (7) days before the date of the hearing,
the Board shall notify the requester of the date, time and place of the
hearing.  The notice may be given by regular first-class mail; certified
mail, return receipt requested, by personal delivery, or by leaving the
notice at the person’s usual place of residence with any individual
residing therein who is eighteen (18) years of age or older and who is
informed of the contents of the notice.



   c.   Any person requesting a hearing before the Board who fails to
appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing
to contest the citation and the determination that a violation was committed
shall be final.  In this event, the citation, as issued, shall be deemed a
final order determining that the violation was committed and imposing the
civil fine set forth in the citation and the alleged violator shall be deemed
to have waived the right to appeal the final order to District Court. A copy
of the final order shall be served on the violator by regular first-class
mail; certified mail, return receipt requested; by personal delivery; or by
leaving the notice at the person’s usual place of residence with any
individual residing therein who is eighteen (18) years of age or older and
who is informed of the contents of the notice.



   d.   All testimony shall be taken under oath and recorded. Testimony
shall be taken from the Code Enforcement Officer, the alleged violator and
any witnesses to the violation offered by the Code Enforcement Officer or
alleged violator.  Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental
due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings.



   e.   The Board shall, based on the evidence, determine whether a
violation was committed.  If it determines that no violation was committed,
an order dismissing the citation shall be entered.  If it determines that a
violation was committed, an order shall be issued upholding the citation and
either imposing a fine up to the maximum authorized or requiring the violator
to abate a continuing violation, or both.



   f.   Every final order of the Board shall be reduced to writing,
which shall include the date the order was issued and the findings and
conclusions reached, including the fine, charges and costs, including
abatement costs, imposed.  The Board may also direct the violator to abate
the violation within a reasonable time and to assess daily fines for
noncompliance.  A copy shall be furnished to the person named in the
citation.  If the person named is not present when the final order is
issued, the order shall be delivered to that person by regular first-class
mail; certified mail, return receipt requested; by personal delivery; or by
leaving the notice at the person’s usual place of residence with any
individual residing therein who is eighteen (18) years of age or older and
who is informed of the contents of the notice.

pursuant to the provisions hereinabove may be made to the Warren District
Court within thirty (30) days of the date the order is issued.  The appeal
shall be initiated by the filing of a complaint and a copy of the Board’s
final order in the same manner as any civil action under the Kentucky Rules
of Civil Procedure.  The District Court shall review the final order de
novo.  If no appeal of the final order of the Board is filed within the time
allowed, the Board’s order shall be deemed final for all purposes.

2-21.13   Liens, Fines, Charges and Fees.



   a.   The City shall possess a lien on property owned by the person
found by a final, non-appealable order as set out hereinabove, or by a final
judgment of the court to have committed a violation of a City ordinance for
all civil fines assessed for the violation and for all charges, fees and
abatement costs incurred by the City in connection with the enforcement of
the ordinance.  An affidavit of the Code Enforcement Officer shall
constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of the lien and the regularity
of the proceedings pursuant to KRS 65.8801 to 65.8839.



   b.   The lien shall be recorded in the office of the County Clerk
and shall be notice to all persons from the time of its recording and shall
bear interest at twelve (12%) percent per annum thereafter until paid.  The
lien shall continue for ten (10) years following the date of the
non-appealable final order or final court judgment.



   c.   Subject to the provisions of hereinbelow, the lien shall take
precedence over all other liens on the property, except state, county, school
board and city taxes and may be enforced by judicial proceedings, including a
foreclosure action.



   d.   In addition to the remedy prescribed above, the person found to
have committed the violation shall be personally responsible for the amount
of all civil fines assessed for the violation and for all charges, fees and
abatement costs incurred by the City in connection with the enforcement of
the applicable Code of Ordinances.  The City Department of Law is authorized
to bring a civil action for the collection of delinquent liens and other
costs incurred by the City, and the City shall have the same remedies as
provided for the recovery of a debt.  The City Attorney, in cooperation with
the Neighborhood and Community Services Department staff, is granted
authority to use his best judgment and discretion to settle any fine and
remedy assessments and to release liens as he deems to be in the best
interests of the City. The City Attorney, in cooperation with the
Neighborhood and Community Services Department staff, is further authorized
to make a determination that a lien not be filed if the cost of the lien and
collection is greater than the amount of the lien, when intervening in
existing litigation is not cost effective or when the lien would not be
enforceable as a matter of law.  The City Attorney is also authorized to
release any existing liens that meet the above criteria.

Subchapter, the City shall send electronic mail notification to all
registrants.

immediate action if necessary under the provisions of this Subchapter.



   c.   The lien provided hereinabove shall not take precedence over

      1.   The City failed to comply with the requirements of the
previous Section for notification of the final order; or



      2.   A prior lienholder complied with this Section.



   d.   A lien that does not take precedence over previously recorded
liens under (c) of this Section shall, if the final order remains partially

state, county, school board and city taxes.



   e.   The City may record a lien before the forty-five (45) day
period established in this Section expires.  If the lien is fully satisfied

   f.   Failure of the City to comply with this and the previous

   a.   The purpose of the Regional Airport Board shall be to
establish, maintain, operate and expand necessary, desirable or appropriate

powers as may be necessary, or desirable to promote and develop aviation,
including air transportation, airports and air navigation facilities.



   b.   The Board shall establish and fix reasonable rates, charges and
fees for the use of the landing area, ramps and other common aviation
facilities.  In fixing such rates, charges or fees, the Board may take into
consideration, among other factors, the total capital investment by the Board
or other local or State governmental authority, the revenue needed to
properly maintain such facilities, the revenue needed to properly expand the
airport and its facilities, the portion of the facilities utilized by the
licensee or contracting party and its customers, and the volume and type of
business conducted.  Any party aggrieved by the rates, charges or fees may
appeal from the action of the Board to the Circuit Court of the County within
ninety (90) days from the date that the Board finally publishes such rates,
charges or fees and gives notice of same to the contracting party or
licensee.  The Circuit Court may hear evidence and determine whether or not
the rates, charges or fees are, or are not, reasonable in amount.  Appeal
from the judgment of the Circuit Court may be prosecuted as any other civil
appeal.



   c.   The Board shall likewise have power to fix rates, charges or
fees by contract, or by publishing general rates, charges or fees for
commercial vendors, concessionaires or other persons for the use or occupancy
of terminal or other ground use facilities, under such terms or conditions as
it may deem to be in the best interest of maintaining, operating or expanding
necessary airport and air navigation facilities, and the public use thereof.



   d.   The Board or any other governmental unit may acquire by
contract, lease, purchase, gift, condemnation or otherwise any real or
personal property, or rights therein necessary for establishing, operating or
expanding airports and air navigation facilities.  The Board may erect,
equip, operate and maintain on such property, buildings and equipment
necessary, desirable or appropriate for airport or air navigation
facilities.  The Board may dispose of any real or personal property, or
rights therein, which in the opinion of the Board are no longer needed for
operating or expanding the airport or air navigation facilities.



   e.   The Board or any other governmental unit may by resolution
reciting that the property is needed for airport or air navigation purposes
direct the condemnation of any property, including navigation or other
easements.  The procedure for condemnations shall conform to KRS 183.133(5)
and the Eminent Domain Act of Kentucky (KRS 416.540 et seq.).



   f.   The Board may make, adopt and enforce such rules, regulations
and ordinances as it may find necessary, desirable or appropriate for
carrying into effect the purposes of this chapter, including those relating
to the operation and control of the airport, airport facilities or air
navigation facilities owned or operated by such Board or such other
governmental unit.  All rules, regulations and ordinances adopted pursuant
to this Section shall be published according to the provisions of KRS
424.130, and the Board or other governmental unit adopting them shall keep a
permanent record of such rules, regulations and ordinances available for
public inspection on the airport premises.  Prosecution for a violation of
any rule, regulation or ordinance adopted pursuant to this Section shall be
in the District Court.

premises if the public health, safety, morals and welfare is threatened by
multiple violations of any ordinance or statute involving disturbance of the
peace or public disorder reported to the City Administrator by his
investigators or law enforcement officers during the course of one day’s
operation of the premises.  The temporary closure shall remain in effect
until review of the alleged violations by the City Administrator within
thirty-six (36) hours.  The applicant shall also provide a criminal
background record or consent in writing to the City Alcoholic Beverage
Control Administrator allowing the Administrator to obtain the criminal

   If upon review of the application, the City Administrator determines
that the applicant has complied with all requirements of the Alcoholic
Beverage Control Act, as well as all regulatory provisions of this Chapter,
that the location is one that can be approved so that a license may be issued
within the quota limits fixed by the State Alcoholic Beverage Control Board,
the Board of Commissioners and City Administrator, and that there are no
other causes for denial of the license, the City Administrator shall approve
the application.

applicant shall pay the amount of the license fee provided in this Chapter in
the form of a certified check, money order, cash or credit card.  Payment
shall be held in deposit by the Finance Department pending State license

4-3.06   License to Become Void if Business Dormant; License Renewal.



   a.   Conditions for dormancy. Because under the provisions of the
Kentucky Revised Statutes, all administrative regulations promul-gated
pursuant thereto and this Chapter, as may be amended from time to time, a
quota system may exist for the number of licenses to sell alcoholic beverages
in the City, it is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business
authorized by such a license or else the license will be declared dormant and
become null and void after ninety (90) days.  Because a licensee, like any
other business, may have his business interrupted by situations not under his
control, various exceptions to this dormancy rule are included herein.



   b.   Surrender of license and exceptions.  Any license under which
no business is transacted during a period of ninety (90) days shall become
null and void.  At the expiration of the ninety (90) day period the license
shall be surrendered to the City Administrator, except that any licensee who
is unable to continue in business at the licensed premises may apply to the
Commonwealth of Kentucky Alcoholic Beverage Control Department to continue
such license in dormancy.  In the event a period of dormancy is applied for
or granted by the State Administrator to the licensee, said licensee shall

Subchapter through the use of another entity's certificate of registration.



   b.   If an entity registered as an individual, partnership, limited
liability company, corporation or other business entity seeks to change to

must register anew.



   c.   All partners within a partnership shall be of record with the

compliance with all applicable laws governing the corporation or limited
liability company; and,



      5.   An entity whose certificate of registration has lapsed is
considered nonregistered from the date the lapse occurred until the date the
registration is renewed, reissued or reinstated.  During the period of
lapse, the entity shall not perform the work of a contractor.



(Ord. BG2006-25, 7/18/2006; Ord. BG2006-27, 8/15/2006)

Board that:



      1.   The applicant has procured general commercial liability
insurance in a sum not less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) per
general aggregate from an insurance company authorized to do business in
Kentucky, and will continue to meet those insurance requirements so long as
the applicant is registered.  Certification shall include the name of the

law and by these rules if the Board determines that delays in receipt of
required documents and/or fees were caused by the Contractors Licensing Board.



   d.   Additionally, if the Contractors Licensing Board determines
that delays in receipt of proof of insurance are caused by insurance carriers
through the error of the insurance carrier in executing documentation, the
Board may issue registration prior to receipt of all documents.

law.

   a.   Designated Enforcement Officials.  This Subchapter is
enforceable by the Director of the Contractors Licensing Board or by Code

general contractor or as a specialty contractor without first obtaining a
license from the Contractors Licensing Board. 



   c.   Interagency Cooperation.  All city and county agencies and
employees are directed and authorized to cooperate with the Board and are
further directed to not issue any city or county permits or approvals without
first obtaining proof of compliance with this Subchapter.



   d.   Legal Action.  The Board is also authorized to bring necessary
legal action, including cease and desist orders, against unlicensed
contractors in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare.



   e.   Enforceability of Contract.  No contract for the performance
of any act for which a license is required by this Subchapter shall be
enforceable by the general contractor or specialty contractor unless the
contractor was properly licensed at the time the work was performed. 



   f.   Injunctive Relief.  In addition to all other remedies, when it
appears to the Director, either upon complaint or otherwise, that any person,
firm, partnership, corporation, association or other organization, or a
combination of any of them, has engaged in or is in engaging in any act of
contracting, practice or transaction which constitutes a violation of these
regulations, the Director may apply through the Board’s attorney to the
Warren Circuit Court for an injunction restraining such person from engaging
in such act, practice or transaction, or doing any act in furtherance
thereof, and upon a proper showing, a temporary restraining order, a
preliminary injunction or permanent injunction shall be granted without
bond.  Processes in such action may be served upon the Defendant in any
county of this state where he transacts business or is bound.



   g.   Proof of Valid License.  At the request of the Director, and
after the issuance of the citation, or a cease and desist order, the County,
City or authority of the State may cause work on a residential or commercial
construction project to cease or be suspended on that project until there is
compliance with the licensee requirements of these regulations by those
contractors employed on that project.



   h.   Duty to Provide List of Subcontractors.  Any licensed
contractor shall provide to the Contractors Licensing Board, upon request, a
current list of all subcontractors on a particular project.



   i.   Authority to Enter Property.  Any person enforcing this
Subchapter may enter upon private premises for the purposes of making
inspections to ensure compliance with these regulations and to enforce the
provisions of this Subchapter.



   j.   Complaint and Investigations:  Disciplinary Actions.



      1.   Complaints and Investigations.



         (a)   Any aggrieved person may file with the Board a
complaint against any licensee alleging dishonest or fraudulent conduct
injurious to the welfare of the public. Such complaint shall:



            (1)   be written and signed;



            (2)   include the address of the job site;



            (3)   include phone numbers of the complainant and
of the person/entity in violation of these rules;



            (4)   describe the specific grievance;

            (6)   include any other relevant material that may
be useful in the investigation.



         (b)   If the Director finds that an investigation is
necessary, the Board's staff shall commence the investigation within fifteen
(15) days after the date the complaint was filed.



         (c)   If it appears from the investigation that a
licensee may have committed dishonest or fraudulent conduct injurious to the
welfare of the public, the Director may:



            (1)   request the licensee orally or through a
warning letter to take corrective action;



            (2)   request the licensee to meet informally with
the Board's staff and the complainant; or,



            (3)   require the licensee to appear before the
Board and show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him.



      2.   Notice of Contemplated Action.



         (a)   The Board will presume that the address of an
applicant or licensee which is on file with the Board is his correct address.



         (b)   Before taking disciplinary action against a
licensee, the Board will provide reasonable notice of the action contemplated.



      3.   Disciplinary Procedure; Hearings.



         (a)   Notice; Request for Hearing.



            (1)   If the Director intends to revoke or suspend
a certificate of registration (license), it shall issue and serve on the
respondent a notice of intent to take an action, giving the opportunity for
hearing.



            (2)   If the Director issues a notice of intent to
take an action and no written request for hearing is received by the Board
within twenty-one (21) days of the date of mailing the notice, the Board may
issue a default order.



            (3)   If the Director issues a notice of intent to
take an action and a written request for hearing is timely received, the
Board will set a hearing to determine whether the respondent has violated any
provision of this Subchapter or any of these rules, and if so, the duration
of any suspension.



         (b)   Administrative hearings may be held before the
Board.  If the respondent fails to appear at the hearing, the Director must
present a prima facie case.



         (c)   In a hearing conducted pursuant to these
regulations, a corporation may be represented by a corporate officer or
employee who is not a member of the state bar, if: 



            (1)   The corporation has specifically authorized
the officer or employee to  represent it; and,



            (2)   The representation is not the officer’s or
employee's primary duty to the corporation, but is secondary or incidental to
the officers or employee's duties relating to the management or operation of
the corporation.



         (d)   Based on evidence received at the hearing, the
Board will prepare findings of fact and conclusions, and issue an order for a
specific violation or a final order dismissing the matter.



         (e)   The respondent and/or the respondent's attorney
may appear before the members of the Board to argue against the proposed
order, if the Board receives written notice of intent to do so before the
Board meeting date.  Oral argument will be permitted only if the original
exceptions were timely received.



         (f)   Notwithstanding any backdating of a renewal, a
person shall be in violation of this Subchapter if, at the time a person
undertakes, offers to undertake, or submits a bid to do work as a contractor,
the person is not actively registered with the Board.



      4.    Grounds for Disciplinary Hearings.



         The Board may suspend or revoke a contractor’s license,
or take any other appropriate measure, if, after an evidentiary hearing, the
licensee is found guilty of any dishonest or fraudulent conduct injurious to
the welfare of the public.



      5.    Appeals.



         A contractor aggrieved by a disciplinary measure of the
Board may appeal such decision to the Warren Circuit Court within thirty (30)
days of such action.



      6.   Enforcement Proceedings Before Code Enforcement Board.



         (a)   Enforcement proceedings for this Subchapter other
than those set out above shall be designated as civil violations, and shall
be initiated by the issuance of a citation by the Code Enforcement Officer as
set out in the procedures in Chapter 2 of this Code, except as may be set out
herein.



            (1)     The notice of the violation or citation
shall be delivered to the violator at his last known address as listed on his
contractor's license, if any.  Such notice of violation or citation shall be
deemed to be properly served if given by certified mail, return receipt
requested, by personal delivery or by leaving the notice at the person’s
usual place of residence with any individual residing therein who is eighteen
(18) years of age or older and who is informed of the contents of the
notice.  Service by certified mail shall be presumed to have been served on
the third day following mail.



            (2)   The citation issued by the code official
shall contain not only the information set forth in Chapter 2, but shall also
contain the location by address of the construction project involved.



         (b)   In addition to all procedures as set out in
Chapter 2 of this Code of Ordinances, the Contractors Licensing Board may
also take immediate action to remedy a violation of this Subchapter,
including the issuance of a Stop Work Order, for work not in compliance with
the requirements of this Subchapter.  Any person violating any portion of
this Subchapter shall be subject to civil penalties as set out in Subchapter

7-1   TITLE.



   This Ordinance shall be known as the "Bowling Green-Warren County
Ordinance for Regulation of Cable Communications."



7-2   THE BOWLING GREEN-WARREN COUNTY CABLE FRANCHISE AUTHORITY.



7-2.01   Created.



   The Bowling Green-Warren County Cable Franchise Authority (hereinafter
"Authority") is hereby created pursuant to an interlocal cooperation
agreement executed by the City of Bowling Green Board of Commissioners and
the Warren County Fiscal Court in accordance with Kentucky Revised Statutes
KRS 65.210 - 65.300, otherwise known as The Interlocal Cooperation Act.



   The Authority is created under the aforementioned Interlocal
Cooperation Act to permit the City and County governments to cooperate with
one another to provide services and facilities in a manner that will accord
best with geographic, economic, population and other factors influencing the
needs and development of local communities.



7-2.02   Purpose.



   Pursuant to the interlocal agreement, the City and County agreed to
cooperate in the acquisition and regulation of a cable television system and
thereby designate the one cooperative body to be the "Authority."  The
purposes for which the Authority is created are generally stated above, but
more specifically include, but are not limited to the following:  To
cooperate in evaluating the cable television needs of the areas served by
City and County; to promote cooperation and offer aid to the respective
governments of City and County in the development and enactment of a cable
television franchise ordinance (hereinafter referred to as "Franchise
Ordinance"); to cooperate in governing the Franchisee according to the
standards prescribed  in  the  Franchise  Ordinance;  to  delegate
certain responsibilities to the respective governments of City and County
insofar as such is efficient and in the best interests of the citizens served
by the Authority; to oversee the day-to-day administration of cable
communication operations; to take all administrative actions on behalf of the
City and County except for any actions expressly reserved to the Mayor,
Board, County Judge/Executive or Fiscal Court or other named entity; and to
grant, execute, modify, renew, revoke and authorize the transfer of cable
television franchises.



7-2.03   Allocation of Funds.



   All funds due the Authority by Franchisee shall be paid to and
allocated between City and County as provided in this Ordinance.  Any
additional funds needed by the Authority shall be contributed by City and
County in an amount proportionate to the voting control maintained by City
and County as provided for herein.



7-2.04   Voting Plan.



   The City and County recognize and agree that in order to protect the
rights and interests of the subscribers to the cable television franchise,
all subscribers must have an opportunity to offer input into the governing of
the cable television franchise by and through their respective local
governments.  Furthermore, the City and the County recognize and agree that
there is a disproportionate population between the City and the County,
thereby warranting the implementation of a special voting plan designed to
protect the interests of the subscribers to the Franchisee and insure that
the input of each of the governing units of City and County truly and
accurately represent the proportionate share of the subscribers located
within the corporate limits of the City and the County.  Therefore, City and
County hereby agree that the following voting plan shall be implemented by
the Authority in order to carry out the purposes and principles hereinabove
described:



      (a)   The voting members of the Authority shall be comprised
of the members of the Board of Commissioners of the City and the members of
the Fiscal Court of the County.  Each voting member shall have one vote;
however, votes shall be weighed proportionate to a percentage computed in the
following manner:



      (b)   The City shall maintain sixty (60) percent of the voting
control of the Authority and the County shall maintain forty (40) percent of
the voting control of the Authority.



      (c)   The weight given votes cast by the voting members of the
Authority shall be computed as follows:



         (1)   The percentage of voting control maintained by
City shall be divided by the number of members on the Board of Commissioners
of the City (which is currently five (5) members as prescribed by statute)
and the quotient so computed shall be multiplied by each vote cast by the
voting members of the Authority representing the City;



         (2)   The percentage of voting control maintained by
County shall be divided by the numbers of members on the Fiscal Court of the
County (which is currently seven (7) members as prescribed by statute) and
the quotient so computed shall be multiplied by each vote cast by the voting
members of the Authority representing the County.



      (d)   A quorum of the Authority shall be required to conduct
any business.  Quorum shall be defined as a majority of the members of the
Board of Commissioners of the City and a majority of the members of the
Fiscal Court of the County.  Unless both said bodies are represented by a
majority of its members, then no business shall be conducted by the Authority.



      (e)   Before any motion, resolution or other business can be
passed, approved or adopted by the Authority, such motion, resolution or
order of business shall receive a majority of votes as weighed and computed
pursuant to the provisions of this agreement.



      (f)   No proxy shall be allowed for any purpose.  For
purposes of clarification, the following example is given:



         The City maintains sixty (60) percent of the voting control
and the County maintains forty (40) percent.  The weight to be given the
City's votes is computed by dividing sixty (60) percent by five (5) which
leaves a quotient of 12.  Each vote cast by the voting members of the
Authority representing the City shall be multiplied by 12.  The weight to be
given the County's votes is determined by dividing forty (40) percent by 7
leaving a quotient of 5.7.  Each vote cast by the members of the Authority
representing County shall be multiplied by 5.7.  Therefore, if the City's
voting members vote 4 yes and 1 no, its total equals 48 yes and 12 no. 
Should the County's voting members vote 2 yes and 5 no, the County's total
vote is 11.4 yes and 39.9 no.  The total votes, which constitute the
Authority's tally of votes, would be 59.4 yes and 51.9 no.



7-2.05   Powers.



   The Authority shall be empowered to acquire, hold and dispose of both
real and personal property which in its discretion is necessary for its use

   Within one hundred twenty (120) days of notice of an award or renewal
of a franchise, the applicant or franchisee and the Authority shall enter
into a franchise agreement which details the rights, duties, responsibilities
and liabilities of both parties and which contains an acceptance on the part
of the applicant or franchisee to the terms of this Chapter, all Authority
guidelines, the  franchise  agreement  and  the  submitted  proposal
(including  supplemental  agreements or  written commitments or
guarantees), provided; however, that this Chapter shall only be acceptable to
franchises or renewals granted after the effective date of this Ordinance. 
Moreover, a new franchisee may not lay any cable until the franchise
agreement is executed by both the new franchisee and the Authority.  Failure
to execute the agreement by the franchisee or renewal franchisee may be
grounds for terminating any rights granted under the award of a franchise. 



   Every franchise agreement shall comply with the standards established
by the FCC which the franchisee must maintain with respect to signal quality
requirements and technical standards of construction, operation and
maintenance of the system, unless otherwise specifically noted.



7-7.02   Modifications.



   An application for modification of a franchise shall provide all
information as required by the Authority including, but not limited to the
specific modification requested; the justification for the requested
modification, including the impact of the requested modification on
subscribers and others, and the impact on the applicant if the modification
is not approved; and any other information required by the Authority to make
a determination.



7-7.03   Transfers.



   An application to transfer a franchise shall provide all information as
required by the Authority including, but not limited to, complete information
on the proposed transaction including details on the legal, financial,
technical and other pertinent qualifications of the transferee and on the
potential impact of the transfer on cable service, subscriber rates and the
public interest.  No sale or transfer shall take place without first
obtaining the written consent of the Authority provided such consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld.  Should a sale or transfer occur without
written consent of the Authority, the Authority shall grant to franchisee
thirty days to cure by submitting an application to transfer, with shall be
subject to approval by the Authority.  Approval by the Authority of a
transfer of a franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the
rights of the Authority under this Ordinance or the franchise agreement and
the Authority may require written assent by any assignee to the requirements
of the franchise.



   Prior written approval of the Authority shall be required where
ownership or control of more than ten (10%) percent of the right or control
of or interest in the franchise is acquired by a person, corporation, firm,
or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom already own or control
ten (10%) percent or more of such right or control or interest, singularly or
collectively.



   Any transfer without the prior written approval of the Authority which
is not cured, may, at the sole discretion of the Authority, render the
franchise void.



7-7.04   Costs.



   The  Authority  specifically  reserves  the  right  to  charge 
the  franchisee for any costs incidental to the awarding, renewing,
transferring, modifying and enforcing the terms of the franchise including
but not limited to consultant fees and legal fees.  The amount of any
charge, if any, shall be negotiated as part of the franchise agreement.



7-8   SECURITY FUND.



   Prior to a franchise or franchise renewal becoming effective, the
franchisee shall post with the Authority a cash security deposit in an amount
as determined by  the  Authority.  The deposit is to be used as a security
fund to ensure the faithful performance of all provisions of law and the
franchise agreement and compliance with all orders, permits and directions of
the Authority and the payment by the franchisee of any fees, claims,
liquidated damages, liens or taxes due the Authority which arise by reason of
the construction, operation or maintenance of the system.



   The Authority shall place the security deposit in an interest bearing
account.  The interest will accrue to the benefit of the franchisee but may
not be withdrawn during the franchise term and any renewal thereof.  All
interest will be added to and become part of the original security fund
during the term of the franchise and any renewal thereof.



   Within thirty (30) days after notice to it that any amount has been
withdrawn from the security fund, the franchisee shall pay to or deposit with
the Authority funds sufficient to restore such security fund.



   If the franchisee fails to pay the Authority any compensation within
the time fixed herein or fails, after thirty (30) days notice, to pay the
Authority, City or County any fees or taxes due or fails to pay or repay to
the Authority within thirty (30) days, any damages, costs or expenses which
the Authority shall be compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of
the franchisee in connection with this franchise or fails, after thirty (30)
days notice of such failure by the Authority, to comply with any provisions
of the franchise agreement which the Authority reasonably determines can be
remedied by an expenditure of the security, the Authority may immediately
withdraw the amount due, with interest and any penalties, from the security
fund.  Upon such withdrawal, the Authority shall notify the franchisee of
the amount and date thereof.



   The security fund deposited pursuant to this section shall become the
property of the Authority  in  the  event  the  franchise  agreement 
is  canceled  by reason of the default of the franchisee.  The franchisee,
however, shall be entitled to the return of such security fund, or portion
thereof as remains at the expiration of the term of the franchise agreement
and any renewal thereof, provided that there is then no outstanding default
on the part of the franchisee.  Interest earned by the investment of the
security fund will accrue to the franchisee.



   The rights reserved to the Authority with respect to the security fund
are in addition to all other rights of the Authority whether reserved by this
ordinance or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a
right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the
Authority may have.



   The franchise agreement shall contain a schedule of liquidated damages
pursuant to this Section.



7-9   FRANCHISE FEES.



7-9.01   Fees Required.



   Any franchisee awarded a franchise or renewal franchise shall pay to
the Authority, for the privilege and use of the streets, rights-of-way,
easements and public ways, and other facilities of the Authority pursuant to
the construction and operation of a cable communication system and for the
Authority's supervision during the term of the franchise, up to five percent
(5%) of the franchisee's annual gross revenues as defined in the franchise
agreement and this Ordinance.



7-9.02   Increase of Fees.



   If the FCC, Congress or other governmental entity with authority over
cable ever allows the Authority or other franchising authority to increase
the franchise fee beyond five percent (5%) of the franchises' gross revenues
as defined above, the franchise fee shall be subject to renegotiation.  In
the event the parties cannot agree upon a new fee, the matter shall be
subject to arbitration in accordance with the procedures of the American
Arbitration Association.  Any resulting award shall be retroactive to the
date the increased fee was authorized.



7-9.03   Allocation of Fees.



   All revenues due the Authority from the franchisee under this Ordinance
shall be allocated between City and County by franchisee according to each of
City's and County's percentage of the total number of franchisee's
subscribers.  For purposes of this section, the term County is defined as
all territory within the presently existing territorial limits of Warren
County as of the date of the passage of this ordinance, excluding all the
territory within the territorial limits of the City of Bowling Green and of
any incorporated city within Warren County as of the date of this
ordinance.  All payments enumerated herein shall be in addition to any other
tax or payment owed to the City, County and Authority by the franchisee.



7-9.04   Payment of Fees.



   Payments required to be made under this Ordinance shall be made
quarterly, within forty- five (45) days of the end of each quarter, at the
City Treasurer's office or County Court Clerk's office, as the case may be. 
Any fee not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half
percent (1 ½%) per month from the date due.  The acceptance of any payment
shall not be construed as an accord that the amount paid is the correct
amount; nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any
claim City, County or Authority may have for additional sums payable by
franchisee, nor a release of any other obligation of the franchisee.  All
amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by the Authority,
provided, however, all audits of records used or useful in ascertaining
franchise fees, conducted by or on behalf of the authority, are binding to
the Authority.



7-9.05   Reports.



   A franchisee shall file with the Authority quarterly, along with the
quarterly franchise fee, a report of its gross revenues attested to by an
officer of the franchisee showing the basis for the computation of the fee
and other relevant facts as requested by the Authority.  A franchisee shall
file with the Authority within ninety (90) days after the expiration of the
franchisee's fiscal year, a detailed financial and revenue statement in a
format established by the Authority clearly showing the gross revenues
received by such franchisee during the preceding year, certified by a
certified public accountant or officer of the franchisee attesting to the
accuracy, completeness and veracity of the revenue figures.  The Authority
reserves the right to have access to and to audit franchisee's books and

of any kind on any person (other than the franchisee) with respect to a cable
service or other programming or communications service provided by such
person over a cable system for which charges are assessed to subscribers, but
not received by a franchisee.  For purposes of illustration only,  this
subsection shall include  the situation(s) where a premium service directly

local laws, regulations and orders.  A franchisee shall not deny cable
service or the extension of cable service to any group of potential
residential cable subscribers because of the income of the residents of the
local area in which such group resides.  These restrictions do not prohibit
a franchisee from offering promotional or incentive discount rates or

disadvantaged groups, as long as such discounts or billing arrangements are
consistent with federal, state and local law.

special reports required by the Authority.



   (c)   All filings and reports required of the franchisee or any

requesting additional reports as determined necessary by the Authority.



7-12.06   Billings, Refunds and Disconnections for Nonpayment/Use of
Property.

except upon approval of the Authority following regulations established by
the Authority, other applicable law and federal regulations.



   The Authority has the right to apply any one or combination of the
following remedies in the event a franchisee violates any provision of the
law, this Ordinance or its franchise agreement:



      (a)   Impose liquidated damages in such amount, whether per
day, incident or other measure of violation, as provided in the franchise
agreement.  Payment of liquidated damages by the franchisee will not relieve
the franchisee of its obligation to meet the franchise requirements.



7-14   ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.



      (b)   Revoke the franchise.  In determining which remedy or

remedy required in order to prevent further violations, and such other
matters as the Authority determines are appropriate.

9-3.05   Special Variance



   a.   The City Manager or his designated representative shall have
the authority, consistent with this Subchapter, to grant special variances.



   b.   Any person seeking a special variance pursuant to this Section
shall file an application with the City Manager or his designated
representative, no less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the date on
which the special variance is sought to be effective.  The application shall
contain information which demonstrates that bringing the source of sound or
activity for which the special variance is sought into compliance with this
Subchapter would constitute an unreasonable hardship on the applicant, on the
community, or on other persons. Notice of an application for a special
variance shall be given by the City Manager or his representative to all
persons who own and/or occupy the real property adjoining the site for which
the special variance is sought.  Notice shall be forwarded by regular mail
not less than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the date on which the
special variance is sought to be effective.  The failure of the City Manager
or his representative to notify any adjoining property owner/occupant shall
not be fatal to the applicant’s request for a special variance.  Any
individual who claims to be adversely affected by allowance of the special
variance may file a statement with the City Manager or his representative
containing any information to support his claim.  Said statement shall be
filed not less than seven (7) calendar days prior to the date on which the
special variance is sought to be effective.



   c.   In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the
City Manager or his designated representative shall balance the hardship to
the applicant, the community, and other persons of not granting the special
variance against the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of
persons affected, the adverse impact on property affected and any other
adverse impact of granting the special variance.  Applicants for special
variances and persons contesting special variances may be required to submit
any information the City Manager or his representative may require.  In
granting or denying an application, the City Manager or his representative
shall place on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying
or granting this special variance.



   d.   Special variances shall be granted by notice to the applicant
containing all necessary conditions including a time limit on the permitted
activity.  The special variance shall not become effective until all
conditions are agreed to by the applicant.  Noncompliance with any
conditions of the special variances shall terminate it and subject the person
holding it to those provisions of this Subchapter regulating the source of
sound or activity for which the special variance was granted.



   e.   Application for extension of time limits specified in special
variance or for modification of other substantial conditions shall be treated
like applications for initial special variances.



   f.   The City Manager or his designated representative may issue
guidelines defining the procedures to be followed in applying for a special
variance and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether to grant a
special variance.

(Ord. BG2018-3, 1/16/2018)



9-4.02   Aggressive Solicitation Prohibited.



   No person shall engage in aggressive panhandling, begging, charitable
and political solicitation at any time or any location in the City of Bowling
Green.



(Ord. BG2018-3, 1/16/2018)



9-4.03   Passive Solicitation Regulated.



   a.   The Board of Commissioners finds that passive panhandling,
begging, charitable and political solicitation as defined in this Subchapter
is speech protected under the First Amendment unless other well-grounded
governmental concerns are implicated.  Passive panhandling, begging,
charitable and political solicitation in the traffic or travel lanes of
public streets and highways or in traffic medians within those public streets
or highways is inherently dangerous, is distracting to both pedestrians and
drivers of motor vehicles, gives rise to an increased risk of injury to
pedestrians and the motor vehicle occupants, interferes with the free flow of
traffic and potentially threatens the safety and well-being of nearby third
parties.  The traffic or travel lanes of public streets and highways and the
medians within those public streets and highways are not designed for and are
not an appropriate location for anything other than travel.  This Subchapter
provides ample alternative sites for passive panhandling, begging, charitable
and political solicitation in areas that do not give rise to enhanced public
safety concerns, personal privacy concerns and personal security concerns. 
Accordingly, passive panhandling, begging, charitable and political
solicitation is permitted in the City except as otherwise prohibited below.



   b.   Passive panhandling, begging, charitable and political
solicitation is prohibited in areas defined as areas with heightened personal
security concerns, areas with heightened personal privacy concerns and areas
with heightened public safety concerns.  For the purposes of this
subsection, passive panhandling, begging, charitable and political
solicitation specifically includes an attempt by a pedestrian to enter into
an area with heightened public safety concerns in order to exchange or
attempt to exchange any item with the occupant of a motor vehicle while the
vehicle is located in areas with heightened public safety concerns as defined
above and any solicitation is prohibited by both the solicitor and the
occupant of the motor vehicle.  Passive panhandling, begging, charitable and
political solicitation is allowed on areas of sidewalks not otherwise
prohibited by this Subchapter, but no such solicitation may include any
attempts to solicit in areas with heightened public safety concerns.



(Ord. BG2018-3, 1/16/2018)



9-5   PENALTIES.



   Any person who violates any provision of this Chapter shall be guilty
of a violation and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine not to exceed
two-hundred and fifty ($250) dollars.  Each day of such violation shall
constitute a separate offense and no additional notice other than notice of
the original offense shall be required to convict a person for violations
resulting from a continuation of such offense.

   b.   Eligible Projects. A project shall be eligible for an employee
withholdings credit only if: 1) it directly creates sufficient payroll so as
to generate employee withholdings of ten thousand ($10,000.00) annually,
beginning on the activation date and continuing through the remainder of the
term of the agreement between the Applicant and the City of Bowling Green; or
2) it qualifies for economic development incentives pursuant to a program
administered by the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the program requires
participation by the City.  Once an incentive credit is granted to an

additional employee withholdings.  Any additional incentive credits will be
at the sole discretion of the City.

Applicant must generate employee withholdings of a minimum of ten thousand
dollars ($10,000.00) annually beginning on the activation date and continuing
through the remainder of the term of the agreement between the Applicant and

participation by the City. If approved, the Applicant may retain up to one
percent (1%) of gross wages generated by new jobs otherwise owed to the City
for a period of ten (10) years following the activation date. This credit is
to be applied to the employee withholdings payable to the City and not to any
other type of taxes or fees payable to the City, to the Warren County School
System or to any other taxing entity.  It shall be the responsibility of the
Applicant to deduct the employee withholdings from its employees'
paychecks.  It shall also be the responsibility of the Applicant to properly
report all employee withholdings and credits taken to the City.

11-7   INCREMENTAL TAX REVENUE – HARTLAND DEVELOPMENT AREA.*



_______________



*   Subchapter 11-7 was adopted by Ordinance No. BG89-55 on November 14,
1989.  Since that time and by act (Senate Bill 372) of the 2000 Kentucky
General Assembly, the provisions of KRS 99.751 to 99.771, by which the
Hartland Taxing District was established, have been repealed.  See KRS
65.680 to 65.699 for provisions regarding “Incremental Financing for
Economic Development.”



11-7.01   Preamble.



   a.   The City of Bowling Green engaged in the study and analysis of
the feasibility of the acquisition, construction and installation of major
convention center and trade show facilities to serve the City, the County of
Warren and the economic area of the City and County, which facilities would
provide and carry out the following public purposes:  (i) the provision of
governmentally owned, public convention and trade show facilities, (ii) the
enhancement of economic development and economic growth within the Bowling
Green - Warren County area, (iii) the enhancement of tourism in the Bowling
Green - Warren County through the provision of modern, governmentally owned,
public convention and trade show facilities, (iv) inducement of business and
industrial expansion compatible with convention and trade show activities and
(v) enhancement of the tax base of the Bowling Green - Warren County area and
creation of employment opportunities  for the citizenry of such area.



   b.   It has been determined by the City, acting by and through its
Board of Commissioners, that the acquisition, construction and installation
of a governmentally owned convention and trade show facilities, to consist of
convention and trade show facilities providing approximately 65,000 square
feet of facilities, will constitute the carrying out of a public purpose and
that the facilities will constitute a "public project" as such term is
defined in KRS Chapter 58 (the "Project").



   c.   The Commonwealth of Kentucky, acting by and through the
Economic Development Cabinet, has announced its intention to provide a
portion of the costs of the proposed Project upon the basis of the economic
and tourism contribution which the Project will make not only to Bowling
Green and Warren County, but to the Commonwealth generally.



   d.   In order to finance the Project, the City has heretofore caused
to be created The Convention Center Corporation, a nonprofit, non-stock
Kentucky corporation, which is a corporation described in and meeting the
qualifications of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Corporation") in order that the Corporation may act as the
agency, instrumentality and constituted authority of the City pursuant to the
provisions of KRS 58.180 in the financing of the Project.



   e.   Formerly KRS 99.751 to 99.771, inclusive, (the "Tax Increments
Act") authorized "taxing districts," including counties and cities of the
second class, such as the County of Warren and the City, to create
"development areas," and to enter into contracts with "agencies" as defined
in the Tax Increments Act, now KRS 65.680 to 65.699, inclusive, (the
“Kentucky Increment Financing Act”), for the release of incremental
revenues created  in  such  development areas to such agencies, and the
Corporation, being a nonprofit corporation  established  pursuant to KRS
Chapter 58,  constitutes  an  "agency"  within the meaning of the Tax
Increments Act, and is legally qualified to accept tax increments derived
from additional ad valorem taxes and occupational license fees generated
within the Development Area and utilize such tax increments for public
purposes, including for the financing of the Project; and the City has
determined that it will, as a taxing district within the meaning of the Tax
Increments Act, create a Development Area within the corporate limits of the
City and designate the Corporation as its Agency to receive tax increments
from such Development Area following the establishment of the Development
Area, so that such tax increments may be utilized by the Corporation for,
with other funds, if required, the amortization of obligations issued by the
Corporation in order to finance the construction, acquisition and
installation of the Project.



   f.   For the foregoing reasons, it is now deemed appropriate and
necessary by the City to (i) formally and officially approve and adopt the
Project and order its immediate implementation, (ii) designate the
Corporation as its agency, instrumentality and constituted authority for the
financing of the Project, (iii) agree to enter into at the appropriate time a
lease of the Project on an annually renewable basis as authorized by Kentucky
law for rentals (subject to credits from tax increments received by the
Corporation from the Development Area) sufficient to amortize the obligations
to be issued by the Corporation for the acquisition, construction and
installation of the Project, (iv) create a Development Area pursuant to the
Tax Increments Act, (v) contract with the Corporation as the designated
Agency under the Tax Increments Act to lease eighty percent (80%) of all ad
valorem tax revenues and occupational license fee revenues derived within the
Development Area over and above the amount of revenues received by the City
from such tax sources from the Development Area in the last year prior to the
establishment of the Development Area, such tax increments to be used by the
Corporation to amortize and pay the obligations issued for the financing of
the Project, and (vi) authorize the immediate undertaking and financing of
the Project.



(Ord. BG97-42, 12/02/97; Ord. BG2016-49, 1/3/2017)



11-7.02   Adoption of Public Project; Implementation of Project.



   A public project consisting of the acquisition, construction and
installation of an approximately 65,000 square feet governmentally owned
public convention and trade show facility to be situated within the corporate
limits of the City of Bowling Green (the "Project") is hereby officially
approved, adopted and confirmed.  The Project is a public project within the
meaning of KRS Chapter 58 and it is hereby found and determined that the
project is necessary and will perform essential governmental functions. 
Accordingly, the Project is ordered to be and shall be undertaken and
implemented forthwith, subject only to the condition that the Commonwealth of
Kentucky provides funding for a sufficient portion of the costs of the
Project.



11-7.03   Corporation to Act as Agency of the City.



   The Corporation is hereby authorized, empowered and directed to
continue to act as the agency, instrumentality and constituted authority of
the City in connection with the financing and acquisition of the Project. 
Such financing and acquisition shall be carried out pursuant to KRS Chapter
58.  In that regard, the Corporation is hereby authorized, directed and
empowered to take and carry out all actions in respect to the formal
authorization of its obligations, the sale of such obligations and the
application of the proceeds thereof of the construction, installation and
acquisition of the Project for lease to and occupancy and use by the City. 
The Corporation shall enter into a lease agreement with the City Pursuant to
which the Project shall be leased by the Corporation to the City for rentals
equal to the amortization requirements in respect to the obligations to be
issued by the Corporation, together with the cost of operating, maintaining
and insuring the facility.



11-7.04   Lease of Project by Corporation to City.



   The Project shall be leased by the Corporation to the City on an annual
basis subject to annual automatic renewals over such term of years as shall
be adequate to amortize in full all obligations issued by the Corporation for
the financing of the Project.  Any and all tax "increments" as hereinafter
defined, received by the Corporation from the Development Area representing
the proceeds of ad valorem taxes and occupational license fees collected
within the Development Area, hereinafter defined, shall be credited by the
Corporation against rental payments otherwise required to be made by the City
under such financing lease. In the event tax increments received by the
Corporation from the Development Area exceed the amortization requirements on
the obligations of the Corporation issued to finance the Project, plus the
cost of operating, maintaining and insuring the Project, such tax increments
shall be returned by the Corporation to the City and to the County of Warren,
pro rata upon the basis of the original interests of each such unit of
government in such underlying ad valorem taxes and occupational license fees.



11-7.05   Immediate Undertaking of Project Authorized.



   The immediate undertaking and implementation of the Project is hereby
authorized and directed.  The Corporation is directed to undertake the
formulation of a financing plan, to cause the Project to be designed, to
enter into such agreements and undertakings as shall be reasonably required
in the circumstances to carry out the implementation and financing of the
Project and to do all other things useful and necessary in furtherance of the
construction and financing of the Project.



11-7.06   Creation of Development Area.*



   a.   Pursuant to KRS 99.751 through 99.771, inclusive, (the "Tax
Increments Act"), a Development Area was officially designated and created by
the City, which encompasses the geographic area described as follows:



   PARCEL I:



   A certain tract of real property lying on Scottsville Road at its
southeastern intersection with  South  Park  Drive, consisting  of 67.136
acres, all as more particularly described as Tract 1 on Revision of the Smith
Estate and Revision of Hartland Subdivision Section 2 as set forth in Plat
Book 22, Page 47, in the Office of the Warren County Clerk.



   PARCEL II:



   A tract of land lying on Scottsville Road at its southeastern
intersection with Ashley Street (proposed), containing 3.14 acres, and more
particularly described as Tract 1 of the Wallace/Vanmeter Subdivision as set
forth in Plat Book 22, Page 104, in the Office of the Warren County Clerk.



   PARCEL III:



   A certain tract of land located on Ashley Street (proposed), containing
2.90 acres, and designated as Lot 2 of the Wallace/Vanmeter Subdivision as
recorded in Plat Book 22, Page 104, in the Office of the Warren County Clerk.



   b.   Pursuant to the Tax Increments Act, now KRS 65.680 to 65.699,
inclusive, (the “Kentucky Increment Financing Action”), the City, as the
"Taxing District," under such Act, hereby designates the Corporation as the
"Agency" under such Act, to develop the Project within the Development Area
and to receive tax increments derived from the Development Area and apply
such tax increments to amortize the obligations to be issued by the
Corporation to acquire, construct and install the Project.



   c.   There are hereby assigned to the Corporation eighty percent
(80%) of the incremental ad valorem taxes and occupational license fees
derived and to be derived within the Development Area.  The incremental
taxes shall be deemed to be the "increments," as defined in the Tax
Increments Act, and shall be that amount of ad valorem tax receipts and
occupational license fee receipts authorized to be received by the City from
the Development Area in each year beginning calendar year 1990 over the
amount of such ad valorem tax revenues and occupational license fee revenues
authorized to be received by the City from the Development Area in calendar
year 1989, being the last year prior to the establishment by the City, as
Taxing District, of the Development Area.  The City shall at a later date
enter into an appropriate contract with the Corporation for the release and
payment of such tax increments to the Corporation, subject to the terms
negotiated at that time.  It is hereby determined and declared that the
increments hereby assigned to the Corporation as Agency, pursuant to the Tax
Increments Act, represent increments expected to be derived by the City as a
direct and proximate result of the undertaking by the City of the Project. 
All tax increments hereby assigned to the Corporation and to be contracted to
the Corporation by the City shall be used solely and only for purposes of the
Project and in the Development Area and shall be used for the amortization
obligations issued by the Corporation for the financing of the Project, and
for the operation, maintenance and insurance of the Project.

which is located in the service area of Warren Rural Electric Cooperative
Corporation (WRECC) that has not obtained fifty percent (50%) occupancy of
the lots within the subdivision.

11-9.02   Street Lighting for New Subdivisions.



   An owner/developer or property owners in a new subdivision who wish to
provide for the installation of street lighting may contract with WRECC for
the cost of installation of street lights, including light pole design, light
bulbs, location of street lights and energy costs, as well as any and all

   Upon approval by WRECC, WRECC may request and the City may approve that
the cost of the street lighting shall be paid by assessment of a special ad
valorem tax on the abutting lots and parcels of land in the new subdivision
in the manner provided by law.  Upon passage of an ordinance making a

establish a street light taxing district for such new subdivision and shall
collect as a special ad valorem tax assessment the necessary funds to provide
for the street light services described herein.  The cost of installation,
energy costs and other costs shall be determined by WRECC and shall be
prorated among owners of each lot within the new subdivision.  The cost for
each lot shall be added to each City ad valorem tax bill each year of the
special tax assessment.  The City shall be entitled to retain a reasonable
collection fee and shall pay to WRECC all remaining funds it receives under
the special ad valorem tax assessment.  The special ad valorem tax
assessment shall be collected in the same manner as City taxes and shall
result in a lien on each lot if not paid.  The City shall not be responsible
to WRECC for any unpaid tax assessments and the City shall not be liable for
the cost of such street lighting, including energy costs, installation or
maintenance during the term of the special tax assessment.  All street
lighting installed shall be in compliance with all applicable regulations.

   Once the new subdivision has been developed so that fifty percent (50%)
of the lots in the new subdivision are occupied and WRECC has recovered all
its costs related to the special taxing district, WRECC shall notify the City
and the special taxing district and tax assessment shall terminate.  At the

all future street lighting installation, including energy costs, maintenance
and all other costs in compliance with current guidelines.

11-11   DEVELOPMENT AREA – INTER-MODAL COMMERCE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER
AND INDUSTRIAL PARK (KENTUCKY TRANSPARK).



11-11.01   Preamble.



   a.   The City of Bowling Green and the County of Warren, Kentucky,
in cooperation with various other local governments, have for several years
engaged in the study and analysis of the feasibility of the establishment of
an Inter-Modal Commerce and Distribution Center and Industrial Park, referred
to as the Kentucky Transpark, (the "Project") to serve the City of Bowling
Green, the County of Warren and the economic area of the City and County,
which project would provide and carry out the following public purposes: 
(i) the enhancement of economic development and economic growth within the
Bowling Green-Warren County area, (ii) inducement of business and industrial
expansion compatible with Bowling Green and Warren County, and (iii) the
enhancement of the tax base of the Bowling Green-Warren County area and
creation of employment opportunities for the citizens of Bowling Green and
Warren County;



   b.   In order to finance the Project, the County of Warren has
heretofore caused to be created the Inter-Modal Transportation Authority,
Inc. (ITA), a nonprofit, non-stock corporation which is a corporation created
pursuant to KRS Chapter 58 (the "Corporation");



   c.   KRS 65.680 to 65.699, inclusive, (the "Kentucky Increment
Financing Act") authorize cities of the second class, such as the City of
Bowling Green, and the County of Warren to create "development areas" and to
enter into contracts and grant agreements as set out in the Kentucky
Increment Financing Act for the release of incremental revenues created in
such development areas to the Corporation, being a nonprofit corporation
established pursuant to KRS Chapter 58.  The Corporation constitutes an
"agency" within the meaning of the Kentucky Increment Financing Act and is
legally qualified to accept tax increments derived from additional tax
revenues generated within the development area, including ad valorem taxes
generated within the development area, and to utilize such tax increments for
public purposes, including for the financing of the Project.  The City of
Bowling Green has determined that it will, as a taxing district within the
meaning of the Kentucky Increment Financing Act, create a Development Area
within the corporate limits of the City of Bowling Green and designate the
Corporation as its Agency to receive tax increments from such Development
Area following the establishment of the Development Area so that such tax
increments may be utilized by the Corporation for, with other funds if
required, the amortization of obligations issued by Warren County, Kentucky
for the benefit of the Inter-Modal Commerce and Distribution Center and
Industrial Park (Kentucky Transpark) in order to finance the construction,
acquisition and installation of the infrastructure of the Project; and,



   d.   For the foregoing reasons, it is now deemed appropriate and
necessary by the City of Bowling Green to (i) create a Development Area
pursuant to the Kentucky Increment Financing Act, and (ii) contract with the
Corporation and other necessary parties as the designated Agency under the
Kentucky Increment Financing Act to release eighty percent (80%) of all ad
valorem tax revenues derived within the Development Area over and above the
amount of revenues received or that would have been received by the City of
Bowling Green from such tax sources from the Development Area in the last
year prior to the establishment of the Development Area, such tax increments
to be used by the Corporation to amortize and pay the obligations issued for
the financing of the Project, including infrastructure costs.

11-12.04     Calculation and Distribution of Tax Increment Financing
Revenue Related to Growth of Existing Businesses or Jobs that Relocate Into
the TIF Development Area.



   a.   It is not the purpose of TIF to shift existing commercial,
professional or other businesses that already exist in the City, but outside
the TIF area, into the TIF area without an adjustment to Old Revenue
(hereinafter also called “base revenues”).  Therefore, any existing City
business outside the TIF area that moves into the TIF area shall file with
the City Finance Department and the Office of the City Manager information
related to the number of employees at its existing location or locations and
the amount of occupational withholding fees paid by those employees for the
preceding calendar year prior to its relocation into the TIF area and the
amount of its net profit fees paid to the City for its previous fiscal
year.  The base revenue for the TIF area shall then be adjusted to include
the occupational withholding fees and net profit fees reported by the
existing City business and these revenues shall be included as Old Revenue to
determine an adjusted base revenue.  Such businesses shall report the
existing revenues to the City Finance Department on forms provided by the
Department.



   b.   Additional policies are hereby adopted related to the creation
of Western Kentucky University jobs in the TIF area.  Prior to the
consideration of any Western jobs in the TIF area, the Warren County Downtown
Economic Development Authority, Inc. shall file with the City Finance
Department copies of the appropriate documents that are required to be filed
with the State pursuant to the State grant agreement, including all documents
that are required to be filed on an annual basis.



   c.   No occupational withholding fees generated from Western
Kentucky University jobs shall be included as new TIF revenues unless there
is an actual increase in Western jobs in the City from the preceding calendar
year.  In addition, only those jobs in the TIF area that exceed the actual
increase in Western jobs in the City shall be considered for TIF revenue
calculations.



      As an example for illustration purposes only, Western employment
increases from 5,000 jobs to 5,100 jobs from the years 2011 to 2012.  The
TIF documents indicate that 200 new Western jobs were reported in the TIF
area for 2012.  Only 100 of the new Western jobs will be considered toward
TIF revenue calculation.



   d.   If the growth of Western jobs in the TIF area exceeds the
actual increase in total Western jobs from the preceding calendar year, the
City Finance Department and the Office of the City Manager shall then examine
the Western jobs that were created in the TIF area and that are being
considered for TIF revenue calculation.  If any of the claimed Western jobs
were existing jobs that relocated into the TIF area, the base revenue for the
TIF area shall be adjusted to include the occupational withholding fees from
the preceding calendar year paid by the existing Western jobs that relocated
into the TIF area and these revenues shall be included as Old Revenue.



      As an example for illustration purposes only and using the
example above, the City will examine the 100 new Western jobs in the TIF
area.  It is determined that an existing Western department relocated into
the TIF area.  Ninety-five of these jobs existed prior to the relocation of
the department.  The occupational withholding fees paid on those 95 jobs for
the previous calendar year shall be included as Old Revenue to determine an
adjusted base revenue.  The five new positions shall be classified as new
jobs and 80% of the occupational withholding fees generated from those five
new jobs will be paid to the Authority.

11-13   ENERGY PROJECT ASSESSMENT DISTRICT.



11-13.01   Preamble.



   The City of Bowling Green declares as a public purpose the
establishment of a municipal program to enable its citizens to participate in
an Energy Project Assessment District (EPAD) program so that owners of
property can finance energy saving improvements to their properties in the
City.  The City adopts this program pursuant to HB 100 approved by the 2015
session of the Kentucky General Assembly and signed by the Governor with the
legislation cited as the “EPAD Act of 2015.”



(Ord. BG2015-18, 6/16/2015; Ord. BG2016-49, 1/3/2017)



11-13.02   Definitions.



   All of the terms of this Subchapter shall have the same meaning as the
terms set out in House Bill 100, the EPAD Act of 2015.



(Ord. BG2015-18, 6/16/2015)



11-13.03   Adoption of EPAD Program and Designation of EPAD Program Area.



   a.   An “EPAD” or “Energy Project Assessment District”
program for existing properties in the City of Bowling Green for the purposes
of encouraging the efficiency of energy use or decrease water or energy
consumption or demand is hereby adopted and established under the Kentucky
EPAD Act of 2015 and the City of Bowling Green intends to use assessments on
real property in the EPAD to support private sector energy projects.



   b.   In order to permit participation by property owners in the EPAD
Act of 2015, the City hereby designates the entire city limits, including any
future annexed area, as its EPAD, making all City property owners eligible
for participation in the program.



(Ord. BG2015-18, 6/16/2015; Ord. BG2016-49, 1/3/2017)



11-13.04   Operation of the EPAD Program.



   a.   The provisions and operation of the EPAD program in the City of
Bowling Green shall be subject to the requirements and procedures set out in
the EPAD Act of 2015.



   b.   The City’s Department of Finance is designated as the
official office for the City to administer the EPAD program and is delegated
the responsibility of administering the program pursuant to the provisions of
the applicable state statutes and this Subchapter, including working with the
Warren County Property Valuation Administrator (PVA), the Warren County Court
Clerk and all applicable City departments in the operation of the program,
assessment of properties and collection of the assessments.  The Department
of Finance is authorized to impose fees on participating property owners to
offset the costs of administering the program, including assessments and
collection functions of Warren County and City offices, except that these
fees shall not exceed one percent (1%) of the amount assessed per payment
with the fees to be divided among the applicable agencies as agreed by the
agencies.  The Department of Finance is further authorized to engage
financing for the purpose of administering the EPAD program from financial
institutions with a physical presence in Kentucky whose deposits are insured
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  In addition, the Department
of Finance may contract with a third-party entity to administer the EPAD
program.



   c.   The Department of Finance is authorized to develop the
necessary application and procedures for property owners of record to apply
for the EPAD program.  To qualify for the program, the property owner of
record shall file the application with the Department of Finance no later
than thirty (30) days prior to commencing the installation of the energy
project.  The application shall be submitted in compliance with the
procedures set out in the EPAD Act of 2015 and as established by the
Department of Finance. The application shall include a legal description of
the real property being improved including a deed book and page number, the
PVA Code and the names and addresses of all owners of the property.  The
application shall also include a general description of the proposed energy
project and a proposed time schedule for undertaking and completing the
project.  The application shall be signed by all owners of the property and
shall include the written consent of the holder of each existing mortgage
lien on the property stating that the lien holder does not object to the
imposition of the EPAD Act lien.



   d.   The Department of Finance staff, in cooperation with any other
City department staff, shall review each application for compliance with the
applicable State statutes and the Department of Finance procedures, including
a review of the energy project being proposed, an examination of the
property’s baseline energy or water usage conditions and the energy or
water savings projected to be achieved as a result of the energy project. 
For any energy project requiring a total assessment of two hundred and fifty
thousand ($250,000) dollars or more, that review shall include evidence that
the energy project has been examined by a Kentucky Licensed Professional
Engineer who has attested that:  1) the scope of work is in compliance with
all applicable building codes; 2) the scope of work and the project budget
are consistent with completed projects of a similar nature; and 3) the
estimated energy savings calculations are accurate and achievable.



   e.   The Department of Finance shall review the application and all
other materials presented with it and shall determine if the application and
energy study, if applicable, comply with the EPAD Act of 2015.  If the
application is approved, the Department of Finance, in conjunction with the
City Department of Law, shall prepare and enter into a written contract
between the City and the property owners accepting the energy project
pursuant to reasonable terms and conditions established by the City,
including the establishment of the necessary assessment to finance the costs
of the project.  The written contract shall set forth the total amount of
the assessment, the term of the assessment, the interest rate established for
the assessment and the annual amount of the assessment.  The contract may
also designate the qualified contractor that will construct and install the
energy project.  The City Manager is hereby designated to execute these
contracts on behalf of the City.



   f.   Once the application is approved, the Department of Finance
shall file a written notice of the assessment in the real property records of
the Warren County Court Clerk’s Office indicating the amount of the
assessment, the legal description of the real property, the name of each
owner of record of the real property and a reference to the statutory
assessment lien provided by the State statutes and this Subchapter.



   g.   Upon the recording of the written notice and the imposition of
the assessment, the Department of Finance is authorized to add the assessment
to the City property tax bill for the relevant property.  The assessment
shall be imposed and collected in the same manner as other City property
taxes and any unpaid assessment shall bear the same interest rate and penalty
as other City property taxes.  The assessment shall, together with any
interest and penalties, constitute a first and prior lien against the real
property on which the assessment is imposed from the date on which the notice
of assessment is recorded until paid.  Furthermore, this lien shall have the
same priority status as a lien for any other State or local ad valorem tax
upon the property.  The Department of Finance is authorized to pursue
collection actions for unpaid assessments in the same manner it pursues
collections of unpaid property taxes.  The Department of Finance shall
collect the assessments annually and make the required payments to the entity
financing the energy project.  Any bonds or notes issued under the
applicable State statutes or this Subchapter for an EPAD project shall not be
general obligations of the City and the City of Bowling Green and its
officers, officials or officers shall have no liability to any persons for
uncollected EPAD assessments and unpaid EPAD debt.



   h.   The owner shall notify the City Department of Finance upon
completion of the energy project and, in the event the total assessment for
the energy project is two hundred and fifty thousand ($250,000) dollars or
greater, provide the Department of Finance a certification from a Kentucky
Licensed Professional Engineer that an on-site inspection verifies the actual
construction and installation was in compliance with the application and
contract.

   b.   In the event of a hazardous substances release or threatened 
release involving a fixed facility, the operator, owner and all other
responsible persons of the facility for the presence of hazardous substances
shall be responsible for the Bowling Green Fire Department and other
dispatched emergency response personnel costs in responding to the release or
threatened release, including but not limited to replacement of supplies and
equipment contaminated as a result of the incident and proper disposal of
contaminated materials, cleanup, evacuation, administrative and other
expenses, including legal expenses, incurred in recovering these costs.  The

recoverable costs as stated hereinabove.  The affidavit of the Fire Chief
shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of the lien and the
regularity of the proceedings and shall be recorded in the Office of the
County Clerk.  The lien shall be notice to all persons from the time of its
recording and shall bear interest thereafter until paid.  The lien created
shall take precedence over all other subsequent liens, except state, county,
school board and city taxes, and may be enforced by judicial proceeding. 
The owner of a property upon which a lien has been attached shall be
personally liable for the amount of the lien, including all interest, civil
penalties, and other charges and the City shall have the same remedies as
provided for the recovery of a debt owed.



12-3.08   Response Outside City Limits.



   The Bowling Green Fire Department and other emergency response
personnel shall respond to releases or threatened releases outside the City
limits of Bowling Green only if written agreements are executed with the
handler, user or other public entity prior to the response and such
agreements are approved by the Board of Commissioners.



   In the event of a hazardous substances response outside the city limits
of Bowling Green, the handler, user or other public entity requesting the
response from the Bowling Green Fire Department and other emergency response
personnel shall assume responsibility for recovering for the Bowling Green
Fire Department and other dispatched emergency response personnel costs
incurred in responding, including but not limited to replacement of supplies
and equipment contaminated as a result of the incident and proper disposal of
contaminated material, cleanup, evacuation, administrative and other
expenses, including legal expenses, incurred in recovering these costs.  The
City Attorney is hereby authorized and directed to initiate such proceedings
against the handler, user or their public entity, in the name of the City of
Bowling Green, in any court having jurisdiction over such matters as are
necessary to recover costs to the City.  Unless exempted by specific mutual
aid agreements, the requesting agencies shall also be responsible for
recovering salary costs for City of Bowling Green personnel beginning at the
time the personnel respond and ending upon their return to the Bowling Green
work station.



12-3.09   Enforcement/Penalties.



   a.   The Fire Chief will have primary responsibilities for
enforcement of the provisions of this Subchapter.



   b.   Upon notification or discovery of any violation of the
provisions of this Subchapter, the Fire Chief or his designated agent shall
investigate the site, and if a violation is found, issue a notice of
violation to the person responsible for the facility.  This notice shall
provide for immediate abatement if a release or threatened release is
occurring.  This notice shall also provide abatement periods for other
violations.



   c.     Any person who fails to notify the Fire Chief of a release

13-2   REGULATING SMOKING ON PUBLIC PROPERTY



13-2.01   Findings.



   a.   Secondhand smoke, also known as environmental tobacco smoke
(ETS), is a mixture of the smoke given off by the burning end of a cigarette,
pipe or cigar and the smoke exhaled from the lungs of smokers.  It is
involuntarily inhaled by nonsmokers, lingers in the air hours after
cigarettes have been extinguished and can cause or exacerbate a wide range of
adverse health affects, including cancer, respiratory infections and asthma.
(California Environmental Protection Agency, Identification of Environmental
Tobacco Smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant, Executive Summary, June 2005.) 
The National Cancer Institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is
responsible for the early deaths of up to 65,000 Americans annually. 
(Health Effects of Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke:  the Report of
the California Environmental Protection Agency.  Smoking and Tobacco Control
Monograph 10, Bethesda, Maryland, National Institutes of Health, National
Cancer Institute, August 1991.)



   b.   Secondhand smoke has been classified by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) as a known cause of cancer in humans (Group A
carcinogen) (California Environmental Protection Agency, Identification of
Environmental Tobacco Smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant, Executive Summary,
June 2005.)



   c.   Secondhand smoke exposure causes disease and premature death in
children and adults who do not smoke.  Secondhand smoke contains hundreds of
chemicals known to be toxic or carcinogenic, including formaldehyde, benzene,
vinyl chloride, arsenic, ammonia and hydrogen cyanide. (The Health
Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke:  6 Major Conclusions
of the Surgeon General Report.  A Report of the Surgeon General, U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 2006.)



   d.   Secondhand smoke causes approximately 3,400 lung cancer deaths
and 46,000 heart disease deaths in adult nonsmokers in the United States each
year. (California Environmental Protection Agency, Identification of
Environmental Tobacco Smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant, Executive Summary,
June 2005.)



     e.   Nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke at work are at
increased risk for adverse health effects.  Levels of ETS in restaurants and
bars were found to be two (2) to five (5) times higher than in residences
with smokers and two (2) to six (6) times higher than in office work places.
(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Report on Carcinogens, Tenth
Edition 2002.  National Toxicology Program.)



   f.   The work place is a major source of secondhand smoke exposure
for adults.  Since 1999, seventy (70%) percent of the U.S. workforce worked
under a smoke-free policy.  Blue collar and service employees are less
likely than white collar indoor workers to be covered by smoke-free
policies.  Restaurant employees are far less likely than other workers to be
protected by smoke-free workplace policies, more likely than other workers to
have these policies violated where they do exist and are more likely to be
exposed to high levels of secondhand smoke on the job.  Only forty-three
(43%) percent of this population work under one-hundred (100%) percent
smoke-free workplace policies.  Only twenty-nine (13%) percent of wait staff
and thirteen (13%) percent of bartenders work under such policies.  As of
2002, over 6.6 million Americans worked in food preparation and service
occupations.  One (1) in five (5) workers in these occupations is a teen,
fifty-six (56%) percent are women, almost twenty (20%) percent are Hispanic
and just under twelve (12%) percent are African American. (The Health
Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke:  6 Major Conclusions
of the Surgeon General Report.  A Report of the Surgeon General, U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 2006.)



   g.   Secondhand smoke is especially harmful to young children. 
Secondhand smoke is responsible for between 150,000 and 300,000 lower
respiratory tract infections in infants and children under eighteen (18)
months of age, resulting in between 7,500 and 15,000 hospitalizations each
year and causes 430 sudden infant death syndrome deaths in the United States
annually.  (California Environmental Protection Agency, Identification of
Environmental Tobacco Smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant, Executive Summary,
June 2005.)  Children who are exposed to secondhand smoke inhale the same
cancer-causing substances and because their bodies are developing, infants
and children are especially vulnerable to the toxins in secondhand smoke. 
Both babies whose mothers smoke while pregnant or who are exposed to
secondhand smoke after birth have weaker lungs than unexposed babies, which
increases the risk for many health problems.  Mothers who are exposed to
secondhand smoke while pregnant are more likely to have lower birth weight
babies, which makes babies weaker and increases the risk for many health
problems.  (The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco
Smoke:  6 Major Conclusions of the Surgeon General Report.  A Report of the
Surgeon General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006.)



   h.   Secondhand smoke exposure may cause buildup of fluid in the
middle ear resulting in 790,000 physician office visits per year. 
Secondhand smoke can also aggravate symptoms in 400,000 to 1,000,000 children
with asthma.  (California Environmental Protection Agency, Identification of
Environmental Tobacco Smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant, Executive Summary,
June 2005.)



   i.    The current Surgeon General’s Report concluded that
scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk-free level of exposure to
secondhand smoke.  Short exposures to secondhand smoke can cause blood
platelets to become stickier, damage the lining of blood vessels, decrease
coronary flow velocity reserves and reduce heart rate variability,
potentially increasing the risk of heart attack.  (The Health Consequences
of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke:  6 Major Conclusions of the
Surgeon General Report. A Report of the Surgeon General, U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, 2006.)



   j.   The current Surgeon General’s Report also concluded that
eliminating smoking in indoor spaces fully protects nonsmokers from exposure
to secondhand smoke.  Separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air
and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposures of nonsmokers to
secondhand smoke.  Conventional air cleaning systems can remove large
particles, but not the smaller particles or the gases found in secondhand
smoke.  Routine operating of a heating, ventilating and air conditioning
system can distribute secondhand smoke throughout a building.  The American
Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, the
preeminent U.S. body on ventilation issues has concluded that ventilation
technology cannot be relied on to control health risks from secondhand smoke
exposure.  (The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco
Smoke:  6 Major Conclusions of the Surgeon General Report.  A Report of the
Surgeon General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006.)

13-2.02   Declaration of Public Policy.



   The Board of Commissioners declares, as a matter of public policy, that
in order to eliminate the exposure of the public and workers in the work
place to secondhand smoke and to reduce the harmful health effects of such
exposure to secondhand smoke, the regulation of smoking in public places and
work places is required in the interests of public health, safety and welfare
of the citizens and workers of the City.

causing the installation, servicing, repair, maintenance, sale, replacement
or response to an alarm system.



   “ALARM PERMIT” shall mean a certificate of authorization issued by
the City of Bowling Green for the operation of an alarm system at an alarm
site.

alarm does not include activation of an alarm system which is caused by a
natural or man-made catastrophe, severe weather that causes physical damage
to the premises, vandalism, telephone line outage or other reasons which

or alarm system user who has any outstanding and unpaid fees or charges

   a.   Where salaries, wages, commissions and other trade

license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the

   b.   Except as provided in subsection e. of this Section, net profit
shall be apportioned as follows:



      1.   For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue
in more than one (1) tax district, by multiplying the net profit by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in
subsection c. of this Section, plus the sales factor, described in subsection
d. of this Section, and the denominator of which is two (2); and,



      2.   For business entities with sales revenue in more than one
(1) tax district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set
forth in subsection d. of this Section.



      3.   For the purposes of this Subchapter, the business entity
shall file an apportionment form provided by the City of Bowling Green.



   c.   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
total amount paid or payable in the City during the tax period by the
business entity for compensation and the denominator of which is the total
compensation paid or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax
period.  Compensation is paid or payable in the City based on the time the
individual's service is performed within the City.



   d.   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
total sales revenue of the business entity in the City during the tax period
and the denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business
entity everywhere during the tax period.



      1.   The sale, lease or rental of tangible personal property
is in the City if:



         (a)   The property is delivered or shipped to a

of the sale; or,



         (b)   The property is shipped from an office, store,
warehouse, factory or other place of storage in the City and the purchaser is
the United States government.



      2.   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease
or rental of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real
property, are apportioned to the City based upon a fraction, the numerator of
which is the time spent in performing such income-producing activity within
the City and the denominator of which is the total time spent performing that
income- producing activity.



      3.   Sales revenue from the sale, lease or rental of real
property is allocated to the tax district where the property is located.



   e.   If the apportionment provisions of this Section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the City, the
business entity may petition the City or the City may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:



      1.   Separate accounting;



      2.   The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;



      3.   The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors which
will fairly represent the business entity's business activity in the City; or,



      4.   The employment of any other method to effectuate an
equitable allocation and apportionment of net profits.



   f.   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the City, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or
payable as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the
City.  The license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which
the compensation for work performed or services rendered within the City
bears to the total wages and compensation paid or payable.  In order for the
City to verify the accuracy of a taxpayer’s reported percentages under this
Subsection, the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.



   g.   All partnerships, S corporations and all other entities where
income is “passed through” to the owners are subject to the provisions of
this Subchapter.  The occupational license tax imposed in this Subchapter is
assessed against income before it is “passed through” these entities to
the owners.



   h.   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate or
withdraws from the City during any taxable year, or if any business entity in
any manner surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the
dissolution, cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of
charter shall not defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and
collection of any occupational license tax for the period of that taxable
year during which the business entity had business activity in the City.



   i.   If a business entity makes or is required to make a federal
income tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the
purposes of this Subchapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year
required by the federal government, and shall employ the same methods of
accounting required for federal income tax purposes.

   d.   The City shall have a lien upon all the property of any
employer who fails to withhold or pay over to the City sums required to be
withheld under this Section.  If the employer withholds, but fails to pay
the amounts withheld to the City, the lien shall commence as on the date the
amounts withheld were required to be paid to the City.  If the employer
fails to withhold, the lien shall commence at the time the liability of the
employer is assessed by the City.



   e.   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this
Section shall annually on or before February 28 of each year complete and
file on a form furnished or approved by the City a reconciliation of the

   b.   Every business entity shall submit a copy of its federal income
tax return and all supporting statements and schedules at the time of filing

business entity in order to audit the return, the City may compel the

schedules in support thereof that have not been previously filed.  The City

governed by the provisions of this Subchapter shall keep records, render
under oath statements, make returns and comply with rules, as the City from
time to time, may prescribe.  Whenever the City deems it necessary, the City
may require a business entity, by notice served to the business entity, to
make a return, render statements under oath or keep records, as the City
deems sufficient to determine the tax liability the business entity.

correctness of any return or for the purposes of making an estimate of the
taxable income of any business entity, the attendance of a representative of

entity, as appears from the face of the return, shall be paid to the City at
the time prescribed for filing the occupational license tax return,
determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the return. 
Where any portion of the net profit license fee so due shall have been
deducted at the source, credit for such amount shall be deducted from the
amount shown to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable
at the time of the filing of the net profit license fee return as hereinabove
provided.

to report such payments to the City.  Said payments must be reported on by
remitting Federal Form 1099 of the year following the close of the calendar
year in which the non-employee compensation was paid.  If a business entity
or person is not required to remit Federal Form 1099 to the IRS, including
but not limited to payments less than six hundred ($600) dollars, they are
still liable to remit the equivalent information to the City.  The

for filing its return, if the business entity on or before the date
prescribed for payment of the occupational license tax, requests the
extension and pays the amount properly estimated as its tax.



   b.   If the time for filing a return is extended, the business shall

      1.   An estimated fee in an amount not less than ninety (90%)
percent of the total tax as finally determined; or,

on the compensation attributable to activities performed outside the City may
file for a refund within two (2) years of the date prescribed by law for the
filing of a return.  The employee shall provide a schedule and computation
sufficient to verify the refund claim and the City may confirm with the
employer the percentage of time spent outside the City and the amount of
compensation attributable to activities performed outside the City prior to
approval of the refund.



   c.   In no event shall any refund or credit be made for any payment
upon any occupational license tax, unless the refund or credit is submitted
and filed in strict compliance with the foregoing provisions of this
Subchapter upon such refund claim forms or amended return forms as may
hereafter be promulgated by the Chief Financial Officer of the City.

21-1   GENERAL PROVISIONS.



21-1.01   Violation to Place or Erect Obstructions on City Property.



   a.   It shall be a civil violation as set out in Chapter 27 of this
Code for any person to erect or place or cause to be erected or placed any
building, sign, fence, brick mailbox or column on any city street, alley,
sidewalk, right-of-way or any other real property owned or occupied by the
City.  Other obstructions, including but not limited to large rocks or
boulders, posts, stakes and landscape that are deemed a safety hazard to the
public shall also be prohibited, with the exception of public utility
infrastructure.



   b.   Any structure that exists within right-of-way as of September
1, 2012 may remain, but may not be enlarged, moved or structurally altered in
a way that increases its nonconformity.  The Public Works Director or
designee shall have the authority to remove the structures should they be
deemed an immediate safety concern or impede any public improvement project
of the City’s streets and infrastructure.  Voluntary demolition of a
nonconforming structure nullifies its nonconforming rights.  If
involuntarily destroyed or removed, the nonconforming structure shall retain
its nonconforming rights for a period of one year.  Failure to re-establish
the structure within one (1) year nullifies the nonconforming rights.



   c.     No structure, sign, fence or vegetation shall be permitted
to obscure the vision of the traveling public at any street, alley or
driveway intersection as determined by the Public Works Director or designee.



   d.   Notwithstanding the provisions hereinabove, signs designating
entrances to subdivisions may be constructed upon city rights-of-way,
provided that prior to the construction, plans and specifications for the
construction of the sign are approved in writing by the Planning and Design
Division of the Department of Public Works through a right-of-way work permit.



21-1.02   Duty to Remove Obstructions; Authorization of Temporary
Obstructions.



   Every person owning or acting as agent for or occupying any building or
lot in the City shall keep, or cause the sidewalk and right-of-way adjacent
to such building or lot to be kept open and free from obstructions, barriers
and impediments as described hereinabove; provided however, the Public Works
Director or designee may allow a temporary obstruction if such obstruction is
removed within twenty-four (24) hours following installation.  The Public
Works Director or designee shall have the authority to remove obstructions
within a notified period of time and, if an emergency exists, may order
immediate removal of an obstruction without prior notice.



21-1.03   Damage to Curbing, Pavement, Sidewalk and Other Public
Infrastructure.



   a.   It shall be unlawful for any person to intentionally or
maliciously damage any curbing, pavement, sidewalk, road signs, traffic
signal equipment, street lights and drainage structures or other public
infrastructure within City rights-of-way.  In addition to any criminal
penalties imposed, the Public Works Department shall have the authority to
notify any violator to require corrective action.  If proper repairs are not
made, the City may repair or contract to repair, and the violator shall be
responsible for the costs incurred by the City for such repair.



   b.   It shall be a civil violation for any person to negligently
damage any curbing, pavement, sidewalk, road signs, traffic signal equipment,
street lights and drainage structures or other public infrastructure within
City rights-of-way.  The Public Works Department shall have the authority to
notify any violator to require corrective action.  If proper repairs are not
made, the City may repair or contract to repair and the violator shall be
responsible for the costs incurred by the City for such repair. 



   c.   In addition to the remedies above, the City Attorney is
authorized to pursue any and all appropriate civil actions in order to
recover the City’s costs for making repairs.



21-1.04   No Construction Materials or Debris on Street.



   It shall be a civil violation for any person to track or leave upon any
city street, alley or sidewalk any construction materials or debris so as to
obstruct or impede traffic or cause property damage or personal injury. 
Additionally, any person performing work at a construction site on or near
any street, alley or sidewalk shall comply with the standards of the current
edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and with
right-of-way work permit requirements.



21-1.05   Enforcement and Penalties.



   Enforcement proceedings for any civil violations of this Subchapter
shall be initiated by the issuance of a notice of violation or a citation by
a code official as set out in the procedures in Chapter 2 of this Code.  Any
person violating any portion of this Subchapter, other than those penalties
classified as civil violations as set out in Chapter 27 of this Code, shall
be guilty of a violation and shall be subject to criminal fines up to two
hundred and fifty ($250.00) dollars for each offense.  Each day that the
prohibited action is continued shall constitute a separate offense.



21-2   STORMWATER QUALITY.



21-2.01   Definitions.



   The terms as used in this Subchapter are further defined in the City of
Bowling Green Stormwater Best Management Practices (BMP) Manual.  In
addition, the term “person” as used in this Subchapter shall have the
same definition as the term “person” in Chapter 27 of this Code.



21-2.02   Purpose.



   The United States Environmental Protection Agency through the Clean
Water Act promulgated Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Phase II
regulations that are enforced by the Kentucky Division of Water (KYDOW)
through a permit issued to the City of Bowling Green.  The purpose of this
Subchapter is to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the
environment, and bring the City of Bowling Green into compliance with its MS4
permit.



21-2.03   Construction Site Stormwater Management.



   a.   Permits Required, Exceptions, Requirements and Fees. 



      1.   Permits are required to be obtained from the City for all
site construction projects and/or land disturbances as set out in the City of
Bowling Green Stormwater Best Management Practices (BMP) Manual.  The
developer shall also coordinate with the KYDOW and the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to determine whether permits are required from those agencies
before construction begins.  Each developer shall submit an application to
the City on a form provided by the City.



      2.   No permit shall be required from the City for emergency
activity that is immediately necessary for the protection of life, property
or natural resources, or for nursery and agricultural operations.



      3.      All permit applications for activities disturbing
more than seven hundred and fifty (750 ft 2 ) square feet of soil shall
include the appropriate review and inspection permit fee.  This review and
inspection fee shall be thirty-five ($35.00) dollars for all residential
building permits and two tenths of one cent ($0.002) per square foot of
disturbed area for all other building permits with a minimum fee of
seventy-five ($75.00) dollars.



   b.   Review and Issuance of Permit.



      1.   The City will review each permit application to determine
its conformance with the provisions of this Subchapter.  Approval indicates
that minimum requirements or intent are met and does not imply a guarantee of
performance.  Based on the review of the permit application, the City will:



         a)   Approve the permit application;



         b)   Approve the permit application subject to such
conditions as may be necessary to meet the requirements/intent of the
objectives of this Subchapter, and issue the permit subject to these
conditions; or,



         c)   Deny the permit application, indicating the
reason(s) and procedure for submitting a revised application.



      2.   The City reserves the right to inspect the site prior to
any construction activity in furtherance of the review process.



      3.   The City’s approval of the permit is for general
compliance with local requirements and the KYDOW general permit.  The
designer is ultimately responsible for the details of design of the plan,
with the property owner being responsible for implementation.



   c.   Right of Entry.  The City of Bowling Green or its designated
agent may enter the property of the applicant as deemed necessary to make
regular inspections to ensure compliance with this Subchapter.



   d.   General Requirements for Construction Site Stormwater
Management.  Requirements for the design, maintenance, and a menu of Best
Management Practices (BMPs) are located in the City of Bowling Green
Stormwater BMP Manual.  Site construction in the City shall comply with the
provisions of the BMP Manual.



21-2.04   Illicit Discharge; Applicability; Responsibility.



   a.   Illicit Discharges. Other than naturally-occurring stormwater,
no person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the MS4, or any
conveyance, any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or
hazardous materials or waters containing any pollutants or hazardous
materials that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards.  Allowable discharges that create or have the potential to create
unsafe conditions on city streets or other public rights-of-way are
prohibited.  The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal
discharge to the MS4 or any conveyance is prohibited.



   b.   Illicit Connections.  The construction, use, maintenance or
continued existence of illicit connections to the MS4 or any conveyance is
prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.  A person is considered to be in violation of this Section if
the person connects a line conveying sewage or any other pollutant or
hazardous materials to the MS4 or any conveyance or allows such a connection
to continue.



   c.   Applicability. This Section shall apply to all discharges
entering the MS4 or any conveyance generated on any developed and undeveloped
lands unless explicitly exempted by the Public Works Director or designee.



   d.   Responsibility.  The City shall administer, implement and
enforce the provisions of this Section.  The standards set forth herein and
promulgated pursuant to this Section are minimum standards; therefore, this
Section does not intend nor imply that compliance by any person will ensure
that there will be no contamination, pollution or unauthorized discharge of
pollutants or hazardous materials.



   e.   Discharge exceptions. The following discharges are exempt from
discharge prohibitions established by this Section, if such discharges do not
violate applicable water quality standards:



      1.   Water line flushing or water from other potable sources,
landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground
water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped
ground water, uncontaminated ground water infiltration, foundation or footing
drains, air conditioning condensation, springs, noncommercial washing of
vehicles, natural riparian habitat or natural wetland flows, swimming pools
(if discharged to the ground, not to a city street or directly to any part of
the MS4 or any conveyance), firefighting activities, street wash water, and
any activity related to normal performance of municipal operations such as
street sweeping. Dewatering of existing ponds requires a permit from the
KYDOW.



      2.   Discharges specified in writing by the City of Bowling
Green as being necessary to protect public health and safety.



      3.   Use of fluorescent dye in sewer infrastructure for
scientific research is allowable.



      4.   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater
discharge permitted under an National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit, waiver or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and
administered under the authority of the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) or the KYDOW, provided that the permit holder is in
full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver or order and
other applicable laws and regulations.



   f.   Suspension of MS4 access due to illicit discharges in emergency
situations.  The City may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge that presents or may present imminent danger to the
environment, to the health or welfare of people, to the MS4, or to waters of
the United States.  If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the City may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4, or waters of the United States, or to
minimize danger to people.



   g.   Suspension of MS4 access due to the detection of illicit
discharge.  Any person discharging to the MS4 or any conveyance in violation
of this Section may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge.  The City shall require the
violator to disconnect access to the MS4 at their cost or take corrective
action to eliminate the source of the illicit discharge.  A person commits a
violation if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant
to this Section without the prior approval of the City.



   h.   Industrial or construction activity discharges.  Any person
subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge
permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.  Proof of compliance
with the permit may be required in a form acceptable to the City prior to the
allowing of discharges to the MS4 or any conveyance.  However, should an
illicit discharge be detected from such activities, the City shall have the
authority to regulate the site per the provisions of this Section.



   i.   Monitoring of discharges. This Section applies to all
facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial
activity, including construction activity.



      1.    The City shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this Section as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this Section.  If a discharger has
security measures in force that require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow immediate access to representatives of the City.



      2.    Facility operators shall allow the City immediate access
to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of
an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any
additional duties as defined by state and federal law.



      3.    The City shall have the right to install on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the Public
Works Director or designee to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's discharge.



      4.    The City shall have the right to require the discharger
to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.



      5.    Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of City and shall not
be replaced.  The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
operator.



      6.    Any interference with allowing the City access to a
permitted facility is a violation of this Section. A person who is the
operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated
with industrial activity commits a violation if the person denies the City
reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any
activity authorized or required by this Section.



      7.   If the City has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which stormwater is discharged and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this Section, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this Section, or any
order issued hereunder to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, the City may seek all appropriate remedies from any
court of competent jurisdiction, including the issuance of a search warrant.



   j.    Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater
pollutants by the use of BMPs.  The City shall review and approve BMPs for
any activity, operation or facility that may cause or contribute to
pollution, discharge of hazardous materials or has the potential to
contaminate naturally occurring stormwater or waters of the United States. 
The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or any
conveyance through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. 
Further, any person responsible for a property or premise which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge may be required to implement, at such
person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants or hazardous materials to the MS4 or any
conveyance.  These BMPs shall be part of a Stormwater Pollution Prevention
Plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES
permit.



   k.    Watercourse protection. Every person owning property through
which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain
that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris,
excessive vegetation and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate or
significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition,
the owner or lessee shall maintain existing structures within or adjacent to
a watercourse so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function or physical integrity of the watercourse.



   l.     Notification of spills.  Notwithstanding other requirements
of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or
responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has
information of any known or suspected release of materials which are
resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants or hazardous
materials discharging into naturally occurring stormwater, the MS4 or any
conveyance, such person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials, such person shall immediately notify
emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch
services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, such person
shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone,
facsimile or email no later than the next business day.  Notifications in
person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed
to the City of Bowling Green within three (3) business days of the
notification given.  If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from
a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge
and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence.  Such records shall be
retained for at least three (3) years.



21-2.05   Post Construction Water Quality.



   a.   Applicability.  For construction meeting either of the
criteria herein below, review and approval of the Post Construction
Stormwater Quality Management Plan as described in the City of Bowling Green
Stormwater BMP Manual is required prior to the issuance of any permit:



      1.   Disturb more than one (1) acre, and create greater than
ten thousand square feet (10,000ft 2 ) of new impervious surfaces,
irrespective of existing impervious surfaces.



      2.    Hotspot land uses as defined below:



         a)    Automotive fueling facilities;



         b)   Automotive maintenance and repair facilities;



         c)   Restaurants with grease collection and disposal;
and,



         d)    Other land uses as determined to have a high
potential of pollutant discharge into the MS4 as determined by the City.



   b.    Review and Issuance of Permit.



      1.   For projects requiring post construction water quality,
plans shall be submitted as part of the application process (e.g. building
permit, detailed development plan or subdivision). The plans shall conform to
the design criteria set forth in the City of Bowling Green Stormwater BMP
Manual.  Based on the review of the permit application, the City will:



         a)    Approve the permit application;



         b)    Approve the permit application subject to such
conditions as may be necessary to meet the requirements/intents of the
objectives of the Subchapter, and issue the permit subject to these
conditions; or,



         c)   Deny the permit application, indicating the
reason(s) and procedure for submitting a revised application and/or
submission.



      2.    The City reserves the right to inspect the site prior to
any construction activity in furtherance of the review process.



      3.    The City’s approval of the permit is for general
compliance with local requirements and the KYDOW general permit.  The
designer is ultimately responsible for the details of design, with the
property owner being responsible for implementation.



   c.   Maintenance.  The property owner shall be responsible for all

pedestrian, to minimize traffic congestion by limiting points of conflict and
to promote the general welfare by preserving the traffic-carrying capacity of
public streets.



      2.   General Requirements for Access Control.  Requirements
for access are located in the Access Management section of the City’s
Traffic Management Manual.  Any access to a city-maintained

   b.   Traffic Impact Study.



      1.   Purpose.  In order to completely evaluate the impacts of
proposed land developments on the existing transportation network, it is
necessary to set forth Traffic Impact Study Guidelines.  The studies
conducted are designed to assist the Public Works Department and private
planners in making decisions regarding the allowance of major land use
changes or new developments.  Traffic impact studies should protect future
transportation needs, assess impact of changes in land use and suggest ways
for mitigating the adverse effects of land use changes.



      2.   General Requirements for Traffic Impact Studies. 
Requirements for traffic impact studies are located in the City’s Traffic
Management Manual.



   c.   On-Street Parking.



      1.   Purpose.  In order to preserve the primary function of
streets in the City, which is the movement of vehicles, it is important to
maintain control of the location and type of on-street parking allowed.



      2.   General Requirements.  Requirements for on-street

residential stormwater management facilities constructed and developed in
conformity with the applicable standards of the City’s Public Works
Department and City-County Planning Commission.



   b.   Applicability.  This Section shall apply to all platted lots
fronting streets not yet accepted by the City for maintenance; provided
however, it shall not apply to residential or commercial lots or developments
fronting public streets in areas incorporated into the City after the
effective date May 1, 2016 which have been constructed and approved according
to the rules and regulations of the City-County Planning Commission.



   c.   Warranties and Inspections.  All streets, roadways, stormwater
management facilities, and similar infrastructure constructed for or accepted
by the City for maintenance shall require the developer or contractor to
warranty the work for a period as specified in the City-County Planning
Commission Subdivision Regulations following the acceptance of the work by
the City.  The Public Works Director or designee shall have the right of

developer or owner and contractor in writing of deficiencies in the work
discovered during the warranty period and the developer or owner and
contractor shall remedy those deficiencies within the time specified by the
Public Works Director or designee, even if the period necessary to correct
the deficiencies occurs beyond the warranty period.  If the deficiencies are
not remedied in a timely manner and to the satisfaction of the Public Works
Director or designee, the Public Works Director or designee may cause the
deficiencies to be corrected and pursue all appropriate causes of action
against the developer or owner and contractor to recover the City’s
costs.  In addition, failure of the developer, owner or contractor to remedy
the deficiencies timely and to the City’s satisfaction may result in the
removal of the responsible party from future bidding on City projects and may
result in the refusal of the City to inspect or approve other streets,
roadways, stormwater management facilities, and similar infrastructure for
acceptance by the City constructed by the responsible party for a time period
within the sole discretion of the City.

Excavation repair failure shall be deemed as trench variation or cracking in
or immediately adjacent to the repaired area.  Trench variation of one half
inch (½”) or greater along a ten (10’) foot straightedge shall
constitute failure. Additionally, cracking within one (1’) foot outside of
the repair shall constitute failure.  Should the repair fail, the permittee
shall make necessary corrections at the direction of the Planning and Design
Division.



   b.   Should a permittee cut a recently paved street, the permittee
shall be required to repave the entire paved section.  The use of seamless,

*   Note:  Subchapter 22-4 was repealed in its entirety and replaced by

22-4.01   Findings and Intent.



   a.   The City finds that parking on public rights-of-way and other
City-controlled properties is regulated to promote traffic safety, enhance
the smooth flow of traffic, and in certain areas of high demand for parking
spaces, to fairly allocate parking spaces among the public by limiting time.



   b.   Limiting parking in business districts helps facilitate
commerce by promoting frequent turnover for conducting business-related
activities or shopping, rather than employee or any other long-term parking.



   c.   Effective enforcement of parking regulations is required to
meet the objectives of this Subchapter, and to protect the health, safety and
welfare of both drivers and pedestrians using public rights-of-way.

City-controlled properties.

during certain hours on designated streets or portions thereof, and shall
post proper signs on such streets accordingly.  The Public Works Director or
his designee is hereby authorized to determine or designate parking

safe and orderly movement of other traffic contiguous to its route or the
special event will not disrupt traffic within the City beyond practical
solution.



   b.   The conduct of the parade will not require the diversion of so
great a number of police officers of the City to properly police the line of
movement and the areas contiguous thereto as to prevent normal police
protection to the City or that the special event will not require the
diversion of so many public employees that allowing the event would
unreasonably deny service to the remainder of the City.



   c.   The conduct of the parade will not require the diversion of so
great a number of ambulances as to prevent normal ambulance service to
portions of the City other than that to be occupied by the proposed line of
march and areas contiguous thereto.



   d.   The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at assembly
points of the parade will not unduly interfere with proper fire and police
protection of, or ambulance service to, areas contiguous to such assembly
areas.



   e.   The conduct of the parade or special event will not interfere
with the movement of fire-fighting equipment enroute to a fire or will not
interfere with access to fire stations and fire hydrants.



   f.   The parade is scheduled to move from its point of origin to its
point of termination expeditiously and without unreasonable delays enroute.



   g.   The parade is not to be held for the sole purpose of
advertising any product, goods or event, and is not designated to be held
purely for private profit.

hardship to adjacent businesses or residents.



   i.   There are no other parade or special event permit applications
for the same time and location that have been or will be granted.



   j.   There are no other parade or special event permit applications
that have been or will be granted for other locations that would reduce
police resources, in combination with the second application, to such an
extent that the welfare and safety of persons and property would be adversely
affected.



   k.   The application contains incomplete or false information or the
applicant fails to comply with the terms of this Subchapter.

right to a hearing before the Code Enforcement Board and the determination
that a violation was committed shall be final;



      9.   The procedure for the person to follow in order to
respond to the citation or to contest the citation; and,



      10.   A statement that a parking violation may result in

22-6.04   Hearing.



   a.   Any person cited for a parking violation may contest the
determination that a violation occurred by requesting in writing a hearing
before the City of Bowling Green Code Enforcement Board.  The request for a
hearing shall be delivered to the Code Enforcement Board addressed to City
Hall within the required fourteen (14) day time limit from the date of
issuance of the parking citation.  When a hearing has been requested, the
Board shall schedule a hearing for the next regular meeting of the Board that
will permit adequate notification to be made to all parties.  Not less than
seven (7) days before the date of the hearing, the Board shall notify the
requester of the date, time and place of the hearing.  The notice may be
given by certified mail, return receipt requested; by personal delivery; or
by leaving the notice at the person’s usual place of residence with any
individual residing therein who is eighteen (18) years of age or older and
who is informed of the contents of the notice.  Any person requesting a
hearing who fails to appear at the time and place set for the hearing shall
be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing to contest the citation and
shall be deemed to have refused to pay the fine levied by the citation.  The
Board shall enter a final order determining the violation was committed and
shall impose the appropriate civil penalty.  A copy of the order shall be
served on the violator.



   b.   At the hearing after consideration of the evidence, the Board
shall determine whether a violation was committed.  Where it is not
established that the violation was committed, an order dismissing the
citation shall be entered.  Where it is established that a violation was
committed, the Board shall uphold the citation and order the owner to pay the
citation within fourteen (14) days from the date of the written order of the
Board.  A copy of such order shall be furnished to the owner.  Any person
ordered to pay the fine who fails to do so within fourteen (14) days shall be
deemed to have refused to pay the fine levied by the citation and a $15.00
late fee and all costs incurred by the City in collecting the civil penalty
shall be added to the original fine amount.



   c.   The Board may consider the parking citation and any other
written report made under oath by the officer who issued the citation in lieu
of the officer’s personal appearance at the hearing.  All other testimony
shall be taken under oath and recorded.  Formal rules of evidence shall not
apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the
proceedings.



   d.   An appeal from the Board’s determination may be made to the
Warren District Court within seven (7) days of the Board’s written order. 
The appeal shall be initiated by the filing of a complaint and a copy of the
Board’s order in the same manner as any civil action under the Kentucky
Rules of Civil Procedure and as set out in the applicable State statutes. 
If no appeal of the final order of the Board is filed within the time
allowed, the Board’s order shall be deemed final for all purposes.

22-6.05   Vehicle Impoundment or Immobilization without Notice.



   A vehicle may be impounded or vehicle immobilization equipment may be
used without giving prior notice to its owner under the following
circumstances:



   a.   The vehicle is impeding or likely to impede the normal flow of
vehicular or pedestrian traffic;



   b.   The vehicle poses an immediate danger to the public safety;



   c.   The vehicle is illegally parked within ten (10) feet of a fire
hydrant;



   d.   The vehicle, without a valid designated plate or placard issued
under State law, is parked in a space clearly marked and designated for use
by disabled persons;



   e.   A police officer reasonably believes that the vehicle is stolen;



   f.   A police officer reasonably believes that the vehicle or its
contents constitute evidence of an offense and such impoundment or
immobilization is reasonably necessary to obtain or preserve such evidence;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall be construed to
authorize seizure of a vehicle without a warrant where a warrant would
otherwise be required;



   g.   The vehicle is parked in a public right-of-way or on other
publicly owned or controlled property in violation of any law, ordinance or
regulation, and there are three (3) or more outstanding parking citations
issued against the vehicle that have not been responded to, appealed to the
Code Enforcement Board or paid, or none of the final orders of the Code
Enforcement Board have been appealed to Warren District Court;



   h.   The vehicle is abandoned or is a junk vehicle; or,



   i.   The vehicle is parked, stopped or standing upon a street or
public way in violation of any City ordinance or State statute at the time
the citation is issued.

22-6.06   Redemption of Impounded or Immobilized Vehicles.



   Vehicles impounded or immobilized by the City shall be redeemed only
under the following circumstances:



   a.   Only the registered owner or other person entitled to
possession based on proof of ownership or right to possession may redeem an
impounded or immobilized vehicle.  A person redeeming an impounded or
immobilized vehicle must produce a valid driver’s license.  A vehicle
impounded or immobilized for reasons of unpaid parking citations can only be
released upon proof that all penalties, fines or forfeitures currently owed
by the registered owner have been satisfied by full payment.



   b.   Any person redeeming a vehicle impounded by the City shall pay
the towing contractor for costs of towing and impoundment prior to redeeming
the vehicle.  Any person redeeming a vehicle immobilized by the City shall
pay a removal fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) prior to having the
immobilization equipment removed.  Any vehicle that has had immobilization
equipment installed that has not been claimed within three (3) days shall be
towed.



   c.   The owner or other person entitled to possession of a vehicle
which has been impounded or immobilized may challenge the validity of such
impoundment or immobilization by requesting in writing a hearing before the
Code Enforcement Board.  The City shall retain possession of the vehicle
pending the hearing unless the owner or other person claiming right of
possession posts a bond or other security in a form satisfactory to the City
and in an amount equal to the fines and fees accrued as of the date of the
hearing request or seventy-five dollars ($75.00), whichever is less.



   d.   The hearing shall be conducted within ten (10) business days of
the date of the request unless the owner or other person entitled to
possession waives the limitation or the City shows good cause for such
delay.  If the owner or person claiming possession is unable to pay the
amount of the bond, the hearing shall be held within seventy-two (72) hours
of the date of the request for hearing is received, unless such person
requests or agrees to a continuance.  No less than five (5) days prior to
the date set for hearing, the Board shall notify the person requesting the
hearing of the date, time and place of the hearing.  In the case of a
hearing required to be held within seventy-two (72) hours, the person
requesting the hearing shall be informed at the time of his request or as
soon thereafter as is practicable of the date and time of the hearing.  Any
person requesting a hearing who refuses or, except for good cause, fails to
appear at the time and place set for the hearing shall be deemed to have
conceded on his and the owner’s behalf the validity of the impoundment or
immobilization.



   e.   At the hearing after consideration of the evidence, the Board
shall determine whether the impoundment or immobilization was valid and
reasonable.  Where it is not established that the impoundment or
immobilization was justified, an order releasing the vehicle shall be
entered.  All fines and fees paid or amounts posted as bond because of the
impoundment or immobilization shall be returned.  Where it is established
that the impoundment or immobilization was justified, the Board shall uphold
the impoundment or immobilization and condition the release of the vehicle
upon the payment of all fines and fees accruing thereto.  If bond has been
posted as security for release of the vehicle, the bond shall be forfeited to
the City.  Any fines or fees in excess of the amount of the bond posted
shall be ordered to be paid by the owner of the vehicle to the City.  A copy
of such order shall be furnished to the owner or person appearing on behalf
of the owner.  The Board may consider the parking citation and any other
written report made under oath by the officer who issued the citation in lieu
of the officer’s personal appearance at the hearing.



   f.   An appeal from the Board’s determination may be made to the
Warren District Court within seven (7) days of the Board’s written order. 
The appeal shall be initiated by the filing of a complaint and a copy of the
Board’s order in the same manner as any civil action under the Rules of
Civil Procedure.  If the Court finds that the impoundment or immobilization
was justified, the owner shall be ordered to pay to the City all fines, fees
and penalties occurring as of the date of the judgment.



   g.   The City shall possess a lien on a vehicle impounded for all
fines, penalties and fees imposed thereon.  Such lien shall be superior to
and have priority over all other liens except the towing company for its
towing charges and any person who claims a security interest on the
vehicle.  All vehicles towed at the request of the City for violations of
this Chapter shall be towed by companies approved by the City and stored at
the location of the towing company. 



   h.   If within ten (10) business days of impoundment a vehicle has
not been claimed or a hearing has not been requested, a notice shall be
mailed by certified mail to the registered owner, if known, and lienholders
of record, affording such parties the right within ten (10) days from the
date of the notice to claim the vehicle or request a hearing.  The notice
shall state that, if no hearing is requested, the vehicle shall be deemed
abandoned unless the charges thereon are paid within forty-five (45) days of
receipt of the notice.  After forty-five (45) days from the date of the
receipt of the notice, the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and the vehicle
escheat to the City.  If the vehicle is judged suitable for use, the City
may obtain a certificate of registration and ownership from the Warren County
Clerk pursuant to KRS 186.020 and either use the vehicle for governmental
purposes or sell the vehicle at public auction to the highest bidder.  If
the vehicle is not suitable for use, it may be sold for its scrap or junk
value.  Nothing in these provisions shall otherwise affect the rights or
obligations between the owner of the motor vehicle and those persons who
claim a security interest therein.

   c.   “Special District” shall mean service areas designated by
BGMU and approved by the Board of Commissioners.  Special Districts
generally include those areas and customers served by BGMU-owned and
maintained infrastructure outside of the city limits of the City of Bowling
Green, Kentucky.  In addition, Special Districts include wastewater services
for the 74-acre tract of annexed property served by BGMU and formerly known
as the Cooksey Farm on Lovers Lane.  Future designations of Special
Districts and the applicable rates applied to them will be determined on a
case-by-case basis at the discretion of BGMU and subject to Board of
Commissioners approval.



   d.   A credit or discount against the basic monthly water and sewer
rates of 10% of such basic rates shall be allowed to residential customers
with respect to the first seven hundred cubic feet (7 ccf) of water and/or
sewer used in any month where the aggregate income of the customer and all
other members of the household is less than twenty-two thousand dollars
($22,000) per year.  No such discounts shall be allowed unless the customer
has made written application therefore and has furnished to Bowling Green
Municipal Utilities such information as it may require under regulations
adopted by it.



   e.   The Bowling Green Municipal Utilities Board may adjust the
rates and charges each year to reflect any increase in the operation and
maintenance expenses of the combined and consolidated municipal water and
sewer utility.  An Annual Cost Adjustment will be determined by the Bowling
Green Municipal Utilities Board with any such increase not to exceed the
percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)
for the twelve (12) month period ending December 31st of the most recently
audited fiscal year of Bowling Green Municipal Utilities over the previous
twelve (12) month period ending December 31st.  To the extent that any
Annual Cost Adjustment determined by the Bowling Green Municipal Utilities
Board is less than the maximum allowed, then any such difference may not be
added to any future Annual Cost Adjustment.  In no event shall the Annual
Cost Adjustment in any year be negative.



      1.   The Consumer Price Index that shall be utilized for this
purpose shall be the “Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U),
U.S. City Average published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau
of Labor Statistics, Washington, D.C. 20212.”



      2.   The Annual Cost Adjustment adopted and approved by the
Bowling Green Municipal Utilities Board will be applied to the existing water
and sewer rates in effect.



   Bowling Green Municipal Utilities will file with the Office of City
Clerk any new water and sewer rates resulting from any adopted and approved
Annual Cost Adjustment no later than two (2) weeks prior to the date in which
the new rates will be effective.

23-2.01   Purpose.



   a.   The purpose of this Subchapter shall be to provide for the
proper operation and administration of the electric system and the water and
sewer systems of the City in a business-like manner, free from political
involvements and influence in order that the most efficient services may be
rendered in a fair and equitable manner to all citizens of the City at the
lowest possible rates consistent with good business practice and the general
welfare of the people.



   b.   The Board of Commissioners hereby reaffirms its declaration,
desire and intention to accept and operate the City electric distribution
plant and system acquired under an agreement between the Tennessee Valley
Authority, the City of Bowling Green and others, dated May 13, 1942, under
the provisions of KRS 96.550 through 96.900 and does hereby accept and agree
to all the provisions of the act which are hereby incorporated herein and
made a part hereof. 



(Ord. BG80-63, S27-16, 7/15/80)



23-2.02   Creation and Responsibility of Bowling Green Municipal Utilities
Board and Disposition of Surplus Funds.



   a.   Pursuant to KRS 96.550-96.900, 96.350-96.510 and the
declaratory judgment entered by Warren Circuit Court, Division II, in Civil
Action No. 18099 on 3 March 1976, there is hereby created the Bowling Green
Municipal Utilities Board (hereinafter “Board”) by merging into it all of
the authority and responsibilities heretofore delegated to the former
Electric Plant Board and the Water and Sewer Commission.



   b.   The Board shall be responsible for the acquisition,
administration, maintenance and operation of all of the City’s electric,
water and sewer plants and facilities and shall have three (3) separate and
distinct divisions:



      1.   The Electric Division shall administer and operate the
City’s electric system and shall separately account for all funds,
deposits, operations and maintenance of the electric system.  After the
establishment of proper reserves, any surplus of proceeds shall be devoted
solely to the reduction of electric rates.



      2.   The Water and Sewer Division shall administer and operate
the City’s consolidated water works and sewer system as two (2) separate
and distinct utilities and shall separately account for all funds, deposits,
operations and maintenance of each utility.  After the establishment of
proper reserves, any surplus of proceeds shall be devoted solely to the
reduction of water and sewer rates.



      3.   The General Services Division shall engage in such
activities and operate such facilities as will be beneficial to the general
welfare of the citizens of the City, which activities shall be approved by
the Board of Commissioners. After the establishment of proper reserves, any
surplus of proceeds shall be devoted to the reduction of rates, in such
amounts and among such divisions as the Board determines.



   c.   So long as any revenue bonds regarding either the electric
division or the water and sewer division remain outstanding all revenues and
expenses of the three (3) separate divisions shall be segregated and all
credits and funds belonging to each division shall be devoted exclusively to
the payment of debt service, capital improvements and operating expenses of
that division.  Any expenditures incurred for the benefit of the divisions
shall be apportioned on the basis of standard accounting procedures and rates
charged to consumers for the furnishing of the three (3) utilities shall be
established in such a manner that will protect both present and future
bondholders and insure the integrity of both the electric division and the
consolidated water and sewer division to the same extent that they would have
been protected had their merger not been accomplished.



   d.   All assets and properties of every nature heretofore owned by
or titled in the name of either the Electric Plant Board or the Water and
Sewer Commission shall henceforth be owned by and titled in the name of the
Bowling Green Municipal Utilities Board, and the Chairman of the Board is
authorized to execute and deliver on behalf of either the Electric Plant
Board or the Water and Sewer Commission any deed, bill of sale, assignment or
other instrument necessary to properly effect and evidence this change in
ownership.

(4) years.  At the conclusion or termination of the term of each member,
that member may be reappointed to one additional term by the Mayor with the
approval of the Board of Commissioners.  If that member is not reappointed,
a new member shall be appointed by the Mayor with the approval of the Board
of Commissioners. Each new member appointed and any member reappointed shall
serve for a term of four (4) years.  In no case shall any regular member
serve more than eight (8) consecutive years on the Board.  If any member
resigns or, for any reason, ceases to be a member before the expiration of
his term, the Mayor with the approval of the Board of Commissioners shall
appoint a new member to serve for such member’s unexpired term, pursuant to
KRS 96.760.  The four (4) regular members of the Board shall be residents of
the City and shall have resided in the City for not less than one (1) year
preceding the date of the appointment and shall be a citizen, taxpayer and
legal voter of the City and otherwise qualified pursuant to KRS 96.740. 



   c.   The fifth member shall be one of the members of the Board of
Commissioners or the City Manager as designated by the Mayor with the

That member may be reappointed to the Board by the Mayor with approval of the
Board of Commissioners as long as he remains in office.



   d.   The salaries for the four (4) regular members of the Board
shall be determined by the Board not to exceed the amount provided for by KRS
96.750; provided, however, the fifth or the ex officio member from the Board
of Commissioners or City Manager shall be paid no salary as a member of this
Board.  Any salaries shall be paid by the Board from allowable operating
revenues generated by Bowling Green Municipal Utilities. 



   e.   No person shall be appointed as a member of the Board who has,
within the last two (2) years next before his appointment, held any public
office, or who is related within the third degree to the Mayor or any member
of the Board of Commissioners of the City, pursuant to KRS 96.740.



   f.   No person shall be appointed a member of the Board who is at
the time of his appointment indebted either directly or indirectly to the
City or who is a surety on the official bond of any official of the City,
pursuant to KRS 96.740.



   g.   If at any time during his term of office a regular member of
the Board becomes a candidate for or is elected or appointed to any public
office, he shall automatically vacate his membership on the Board and another
person shall be appointed in his place, pursuant to KRS 96.740.



   h.   The members of the Board shall each give bond for the faithful
performance of his duties in the sum of five thousand ($5,000.00) dollars,
with surety, to be approved by the Board of Commissioners. The cost of such
bonds shall be paid equally from the revenue of the electric system and water
and sewer system.

each member in advance of the meeting; stating the time and purpose of the
meeting pursuant to KRS 96.770.

23-2.06   Employees’ Bond.



   The Board shall require all its agents and employees, who may collect

23-2.07   Removal of Members.



   Any regular member of the Board may be removed from office for cause,
inefficiency, neglect of duty, misfeasance, nonfeasance or malfeasance in
office. Charges for removal of any member may be preferred by the Mayor, any
member of the Board of Commissioners or by any citizen of the City.  When
charges are preferred against any member, notice shall be served upon the
member of the time and place of the hearing on such charges and the hearing
shall be held by the Board of Commissioners not less than three (3) days nor
more than ten (10) days after the service of such notice upon the member. 
All rules of evidence recognized by courts of the State shall be observed in
the hearing on such charges.  A verdict shall be rendered by a majority of
the members of the Board of Commissioners voting thereon.  There shall be no
appeal from the decision of the Board of Commissioners on such hearing.  The
members appointed pursuant to this Chapter shall accept the provisions of
same and the rules set forth herein shall govern.

23-2.08   Political Activities Prohibited by Members and Employees.



   No member of the Board shall use his office for political purposes, nor
attempt to exercise political influence on any employee of the Board or

23-3.05   Prohibitions and Limitations on Use of the Public Sanitary
Sewers.



   This Section establishes limitations and prohibitions on the quantity
and quality of wastewater which may be lawfully discharged into the publicly
owned treatment works.  Pretreat-ment of some wastewater discharges may be
required to achieve the goals established by this Subsection, the Clean Water
Act, or applicable Federal Categorical Pretreatment standards.  The specific
prohibitions and limitations contained in this Section are subject to change
when necessary to enable the General Manager to provide efficient wastewater
treatment, protect the public health and environment, and to enable BGMU to
meet requirements contained in its NPDES permit.



   The ultimate goal to be achieved by adherence to this Section is to
protect the ability of BGMU’s wastewater treatment plant to provide a
satisfactory effluent and the creation of a sludge residue that may be
disposed of in the approved method, without violating any applicable law or
regulation.



   a.   It shall be the duty of the General Manager to monitor the
treatment works influent for elements which may adversely affect the
treatment plant’s biological processes and sludge disposal method.  Should
the influent at the treatment plant reach or exceed the levels established by
this Subchapter, the General Manager shall initiate technical studies to
determine the cause of the influent violation and shall recommend to the
Board such remedial measures as may be considered necessary, including but
not limited to the establishment of new or revised pretreatment levels for
the elements causing the violation.



   b.   The General Manager shall also recommend to the City through
the Board of Commissioners such changes in the discharge standards as may be
necessary in the event the waste-water treatment plant effluent standards are
changed or should there be changes in any applicable law or regulation
affecting the effluent standards or in the event changes are needed for a
more efficient operation of the wastewater treatment plant.



   c.   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any
substances, materials, waters, or wastes to any public sewer if it appears
likely in the opinion of the General Manager that such waste may harm the
sewers, wastewater treatment process or equipment or may adversely affect the
receiving stream, or may otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or
constitute a nuisance.  In forming an opinion as to the acceptability of
these wastes, the General Manager shall give consideration to such factors as
the quantities of the subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in
the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the wastewater
treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the wastewater treatment
plant, and such other factors as may be deemed appropriate in the opinion of
the General Manager.



   d.   No person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break,
damage, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or
equipment which is a part of the waste water system.



   e.   Prohibitions on Wastewater Discharges.  No person shall
discharge or deposit or cause or allow to be discharged or deposited into the
wastewater system any wastewater which contains the following:



      1.   Oils and Grease.



         (a)   Oil and grease concentrations or amounts from
users violating Federal, State or City pretreatment standards set forth in
paragraph e.1.(b) of this Section.



         (b)   Industrial wastewater shall not exceed total oil
and grease concentration of three hundred ninety (390 mg/l) milligrams per
liter, whether emulsified or not, or containing substances which may solidify
or become viscous at temperatures between thirty-two (32) degrees and one
hundred fifty (150) degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees to 65 degrees Celsius) at
the point of discharge into the system. Hydrocarbon origin oil and grease
concentration shall not exceed fifty (50 mg/1) milligrams per liter.



         (c)   All FSEs are required to comply with BGMU Fats,
Oils and Grease (FOG) Management Policy (see Section 23-3.05(h)).



      2.   Explosive Mixtures.  Liquids, solids or gases which by
reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or
by interaction with other substances to cause fires or explosion or be
injurious in any other way to the wastewater system or to the operation of
the system.  Specifically prohibited are substances which exhibit a
closed-cup flashpoint of less than one hundred forty (140) degrees
Fahrenheit.  At no time shall two (2) successive readings at two (2) hour
intervals on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the
wastewater system, be more than five (5%) percent nor any single reading over
ten (10%) percent of the Lower Explosive Limit (L.E.L.) of the meter. 
Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to: gasoline, kerosene,
naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes,
peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and
sulfides.  TTO (accumulative) concentrations shall not exceed two and
thirteen hundredths (2.13 mg/1) milligrams per liter.



      3.   Noxious Material.  Noxious or malodorous solids, liquids
or gases, which either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are
capable of creating a public nuisance or hazard to life, or are or may be
sufficient to prevent entry into the wastewater system for its operation,
maintenance and repair.



      4.   Improperly Shredded Garbage and Ground Paper Products. 
Garbage that has not been ground or comminuted to such a degree that all
particles will be carried freely in suspension under flow conditions normally
prevailing in the public sanitary sewer, with no particle greater than
one-half (1/2”) inch in any dimension.



      5.   Radioactive Wastes.  Radioactive wastes or isotopes of
such half-life or concentration that they do not comply with regulations or
orders issued by the appropriate authority having control over their use and
which will or may cause damage or hazards to the wastewater system or
personnel operating the system.



      6.   Solid or Viscous Wastes.  Solid or viscous wastes which
will or may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer, or otherwise interfere
with the proper operation of the wastewater system.  Prohibited materials
include, but are not limited to: grease, uncomminuted garbage, animal guts or
tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or flashings entrails, whole
blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust,
metal, mud, glass, straw shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent
hops, waste paper, wood, plastics, tar, asphalt residues, residues from
refining or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, and similar substances.



      7.   Excessive Discharge Rate.  Wastewaters at a flow rate
that exceed for any time period longer than fifteen (15) minutes more than
five (5) times the user’s average process flow during normal operation or
that would cause interference with the wastewater system. Users are required
to incorporate hydraulic slug control into the BMP for each facility.  BGMU
shall evaluate the slug control plan within one (1) year of the user’s
designation as a Significant Industrial User. This Sewer Use Ordinance stands
as authority to enforce these slug control requirements. 



      8.   Toxic Substances.  Any toxic substance in amounts
exceeding standards promulgated by the Administrator of the United States
Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act, and
chemical elements or compounds, phenols or other taste or odor producing
substances, or any other substances which are not susceptible to treatment or
which may cause interference with the biological processes or efficiency of
the wastewater treatment plant, or that will “pass-through” the system as
defined in Section 23-3.01.



      9.   Unpolluted Waters.  Any unpolluted water including, but
not limited to water from cooling systems or of storm water origin, which
will increase the hydraulic load on the wastewater system.



      10.   Discolored Material.  Wastes with objectionable color
producing interference with, or not removable by the treatment process of the
wastewater treatment plant.



      11.   Corrosive Wastes.  Any waste which will cause corrosion
or deterioration of the wastewater system.  All wastes discharged to the
wastewater system must have a pH value in the range of six (6) to eleven (11)
standard units.  Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to:
acids, concentrated sulfides, chlorides and fluoride compounds, and
substances which will react with water to form acidic products.



      12.   Heat.  Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological
activity in the wastewater system resulting in interference, but in no case
heat in such quantities that the temperature at the wastewater treatment
plant exceeds forty (40) degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) unless BGMU
approves alternate temperature limits.



      13.   Hazardous Waste.  Any waste or wastewater classified as
a hazardous waste by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
without at least a sixty (60) day prior notification of such discharge to the
General Manager of BGMU.  This notification must include the name of the
waste, EPA hazardous waste number, type of discharge, volume/mass of
discharge and time of occurrence.  The General Manager may deny or condition
this discharge at any time.



   f.   Limitations on Wastewater Discharges.  No person shall
discharge or convey, or permit or allow to be discharged or conveyed to the
public sanitary sewer any wastewater containing pollutants of such character
or quantity that will:



      1.   Not be susceptible to treatment, cause interference with
the process or efficiency of the wastewater treatment system or pass through
the treatment plant to the receiving stream.

written letter of approval from the General Manager prior to batch
discharge.  Unless otherwise allowed under the terms and conditions of the
permit, a separate permit must be secured for each location of discharge. 
This permit shall include the time of day the discharge is to occur, the
volume of discharge, and shall limit the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of the discharge.  Such user shall pay any applicable
charges or fees therefore, and shall comply with the conditions of the permit
issued by the General Manager.  No permit, however, will be required to
discharge domestic wastewater from a recreational vehicle holding tank
providing such discharge is made into an approved facility designed to
receive such wastewater.



      3.   All grease pumpers/haulers shall meet grease waste
pumping, record keeping, and other requirements of the BGMU FOG Management
Policy.



   h.   Fats, Oil, Grease (and Sand) Interceptors and Traps.



      1.   All FSEs are required to comply with BGMU FOG Management
Policy.  Grease interceptors must be approved, designed, installed and
maintained in accordance with the BGMU standards as set forth in BGMU FOG
Management Policy.  Failure to meet the requirements of the BGMU FOG
Management Policy will result in enforcement action, which may include fines,
penalties and compliance schedule requirements.  If BGMU employees are
required to remediate and/or to clean out the wastewater collection lines as
a result of a partial blockage or stoppage due to a defective or clogged
grease interceptor or grease trap, the property owner and/or user shall be
further required to pay the costs of BGMU labor and materials required to
clean out the wastewater lines.



      2.   All existing FSEs shall be required to submit plans and
install a grease interceptor in accordance with the BGMU FOG Management
Policy within ninety (90) days after notification by BGMU, at the owner’s
expense, if and when BGMU determines that a potential fats, oils and grease
problem exists which is capable of causing interference, damage or
operational problems to structures or equipment in the wastewater system. 
BGMU shall retain the right to inspect and approve installation of the grease
interceptor at the FSE.



      3.   The type, capacity, configuration and components of all
grease control equipment (interceptors or traps) shall be in accordance with
the BGMU FOG Management Policy.  Grease control equipment shall be approved
by the Health Officer, the Plumbing Inspector and a BGMU representative, and
shall be located so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection.  They shall be constructed of impervious materials capable of
withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperatures and shall be of
substantial construction, gastight, watertight and equipped with easily
removable covers.  BGMU approval of grease control equipment shall be given
prior to Health Department transmittal of general facility plumbing plans to
Frankfort for State approval.



      4.   Any FSE upgrading an existing FSE, or a FSE which
experiences a change of ownership, whether by sale of substantially all of
the assets, or by transfer of stock, ownership units, partnership interests
or otherwise, or for all other FSEs effective June 1, 2019, shall be required
to install and maintain a grease interceptor in accordance with the BGMU FOG
Management Policy.



      5.   All FOG and sand interceptors and traps shall be
maintained in continuously efficient operation at all times at the expense of
the user.  Grease interceptor and grease trap maintenance requirements are
provided in the BGMU FOG Management Policy.



      6.   New multi-unit facilities (strip malls, strip centers,
etc.) shall install grease interceptors in accordance with the BGMU FOG
Management Policy.  New multi-unit facilities must have two (2) separate
wastewater line connections at each unit within the multi-unit facility. 
One (1) wastewater line will be for sanitary wastewater and one (1)
wastewater line will be for the kitchen area, or potential kitchen area, of
each unit.  New multi-unit facility owners shall contact BGMU prior to
conducting private plumbing work at the multi-unit facility site.



      7.   Approval of proposed facilities or equipment by the
Health Officer or BGMU does not, in any way, guarantee that these facilities
or equipment will function in the manner described by their constructor or
manufacturer; nor shall it relieve a person of the responsibility of
enlarging or otherwise modifying such facilities to accomplish the intended
purpose.



   i.   Surcharges.



      1.   There will be a surcharge for high strength wastewater
for either high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5 ) or high chemical oxygen
demand (COD), but not both simultaneously. There will also be surcharges for
high total suspended solids (TSS), high ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N), high
non-hydrocarbon oil and grease (O&G non-hydro) and high total phosphorus
(T-P) in industrial wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer system.
Industrial wastewater that exceeds the following thresholds shall be subject
to surcharge:



 

Constituents
 
Threshold mg/1


BOD5
 
300


COD
 
450


TSS
 
300


NH3-N
 
25


O&G non-hydrocarbon
 
50


T-P
 
10



 



      2.   Sewer surcharges shall be based upon the average of the
analysis of at least two (2) samples taken during any one (1) month or
quarter and shall remain in effect until the next analysis is conducted. 
One sample may be used if the industrial user’s production or sampling
frequency does not allow for a second sample.



      3.     Each constituent has respective surcharge rates that
reflect the cost of additional treatment. These rates are based on the latest
BGMU surcharge evaluation.



   Surcharge Formula:



         (Average Pollutant Concentration, mg/l) x (Flow, MGD) x
(8.34) = Pollutant Discharged, lbs.



         (Pollutant Discharged, lbs) x (Surcharge Rate) = Total
Surcharge Amount



      4.   Sewer surcharges will be billed with the regular sewer
service bill and the General Manager shall have such remedies for the
collection of such costs for the collection of sewer service charges.  No
reduction in sewer service charges, fees or taxes shall be permitted because
of the fact that certain wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer contain
less than the maximum allowable concentration or threshold as defined above.



   j.    Dilution of Wastewater.  No user shall ever increase the use
of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the
limitations contained in the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or
for any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by BGMU or the
Commonwealth of Kentucky.

Ord. BG2017-22, 6/6/2017)



23-3.06   Control of Prohibited Wastes.



   a.   Regulatory Actions.  If wastewaters containing any substances
described in Section 23-3.05 or 23-3.07 are discharged or proposed to be
discharged into the wastewater system of BGMU or to any wastewater system
tributary thereto, the General Manager may take any action necessary to:



      1.   Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater.



      2.   Require a discharger to demonstrate that in-plant
modifications will reduce or eliminate the discharge of such substances in
conformity with this Section.



      3.   Require pretreatment, including storage, facilities or
flow equalization necessary to reduce or eliminate the objectionable
characteristics or substances so that the discharge will not violate this
Section.



      4.   Require the person making, causing or allowing the
discharge to pay any additional cost or expense incurred by BGMU for handling
and treating excess loads imposed on the wastewater system.



      5.   Take such other remedial action as may be deemed to be
desirable or necessary to achieve the purpose of this Subchapter.



   b.   Compliance Schedule.  Where pretreatment is required to meet
the requirements of this Subchapter, the Significant Industrial User shall
submit the shortest schedule by which such additional pretreatment will be
provided.  The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the
compliance date established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
for the applicable Pretreatment Standard or applicable National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard.



   c.   Submission of Plans.  Where pretreatment or equalization of
wastewater flows prior to discharge into any part of the wastewater system is
required, plans, specifications and other pertinent data or information
relating to such pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall first be
submitted to the General Manager for review and approval.  Such approval
shall not exempt the discharge or such facilities from compliance with any
applicable code, ordinance, rule, regulation or order of any governmental
authority.  Any subsequent alterations or additions to such pretreatment or
flow-control facilities shall not be made without due notice to and prior
approval of the General Manager



   d.   Pretreatment Facilities Operations.  If pretreatment or
control of waste flows is required, such facilities shall be maintained in
good working order and operated as efficiently as possible by the owner or
operator at their own cost and expense, subject to the requirements of this
Subchapter and all other applicable codes, ordinances and laws.  By-passing
of pretreatment systems is prohibited as per 40 CFR 403.17.



   e.   Admission to Property.  Whenever it shall be necessary for the
purposes of this Subchapter, the General Manager, upon the presentation of
credentials, may enter upon any property or premises at reasonable times for
the purpose of:



      1.   Copying any records required to be kept under the
provisions of this Chapter,



      2.   Inspecting any monitoring equipment or method, or any
pretreatment facilities, and



      3.   Sampling any discharge of wastewater to the wastewater
system.  The General Manager may enter upon the property at any hour under
emergency circumstances.



   f.   Protection from Accidental Discharge.  Each Significant
Industrial User shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this Subchapter. 
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the owner’s or operator’s own cost and
expense.  Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be submitted to the General Manager for review,
and shall be approved before construction of the facility.  Review and
approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the
Significant Industrial User from the responsibility to modify the facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this Subchapter.



   g.   Reporting of Possible or Actual Accidental or Intentional
Discharge.  If for any reason a facility sustains or suspects it may have
sustained an accidental or intentional sludge discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes regulated by this Section, the facility responsible
for such discharge shall cease or contain such discharge immediately, and
immediately notify the General Manager so that corrective action may be taken
to protect the wastewater system.  In addition, a written report addressed
to the General Manager detailing the date, time and cause of the accidental
discharge, the quantity and characteristics of the discharge, and corrective
action taken to prevent future discharges shall be filed by the responsible
facility within five (5) days of the occurrence of the noncomplying
discharge.

BG2017-22, 6/6/2017)



23-3.07   Significant Industrial Users:  Reporting and Monitoring.



   a.   Reports.



      1.   Every Significant Industrial User who discharges into the
public sanitary sewer or employs processes which generate any substances
suspected of having an adverse impact  on the wastewater system shall file a
periodic Discharge Report at such intervals as may be designated by the
General Manager.  The General Manager may require any other users
discharging or proposing to discharge into the wastewater system to file such
periodic reports.



      2.   The Discharge Report shall include, but, in the
discretion of the General Manager, shall not be limited to: nature of
process, volume, rates of flow, mass emission rate, production quantities,
hours of operation, concentrations of controlled pollutants, or other
information which relates to the genera-tion of waste.  Such reports may
also include the chemical constituents and quantity of liquid materials
stored on site even though they are not normally discharged.  In addition to
Discharge Reports, the General Manager may require information in the form of
self-monitoring reports.



      3.   Within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the
effective date of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, all
Significant Industrial Users subject to such Standards and currently
discharging or scheduled to discharge to the wastewater system shall be
required to submit to the General Manager a report containing the information
required in Section 403.12(b) of the Regulations and the compliance schedules
and reports required in Sections 403.12(c), (d) and (c) of the Regulations.



      4.   Reports submitted to the General Manager must be signed
by an authorized representative of the Significant Industrial User.  An
authorized representative may be (a) a Principal executive officer of at
least the level of vice president, if the Significant Industrial User is a
corporation, (b) a general partner or proprietor, if the Significant
Industrial User is a partnership or sole proprietorship, or (c) a duly
authorized representative of any of the above individuals, if such
representative is responsible for the overall operation of the facility from
which the discharge originates.



      5.   All sampling analysis done in accordance with U.S. EPA
procedures by the Significant Industrial User during a reporting period shall
be submitted to the General Manager, regardless of whether or not that
analysis was required by the user’s discharge permit.



      6.   The Significant Industrial User must receive the approval
of the General Manager before changing the sampling point and/or monitoring
facilities to be used in all required sampling.



      7.   All Significant Industrial Users must notify the General
Manager within twenty-four (24) hours of first becoming aware of a permit
violation through self-monitoring. This notification shall include the date
of violation, the parameter violated and the amount in exceedance. Within ten
(10) days of first becoming aware of this violation, Significant Industrial
User must re-sample for the parameter(s) violated and submit this sample
results to BGMU.



      8.   All Significant Industrial Users shall report any change
of discharge volume or pollutant concentration.



   b.   Records and Monitoring.



      1.   All Significant Industrial Users who discharge or propose
to discharge wastewaters to the wastewater system shall maintain such records
of production and related factors, effluent flows, and pollutant amounts or
concentrations as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the
requirements of this Subchapter and any applicable State or Federal
pretreatment standards or requirements. These records shall also include the
date, exact place, method and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s)
taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the
analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such
analyses.  These records shall remain available for a period of at least
three (3) years.  This period shall be automatically extended for the
duration of any litigation concerning the User or BGMU, or where the User has
been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the General
Manager.



      2.   Such records shall be made available upon request by the
General Manager.  All such records relating to compliance with pretreatment
standards shall be made available to officials of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the Commonwealth of Kentucky upon demand.  A summary
of such data indicating the Significant Industrial User’s compliance with
this Chapter shall be prepared semi-annually and submitted to the General
Manager.  In addition the General Manager may inspect and copy all records
pertaining to the user’s wastewater discharge.



      3.   Any Significant Industrial User shall install at their
own cost and expense suitable monitoring equipment to facilitate the accurate
observation, sampling and measurement of wastes.  Such equipment shall be
maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all times.



      4.   The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained
on the Significant Industrial User’s premises in a readily accessible
location in the opinion of the General Manager.  When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the Significant Industrial User,
the General Manager may allow such facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area with the approval of the public agency having
jurisdiction over such street or sidewalk, and located so that it will not be
obstructed by public utilities, landscaping, or parked vehicles.



      5.   When more than one (1) Significant Industrial User can
discharge into a common sewer, the General Manager may require installation
of separate monitoring equipment for each Significant Industrial User.  When
there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single Significant
Industrial User, the General Manager may require that separate monitoring
facilities be installed for each separate discharge.



      6.   Whether constructed on public or private property, the
monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the General
Manager’s requirements and all applicable construction standards and
specifications.



   c.   Inspection, Sampling and Analysis.



      1.   Compliance Determination.  Compliance determinations
with respect to Section 23-3.05 may be made on the basis of either
instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater as may be
appropriate for the parameter. Composite samples may be taken over
twenty-four (24) hour period, or over a time span, as determined necessary by
the General Manager to meet the needs of specific circumstances.



      2.   Analysis of Discharges.  At the owner’s expense,
laboratory analysis of discharge samples shall be performed by a laboratory,
certified by the Kentucky Laboratory Certification Program, in accordance
with methods as outlined in 40 CFR 136 and 40 CFR 261, or other approved EPA
methods. If the POTW samples a Significant Industrial User and determines a
violation has occurred BGMU shall sample, at the owners expense, a second
time within thirty (30) days.



      3.   Sampling Frequency.  Sampling of discharges for the
purpose of compliance determination with respect to Section 23-3.05 will be
done at such intervals as the General Manager may designate.



      4.   Sample Collection.  All sample collection and testing
methods shall be those as described in 40 CFR 136 and 40 CFR 261, or other
approved EPA methods.



      5.   Monitoring Equipment.  Wastewater monitoring and flow
measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and maintained
in good working order at all times.  The failure of a Significant Industrial
User to keep those facilities in good working order shall not be grounds for
the Significant Industrial User to claim that sample records are
unrepresentative of its discharge.



      6.   Sample Collection Methods.  The User must collect
wastewater samples using the twenty-four (24) hour flow-proportional
composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or
grab sampling is authorized by the General Manager.  Where time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized, the samples must be
representative of the discharge.  Using Protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and
sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field;
for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in
the laboratory.  Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized as appropriate.  In addition, grab samples may be required to
show compliance with Instantaneous Limits.



      7.   Use of Grab Samples.  For sampling required in support
of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports a minimum of four (4)
grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease,
sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical
sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data
are available, BGMU may authorize a lower minimum.  The Significant
Industrial User is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary
to assess and assure compliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and
Regulations.



      8.   All Samples will be representative and based on composite
or composited grab samples taken at a minimum of every four (4) hours while
discharging. 



      9.   Copies of records of all samples and/or monitoring
activities must be kept by the Significant Industrial User for a minimum of
three (3) years.



   d.   Public Access to Information; Exceptions.



      1.   Information and data on a user obtained from reports,
questionnaires and monitoring programs, and from inspections shall be
available to the public or other governmental agencies without restriction
unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of BGMU that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as
trade secrets of the user.



      2.   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made
available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to
the Subchapter, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
Permit, and/or the Pretreatment Standards; provided however, that such
portions of a report shall be available for use by the State or any State
agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnish-ing the report.  Wastewater constituents and characteristics will
not be recognized as confidential information.



      3.   Information accepted by BGMU as confidential, shall not
be transmitted to the general public by BGMU until the expiration of three
(3) days following the giving of written notice by BGMU to the user of
BGMU’s intention to divulge such information to the general public.  The
State shall have unrestricted access to all information submitted to BGMU to
include that information deemed confidential. 



   e.   Permit to Discharge.



      1.   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any
Industrial Wastewater directly or indirectly to sewerage facilities owned by
BGMU or Warren County Water District without first obtaining a permit from
BGMU for Industrial Wastewater discharge when deemed necessary.  This
regulatory authority shall extend to any extra jurisdictional agencies or
industries which contribute wastewater to BGMU’s wastewater system. These
permits shall include the permit issuance, effective and expiration dates; a
statement that the permit is non-transferable; effluent limits based on
applicable Pretreatment Standards; self-monitoring, sampling, reporting,
notification and record keeping requirements; the waiver process to seek
relief for monitoring a pollutant neither present or expected to be present
in a discharge; a statement of applicable penalties for violation of the
Pretreatment Standards and Regulations; requirements to control slug
discharges; and language detailing any grants by BGMU General Manager
authorizing waivers from monitoring.



      2.   The  permit  for Industrial Wastewater  discharge may
require  pretreatment of industrial wastewaters before discharge, 
restriction  of  peak flow discharges, discharge of certain wastewater only
to specified sewers of BGMU, relocation of point of discharge, prohibition of
discharge of certain wastewater components, restriction of discharge to
certain hours of the day, payment of additional charges to defray increased
costs of BGMU created by the wastewater discharge and such other conditions
as may be required to effectuate the purpose of this Chapter.



      3.   No permit for Industrial Wastewater discharge is
transferable without the prior written consent of the General Manager.



      4.   No person shall discharge Industrial Wastewaters in
excess of the quantity or quality limitations set by the permit for
industrial wastewater discharge.  Any person desiring to discharge
wastewaters or use facilities which are not in conformance with the permit
should apply to BGMU for an amended permit with regard to quantity.



      5.   Applicants for a permit for Industrial Wastewater
discharge shall complete an application for wastewater discharge permit
available at the general offices of BGMU one hundred eighty day (180) prior
to permit validation.  Baseline Monitoring Reports (BMR) and Industrial
Waste Survey Questionnaire (IWSQ) must be submitted as well.



      6.   Upon receipt of the permit fee prescribed in BGMU’s
schedule of charges and fees and of all required information, the application
shall be processed and, upon approval, be signed by the General Manager and
one (1) copy returned to the applicant.



      7.   The application shall be approved if the applicant has
complied with all applicable requirements of this Subchapter and furnished to
BGMU all required information and if the General Manager determines that
there is adequate capacity in the wastewater system.



      8.   Upon approval of the permit application, BGMU will issue
a wastewater discharge permit incorporating discharge conditions, monitoring
schedules and locations, compliance schedules, etc., tailored to the
individual industrial user.  This wastewater discharge permit shall be
issued for a specified time period not to exceed five (5) years.  A permit
may be issued for a period less than a year or may be stated to expire on a
specific date.  The user shall apply for permit reissuance a minimum of one
hundred eighty (180) days prior to the expiration of the user’s existing
permit.  The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to
modification by BGMU during the term of the permit as limitations or
requirements are modified or other just cause exists.  The user shall be
informed of any proposed changes in the permit at least thirty (30) days
prior to the effective date of change.  Any changes or new conditions in the
permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.



      9.   All Significant Industrial Users shall submit periodic
reports regarding the nature and concentration of all pollutants as outlined
in their wastewater discharge permit.  Production rates shall be reported by
industrial users subject to production based standards.  In addition, within
ninety (90) days following date for final compliance with applicable
Pretreatment Standards or, in the case of a new source, ninety (90) days
prior to commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the wastewater
treatment plant, any user subject to Pretreatment Standards and/or local
requirements shall submit to the General Manager a report indicating the
nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the
regulated processes which are limited by Pretreatment Standards and/or local
requirements. This report shall include schematic drawings or other
descriptions of any pretreatment equipment.  New sources are required to be
in compliance with Pretreatment Standards and/or local limits upon
commencement of introduction of wastewater to the wastewater treatment
system.  All sampling and testing shall follow the methods as outlined in 40
CFR 136, 40 CFR 261, or other approved EPA methods.  This statement shall be
signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user, and certified
by a qualified professional.



      10.   No User shall ever increase the use of process water, or
in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute
for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained
in the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or for any other
pollutant-specific limitation developed by BGMU or the Commonwealth of
Kentucky.  The General Manager may impose mass limitations on users where
the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate.  In such cases, all
reports shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by Pretreatment
Standards in the effluent of the User.  These reports shall contain the
results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the
nature and concentration, of production and mass where requested by the
General Manager, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the
applicable Pretreatment Standards.  All analyses shall be performed in
accordance with procedures established by the EPA Administrator pursuant to
Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments
thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the EPA
Administrator.  Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques approved by the Administrator.



      11.   The General Manager may suspend a permit for Industrial
Wastewater discharge for a period of not to exceed sixty (60) days when such
suspension is necessary in order to stop a discharge which presents an
imminent hazard to the public health, safety, or welfare, to the local
environment or to BGMU’s wastewater system.



      12.   Any discharger notified of a suspension of this permit
shall immediately cease and desist the discharge of such industrial
wastewater to the sewerage system.  In the event of a failure of the
discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the General
Manager shall take such steps as are reasonably necessary to insure
compliance.



      13.   Any suspended discharger may file with the General
Manager, a request for a meeting with the Board of Directors.  The Board
shall meet within thirty (30) days of the receipt by the General Manager such
request.  The Board shall hold a meeting on the suspension and either
confirm or revoke the action of the General Manager.  Reasonable notice of
the meeting shall be given to the suspended discharger.  At this meeting the
suspended discharger may appear personally or through counsel, and present
evidence in their own behalf.



      14.   In the event that the Board fails to meet within the
time set forth above or fails to make a determination within a reasonable
time after the close of the meeting, the order of suspension shall be stayed
until a determination is made either confirming or revoking the action of the
General Manager.



      15.   The General Manager shall reinstate the permit on proof
of satisfactory compliance with all discharge requirements of BGMU.



      16.   The General Manager may revoke a permit for Industrial
Wastewater Discharge on a finding that the discharger has violated any
provisions of this Chapter.  No revocation shall be ordered until a meeting
on the question has been held by the Board.  At this meeting, the discharger
may appear personally or through counsel and present evidence in their own
behalf.  Notice of the meeting shall be given to the discharger at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the meeting.



      17.   Any discharger whose permit has been revoked shall
immediately stop all discharge of any liquid carried wastes covered by the
permit to any public sewer that is tributary to the wastewater system of
BGMU.  The General Manager may disconnect or permanently block from such
public sewer the industrial connection sewer of any discharger whose permit
has been revoked if such action is necessary to ensure compliance with the
order of revocation.



      18.   Before any further discharge of Industrial Wastewater
may be made by the discharger, he must apply for a new permit for Industrial
Wastewater Discharge, pay all charges that would be required upon initial
application together with all delinquent fees, charges and penalties and such
other sums as the discharger may owe to BGMU.  Cost incurred by BGMU in
revoking the permit and disconnecting the industrial connection sewer shall
be paid for by the discharger before issuance of a new permit for Industrial
Wastewater discharge.



      19.   BGMU may suspend the wastewater treatment services
and/or a wastewater discharge permit when such suspension is necessary, in
the opinion of BGMU, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health
or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the
wastewater treatment plant or causes BGMU to violate any condition of its
NPDES Permit.



      20.   Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater
treatment service and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately
stop or eliminate the contribution.  In the event of a failure of the person
to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, BGMU shall take such steps
as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the wastewater treatment plant or endangerment
to any individuals.  BGMU shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit
and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the
noncomplying discharge.  A detailed written statement submitted by the
Significant Industrial User describing the causes of the harmful contribution
and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to
BGMU within fifteen (15) days of the date of occurrence.



      21.   The General Manager may deny or conditionally approve,
new or increased contributions of pollutants or changes in the nature of
pollutants to the POTW by Significant Industrial Users where such
contributions do not meet applied Pretreatment Standards and Regulations, or
conditions of this Chapter.



   Any Significant Industrial User who meets the criteria for Significant
Non-Compliance shall submit a compliance schedule outlining the steps which
the Significant Industrial User plans to take to achieve compliance.  This
compliance schedule shall include milestone dates.  The Significant
Industrial User shall submit reports within fourteen (14) days past each
milestone date.  These reports will confirm the completion of the schedules
plan for the milestone date.  If the Significant Industrial User has not met
the expectations of the compliance schedule the Significant Industrial User
will explain why and how the Significant Industrial User will accelerate
activities to meet the final compliance milestone date. Within fourteen (14)
days past the final compliance milestone date the Significant Industrial User
will submit a report with a statement, indicating that the Significant
Industrial User is consistently meeting the conditions of this Subchapter and
the Significant Industrial User will provide sufficient analytical data to
support this statement.



   The definition of Significant Non-Compliance is expanded to include 40
CFR 403.8 (f) (2) (viii) (A-C).  Per 40 CFR 403.12 (b) (e) and (h), all
Significant Industrial User reports shall include any BMP’s required and
BMP compliance information.  Documentation of compliance with BMP
information shall be maintained by the SIU and BGMU. 



      22.   Where an effluent from an industrial process is mixed
prior to treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by the
regulated process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived for the
discharge permit by the General Manager.  These alternative limits shall be
applied to the mixed effluent.  These alternative limits shall be calculated
using the Combined Wastestream Formulae and/or Flow-Weighted Average Formulae
given in 40 CFR 403.6(e).  Where the effluent limits in a Categorical
Pretreatment Standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutants per
units or production (production-based standard), the General Manager may
convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant that may be discharged per day or effluent concentration for
purposes of calculating effluent permit limitations applicable to the
permittee.  The permittee shall be subject to all permit limits calculated
in this manner under 40 CFR 403.6(c) and must fully comply with these
alternative limits.  All categorical industrial users subject to
production-based standards must report production rates annually so that
alternative permit limits can be calculated if necessary.  The categorical
industrial user must notify the General Manager thirty (30) days in advance
of any change in production levels that might affect the flow or other data
used to calculate the effluent limits in the discharge permit.



      23.   Upper limitations have been established for conventional
pollutants for Industrial Wastewater discharges. Conventional pollutants
include Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD 5 ), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD),
Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Ammonia Nitrogen (NH 3 -N), Total Oil & Grease
(O&G) and Total Phosphorus (T-P). All Significant Industrial Users shall not
exceed the following discharge limits:



 

Constituents
 
Limits mg/1


BOD5
 
4,000


COD
 
10,000

23-3.09   Enforcement and Abatement.



   a.   General.  BGMU through the General Manager or designee, to
insure compliance with this Subchapter, and as permitted through 40 CFR
Subchapter N, 401 through 471 and 401 KAR 5:057 may take the following
enforcement steps against Significant Industrial Users in noncompliance with
this Subchapter.  The remedies available to the General Manager include
injunctive relief, civil and criminal penalties, immediate discontinuance of
discharges and/or water and/or electric service and the publishing of the
list of significant violators annually.  The enforcement authority shall be
vested in the General Manager or designee. This designee shall be the duly
authorized employee as authorized under 40 CFR 403.12 (m).



      All violations of requirements of this Subchapter must be
reviewed and responded to by the General Manager or representative.  In
general, the General Manager shall notify the Significant Industrial User
when a violation occurs.  For all violations, the General Manager shall
receive an explanation and, as appropriate, a plan from the Significant
Industrial User to correct the violation within a specific time period.  If
the violation(s) persist or the explanation and/or plan are not adequate, the
General Manager’s response shall be more formal and commitments or
schedules, as appropriate, for compliance will be established in an
enforceable document.  The enforcement response selected will be related to
the seriousness of the violation.  Enforcement responses will be escalated
if compliance is not achieved expeditiously after the initial action.  A
significant violation will require a formal enforcement action.  The full
scale of enforcement actions will be detailed in BGMU’s Pretreatment
Program Enforcement Response Plan.



   b.   Enforcement Action.



      1.   Informal Notice.  These actions include statements made
to the Significant Industrial User during sampling and/or inspection visits,
telephone calls to the appropriate company official, informal meetings,
warning or reminder letters.  These informal notices shall be used for minor
violations.



      2.   Formal Notice.  These actions include the following:



         (a)   Notice of Violation.  Any person found to be
violating any provision of this Subchapter, wastewater discharge permit or
any order issued hereunder shall be served by BGMU’s General Manager with a
written notice stating the nature of the violation.



         (b)   Administrative Order/Fines.  Any person who,
after receiving a Notice of Violation, and continue to discharge in violation
of this Chapter or of the pretreatment standard or requirements or is
determined to be a chronic or persistent violator, shall be ordered to appear
before the General Manager.  At said appearance, a compliance schedule will
be given to the violating user and an administrative fine assessed.  The
fine shall be determined on a case-by-case basis which shall consider the
type, severity, duration and number of violations, severity of impact on the
POTW, impact on human health, the Significant Industrial User’s economic
benefit from the violation, past history of the Significant Industrial User,
and good-faith efforts made by the Significant Industrial User.  The fine
shall be a non-arbitrary but appropriate amount as defined in Section 23-3.10
in this Subchapter.



   The administrative order may take any of the following four (4) forms:



      (1)   Consent Order.  The General Manager is hereby empowered
to enter into Consent Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other
similar documents establishing an agreement with the Significant Industrial
User responsible for the noncompliance.  Such orders will include specific
action to be taken by the Significant Industrial User to correct the
noncompliance within a time period also specified in the order.  Consent
Orders shall have the same force and effect as all other administrative
orders.



      (2)   Compliance Order.  When the General Manager finds that
a Significant Industrial User has violated or continues to violate this
Chapter or permit or order issued hereunder, he may issue an order to the
Significant Industrial User responsible for the violation directing that
following a specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless
adequate treatment facilities, devices and other related appurtenances have
been installed and are properly operated.  Orders may also contain such
other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to
address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment
technology, additional self-monitoring and management practices.



      (3)   Cease and Desist Order.  When the General Manager finds
that a Significant Industrial User has violated or continues to violate this
Chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, the General Manager may
issue an order to cease and desist all such violations to the Significant
Industrial User and direct those persons in noncompliance to:



         (i)   Comply forthwith;



         (ii)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventative
action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened
violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge.



      (4)   Show Cause Hearing.  The General Manager may issue to
any Significant Industrial User who causes or contributes to violations of
this Chapter, discharge permit or order issued hereunder, an order to appear
and show cause why more severe enforcement action should not be taken.  A
notice shall be served on the Significant Industrial User specifying the time
and place of the hearing to be held by the General Manager regarding the
violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed
enforcement action and directing the Significant Industrial User to show
cause before the General Manager why more severe enforcement action should
not be taken.  The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10)
days before the hearing.  Service may be made on any agent or officer of the
facility.  Whether or not a duly notified Significant Industrial User or its
representative appears, immediate enforcement action may be pursued.  BGMU
itself may conduct the hearing and take evidence or may designate a
representative to:



         (i)   Issue in the name of BGMU notices of hearings
requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of
evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings; and,



         (ii)   Take the evidence.



   c.   Revocation of Permit.  Any Significant Industrial User
violating any of the provisions of this Chapter or discharge permit or other
order issued hereunder shall be subject to termination of its authority to
discharge sewage into the public sewer system.  Such termination shall be
immediate if necessary for the protection of the POTW.  Said Significant
Industrial User may also have water service terminated.  Any Significant
Industrial User who violated any condition(s) of this Chapter, discharge
permit, order or applicable State or Federal regulation is subject to having
its Industrial User Discharge Permit revoked in accordance with the
procedures of this Chapter.  Violations resulting in immediate permit
revocation shall include, but not be limited to, the following:



      1.   Failure of Significant Industrial User to factually
report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;



      2.   Failure of the Significant Industrial User to report
significant changes in operations, processes, wastewater constituents and
characteristics;



      3.   Refusal of reasonable access to the Significant
Industrial User’s premises for the purposes of inspection and sampling; and,



      4.   Violation(s) of any condition of the Industrial User
Discharge Permit.



   d.   Liability.  Any Significant Industrial User violating any of
the provisions of this Chapter, discharge permit or other order issued
here-under shall become liable to BGMU for any expense, loss or damage
occasioned by BGMU by reason of such violation.  This civil liability is as
provided by State and Federal regulations.



   e.   Misrepresentations and/or Falsifying of Documents.  Any
Significant Industrial User who knowingly and/or negligently makes any false
statements, representations or certification of any application, record,
report, plan or other document filed or required pursuant to this Subchapter
or Industrial User Discharge Permit or who falsifies, tampers with or
knowingly and/or negligently renders inaccurate any monitoring device or
method required under this Subchapter, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and
shall be fined at least one thousand ($1,000.00) dollars per violation or
imprisoned for not more than twelve (12) months or both.



   f.   Destruction of POTW and Legal Action.  No person(s) shall
maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface
or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is part of the
POTW system.  Any person(s) violating this provision shall be subject to
immediate arrest under charge of disorderly conduct.  It shall be noted that
the Clean Water Act does not require proof of specific intent to obtain
conviction.



   g.   Judicial Action.  If any person(s) discharges sewage,
industrial wastes or other wastes into BGMU’s wastewater disposal system
contrary to the provisions of this Chapter, discharge permit, any order of
the General Manager or BGMU, or Federal or State pretreatment requirements,
BGMU may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in
the appropriate court of this jurisdiction.  In addition to the penalties
provided herein, BGMU may recover reasonable attorney’s fees, court costs,
court reporter’s fees and other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit
at law against the person(s) found to have violated this Subchapter or the
orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder.



   h.   Termination of Service.  The General Manager may suspend the
wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater discharge permit of a
Significant Industrial User whenever such suspension is necessary in order to
stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of the public, the POTW
system or the environment.  Any Significant Industrial User notified of
suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the discharge permit
shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution.  In the event of a
Significant Industrial User’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the General Manager shall take such steps as
deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endanger-ment to any individuals.  Any Significant Industrial User
responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent endangerment shall submit a
detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution
and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the General
Manager.



   i.   Criminal Prosecution.  Any Significant Industrial User who
will-fully or negligently violates any provisions of this Subchapter, any
orders or permits insured hereunder, or any other pretreat-ment requirements
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and be, upon conviction, fined at least one
thousand ($1,000.00) dollars per violation per day or imprisoned for not more
than one (1) year or both.



   j.   Public Nuisance.  The discharge of wastewater in any manner in
violation of this Subchapter is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall
be corrected or abated as provided herein.



   k.   Violations Not Involving Imminent Danger.



      1.   Notification to Significant Industrial User of actual or
threatened violation.  Whenever the General Manager determines or has
reasonable cause to believe that a discharge of wastewater has occurred, or
is about to occur, in violation of the provisions of this Subchapter, or any
other applicable law or regulation, he shall notify the Significant
Industrial User of such violation; however, failure of the General Manager to
provide notice to the Significant Industrial User shall not in any way
relieve the Significant Industrial User from any consequences of a wrongful
or illegal discharge.  The notice shall state:



         (a)   The nature of the actual or threatened violation
of this Section.



         (b)   The time within which the Significant Industrial
User must take appropriate measures to prevent any threatened violation, or
the recurrence of any actual violations, and to furnish evidence to the
General Manager that such corrective action has been taken.



      2.   Proceedings in the event of failure of Significant
Industrial User to furnish satisfactory evidence of corrective action within
time prescribed by notice.  In the event the Significant Industrial User
fails to furnish satisfactory evidence to the General Manager that corrective
action has been taken within the time prescribed by the notice (or any
extensions of time granted by the General Manager), the General Manager may:



         (a)   Suspend the water, sewer and/or electric service
if this action will serve to prevent any further violations by the
Significant Industrial User.



         (b)   Sever sewer connection(s), or take such other
steps as may be required in order to insure that no prohibited wastewater is
introduced into the public sanitary sewer.



   l.   Violations Involving Imminent Danger.



      1.   The General Manager may suspend the water and/or electric
service when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the General
Manager, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or
may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare
of persons to the environment, causes interference to the wastewater system
or causes BGMU to violate any condition of its NPDES Permit.



      2.     Any person notified of a suspension of water and/or
electric service shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge.  In the
event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the General Manager shall take such steps as deemed necessary
including immediate severance of the sewer connection to prevent or minimize
damage to the wastewater system or endangerment to any individuals.  The
General Manager shall reinstate the water, sewer and/or electric service upon
proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge.  A detailed written
statement submitted by the Significant Industrial User describing the causes
of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence shall be submitted to the General Manager within five (5) days of
the date of occurrence.



   m.   Assessment of Damages to Significant Industrial Users.  When a
discharge of wastewater causes an obstruction, damage, or any other
impairment to the wastewater system, the General Manager may assess a charge
against the Significant Industrial User for the work required to clean or
repair the facility and these charges will be billed directly to the
Significant Industrial User when costs are final.  The General Manager shall
have such remedies for the collection of such costs as he has for the
collection of sewer service charges.



   n.   Judicial Relief.  In cases of violations of this Subchapter,
BGMU shall have the right to seek injunctive relief and any other relief of a
civil or criminal nature against the violators, which right shall be in
addition to the right to take non-judicial action as set out in paragraphs b
and c of the Section.  In any judicial action of a civil nature, BGMU shall
have the right to recover from the violator of this Subchapter any actual
damages sustained, including the costs, if any, incurred by BGMU, in
corrective or preventive action taken for the purpose of protecting the
integrity of the wastewater system, reasonable attorney’s fees, court
costs, court reporters’ fees and other expenses of litigation.

24-1   FINDINGS, DECLARATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY, PURPOSE



24-1.01    Findings. 



   The Board of Commissioners for the City of Bowling Green, based on
evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually explicit
entertainment activities on the community presented in hearings and reports,
in findings incorporated in numerous cases heard by the United States Supreme
Court and in studies in many communities around the country, including but
not limited to Dallas, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; Newport News, Virginia; Garden
Grove, California; and Newport, Kentucky finds that:



   a.   Certain sexually explicit entertainment activities which are or
may become located near areas zoned for residential use, near schools and
public parks, and near malls and similar open spaces that cater to use by
family groups and children would adversely affect the viability of such
nearby properties for such purposes;



   b.   The City of Bowling Green and the United States Government have
spent millions of dollars on community development and neighborhood
enhancement projects over the past years to attempt to eliminate blight and
to further prevent deterioration of the city's neighborhoods;



   c.   Certain sexually explicit entertainment activities, because of
the conditions of their operations, have or may contribute to an increased
incidence of crime and juvenile delinquency, particularly when such
activities are located in close proximity to one another;



   d.   Certain sexually explicit entertainment facilities,
particularly through outside displays, tend to attract undesirable clientele
that discourage neighborhood residents from undertaking civic improvements
and cause residents and businesses to move elsewhere and/or may frustrate
attempts to attract new residents and businesses to come into a particular
area, all of which factors contribute to a diminution of property values and
to a general deterioration of the city's neighborhoods;



   e.   The establishment of small closet-like rooms or booths at
sexually explicit amusement facilities in the city may encourage persons to
loiter for illegitimate purposes and may encourage lewd conduct in public
places, thereby creating a public nuisance and a danger to health and safety,
including the spread of communicable diseases;



   f.   The concentration of sexually explicit movies, books and sexual
paraphernalia in the City, the establishment of businesses that house 
sexually explicit movies and hotel rooms which may be rented by the hour that
offer free sexually explicit movies in the room have provided prostitutes an
appealing and visible meeting place to ply their trade, and this has and may
create public nuisances and may create supermarkets of sex in otherwise
respectable City neighborhoods;



   g.   The value of free expression in a free society can be protected
by affording an opportunity for products and services to be sold at distinct
and separate locations where such goods and services will be just as
available to the public wishing to pay for them, but with dramatically less
deleterious effect on abutting neighborhoods;



   h.   Some video cassette rental outlets have or may become engaged
in the rental and distribution of movies which are distinguished or
characterized by an emphasis on sexual activities as hereinafter defined as a
principal portion of their business activity, requiring that such
establishments be licensed and regulated as sexually explicit entertainment
establishments in order to protect the City's neighborhoods from blight and
in order to protect children from the deleterious effects of exposure to
sexually explicit portrayals on jackets in which such movies are packaged;



   i.   The noise generated by patrons coming and going from sexually
explicit entertainment activity establishments may cause a substantial
disruption to nearby residents and a modest curtailment of the hours during
which entertainment is offered to patrons coming and going from such
establishments would afford some relief to persons residing nearby without
significantly interfering with the availability of the offered entertainment
therein;



   j.   Sexually explicit entertainment establishments which may have
integrated several forms of sexually explicit entertainment in one business
premise have had a greater blighting effect on surrounding land uses than
have establishments which engage in only one form of sexually explicit
entertainment;



   k.   The regulation of escort services providing sexually explicit
services will deter prostitution and public indecency and will secure the
public health and safety of the City; and,



   l.   Nationally there is extensive involvement of organized crime in
the business of sexually explicit entertainment activities which is regulated
herein and that the disclosure of the names of persons who own, as well as
the names of the persons who operate such sexually explicit bookstores and
other sexually explicit entertainment establishments would aid law
enforcement officials in the enforcement of the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), as well as the enforcement of the laws of
the state prohibiting the distribution of obscene matter, use of minors to
distribute obscene matter, advertising of obscene matter, distribution of
obscene matter to minors, promoting sale of obscenity, use of a minor in a
sexual performance, distribution of portrayal of sexual performance by a
minor, promotion of material portraying a sexual performance by a minor, and
advertising of material portraying a sexual performance by a minor, and use
of a minor to distribute material portraying a sexual performance by a minor.

24-1.02   Declaration of public policy.



   The Board of Commissioners declare, as a matter of public policy, that
in order to preserve surrounding neighborhoods, prevent blight and the
deterioration of the neighborhoods, protect property values, promote the
return of residents and businesses to the City's neighborhoods, protect
children from deleterious effects of exposure to sexually explicit material,
reduce the spread of communicable diseases, and decrease incidence of crime
and juvenile delinquency, the licensing and regulation of sexually explicit
entertainment establishments is a public necessity and is required in the
interest of public health, safety and welfare, and the economic and aesthetic
well-being of the people.



24-1.03   Purpose. 



   The purpose of this Chapter is to effect the declaration of public
purpose set forth in this Section as it relates to the foregoing findings of
the Board of Commissioners, and more particularly to:



   a.   Protect neighborhoods;



   b.   Prevent neighborhoods from suffering the noise, the blighting
influence and the increase in crime brought about by a concentration of
sexually explicit entertainment establishments in one neighborhood;



   c.   Prevent unsanitary conditions that exist at sexually explicit
amusement arcades and to reduce the spread of communicable diseases;



   d.   Protect children from the deleterious effects of exposure to
sexually explicit matter while such children are shopping for video cassette
movies appropriate for their age at such rental outlets; and,



   e.   Obtain sufficient information to identify those persons
licensed or to be licensed for the operation of establishments selling,
showing or renting sexually explicit materials or providing sexually explicit
escort services.

preserve public confidence in and respect for the government he or she
represents.  Such confidence and respect can best be promoted if every
public official and employee, whether paid or unpaid, and whether elected or

fairness and equality under the law and avoid both actual and potential
conflicts between their private self-interest and the public interest.

her independence of judgment or action in the performance of his or her
official duties;



   2.   Engage in or accept private employment or render services for
private interests when such employment or service is incompatible with the

official or employee who is a candidate for public office may accept campaign
contributions and services in connection with any such campaign;



   5.   Represent private interests in any action or proceeding before
the governmental body for which he or she serves or is employed without
consulting and receiving written consent from the City.  This standard of
conduct shall not be construed to prevent a public official or employee from
appearing, without compensation, before any governmental body of the City to
express his or her personal views as a private citizen.  No elected official
shall be prohibited from making any inquiry for information on behalf of a
constituent, if no compensation, reward or other thing of value is promised
to, given to, or accepted by the official, whether directly or indirectly, in
return for the inquiry;

board member’s City agency, except that this prohibition shall not apply to
contracts entered into before an elected official filed as a candidate for
city office, before an appointed official was appointed to a City or City
agency office, or before an employee was hired by the City.  However, if any
contract entered into by a City or City agency official or employee before he
or she was appointed to office or was hired as an employee is renewable after
he or she assumes the appointed office or is hired as an employee, then this
prohibition shall apply to the renewal of the contract.  No elected public

agency, board or commission that is created by the City, that is created
jointly by the City and Warren County, that has any City representation on
its board of directors or that receives funding from the City that is
identified in the annual budget as either a City contract agency, board or
commission or competitive funding agency, board or commission.  This
prohibition shall not apply to contracts existing with any such agencies,
boards or commissions prior to June 15, 2009.  However, if any such existing
contract is renewable after June 15, 2009, then this prohibition shall apply
to the renewal of the contract.



   2.   The prohibition above shall not apply for contracts involving
employees of the City of Bowling Green if the contract is awarded after
public notice and competitive sealed bidding or competitive online bidding,
unless the employee of the City is authorized to participate in establishing
the contract specifications or awarding or managing the contract.  In any
situation in which this exception is applicable, the department requesting
the contract shall provide written documentation to the Department of Finance
that these provisions have been or will be met.



   3.   Any violation of this section shall constitute a Class A
misdemeanor, and upon conviction, the court may void any contract entered
into in violation of this section.  Additionally, a violation of this
section shall be grounds for removal from office or employment with the City
in accordance with any applicable provisions of state law and ordinances,
rules or regulations of the City.

large tree, thirty-five feet (35') for a medium tree and twenty-five feet
(25') for a small tree.



   c.   The tree location is to be at least twenty feet (20') from the
curb of an intersection of a street and outside the sight triangle as defined
in the Zoning Ordinance.  In addition, the tree or other planted vegetation
shall not cause a significant sight visibility problem to motorists or
pedestrians. 



   d.   The tree location is to be at least ten feet (10') from fire

least fifty (50) square feet in area.



   g.   If any tree is planted in a utility strip, it must be a medium
sized tree only.



   h.   Since the size of the public right-of-way varies, it is the
responsibility of the property owner or the person or organization planting
the tree, shrub or other vegetation to determine the location of the
right-of-way.  The property owner or the person or organization planting the
tree, shrub or other vegetation can get assistance in locating the
right-of-way by contacting the City.  The property owner or the person or
organization planting the tree, shrub or other vegetation shall be
responsible for any damages to underground utilities and should call You Dig
at 811 prior to any work being performed.  The property owner or the person
or organization planting the tree agrees to maintain the tree after it is
planted.



   i.   Planting of tree and vegetation shall not be in ditches or
obstruct the flow of stormwater.



   j.   The City assumes no liability for trees or other vegetation
planted in any rights-of-way.

26-6   TREE TOPPING.



   It shall be unlawful for any person to top any public tree.  "Topping"
is defined in the ANSI A300 (Part 1)-2001 Pruning standard as: “4.46
topping: The reduction of a tree’s size using heading cuts that shorten
limbs or branches back to a predetermined crown limit.  Topping is not an
acceptable practice (5.57).” Other names for topping include “heading,”
“tipping,” “hat-racking,” “shaping,” and “rounding over.” 
Topping is harmful to the health of a tree and can lead to decay, rapid
re-growth and hazardous limbs.  “Crown Reduction” is an acceptable
practice to reduce the size of a tree’s canopy when done in accordance with
ANSI A300 standards.  “Restoration” pruning may be used to repair the
canopy of a tree that has been damaged by storms, previous improper pruning
or other means.  It is recommended that an arborist certified by the ISA
perform any major pruning.  When a tree’s size, location or other factor
prevents correct pruning practices, removal and/or replacement with a more
suitable species is encouraged.  More information can be found at the
City’s Tree Board website at http://www.bgky.org/tree/topping.php.



(Ord. BG2004-21, 5/4/2004; Ord. BG2011-4, 2/1/2011)



26-7   VEGETATION MAINTENANCE.



   a.   It shall be unlawful for the owner or occupant of any building
or lot to permit any vegetation, including public trees, to grow in a manner
which interferes with normal sidewalk traffic located on such lot or on
public right-of-way adjoining such lot or street traffic, or to grow so as to
pose a threat to safety or public rights-of-way due to obstruction of view,
obstruction of passage or any other manner.  Any and all pruning of a public
tree shall comply with ANSI A300 (Part 1)-2001 Pruning standard.  A summary
of correct pruning can be found on the City’s Tree Board website at
http://www.bgky.org/tree/pruning.php.  Trees that grow over a public
right-of-way shall be maintained so that the lowest limb is at a height of no
less than fifteen (15) feet above the right-of-way.



   b.   The owner of the property adjacent to the sidewalk or other
rights-of-way upon which vegetation, including public trees are planted or in
which vegetation, including trees, are allowed to grow in a manner which
interferes with normal sidewalk traffic located on such lot or on public
right-of-way adjoining such lot or street traffic, or are allowed to grow so
as to pose a threat to safety on public rights-of-way due to obstruction of
view, obstruction of passage or any other manner shall be responsible for all
care and maintenance of the vegetation, including public trees which is
required in order to insure that the provisions of the preceding paragraph
are carried out.



   c.   Nothing in the foregoing paragraphs shall prohibit the City or
its authorized agent(s) from making such alterations in or removal of
vegetation within rights-of-way, including public trees, or making
alterations in vegetation, including trees, that are allowed to grow in a
manner which interferes with normal sidewalk traffic or on public
rights-of-way or are allowed to grow so as to pose a threat to safety on
public rights-of-way due to obstruction of view, obstruction of passage or
any other manner as necessary to protect its reasonable interests.  Unless
the alteration or removal is deemed an emergency, the person responsible for
the vegetation, including trees, shall be given an opportunity to bring the
vegetation or tree into compliance.  If the responsible person fails or
refuses to bring the vegetation, including trees, into compliance, the City
shall have the authority to bring the vegetation, including trees, into
compliance and may cite the responsible person as set out below and may
recover its costs incurred in bringing the vegetation, including trees, into
compliance.  Vegetation, including trees, altered or removed as a result of
an emergency determination may also result in a citation being issued with
the City authorized to recover its costs.



(Ord. BG2011-4, 2/1/2011)



26-8   TREE REMOVAL.



   No person shall remove, cut above the ground or disturb any public tree
without approval of the City of Bowling Green except to perform routine
maintenance as described above.  The person shall then abide by the
standards set forth below.  Requests for approval to perform a tree removal
or other major tree work on a public tree shall be obtained by contacting the
City.



   a.   The entire tree, including the stump is removed.



   b.   The area is refilled to ground level with soil, so as to

   c.   The area is re-seeded or planted in other appropriate manner.



   d.   There is no damage done to any property belonging to the City
or third party.



   e.   The entire removal may be done without danger or inconvenience
to the public.



   It shall specifically be the responsibility of the owner of the
property adjacent to the rights-of-way upon which the public tree is planted
to comply with the foregoing.  Citations shall be issued to the owner of the
property adjacent to the rights-of-way upon which the public tree is planted
for any violation or damages resulting from improper tree removal or tree
care practices.

26-9   TREE CARE AND REMOVAL COMPANIES.



   The City does not endorse or certify the expertise of tree care and
removal companies.  These companies must possess and maintain current
contractor and occupational licenses. It is recommended that a Kentucky or
International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) certified arborist be on company
staff. More information can be found at

26-11   PENALTIES.



   As a result of the violation of any provision of this Chapter, whether
by fault in accident or vandalism, which results in the injury, mutilation or
death of a public tree, the party in violation or fault shall be responsible
for the cost of repair or replacement of such tree.  The replacement value
of trees shall be determined in accordance with the latest revision of A
Guide to the Professional Evaluation of Landscape Trees, Specimen Shrubs, and
Evergreens, as published by the International Society of Arboriculture.



   In addition to being responsible for the replacement value, violations
of this Chapter shall be subject to the following schedule of civil fines:



   a.   If a citation for a violation of this Chapter is not contested
by the person charged with the violation, the maximum penalties below shall
apply; however, the Board may waive any or all of a penalty for an
uncontested violation, if in its discretion, the Board determines that such
waiver will promote compliance with this Chapter.  The penalties listed
below are for each day a violation continues, beginning on the first day
after the ending date of the correction period given in the citation. A
second offense is an offense that occurs within five (5) years of the
determination by the Code Enforcement Board of a prior offense.  All others
are those that occur within five (5) years of the determination by the Code
Enforcement Board of two (2) or more prior offenses.

27-3   SCREENING REGULATIONS FOR RECYCLING ESTABLISHMENTS.



27-3.01   Purpose.



   Recycling establishments by definition contain items which are so
visually offensive as to create a public nuisance which inhibits tourism and
potential growth and development of this community. This Subchapter promotes
and protects the visual aesthetic character of the land surrounding highways
to persons residing in the vicinity and persons traveling thereon, while
allowing each landowner to conduct business upon his own property, provided
such business is conducted in such a manner as not to be injurious or
offensive to others.  This Subchapter provides an effective means, in the
public interest, of controlling the offensive unsightly characteristics of
recycling establishments without impeding the operation of such businesses
from which the nuisance originates.



(Ord. BG2014-12, 8/5/2014)



27-3.02   General Provisions.



   a.   The operation of any recycling establishment situated closer
than one thousand (1,000) feet from the right-of-way line of any public road
without a permit is hereby declared to be a public nuisance.



   b.   No person shall operate any recycling establishment which is
situated closer than one thousand (1,000) feet from the right-of-way line of
any public road unless a permit for such operation shall have been obtained
from the City of Bowling Green Department of Neighborhood and Community
Services, Building and Inspection Division.



   c.   All recycling establishments, where permitted, shall comply
with the following provisions:



      1.   No junked, wrecked or inoperable vehicles, machinery or
material scrap or parts shall be located on the right-of-way of any road;



      2.   Every recycling establishment shall be hidden from view
of the traveling motorist and from any adjoining residential zoning district
for one thousand (1,000) feet in each direction from the outer perimeter of
the establishment which is visible to the traveling motorist or adjoining a
residential zoning district;



      3.   If an operator begins a recycling establishment in a new
location, the location shall be screened to comply with provisions of this
Subchapter and the operator shall have obtained a permit prior to beginning
operation;



      4.   The screened area of the recycling establishment shall be
set back the distance of the required building setback line along the front
property line, except as permitted in the Zoning Ordinance;



      5.   Recycling establishments which are side by side are not
required to screen common areas, but must screen outer perimeters from view
of the traveling public pursuant to this Subchapter; and,



      6.   All recycling establishments shall comply with all
federal, state and local stormwater management standards.



(Ord. BG2001-51, 11/20/2001; Ord. BG2003-61, 12/2/2003; reference Ord.
BG2011-30, 6/27/2011; Ord. BG2014-12, 8/5/2014)



27-3.03   Measurement of Control Distance for Screening.



   In measuring the one thousand (1,000) feet control distance from the
outer perimeter of the recycling establishment, in each direction a
circumscribed polygon shall be created around the site with no distance less
than one thousand (1,000) feet from the perimeter of the site.



(Ord. BG2014-12, 8/5/2014)



27-3.04   Standards for Screening.



   a.   The screening required by this Subchapter may be effected by
the construction of a fence, either wooden, metal, synthetic or chain link
with synthetic webbing or earth berm or combination thereof, so as to
completely block the view of what is enclosed.



      1.   Approval of a screening proposal shall be obtained from
the Building and Inspection Division of the Department of Neighborhood and
Community Services prior to the erection of fencing to effect the screening
required to hide the recycling establishment from view of the traveling
public and adjoining residential zoning districts.  Failure to obtain such
advance approval may result in the necessity of removing and re-erecting part
or all screening in order to comply with standards for screening set forth in
this Section.



      2.   Materials for screening shall present an attractive
appearance.



      3.   The completed screening shall present a neat and clean
appearance.



      4.   Screening shall not be made from:



         a.   wrinkled or bent metal; or,



         b.   pieced together metal or wood panels or other
patchwork materials.



      5.   Unless a continuous overall neat design is created, all
metal or wood panels shall be erected vertically.



      6.   Fencing used for screening shall be of uniform height of
at least eight (8) feet unless a variation in height is approved by the
Building and Inspection Division of the Department of Neighborhood and
Community Services.  Screening heights of less than eight (8) feet will be
permitted only in such instances where the reduced height is adequate to
fully screen the property from the view of the traveling motorist or any
adjacent residential district.



      7.   Completed screening shall blend with the surrounding area
as much as possible.



      8.   Fencing materials must be painted in order to blend with
the surrounding area.  The color shall be a neutral color and shades of
buildings and other structures in the area may be taken into account in
determining the color to be used on fencing materials.



      9.   If a building or other structure is used as a portion of
the screening, the Building and Inspection Division of the Department of
Neighborhood and Community Services may require it to be painted in order to
blend with the other portions of screening and the surrounding area.



      10.   Screening shall be maintained in good repair at all
times.



      11.   All recyclable material shall be arranged so as to
permit access by fire fighting equipment and to prevent the accumulation of
water.  No recyclable materials shall be piled to a height of more than
eight (8) feet.



      12.   Any set back area shall be kept free of weeds and scrub
growth.



      13.   No recyclable material shall be burned on the premises.



      14.   Fencing used for screening shall not be used for bill
posting, signage or other advertising purposes, except that a space no larger
than six (6) feet by twelve (12) feet may be used to advertise the recycling
establishment.  When a recycling establishment fronts on more than one (1)
street, space for advertisement shall extend to each street on which the
recycling establishment abuts.



      15.   Screening shall comply with local, state and federal
regulations and laws for environmental protection.



      16.   Entrance gates shall be sufficient to block the view,
and shall be closed so as to block the view at all times when the recycling
establishment is not in operation.  Where frontage is less than two hundred
(200) feet, one (1) forty (40) foot entrance is allowed; where frontage is
greater than two hundred (200) feet, the recycling establishment may have two
(2) entrances with a maximum area forty (40) feet each.  All entrances shall
meet the City street access standards.



   b.   Wherever screening faces a road, landscaping shall be provided
which meets all applicable landscaping codes and/or ordinances at the
location of the recycling establishment, as well as any property maintenance
codes.



   c.   Any recycling establishment which cannot as a practical matter
be screened shall be removed within six (6) months of receipt of notice of
violation.

is hidden from the view of motorists.



   c.   Application for a permit to locate or operate a recycling

Subchapter shall also govern and control the condemnation of buildings and
structures found to be unfit for human occupancy and use, and establish
procedures for the demolition of such structures.  This Subchapter shall
also establish what constitutes a nuisance on public and private properties,
prohibit such nuisances, fix the responsibilities of owners, operators and
occupants of property and provide for administration, enforcement and civil
penalties.  The provisions of this Subchapter shall not be construed to
prevent the enforcement of other ordinances or regulations.

27-5   AMENDMENTS TO PROPERTY MAINTENANCE CODE.



27-5.01   Means of Appeal.



   In that a Code Enforcement Board has been established for the City of

Maintenance Code dealing with means of appeal is deleted in its entirety and
that Section shall henceforth read as follows:



   a.   Correction time.  The International Property Maintenance Code
is amended to provide that any request for additional time to come into
compliance shall be made by written application to the code official within
the time allowed in the correction order except as set out hereinbelow.  The
City may extend the correction time, in its sole discretion, if it determines
that the correction time is not reasonable given the facts of a particular
violation.  It shall be the duty of the violator to notify the City that
additional time is needed and to provide justification why the correction
time is inadequate.  Code officials are not authorized to grant requests for
additional time to correct an unsafe / problem structure as defined in
Subsection 27-5.02 (a) below and any request for additional time to correct
such a problem structure shall take the form of an appeal to the Bowling
Green Code Enforcement Board.  An appeal may be filed by any party with an
equitable interest in the property and any such appeal must be filed within
the remedy period specified in Subsection 27-5.02 (b).

27-5.02   Unsafe / Problem Structures.



   In that there is a need to establish a period of time an unsafe /

add the following:



   a.   An unsafe / problem structure is defined as a building or other

unsafe, unsanitary or which so utterly fails to provide the amenities
essential to decent living that it is unfit for human habitation or is likely
to cause sickness or disease or injury to health, safety or general welfare
of those living therein;



      3.   A building having light, air and sanitation facilities
that are inadequate to protect the health, safety or general welfare of human

or the elements.



   b.   When an unsafe / problem structure, not in danger of structural
collapse, has been closed and secured from entry and the elements by the
property owner and the structure continues to remain closed and secured from
entry and the elements by approved methods, it may remain standing in a safe
condition for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days from the date of the
condemnation, fire or damage from other means, or the date of the release of
the property from a governmental, criminal, fire or explosives investigation,
at which time an application must have been made for a building permit to
repair or for a demolition permit. If a building permit is requested and
approved, repair or renovation work to bring the property into compliance
must be completed within sixty (60) days of the date of the issuance of the

27-6   NUISANCES.



27-6.01   Purpose.



   Nuisances have the potential to create environments which annoy, injure
or endanger the comfort, health or safety of the public.  Nuisances hinder
neighborhood development and possibly diminish neighboring property values. 
It is the City’s desire to promote its neighborhoods and ensure that
property is maintained in accordance with this Code.  For the purposes of
this Subchapter, it shall not be essential that the nuisance be created or
contributed to by the owner, occupant or persons having control or management
of the property or premises, but merely that the nuisance be created or
contributed to by licensees, invitees, guests or other persons for whose
conduct the owner or operator is responsible, or by persons for whose conduct
the owner or operator is not responsible, but by the exercise of reasonable
care ought to have become aware.

   In addition to what is declared in this Subchapter to be a public
nuisance, those offenses which are known to the common law and in the
statutes of Kentucky as public nuisances may be treated as such and be
proceeded against as is provided in this Subchapter or in accordance with any

having considered the evidence in the matter, the Code Enforcement Board
dismisses the citation or that portion of the citation alleging weeds or
grass violations, the City may not recover the abatement costs to remedy the
alleged weeds or grass violations which were dismissed.

27-9   REPEAT OFFENDER.



27-9.01   Designation.



   A person shall be classified as a repeat offender only by the
recommendation of the code enforcement staff and action by the Code
Enforcement Board.  The code enforcement staff shall recommend that a person
be classified as a repeat offender with no less than fourteen (14) days’
notice to that person prior to the next Code Enforcement Board meeting. 
That person may appear at the Board meeting to contest the recommendation. 
The repeat offender designation shall be determined at the sole discretion of
the Code Enforcement Board and the Code Enforcement Board will establish a
period of time a person will remain in repeat offender status of no less than
twelve (12) months, but no longer than twenty-four (24) months. A person will
remain as a repeat offender for the appointed amount of time and until all
outstanding fines/fees are paid.  Citations used as justifications for
deeming a person a repeat offender cannot be used as justification for future
recommendations of repeat offender status.



(Ord. BG2011-6, 3/1/2011; Ord. BG2014-12, 8/5/2014)



27-9.02   Enforcement.



   In addition to all of the procedures set forth above, enforcement
action shall be enhanced against designated repeat offenders.  No personal
contact or notices of violation shall be required of the code enforcement
staff and the staff may cite designated repeat offenders immediately upon
confirmation of a code violation.  The code enforcement staff may also
institute a program of regular inspections involving properties of repeat
offenders without the necessity of complaints.  The names of designated
repeat offenders may be made public by use of the City’s website or other
appropriate means.



(Ord. BG2011-6, 3/1/2011)



27-9.03   Penalties.



   If a designated repeat offender is cited for a violation of the
provisions of Subchapters 27-4 (Property Maintenance Code), 27-5 (Amendments
to Property Maintenance Code) and / or 27-6 (Nuisances) set out hereinabove
and the citation is not contested, a maximum fine of one thousand two hundred
($1,200) dollars shall apply; however, the Code Enforcement Board may waive
any or all of that fine for an uncontested violation, if in its discretion,
the Board determines that such waiver will promote compliance with this
Chapter.  If the designated repeat offender contests the citation and a
hearing before the Board is required, the Board may impose a maximum fine of
two thousand four hundred ($2,400) dollars at the discretion of the Board. 
The Code Enforcement Board may also classify all such civil fines as daily
fines until the violation is remedied.  The Code Enforcement Board findings
that assess the civil fines and remedy charges against repeat offenders shall
also authorize the City to file civil actions in the appropriate Warren
County court against the repeat offender to collect the civil fines and
remedy charges, including foreclosure actions if deemed appropriate by the
City.

   --------------------



*   Editor’s Note: This Chapter was created in its entirety by Ord. No.
BG2007-13, April 17, 2007.



28-1   STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND
OBJECTIVES.



28-1.01   Statutory Authorization.



   The Kentucky General Assembly has in various Chapters of the Kentucky
Revised Statutes delegated to the City of Bowling Green the authority to
adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general
welfare of its citizens.



28-1.02   Findings of Fact.



   a.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Bowling Green are subject
to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.



   b.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and
by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or
otherwise protected from flood damage.



28-1.03   Statement of Purpose.



   It is the purpose of the provisions in this Chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
loss due to flooding by provisions designed to:



   a.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water erosion hazards or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity;



   b.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;



   c.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters;



   d.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase erosion or flood damage; and,



   e.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to
other areas.



28-1.04   Objectives.



   The objectives of this Chapter are to:



   a.   Protect human life and health;



   b.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;



   c.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;



   d.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;



   e.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;



   f.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas
in such a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by
flooding;



   g.   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is
in a Special Flood Hazard Area; and,



   h.   Ensure that those who occupy a Special Flood Hazard Area assume
responsibility for their actions.



28-2   DEFINITIONS.



   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this
Chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common
usage and to give this Chapter its most reasonable application.  Definitions
contained in the City-County Planning Commission’s Zoning Ordinance and
Subdivision Regulations as adopted by the City of Bowling Green may conflict
and are intended for use in those documents and shall not be used to
interpret the provisions of this Chapter.



   “A Zone” shall mean portions of the Special Flood Hazard Area
(SFHA) in which the principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall,
snowmelt or a combination of both.  In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly
or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. 
Areas of 100-year flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are
not determined.



   “Accessory structure (Appurtenant structure)” shall mean a
structure located on the same parcel of property as the principle structure,
the use of which is incidental to the use of the principle structure. 
Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not
be used for human habitation and should be designed to have minimal flood
damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages,
carports, storage sheds, pole barns and hay sheds.

   “AR/A1 – A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO and AR/A Zones” shall mean
Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a
previously accredited flood protection system that is in the process of being
restored to provide a 100-year or greater level of flood protection.  After
restoration is complete these areas will still experience residual flooding
from other flooding sources.



   “A99 Zone” shall mean that part of the SFHA inundated by the
100-year flood which is to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal
flood protection system under construction.  No base flood elevations are
determined.



   “Area of shallow flooding” shall mean a designated AO or AH Zone on
a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) where the base flood depths
range from one to three (3) feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the
path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and velocity flow may be
evident.  Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.



   “B and X Zones (shaded)” shall mean areas of the two tenths (0.2%)
percent annual chance (500-year) flood, areas subject to the 100-year flood
with average depths of less than one (1) foot or with contributing drainage
area less than one (1) square mile, and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.



   “Base flood” shall mean a flood which has a one (1%) percent chance
of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the 100-year
flood).  Base flood is the term used throughout this Chapter.

Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE,
AR/A1-A30, AR/AH and AR/AO that indicates the water surface elevation
resulting from a flood that has a 1 (1%) percent or greater chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.



   “Basement” shall mean that portion of a structure having its floor
subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides.



   “Building” shall mean a walled and roofed structure that is
principally aboveground, including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage
tank or other man-made facility or infrastructure.  See definition for
structure.



   “C and X (unshaded) Zones” shall mean areas determined to be
outside the 500-year floodplain.



   “Community” shall mean a political entity having the authority to
adopt and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.



   “Community Rating System (CRS)” shall mean a program developed by
the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) to provide incentives to those
communities in the Regular Program to go beyond the minimum floodplain
management requirements to develop extra measures for protection from
flooding.



   “Community Flood Hazard Area (CFHA)” shall mean an area that has
been determined by the Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated,
designated or qualified community official) from available technical studies,
historical information and other available and reliable sources, which may be
subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare. Included are areas downstream from
dams.



   “Critical facility” shall mean any property that, if flooded, would
result in severe consequences to public health and safety or a facility
which, if unusable or unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and
adversely affect the health and safety of the public.  Critical facilities
include but are not limited to:



      1)   housing likely to contain occupants not sufficiently
mobile to avoid injury or death unaided during a flood schools;



      2)   nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency
response installations;



      3)   vehicle and equipment storage facilities, emergency
operations centers likely to be called upon before, during and after a flood;



      4)   public and private utility facilities important to
maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after a flood;
and,



      5)   those facilities or installations which produce, use or
store volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials,
hazardous materials or hazardous waste.



   “D Zone” shall mean an area in which the flood hazard is
undetermined.



   “Development” shall mean any manmade change to improved or
unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other

non-residential structures.



   “Elevation Certificate” shall mean a statement certified by a
registered professional engineer or surveyor on the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) approved form in effect at the time of certification
that verifies a structure’s elevation and other related information to
verify compliance with this Chapter.



   “Emergency Program” shall mean the initial phase under which a
community participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP),
intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at subsidized rates on
all insurable structures in that community before the effective date of the
initial Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).



   “Enclosure” shall mean that portion of a structure below the Base
Flood Elevation (BFE) used solely for parking of vehicles, limited storage or
access to the structure.



   “Encroachment” shall mean the physical advance or infringement of
uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, structures, permanent structures or
development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of
a floodplain.



   “Existing construction” shall mean any structure for which the
start of construction commenced before the effective date of the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or before January 1, 1975 for FIRM is effective
before that date.  “Existing construction” may also be referred to as
“Existing structures.”



   “Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” shall mean a
manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including, at a minimum the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the first floodplain
management ordinance adopted by the City of Bowling Green based on specific
technical base flood elevation data which established the area of special
flood hazards.



   “Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision”
shall mean the preparation of additional sites by the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be

streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).



   “Five Hundred-Year Flood (500-Year Flood)” shall mean the flood
that has a two tenths (0.2 %) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any year.  Areas subject to the 500-year flood have a moderate to low risk
of flooding.



   “Flood, flooding or flood water” shall mean:



      a.   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal
waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source; and/or mudslides (i.e. mudflows).



      b.   The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.



   “Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)” shall mean a map on which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance
Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and the
regulatory floodway.



   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)” shall mean a map on which the
boundaries of the flood, mudslide (i.e. mudflow) and flood-related erosion
areas having special hazards have been designated as Zones A, M and/or E by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance
Administration (FIA).



   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” shall mean a map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance
Administration (FIA) has delineated special flood hazard areas and risk
premium zones.



   “Flood Insurance Study” (FIS) shall mean the report provided by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance
Administration (FIA) containing flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) and/or the Flood Boundary Floodway Map (FBFM) and the water surface
elevation of the base flood.



   “Floodplain or flood-prone area” shall mean any land area
susceptible to being inundated by flood waters from any source.



   “Floodplain Administrator” shall mean the individual appointed by a
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) participating community to administer
and enforce the floodplain management ordinances.



   “Floodplain management” shall mean the operation of an overall
program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and
preserving and enhancing natural resources in the floodplain, including but
not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain
management ordinances and open space plans.



   “Floodplain management regulations” shall mean the provisions of
this Chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building
codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and
erosion control) and other applications of police power which control
development in flood-prone areas.  This term describes federal, state and/or
local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for
the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.



   “Floodproofing” shall mean any combination of structural and
non-structural additions, changes or adjustments to structures which reduce
or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and
sanitation facilities, structures and their contents.



   “Floodproofing Certificate” shall mean a certification by a
registered professional engineer or architect on a FEMA-approved form in
effect at the time of certification stating that a non-residential structure,
together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to a
specified design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to
the passage of water and all structural components are capable of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy
and anticipated debris impact forces.



   “Floodway” shall mean the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more
than one foot.  Also referred to as the regulatory floodway.



   “Floodway fringe” shall mean that area of the floodplain on either
side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without
additional hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis.



   “Freeboard” shall mean a factor of safety, usually expressed in
feet above the Base Flood Elevation (BFE), which is applied for the purposes
of floodplain management.  It is used to compensate for the many unknown
factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than those calculated
for the base flood.  Freeboard must be applied not just to the elevation of
the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to the level of protection
provided to all components of the structure, such as building utilities, HVAC
components, etc.



   “Fraud and victimization” shall mean, as related in the Appeals and
Variance Procedures of this Chapter, the variance granted must not cause
fraud on or victimization of the public.  In examining this requirement, the
City of Bowling Green will consider the fact that every newly constructed
structure adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the
community for fifty (50) to one (100) hundred years.  Structures that are
permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during
all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners
of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs,
inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flood damages may
incur.  In addition, future owners may purchase the property unaware that it
is subject to potential flood damage and can be insured only at very high
flood insurance rates.



   “Functionally dependent use facility” shall mean a facility,
structure or other development which cannot be used for its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water.  The term
includes only a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and
unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair or seafood
processing facilities.  The term does not include long-term storage,
manufacture, sales or service facilities.



   “Governing body” shall mean the City of Bowling Green.



   “Hazard potential” shall mean the possible adverse incremental
consequences that result from the release of water or stored contents due to
failure of a dam or misoperation of a dam or appurtenances.  The hazard
potential classification of a dam does not reflect in any way the current
condition of a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural
integrity, flood routing capacity).



   “Highest adjacent grade” shall mean the highest natural elevation
of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.



   “Historic structure” shall mean any structure that is:

   “Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC)” provides for the payment of a
claim for the cost to comply with State or community floodplain management
laws or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building
covered by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) under the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP) sustains a loss and the state or community declares
the building to be substantially or repetitively damaged, ICC will help pay
up to thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) for the cost to elevate, floodproof,
demolish or remove the building.  ICC coverage is available on residential
and non-residential buildings (this category includes public or government
buildings, such as schools, libraries and municipal buildings) insured under
the NFIP.

bodies, shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or
improvement of any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other
obstruction (except those constructed by the Department of Highways) across
or along any stream, or in the floodway of any stream. Unless, the plans and
specifications for such work have been submitted by the person or political
subdivision responsible for the construction, reconstruction or improvement
and such plans and specifications have been approved in writing by the
Cabinet and a permit issued. However, the Cabinet by regulation may exempt
those dams, embankments or other obstructions which are not of such size or

a river or stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling,
raising or obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the
channel or in the floodway of the stream; unless, plans and specifications
for such work have been submitted to and approved by the Cabinet and a permit
issued as required in hereinabove.



      c.   Nothing in this section is intended to give the Cabinet
any jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction,
improvement, enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district,

28-3   GENERAL PROVISIONS.



28-3.01   Lands to Which this Chapter Applies.



   This Chapter shall apply to all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) and,
as determined by the Floodplain Administrator or other delegated, designated
or qualified community official as determined by the City of Bowling Green
from available technical studies, historical information and other available
and reliable sources, areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Bowling
Green which may be subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that can
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of the
citizens of the City of Bowling Green.



28-3.02   Basis for Establishing the Special Flood Hazard Areas.



   The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Warren
County, dated May 2, 2007, with the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRMS), other supporting data and any subsequent amendments thereto, are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of these regulations by
the City of Bowling Green, and for those land areas acquired by the City of
Bowling Green through annexation.  This Flood Insurance Study and attendant
mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this Chapter and may be
supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this
ordinance and which are recommended to the City of Bowling Green by the
Floodplain Administrator and are enacted by the City of Bowling Green
pursuant to statutes governing land use management regulations.  The Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and/or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) are permanent
records of the City of Bowling Green and are on file and available for review
by the public during regular business hours at the City-County Planning
Commission office at 1141 State Street, Bowling Green, Kentucky, 42101.



(Ord. BG2007-21, 6/5/2007)



28-3.03   Establishment of Development Permit.



   A Development Permit shall be required in conformance with the
provision of this Chapter prior to the commencement of any development
activities in the special flood hazard areas (SFHA).  Application for a
development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the Floodplain
Administrator.



28-3.04   Compliance.



   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of
this Chapter and other applicable state regulations. Violation of the
requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with conditions) shall constitute a violation.  Nothing herein
shall prevent the City of Bowling Green from taking such lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.



28-3.05   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.



   This Chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions.  However, where this Chapter and
another regulations, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.



28-3.06   Interpretation.



   In the interpretation and application of this Chapter, all provisions
shall be:



   a.   Considered minimum requirements;



   b.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,



   c.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes.



28-3.07   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.



   The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations.  Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.  Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes.  This Chapter does
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. 
This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Bowling
Green, Warren County or the Bowling Green – Warren County Commission, their
officers or employees, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the Federal Insurance
Administration or the Federal Emergency Management Agency for any flood
damages that result from reliance on the provisions of this Chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

28-4   ADMINISTRATION.



28-4.01   Designation of Local Administrator.



   The Board of Commissioners of the City of Bowling Green hereby appoints
the Executive Director of the City-County Planning Commission or to his/her
designee to administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this Chapter
by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions
and that petition is herein referred to as the Floodplain Administrator.



28-4.02   Establishment of Development Permit.



   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any special flood hazard area established above. 
Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the
Floodplain Administrator prior to permit can be processed. Specifically, the
following information is required: any development activities, and may
include, but not be limited to the following:  1) plans in duplicate drawn
to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions and elevations of the area
in question; 2) existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials
and drainage facilities; and 3) the location of the foregoing.  The
endorsement of the Floodplain Administrator is required before a state
floodplain construction permit can be processed.  Specifically, the
following information is required:



   a.   Application Stage:



      1.   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level (MSL) of
the proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A
and elevation of highest adjacent grade; or,



      2.   Proposed elevation in relation to Mean Sea Level to which
any non-residential structure will be flood-proofed.



      3.   All appropriate certifications from a registered
professional engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed
structure will meet the flood-proofing criteria as provided herein.



      4.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will
be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.



   b.   Construction Stage:



      1.   Upon placement of the lowest floor and before
construction continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it
shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain
Administrator and to the state a certification of the elevation of the lowest
floor or flood-proofed elevation as built in relation to Mean Sea Level.  In
AE, A1-30 and A zones where the City of Bowling Green has adopted a
regulatory Base Flood Elevation, the certification shall be prepared by or
under the direct supervision of and certified by a registered land surveyor
or professional engineer.



      2.   When flood proofing is utilized for a particular
structure, the certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a certified professional engineer or architect.  Any
continued work undertaken prior to the submission of the certification shall
be at the permit holder’s risk.  The Floodplain Administrator shall review
the lowest floor and flood proofing elevation survey data submitted. 
Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder
immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted to
proceed.  Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said corrections
required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.



28-4.03   Duties and Responsibilities of the Local Administrator.



   a.   The Floodplain Administrator and/or staff is hereby appointed,
authorized and directed to administer, implement and enforce the provisions

         c)   Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible
manner; and,



         d)   The proposed development does not adversely affect
the carrying capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this Chapter,
"adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development
will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one
foot at any point.



      2.   Review and use of other base flood data when base flood
elevation data has not been provided above. The Floodplain Administrator
shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and
floodway data available from a federal or state agency or other source in
order to administer the provisions of this Chapter.  Any such information
shall be submitted to the City of Bowling Green for adoption.



      3.   Notification of other agencies:

as to the exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas,
for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary
and actual field conditions:



         a)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, the Floodplain
Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.  The person
contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation;



         b)   When base flood elevation data or floodway data
have not been provided, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from
a federal, state or other source in order to administer the provisions of
this Chapter;



         c)   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular
structure, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain a floodproofing
certification from a registered professional engineer or architect in
accordance with this Chapter; and,



         d)   All records pertaining to the provisions of this
Chapter shall be maintained in the office of the Floodplain Administrator and
shall be open for public inspection.



      6.   Right of Entry.



         a)   Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce
any of the provisions of this Chapter, or whenever the Floorplain
Administrator has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any
structure or upon any premises any condition or ordinance violation which
makes such building, structure or premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous,
the administrator or other designated code officials may enter such building,
structure or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or perform
any duty imposed upon the administrator by this Chapter.



         b)   If such structure or premises are occupied, the

other persons having charge or control of such request entry.



         c)   If entry is refused, the Floodplain Administrator
or other designated code official shall have recourse to every remedy
provided by law to secure entry.



         d)   When the Floodplain Administrator or other code
official shall have first obtained a proper inspection warrant or other
remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner or occupant or any other
persons having charge, care or control of any building, structure or premises
shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as herein provided, to
promptly permit entry therein by the Floodplain Administrator or other
designated code official for the purpose of inspection and examination
pursuant to this Chapter.



      7.   Stop Work Orders.



   Upon notice from the Floodplain Administrator or other designated code
officials, work on any building, structure or premises that is being done
contrary to the provisions of this Chapter shall immediately cease.  Such

any provision of this Chapter shall be defended by the City’s Department of
Law or the attorney for the City-County Planning Commission until the final
termination of the proceedings.



      10.   Expiration of Floodplain Construction Permit.



   A floodplain construction permit and all provisions contained therein
shall expire if the holder of a floodplain construction permit has not
commenced construction within one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days from
the date of its issuance by the Floodplain Administrator.



28-5   PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.



28-5.01   General Construction Standards.



   The City-County Planning Commission Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision
Regulations as adopted by the City establish a Floodplain District based on
the Special Flood Hazard Areas defined in this Chapter and prohibits new
construction and substantial improvements within the Floodplain District. 
As a result, lowest adjacent grade of a structure is typically above the base
flood elevation and floodproofing of structures near Special Flood Hazard
Areas is not required.  The City recognizes that Non-Conforming Structures
as defined in the Zoning Ordinance do exist.  The following provisions are
established in the event new construction and substantial improvements are
permitted within the Special Flood Hazard Area.  Applicable portions of
these provisions shall also be used when permitting development on parcels of
land contiguous to Special Flood Hazard Areas.  In all Special Flood Hazard
Areas, the following provisions are required:



   a.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the
effects of buoyancy;



   b.   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement.  Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to use of over-the-top or fame ties to ground anchors.  This
standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state
requirements for resisting wind forces;



   c.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;



   d.   New construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;



   e.   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air condition
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding;



   f.   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;



   g.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters;



   h.   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed
to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;



   i.   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a
structure which is not in compliance with the provisions of this Chapter
shall meet the requirements of “new construction” as contained in this
Chapter, and;



   j.   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a
structure which is not in compliance with the provisions of this Chapter,
shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or
replaced.



28-5.02   Specific Standards.



   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have
been provided, the following provisions are required:



   a.   Residential Construction.  New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have
the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment and ductwork
elevated no lower than one and a half (1.5) feet above the base flood
elevation.  Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of
floodwaters shall be presided in accordance with this Chapter.



      1.   In an A Zone where no technical data has been produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency elevated one and a half (1.5) feet
above the base flood elevation as determined by this community, the
Floodplain Administrator will determine the method by which base flood
elevations are determined.  Methods include, but are not limited to detailed
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use of existing data available from other
sources, use of historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgment in
the event no data can be produced. Title 401 of the Kentucky Administrative
Regulations Chapter 4, Regulation 060, Section 5(5)a, states as a part of the
technical requirements for a State Floodplain Permit: 1) the applicant shall
provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby Base
Flood Elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not
available; 2) All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and
shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than + five-tenths (0.5)
foot; 3) cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which
represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic
characteristics of the base floodplain change; 4) each cross section shall
extend across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at
the locations specified by the cabinet; and 5) if necessary to ensure that
significant flood damage will not occur, the Cabinet may require additional
cross sections or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed
for making routine regulatory floodway boundary calculations.



      2.   In all other Zones, elevated one and a half (1.5) feet
above the base flood elevation, upon the completion of the structure, the
elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a
registered professional engineer or surveyor and verified by the Housing and
Community Development, Buildings and Inspections Division to be properly
elevated.  Such certification and verification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.



   b.   Non-residential Construction.  New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or non-residential structure
(including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes) shall be
elevated to conform with the provisions of this Chapter or together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities:



      1.   Be floodproofed below an elevation one and a half (1.5)
feet above the level of the base flood elevation so that the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;



      2.   Have structural components capable of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;



      3.   Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical
equipment and ductwork, elevated no lower than one and a half (1.5) feet
above the level of the base flood elevation; and,



      4.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall
certify that the standards of this Section are satisfied.  Such
certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.



      5.   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in this
Section.



      6.   All new construction and substantial improvement with
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage and which
are subject to flooding shall be constructed of flood resistant materials
below an elevationone and a half (1.5) feet above the base flood elevation
and shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater.  Opening
sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet
or exceed the following minimum criteria:



         a)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer
or architect; or,



         b)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total net
area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher
than one (1) foot above grade.  Openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the
automatic entry and exit of floodwater.



   c.   Elevated Structures. New construction or substantial
improvements of elevated structures on columns, posts or pilings (e.g.) that
include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls
below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living
space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.



      1.   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the
following minimum criteria:



         a)   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a
total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding;



         b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than
one (1) foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in
elevation or higher than the exterior foundation grade); and,



         c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow
of floodwaters in both directions.



      2.   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum
necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage
of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard
exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator);



      3.   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms;



      4.   The total floor area of all such enclosed areas shall not
exceed 300 square feet; and,



      5.   For enclosures greater than seven (7) feet in interior
height, where elevation requirements exceed six (6) feet above the highest
adjacent grade, a copy of the legally recorded deed restriction prohibiting
the conversion of the area below the lowest floor to a use or dimension
contrary to the structures’ originally approved design shall be presented
as a condition of issue of the final Certificate of Occupancy.



   d.   Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles. 
All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed on sites located
within A, A1-30 and AE on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all
the requirements for new construction, including elevation and anchoring.



      1.   Locations include:



         a)   On individual lots or parcels;



         b)   In expansions to existing manufactured home parks
or subdivisions;



         c)   In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions;



         d)   In substantially improved manufactured home parks
or subdivisions;



         e)   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision,
or,



         f)   In an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred
"substantial damage" as the result of a flood.



      2.   All Manufactured homes must be:



         a)   Elevated on a permanent foundation;



         b)   Have its lowest floor elevated no lower thanone and
a half (1.5) feet above the level of the base flood elevation, and,



         c)   Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.



      3.   Excepting manufactured homes that have incurred
substantial damage as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or
substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
must be elevated so that:



         a)   The manufactured home is securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and
lateral movement, so that either the lowest floor of the manufactured home is
elevated no lower than one and a half (1.5) feet above the level of the base
flood elevation, or the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced
piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength of no
less than thirty six (36) inches in height above the highest adjacent grade.



      4.   All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within
A, A1-30 and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must
either:



         a)   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred and
eighty (180) consecutive days;



         b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or,



         c)   Meet the permit requirements for new construction
of this Chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements for
“manufactured homes.”



   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed and
insured in accordance with the Commonwealth of Kentucky motor vehicle
regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only
by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions.



   e.   Floodways.  Located within areas of special flood hazard
established above are areas designated as floodways.  Since the floodway is
an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply: Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial  improvements and other developments unless
certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any
increase in the base flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood
discharge; and if this provision is satisfied all new construction and
substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this Chapter.



   f.   Standards for Utilities.



      1.   All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage
systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate:



         a)    Infiltration of flood waters into the systems, and,



         b)   Discharge from the systems into flood waters.



      2.    On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.



   g.   Structures Elevated on Fill.



      1.   A residential or non-residential structure may be
constructed on permanent fill in accordance with the following:



         a)   The lowest floor (including basement) of the
structure or addition shall be no lower than one and a half (1.5) feet above
the base flood elevation;



         b)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than
one (1) foot deep before compacting and should extend at least ten (10) feet
beyond the foundation of the structure before sloping below the base flood
elevation, said slope being no greater than 2:1 ratio unless stability
analysis is provided by a registered professional engineer;



         c)   The top of the fill shall be no lower than one and
a half (1.5) feet above the base flood elevation. However, the ten (10) foot
minimum may be waived if a structural engineer certifies an alternate method
to protect the structure from damage due to erosion, scour and other
hydrodynamic forces; and,



         d)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow or
surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties.



         e)   All new structures built on fill must be
constructed on property designed and compacted fill (ASTM-D-698 or
equivalent) that extends beyond the building walls before dropping below the
base flood elevation and has appropriate protection from erosion and scour.
The design of the fill or the fill standard must be approved by a licensed
professional engineer; and,



         f)   Soil testing and compaction requirements shall be
conducted as set forth by the applicable Kentucky Building Code.



   h.   Vegetative Buffer Strips (Riparian Zones). For all activities
involving construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria
shall be met:



      1.   A natural vegetative buffer strip shall be preserved
within at least twenty five (25) feet of the mean high water level of the
channel; and,



      2.   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip
during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall
be established upon completion of construction. The use of native riparian
vegetation is preferred in the buffer strip.  Access through this buffer
strip shall be provided for stream maintenance purposes.



28-5.03   Standards for Streams Without Established Base Flood Elevation
(Unnumbered A Zones and/or Floodways).



   Located within the special flood hazard areas established this Chapter,
where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where
base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions
apply:



   a.   No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall
be located within special flood hazard areas unless certification by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the
City.  The engineering certification should be supported by technical data
that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles; and,



   b.   New construction or substantial improvements of structures
shall be elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance
with this Chapter.



28-5.04   Standards for Subdivision Proposals.



   a.   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood
hazard area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damage;



   b.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage; and,



   c.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided
to reduce exposure to flood hazards.



   d.   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not
available (Zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway
data for subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including
manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than fifty (50) lots or
five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall be provided.



   e.   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed
structure(s) and lowest adjacent grade.  If the site is filled above the
base flood elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations
shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and
provided to the Floodplain Administrator.



28-5.05   Standards for Accessory Structures in All Zones Beginning with
the Letter “A.”



   For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated
‘A’ the following provisions shall apply:



   a.   Structure must be non-habitable;



   b.   Must be anchored to resist floatation forces;



   c.   Shall require flood openings/vents no more than one (1) foot
above grade and total openings are to be one (1) square inch per one (1)
square foot of floor area with at least two (2) openings required on opposite
walls;



   d.   Built of flood resistant materials below a level one and a half
(1.5) feet above the base flood elevation;



   e.   Must elevate utilities above the base flood elevation;



   f.   Can only be used for storage or parking; and,



   g.   Cannot be modified for a different use after permitting.



28-5.06   Critical Facilities.



   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent
possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). 
Construction of new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the
floodway; however, they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available.  Critical facilities constructed within the
SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the level of
the base flood elevation at the site.  Floodproofing and sealing measures
must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or
released into floodwaters.  Access routes elevated to or above the level of
the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the
extent possible.



28-6   VARIANCE PROCEDURES.



28-6.01   Nature of Variances.



   a.   The variance criteria set forth in this subchapter are based on
the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of
property and are not personal in nature.  A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying
with the requirements of this subchapter would create an exceptional hardship
to the applicant or the surrounding property owners.  The characteristics
must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels.  The
unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure,
its inhabitants or the property owners.



   b.   It is the duty of the City of Bowling Green through the
City-County Planning Commission to help protect its citizens from flooding. 
This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a
structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood
elevation or from other requirements in this Chapter are quite rare. The
long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be
met if variances are strictly limited.  Therefore, the variance guidelines
provided in this subchapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions
that must be met before a variance can be properly granted.  The criteria
are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than
a variance are more appropriate.



      1.   Designation of variance and appeal board.



   The City of Bowling Green hereby establishes the Bowling Green –
Warren County Board of Adjustments as the body to hear requests for variances
and the City of Bowling Green Code Enforcement Board as the body to hear and
decide appeals.



      2.   Duties of variance and appeals board.



         a)   The Board of Adjustments shall hear and decide
requests for variances from the requirements of this subchapter and the Code
Enforcement Board shall hear appeals of decisions or determinations made by
the Floodplain Administrator or designated code officials in the enforcement
or administration of this subchapter.



         b)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of either body
may appeal such decision to the appropriate court as provided in the Kentucky
Revised Statutes.



      3.   Variance Procedures.



   In passing upon  applications for variances, the Board of Adjustments
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors and all
standards specified in other sections of this Chapter, and the:



         a)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands
to the injury of others;



         b)     Danger to life and property due to flooding or
erosion damage;



         c)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its
contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing
individual owner and future owners of the property;



         d)   Importance to the community of the services
provided by the proposed facility;



         e)   Necessity that the facility be located on a
waterfront in the case of functionally dependent facility;



         f)   Availability of alternative locations which are not
subject to flooding or erosion damage;



         g)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;



         h)   Relationship of the proposed use to the
comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;



         i)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood
for ordinary and emergency vehicles;



         j)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise
and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and,



         k)   Costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets and
bridges.



      4.   Conditions for Variances.



   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this
subchapter, the Board of Adjustments may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
Chapter.



         a)   Generally, variances may be issued for new
construction, substantial improvement and other proposed new development to
be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood
level, providing that the procedures set forth in this Chapter have been
fully considered.  As the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.



         b)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped
regulatory floodway, if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.



         c)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination
that the variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the
flood hazard.  "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of
deviation from the requirements of this Chapter.  For example, in the case
of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the Board of Adjustments
need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to
whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which
the Board of Adjustments believes will both provide relief and preserve the
integrity of the provisions setout hereinabove.



         d)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination
that the variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering
the flood hazard.  In the instance of an historical structure, a
determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to
afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the
structure.



         e)   Variances shall only be issued upon:



            (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;



            (2)   A determination that failure to grant the
variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in
this subchapter); and,



            (3)   A determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood height, additional threats to
public safety, cause extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as
defined in the definition section under "Public safety and nuisance"), cause
fraud or victimization of the public (as defined in the definition section)
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.



         f)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall
be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood
elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.



         g)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the
records of all variance actions and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration
(FIA) upon request.



         h)     Variances may be issued for new construction,
substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of this
Chapter are satisfied and that the structure or other development is
protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and
does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a
public nuisance.



      5.   Variance Notification.



   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:



         a)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars ($25) for one
hundred dollars ($100) of insurance coverage; and,



         b)   Such construction below the base flood level
increases risks to life and property.  A copy of the notice shall be
recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Warren County
Clerk and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of
title of the affected parcel of land.



         c)     The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a
record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance,
and report such variances issued in the biannual report submission to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.



      6.   Historic Structures.



   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure
and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.



      7.   No Impact Certification within the Floodway.



   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway,
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

Warren County Joint Zoning Ordinance
-----------------------------------------------------------
1-1
ARTICLE 1
GENERAL PROVISIONS
SEC. 1.1 SHORT TITLE
This Joint Zoning Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the “Warren County Zoning Ordinance” or “this Ordinance.”
SEC. 1.2 AUTHORITY
Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) 100.201 gives legislative bodies and fiscal courts the authority to enact permanent land use regulations, including zoning and growth management regulations.
SEC. 1.3 EFFECTIVE DATE
This ordinance, as amended, original effective date of December 1, 2001, shall be in full force and effect after adoption by all legislative bodies.
SEC. 1.4 PURPOSE
A. The purpose of this Joint Zoning Ordinance is to prescribe, regulate, restrict and limit for the purpose of promoting the public health, safety, or general welfare, regulations of and restrictions upon the erection, construction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures or land, including regulations and restrictions of the height, number of stories, and size of buildings and other structures, the size of the yards, courts and other open spaces, the density of population, and the location and use of such buildings, structures and land for trade, industry, residence or other purposes.
B. This Ordinance is also intended to provide a method of administration and enforcement and penalties for the violation of its provisions.
SEC. 1.5 ZONING AFFECTS EVERY STRUCTURE OR USE
No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure or part thereof shall be erected, moved or altered, unless for a use expressly permitted by and in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the zoning district in which it is located, except that any structure damaged or destroyed may be restored if such structure does not involve a nonconforming use.
SEC. 1.6 MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare.
SEC. 1.7 CONFLICT WITH EXISTING LAW
It is not intended by this Ordinance to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair or interfere with any existing provisions of law, ordinance or resolution, or with any rules, regulations, or permits previously adopted or issued, or which shall be adopted or issued pursuant to law relating to the use of buildings, or premises, or with any private restrictions placed upon property by covenant, deed or recorded plat; provided, however, that where this Ordinance imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or premises or upon the heights of buildings or requires greater lot areas, larger yards, courts or other open spaces than are imposed or required by such existing provisions of law, ordinance or resolution, or by such rules, regulations, or permits or by such private restrictions, the provisions of this Ordinance shall control.
SEC. 1.8 CONFLICTS WITH ORDINANCES, PRIVATE COVENANTS AND DEEDS
In case of conflict between this Ordinance or any part thereof, and the whole or part of any existing or future ordinance of the City of Bowling Green, City of Oakland, City of Plum Springs, City of Smiths Grove, City of Woodburn and Warren County or the whole or part of any existing or future private covenants or deeds, the most restrictive shall in all cases apply.
Article 1
------------------------------------------------
General Provisions
Warren County Joint Zoning Ordinance
-----------------------------------------------------------
1-2
SEC. 1.9 VALIDITY
If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this Ordinance shall be held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect any other section, clause, provision or portion of this Ordinance which is not in itself invalid or unconstitutional.
SEC. 1.10 RIGHT TO FARM POLICY
In addition to the purposes set out above, there is hereby established a "Right-to-Farm" policy. See also Sec. 7.4, Enforcement Actions Involving Agricultural Operators.
A. Any agricultural operation or practice that is historical, traditional, legitimate and reasonable shall be protected. Any new or expanded agricultural operation or practice that is legitimate and reasonable shall be encouraged.
B. Agriculture, as a way of life, benefits all residents of Warren County. It is an important part of the economy and adds intrinsic value to life in Warren County. Agriculture, as a business, brings with it noise, odors, dust, mud, smoke and other inconveniences such as weed burning, equipment and livestock on public roads, odors from manure and feeds, odors from chemical applications, lights and noises at all hours of the day and night, and on-farm processing and marketing of crops and livestock. To maintain this way of life, Warren County intends to protect agricultural operators from unnecessary, intrusive litigation. Therefore, no inconvenience shall be considered a nuisance as long as it occurs as a part of non-negligent and legal agricultural practice.
SEC. 1.11 LANDLOCKED POLICY
The purpose of this policy is to deal with property which is for all intents and purposes, landlocked, having less than the required frontage on a public right-of-way.
A. The Planning Commission has adopted a policy which allows for the recording, for financing purposes only, of landlocked properties.
B. In order to be accepted for this "special recordation" the landlocked parcel shall be surveyed and a plat prepared and recorded.
C. The property must otherwise meet the minimum requirements of this Ordinance and the Subdivision Regulations of Warren County.
D. The recording plat shall have a certification on its face above the owner's signature which states, that the property shall only be conveyed in its entirety; that no further subdivision of the property which does not eliminate the landlocked status shall be permitted; and that no building permit will be issued for the placement of any additional structures.
E. This certification is binding on the property, regardless of ownership, until such time as the required frontage on a public way is obtained.
F. Applicants for this "special recordation" shall provide evidence to the Planning Commission at a public hearing that all other means of acquiring adequate frontage have been exhausted. Inconvenience or being unwilling to incur reasonable costs is not acceptable proof.
G. For all intents and purposes, the landlocked parcel shall be considered a non-conforming lot of record (see also Sec. 6.4)

2. That the proposed development is limited to agriculture, single family residential or institutional use and that each lot created is at least one acre in size, and has at least 20,000 square feet of lot area outside of any drainage easements and/or floodplains; AND a site evaluation by the Barren River District Health Department certifies that a conventional septic system is acceptable, or
3. That it is a commercial use, located on at least one acre, and has at least 20,000 square feet of lot area outside of any drainage easements and/or floodplains, AND a site evaluation by the Barren River District Health Department certifies that a conventional septic system is acceptable, or
4. That it is an industrial use, located on at least one acre, and has at least 20,000 square feet of lot area outside of any drainage easements and/or floodplains, AND a site evaluation by the Barren River District Health Department certifies that a conventional septic system is acceptable.
1.12.3 Nonconforming Lots Not Within 2,000 Feet of Public Sewer
A. Development of land greater than 2,000 feet from existing public sanitary sewer located on a nonconforming lot of record must demonstrate the following:

SEC. 1.13 FIRE PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS
1.13.1 At the time of the filing of any application for a building permit, site work permit, public water lines shall be available to the site sufficient to meet the fire protection standards in accordance with:
A. All property located within the designated Bowling Green/ Warren County Urbanized Area: 600 gallons per minute at 20 pounds of residual pressure.
B. All property located outside the designated Bowling Green/ Warren County Urbanized Area: 250 gallons per minute with 20 pounds of residual pressure for agriculture, rural residential and/or residential estate districts and 600 gallons per minute at 20 pounds of residual pressure for all other districts.
C. In lieu of meeting these requirements, an alternative fire protection plan, prepared by a professional engineer meeting the appropriate specifications of NFPA 13, 13D, 13R, 750 and/or 1142, may be approved by the Warren County Public Works Director.
D. At the time of the filing of any application for a site work permit or building permit, the Fire Protection requirements for agriculture, rural residential and residential estate districts in the Warren County unincorporated area may be waived, if proper documentation is recorded at the Warren County Courthouse, either by way of land use certificate or plat. The following note shall be included on such document: “At the time of recordation of this document, the water provided to this property did not meet the Fire Control Standards of Warren County, as outlined in Section 1.13 of the Zoning Ordinance.” Proof of documentation must be provided before a building permit will be issued.
SEC. 1.14 SIGHT DISTANCE
No structure, fence, or vegetation shall be permitted to obscure the vision of the public at any street, alley or driveway intersection, in accordance with the sight distance regulations of the applicable agency (KYTC, Bowling Green Public Works or Warren County Public Works).
SEC. 1.15 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS
1.15.1 Plans Filed, Building Permits
In any case where plans and specifications (including a recorded plat or site development plan) have been filed with the Building Inspector or Planning Commission staff and are complete prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, and the plans and specifications are for a building or structure that would conform with the regulations effective at the date of such filing, but not with this Ordinance, a building permit for such building or structure shall be issued.
1.15.2 Expiration of General or Site Development Plans
Where no significant development activity (issuance of site work or building permits, construction of improvements, recording of plat, etc.) has occurred for a period of five years following the final action on the project, development plans approved as part of a re-zoning, conditional use permit or other approval prior to the effective date of this Ordinance shall expire. The Planning Commission may, in their sole discretion, extend such development plans for an additional period not to exceed two years, provided that the land owner intends to begin development within the two-year period. In the absence of such an extension, further development permits in reliance on the development plan may require the approval of a new development plan in accordance with this Ordinance.

2. Rules for Computing Requirements. The following rules apply when computing off-street parking and loading requirements.
a. Fractions. When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, any fraction of less than 1/2 will be rounded down to the next lower whole number and any fraction ½ or more will be rounded up to the next higher whole number.
b. Unlisted Uses. For a use not specifically listed in the table above, the Executive Director shall apply the off-street parking standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or require an alternative parking study in accordance with this section.
3. Change in Use. Where the principal use is changed to a use for which additional parking is required under the provisions of this ordinance, it shall be unlawful to begin or maintain such altered use until the required off-street parking is provided and the site is brought into compliance with all other applicable provisions of this ordinance including, paving and landscaping.
4. Alternative Parking Study. Some uses have widely varying parking demand characteristics, making it impossible to specify a single off-street parking standard. A developer proposing to develop or expand such a use may submit an alternative parking study that provides justification for the number of off-street parking spaces proposed.
a. A parking study must include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by the Planning Commission and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study must document the source of data used to develop the recommendations.
(1) The Planning Commission shall review the parking study and any other traffic engineering and planning data relevant to the establishment of an appropriate off-street parking standard for the proposed use. After reviewing the parking study, the Planning Commission shall establish a minimum off-street parking standard for the proposed use.
b. In addition to minimum parking required per parking study, the Planning Commission may require additional, unpaved area be designated and set aside for future use.
5. Temporary Parking. City or County agencies may issue a permit to park vehicles on a gravel surface for a period of up to one (1) year in relation to expansion or redevelopment of an existing site nearby. Screening of the temporary parking area from incompatible uses may be required. The area shall be designed for the safe ingress and egress of vehicles to the street and in such a way that mud and gravel will not be carried onto adjacent streets. Before the approved time period expires, the area shall be paved and landscaped as required by the zoning ordinance or gravel removed, the land graded and sodded or seeded in grass. An extension may granted if the construction period lasts longer than one (1) year.

SEC. 4.8 SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICTS
4.8.1 Planned Unit Development (PUD)
A. The purpose of a PUD is to encourage and allow more creative and imaginative design of land development than is possible under conventional zoning regulations. The PUD zone provides more flexibility in terms of development standards and requirements such as setback and yard area, lot size and dimensions and building height. Ideally, this flexibility results in development that is better planned, contains more amenities and is more desirable to live and work in and, ultimately, provides substantial benefits to the community and environment compared to conventional zoning districts.
Each PUD shall be properly planned and designed and comply with the following objectives:
1. All PUDs should promote design creativity and excellence that will result in high quality development;
2. PUDs should allow for a mixture of land uses and building types not otherwise allowed in a conventional zoning district by careful planning that establishes compatible relationships between uses within the site and uses adjacent to the site;
3. PUDs should allow a mixture of different land uses and building types in an innovative and functionally efficient manner;
4. All PUDs should be reviewed for consistency with the adopted Comprehensive Plan
B. Uses Permitted. Uses shall be limited to those identified in the approved general development plan for the PUD.
C. Development Standards.
1. Any parcel proposed for development as a PUD shall have a minimum lot size of 1 acre.
2. Any PUD shall be developed in accordance with the standards identified in the approved general development plan, including the concept plan, for the PUD.
3. Any PUD development shall be in compliance with all adopted health, fire, and building codes.
D. PUDs Without Development Plan Conditions. It is recognized that there are older developments within the community zoned PUD with no development plan conditions. New development or improvements on such property shall default to the development standards in the zoning districts as specified in the table below:
Use Type
Default Development Standard District
Agriculture
AG (Agriculture)
Single Family Residential
Public Sewer
Septic System
RS-1A, B, C or D (Single Family Residential)*
R-E (Residential Estate)
Multi-Family Residential
RM-3 (Multi-Family Residential)
Public
P (Public)
Commercial
HB (Highway Business)

SEC. 4.9 OVERLAY DISTRICTS
4.9.1 General
Where an overlay district and the underlying or base zoning district have different standards or regulations, the most restrictive standards or regulations pertaining to that land shall apply.
4.9.2 Conservation Subdivision Overlay District (CSOD)
A. Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of the Conservation Subdivision Overlay District is to provide for the preservation of prime farmland, greenspace and watersheds; to allow residential developments that permit flexibility of design and efficient uses of the land; to preserve sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat; to conserve scenic views and view sheds of open spaces by the use of a Conservation Subdivision as outlined by this Ordinance. It is the intent of this Overlay District to allow for an alternative and optional development style with regard to sidewalks, street widths, street lights, curb and gutter, or other development requirements as outlined within the Subdivision Regulations.
B. Description of Area. A Conservation Subdivision development is only permitted in the unincorporated areas of Warren County illustrated by Exhibit C in Appendix A of this Ordinance.
C. Map Amendment Required. Establishment of a Conservation Subdivision requires a map amendment as outlined in Section 3.11 of this Ordinance. Such amendment shall establish the CSOD overlay designation for the development.
D. Permitted Zoning District. The permitted zoning districts that are allowed to be utilized under the Conservation Subdivision Overlay District include: AG (Agriculture); utilizing the property development standards as outlined in Section F below.
E. Permitted Uses. The permitted uses within the Conservation Subdivision Overlay District shall be the same as the underlying zoning district as enumerated in the Use Table in Section 5.1 of this Ordinance for the portion of property to be developed. Areas classified as Conservation Areas shall be limited to Agriculture production, floodplains, wetlands, woodlands, a single dwelling unit, common areas, drainage areas or other amenities to the Conservation Subdivision, for the duration of the Conservation Areas as set forth in Section 4.9.3.J below.
F. Minimum Road Width Required for Density Bonus. Any property proposed for a Conservation Subdivision utilizing the option for a density bonus outlined below shall be accessed from a County or State maintained roadway of at least eighteen (18) feet in width. Any proposed Conservation Subdivision that does not meet this requirement may be required to add additional width to such roadway in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations of Warren County and the applicable jurisdiction. Any addition or proposed addition of roadway shall extend from the entrance(s) of the property containing the proposed Conservation Subdivision and connect with the nearest public roadway that is at least 18 feet in width.
G. Property Development Standards. A property must consist of a minimum forty (40) acres in order to utilize the Conservation Subdivision Development Standards.
Article 4
-----------------------------------------------
Zoning Districts – Overlay Districts
Warren County/Joint Zoning Ordinance
---------------------------------------------------
4-65
1. All conservation subdivisions must be served by an internal street as approved by the applicable jurisdiction.
2. The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the gross area of the proposed conservation subdivision, using the nearest whole number of acres, by the minimum lot size specified in the Agriculture (AG) zoning district (5 acres), plus a density bonus specified below:
a. Subdivisions proposed for on-site septic development and accessed from a road less than 18 feet in width will not receive a density bonus, and shall contain a maximum of 20 lots.
Lot Calculation Example:
Gross area of proposed subdivision (40 acres) ÷ minimum lots size in AG (5 acres) = 8 total lots.
b. Subdivisions proposed for on-site septic development and accessed from a road equal to or greater than18 in width will receive a density bonus of 250%.
Lot Calculation Example:
Gross area of proposed subdivision (40 acres) ÷ minimum lot size in AG (5 acres) x 2.5 (250% density bonus) = 20 total lots. In this example there would be 20, one acre lots and 20 acres in an easement.
c. Subdivisions proposed for sanitary sewer development and accessed from a road equal to or greater than18 ft in width will receive a density bonus of 500%.
Lot Calculation Example:
Gross area of proposed subdivision (40 acres) ÷ minimum lot size in AG (5 acres) x 5 (500% density bonus) = 40 total lots. In this example there would be 40, half acre lots (or less) on 20 acres with the remaining 20 acres (or more) in an easement.
3. The following Table specifies the general development standards that shall apply:

SEC. 5.2 USE CATEGORIES
5.2.1 Basis for Classifications
Use categories classify land uses and activities into use categories based on common functional, product or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions. The use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts.
A. Principal Uses. Principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use. The "Characteristics" subsection of each use category describes the common characteristics of each principal use.
1. Developments with Multiple Principal Uses. When all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned to that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore and bakery, for example, would be classified in the Retail Sales and Service category because all of the development's principal uses are in that category. When the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories, each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category.
2. Accessory Uses. Accessory uses are allowed by-right in conjunction with a principal use unless otherwise stated in the regulations. Also, unless otherwise stated, accessory uses are subject to the same regulations as the principal use. Common accessory uses are listed as examples in the use category descriptions.
3. Use of Examples. The "Examples" subsection of each use category lists common examples of uses included in the respective use category. The names of these sample uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself "Wholesale Warehouse" but that sells mostly to consumers, is included in the Retail Sales and Service category rather than the Wholesale Sales category. This is because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the Retail Sales and Service category.
B. Similar Use Interpretation Criteria. The following considerations may be used in making similar use interpretations.
1. The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each use category;
2. The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity;
3. Relative amounts of sales from each activity;
4. The customer type for each activity (retail or wholesale);
5. The relative number of employees in each activity;
6. Hours of operation;
7. Building and site arrangement;
8. Vehicles used with the activity;
9. The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use;
10. How the use advertises itself;
11. Parking needs;
12. Noise level, odor, dust, vibrations, or smoke generated; and
13. Utility use.

Warren County/Joint Zoning Ordinance
---------------------------------------------------

5.2.2 Residential Use Categories
A. Household Living
1. Characteristics. Household Living is characterized by the residential occupancy of a dwelling unit by a household. Tenancy is arranged on a month-to-month or longer basis. Uses where tenancy may be arranged for a shorter period are not considered residential; they are considered to be a form of transient lodging (see the Overnight Accommodations and Community Service categories).
2. Accessory Uses. Accessory uses commonly associated with Household Living are recreational activities, raising of pets (including non-commercial kennels), hobbies, parking of the occupants' vehicles, certain home occupations and accessory apartments as defined in Article 4 of this ordinance.
3. Examples. Uses include living in houses, duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, other multi-dwelling structures and rooming/boarding houses.
4. Exceptions.
a. Short-term rentals where tenancy is arranged for periods of less than 30 days is considered to be an Overnight Accommodation use.
5. Specific Use Standards.
a. The keeping of any animal within the incorporated area of Bowling Green must adhere to the City of Bowling Green, Kentucky Code of Ordinances, Chapter V, Animals.
b. For the keeping of any livestock (weighing 500 pounds or less), located in the AG district (less than 2 acres) or any residential zoning classification, and located outside the incorporated area of Bowling Green, a minimum of one half (1/2) acre of livestock containment area is required.
c. For the keeping of any livestock (weighing over 500 pounds), located in the AG district (less than 2 acres) or any residential zoning classification, and located outside the incorporated area of Bowling Green, a minimum of one (1) acre of livestock containment area is required.
d. For the keeping of any domestic pets such as a dog or cat, an outdoor pet containment area shall be required in the following areas:
(1) In subdivisions, located in the unincorporated area of Warren County, in the PUD, MHP, R-E, RS-1A, 1B, 1C or 1D zoning classification.
(2) Cities of Woodburn and Plum Springs in all zoning districts,
For the purposes of sections a, b and c above, livestock containment area and outdoor pet containment area shall mean animals shall remain on the premises of the owner, or if off the premises of the owner, under restraint by means of a lead, leash, harness, appropriate animal carrier or other reasonable method and under the control of a responsible person.

1. Specific Use Standards.
a. Home Occupations. Home occupations listed in 5.2.2.C. shall meet the following standards:
(1) No person other than members of the family residing on the premises shall be engaged in such home occupation.
(2) The use of the dwelling unit for the home occupation shall be clearly incidental and subordinate to its use for residential purposes by its occupants.
(3) No more than one home occupation permit shall be granted per dwelling unit.
(4) There shall be no change in the outside appearance of the dwelling or premises, or other visible evidence of the conduct of such home occupation. Signage shall be limited to 6 sq. ft., monument or wall sign only.
(5) No traffic shall be generated by such home occupation in greater volumes than would be expected in a residential neighborhood.

ARTICLE 6 NONCONFORMITIES
SEC. 6.1 INTENT
If, within the districts established by this Ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or future amendment. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon or expanded, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
SEC. 6.2 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. No nonconforming structure may be enlarged, moved, or structurally altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. Voluntary demolition of a nonconforming structure nullifies its nonconforming rights. Should a nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be voluntarily destroyed, moved or removed to an extent of 55 percent or more of its replacement cost at time of destruction (exclusive of foundations), it shall not be repaired or reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
B. When a nonconforming structure is involuntarily destroyed or removed, it shall retain its nonconforming rights for a period of eighteen (18) months. Failure to re-establish the structure within eighteen (18) months nullifies the nonconforming rights. A one-time extension, no longer than 6 months, may be granted by Planning Commission staff if it can be proven that extenuating circumstances have occurred, preventing reestablishment of nonconforming rights within the standard eighteen (18) month time period. Re-establish, for the purposes of this section, shall mean that necessary permits and approvals have been obtained or have been applied for and that binding contracts for the construction of the principal structure have been let; in the absence of contracts, the principal structure must be under construction to a substantial degree (at least 55 percent of the construction completed).
C. A nonconforming structure may be altered to the extent necessary to comply with a lawful order of government officials.
D. Existing nonconforming structures located in the special flood hazard area shall not be expanded but may be otherwise modified, altered, or repaired provided such measures incorporate flood-proofing of the structure in accordance with FEMA standards.

SEC. 6.3 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND
Where at the time of passage of this Ordinance or amendments, lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted in the district under the terms of this Ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions:
A. No nonconforming use, except single family residential uses, and cemeteries, shall be enlarged, increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance;
B. No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance;
C. No structure, or structure and premises in combination, devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
D. A nonconforming use may continue indefinitely; however if any nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for eighteen (18)consecutive months or more, except where government action impedes access to the premises, the nonconforming status shall be nullified. Any subsequent use of land shall be in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located;
E. Sale of a property containing a nonconforming use shall have no effect on the nonconforming status;
F. Where nonconforming use status applies, the removal or destruction of the occupied principal structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 55 percent or more of its replacement cost, exclusive of foundation, at time of destruction.
G. No nonconforming use shall be changed from one use to another, unless the newly proposed use is determined by the Executive Director (or his/her designee) to be the same or less intense than the existing nonconforming use.
SEC. 6.4 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD
A. A nonconforming lot of record is any lot which was lawfully created prior to the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance (see Sec. 1.3 and 6.1) but which has a smaller minimum lot area, frontage, or width than now required for that zoning district.
B. A nonconforming lot of record may be used in accordance with the other applicable regulations for that zoning district. The subdivision of a nonconforming lot that creates a greater nonconformity is prohibited. The minor adjustment of lot lines between nonconforming lots of the same zoning classification may be allowed as long as an additional lot is not created.
C. The Executive Director may approve building permits for a lot of record for only one single family detached structure and associated accessory structures. Such building permits may be
Article 6
-----------------------------------------------
Nonconformities
Warren County/Joint Zoning Ordinance
---------------------------------------------------
6-3
approved if the proposed structure(s) can comply with all district development standards except minimum lot area, frontage, or width. A Variance or Waiver of any other development standard must be obtained only through action of the Board of Adjustments or Planning Commission as allowed in this ordinance.
D. Agricultural exception lots, as defined in Section 4.3.4.C of this ordinance, are not considered non-conforming, and are a legal conforming lots of record.
SEC. 6.5 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE
A. Routine Maintenance
On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, any change that does not require a building permit is considered routine maintenance and shall not affect the nonconforming status.
B. Unsafe Buildings
If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any building official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
SEC. 6.6 CONDITIONAL USES NOT NONCONFORMING USES
Any use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under the terms of this Ordinance shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use.
SEC. 6.7 NONCONFORMING SIGNS
A. Destroyed, Damaged, Removed, or Abandoned Signs. Whenever a non-conforming sign collapses, burns, or is removed from its location, it shall not be replaced or reconstructed, except in full compliance with the provisions of this Section.
B. Freestanding signs which are not prohibited on-premise signs and in legal existence on the effective date of this Section and not in conformity with the provisions may remain in place and shall be referred to as nonconforming signs. Only routine maintenance may be performed on the sign and its structure until such time as the sign is brought into conformance with these regulations. Routine maintenance includes the following:
1. Replacement of nuts and bolts, cleaning and painting, or manipulating to level or plumb the device, but not to the extent of adding struts or guys for the stabilization of the sign or structure or substantially changing the sign.
2. Routine changing of messages (i.e. readerboard messages)
3. Replacement of facing where the existing casing/framing will still be utilized
4. Replacement of casing/framing where the existing sign face(s) will still be utilized
Article 6
-----------------------------------------------
Nonconformities
Warren County/Joint Zoning Ordinance
---------------------------------------------------
6-4
Routine maintenance does not include installation of additional panels that will result in a greater nonconformity. In the event that the entire sign face and casing/framing are both removed in their entirety, the nonconforming rights shall be nullified. Any new signage shall conform to all requirements of this Ordinance for the zone in which it is located (size, height, location, etc.).
C. When a nonconforming sign is involuntarily destroyed or removed, it shall retain its nonconforming rights for a period of six (6) months. Failure to re-establish the structure within six (6) months nullifies the nonconforming rights. Re-establish, for the purposes of this section, shall mean that necessary permits and approvals have been obtained or have been applied for and that binding contracts for the construction of the principal structure have been let; in the absence of contracts, the principal structure must be under construction to a substantial degree (at least 55 percent of the construction completed).
D. If a nonconforming sign is voluntarily destroyed or removed, such sign can only be replaced or reconstructed in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance and the Subdivision Regulations, as well as any recorded subdivision plat or development plan. Any sign which cannot be replaced or reconstructed in compliance with this Section shall be removed by the property owner at owner's sole cost and expense.

PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS
SECTION 3.1 Subdivision Plats
The purpose of this section is to set forth procedures for the preparation, review and
approval of subdivisions classified under these regulations.
A. OPTIONAL PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE – Any developer desiring to
subdivide property should contact the Planning Commission and make an
appointment for a pre-application conference. The purpose of the preapplication
conference is to discuss compliance with the Zoning Ordinance,
Subdivision Regulations and any Development Plan Conditions, fees,
requirements and procedures related to the development of the property will be
established.
B. APPLICATION – Following the pre-application conference (if required), the
developer may submit an application for a subdivision or site development plan
(see Section 3.2). The application shall be in the form as prescribed by the
Planning Commission. Fees established at the pre-application conference will be
paid at the time of application. The preliminary plat should conform to the
content requirements set forth in these regulations.
C. NOTIFICATION – If deficiencies are found in the application, notice will be given
to the applicant outlining the deficiencies. Notice of an application for a
preliminary plat will be posted on the planning commission website at
warrenpc.org. Comments on proposed subdivisions will be accepted for five (5)
days following the posted notice.
D. STAFF PRELIMINARY PLAT REVIEW AND ACTION – The Planning Commission
Executive Director or assigned subdivision review staff will review the preliminary
lot layout based on the checklist found in Appendix H. The Commission staff shall
take one of the following actions on each application:
1. PRELIMINARY STAFF PLAT APPROVAL – After the Planning Commission
has given preliminary plat approval, one (1) set of the required materials will
be returned to the developer along with a written notice of the action, and a
land use certificate will be recorded at the County Clerk’s office by the
Planning Commission. Preliminary plat approval grants the developer three (3)
years to submit construction plans (if required) and the recording plat for all
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 3, Page 10
property shown on the preliminary plat layout. If the three (3) year period for
filing the recording plat elapses, the developer must resubmit the preliminary
plat layout and fees for preliminary plan re-approval. The Planning
Commission Executive Director may give special consideration, which may
include a time extension, for large scale projects that have demonstrated
continuous construction progress throughout the approval period.
2. CONDITIONAL PRELIMINARY PLAT APPROVAL – The developer must
make all corrections to the preliminary lot layout as requested by the Planning
Commission. After corrections are made, preliminary plat approval shall be
granted as outlined in item D.1 above.
3. STAFF DISAPPROVAL – The preliminary plat is not acceptable. For further
action, the developer must make all changes and resubmit the preliminary lot
layout.
E. PLANNING COMMISSION PLAT REVIEW AND ACTION – The Planning
Commission Executive Director, any citizen or the developer may request a
public review and approval by the Planning Commission at one of their regularly
scheduled meetings within thirty (30) days of the request.
F. PLAT REVIEW, RECORDATION AND ACTION – The recording plat will be
reviewed for compliance with the approved preliminary plan. The plat of record
contains such information as is necessary for the public recording and transfer of
land including but not limited to required signatures, lot lines, easements, any
recorded development plan conditions and other restrictions.
The developer and/or surveyor shall distribute the preliminary lot layout to all
required agencies, and will solicit comments on the proposed subdivision
containing public infrastructure. The appropriate local government will be
determined through approval and recordation of the plat if dedications of any
public lands, streets, alleys, etc. would be beneficial to the public interest and
suitable future acceptance if constructed to current standards.
The recording plat shall be prepared in accordance with these regulations. The
Planning Commission shall record the subdivision plat at the Warren County
Clerk’s office (which authorizes the property owner or developer to offer lots for
sale). A certification of approval shall be stamped on the recording plat and
affixed with the signature of the Planning Commission Chairman, or Vice
Chairman, and the Executive Director or assigned staff.
Warren County Subdivision Regulations

action, the developer must make all changes and resubmit the construction
plans.
B. PRE-CONSTRUCTION CONFERENCE – After Comprehensive Development
Review approval (if required), construction plan approval and receipt of a Notice
of Coverage (NOC) from the Kentucky Division of Water, the developer and his
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 3, Page 12
contractor shall be required to schedule and attend a mandatory pre-construction
conference with the Planning Commission. The developer or contractor shall be
prepared to outline all proposed construction operations and procedures as
presented in the construction plans. If the construction plans were given
conditional final approval, the developer must show that the conditions have been
met. The developer will be informed of other regulations applicable to the
proposed subdivision. An appropriate bond or surety must be posted prior to the
Pre-Construction Conference.
C. NOTICE TO PROCEED – After attending the required pre-construction
conference, the developer is permitted to proceed with the construction process
after complying with items D and E (listed below) and receiving a “Notice to
Proceed” from the Planning Commission.
D. CONTRACT – The contract, signed by the developer and property owner, shall
specify a surety in an amount that will be sufficient to pay the entire cost of
installing the public improvements set forth in the construction plans and related
documents as determined by the Planning Commission. All required Planning

Construction Conference.
E. ACCEPTABLE SURETIES – To secure the proper completion of all public
improvements shown on the approved construction plans, the developer shall
provide, subject to the approval of the Planning Commission, one of the following
sureties in an amount equal to the cost of the public improvements plus ten
percent (10%), as set forth in the construction contract and in compliance with the
Bonding Policy set forth in Appendix G.
1. CORPORATE SURETY BOND (PERFORMANCE BOND) – If the developer
chooses to provide a corporate surety bond, then it shall be from an insurance
company authorized to do business in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The
bond shall be in the form of a payment and performance bond satisfactory to
the Planning Commission. If the developer has employed a contractor to
construct all improvements as provided herein, the Planning Commission may
accept the payment and performance bond of such contractor as surety for
the performance of the construction contract and shall require the
construction contractor to sign the construction contract as a co-developer.
A. The corporate surety bond shall provide the Planning Commission as a
named obligee. The bond should clearly establish that it acts as a
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 3, Page 13
surety for the construction contract, signed by the developer or
property owner. The corporate surety bond shall state that the amount
is equivalent to the construction project estimate. The corporate surety
bond shall also state that upon the failure by the developer to complete
the improvements within the required time period, the insurance
company shall pay the Planning Commission, immediately, and
without further action, such funds as are represented, in the corporate
surety bond. The original corporate surety bond will be for a three (3)
year period to coincide with the dates of the construction contract and
shall continue through any approved extensions until the bond is
released by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission will
provide one (1), non-certified notice of intent to call the corporate
surety bond to the developer and to the insurance company which
issued the corporate surety bond. Any corporate surety bond which has
not been released, nor had documentation submitted for an extension
prior to the morning of the expiration date of the construction
contract, shall be called and converted to a cash surety in the amount
of the Planning Commission staff’s estimate of the remaining work to
be completed or twenty percent (20%), whichever is greater.
B. The performance bond shall contain a provision stating the bond may
not be revoked except upon written notice by the Planning
Commission. The expiration date, if the bond is revoked, shall be at
least thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice from the Planning
Commission. It shall be understood and agreed, however, that the
maker of the performance bond will be liable for any and all unpaid bills
up to the amount of the performance bond accruing up to the
expiration datae thereof, and a provision stating such shall be set forth
in the performance bond.
C. All performance bonds shall be drafted that the only requirement for
the Planning Commission to draw upon such bond is to notify the
financial institution that the applicant/developer/owner has failed to
complete construction of their project in accordance with the approved
construction contract, subdivision plans and these rules and
regulations. The Planning Commission shall have the right, at its
discretion, and upon fourteen (14) days’ notice to the subdivider, to
draw any amount necessary to complete the project up to the
remaining balance. The amount drawn, which may be more than
required to complete the project, will be held in a segregated account
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 3, Page 14
until the work can be bid competitively and awarded and paid for or
until the contract for the work is otherwise let and paid for or until the
contract for the work is otherwise let and paid for. In no instance shall
the Planning Commission or local government agency incur any
liability for repayment of these funds. Any excess over the cost of
completing the work will be returned to the grantor. Release of the
funds will be made only with the prior written consent of the Planning
Commission and in consultation with the local governing body.
D. The performance bond shall contain a provision that requires, in the
event of a change to the bond, thirty (30) days written notice prior to
the change taking effect.
2. CASH SURETY – If the developer chooses to provide a cash surety, then cash
shall be deposited in a separate subdivision surety account of the Planning
Commission. The cash surety shall be used by the Planning Commission to pay
for the timely and satisfactory completion of all public improvements called
for in the subdivision or shall be refunded to the developer if he satisfactorily
completes the project.
3. LETTER OF CREDIT – The Planning Commission will accept the posting of an
approved letter of credit as surety for the timely and satisfactory completion
of public improvements in a subdivision in order that the subdivision may be
recorded in an expeditious manner. The developer may provide, as surety for
the performance of the contract, a letter of credit from a financial institution
acceptable to the Planning Commission. The letter of credit shall be delivered
in a form acceptable to the Planning Commission. The letter of credit shall
state that the amount is equivalent to the construction project estimate. The
letter of credit shall also state that upon the failure by the developer to
complete the improvements within the required time period, the financial
institution shall pay the Planning Commission, immediately and without
further action, such funds as are represented in the letter of credit. The original
letter of credit will be for a one (1) year period. Extensions of up to two years
may be granted to coincide with the dates in the construction contract.
The Planning Commission will provide one (1), non-certified Notice of
Coverage (NOC) to call the letter of credit to the developer and to the
institution which issued the letter of credit. Any letter of credit which has not
been released nor had an approved extension prior to the morning of the
expiration date shall be called and converted to a cash surety in the amount of
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 3, Page 15
the Planning Commission staff’s estimate of the remaining work to be
completed or twenty percent (20%), whichever is greater. The developer or
the institution must submit the new letter of credit to the Planning
Commission by 4:00 p.m. on the last working day at least one (1) week prior to
the expiration date on the face of the original letter.
F. REDUCTION OF CONTRACT SURETIES – The developer may request a
reduction of the surety. If progress has been made on the completion of
improvements, the Planning Commission Executive Director or assigned staff
may at his sole discretion authorize the reduction of the surety. The construction
must be completed as provided in the construction contract and the Subdivision
Regulations and in a manner satisfactory to the Planning Commission. The
following conditions must be satisfied for contract surety reduction:
1. MINIMUM AMOUNT OF SURETY – No surety shall be for an amount less
than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or twenty percent (20%) of the original
contract amount, whichever is greater.
2. VERBAL OR WRITTEN REQUEST – The Planning Commission shall require a
request for a reduction. The request must include certification from Planning
Commission staff that the detailed improvements have been completed, and
for which the reduction of the contract surety is requested, in accordance with
the approved subdivision plan specifications.
3. DETERMINATION OF SURETY REDUCTION – If the Planning Commission
authorizes the reduction of the amount of the contract surety, the reduction
shall be based upon the following formula: New or Revised Bond Amount =
Total Value of Uncompleted Work + Ten Percent (10%). Under no
circumstances shall the total amount of any reduction approved by the
Planning Commission reduce the contract surety to an amount below twenty
percent (20%) of the initial construction bond estimate (bonded amount set
forth in the construction contract).
4. PROJECTS IN DEFAULT – If the improvements are not completed within
three (3) years from the date of the signed and executed construction contract
as provided in this Article, said contract shall be in default and shall not be
eligible to be reduced. Once a project is deemed in default, any remaining
Letter of Credit or Corporate Surety must be converted to a cash surety unless
and extension is granted.
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 3, Page 16
G. DEFAULT / COMPLETION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS – As provided for in this
Article, if the improvements are not completed within three (3) years from the
date of the signed and executed construction contract, the development shall be
in default. Within one hundred twenty (120) days of default, the Planning
Commission may proceed with actions against the developer and its surety for
performance unless another course of action is approved.
H. ACCEPTANCE AND MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS – Any street or other
public land dedicated by plat shall be accepted for maintenance by the
appropriate legislative body after it has received approval by the Planning
Commission and formally adopted for acceptance by the legislative body. Any
street built in accordance with specific standards set forth in these regulations or
by ordinance shall only be accepted for maintenance by the appropriate
legislative body after inspection, final approval, submission of “as-built” plans and
adoption of an ordinance to accept public improvements.
Sidewalks or other improvements not completed at the time of acceptance may
be allowed at the discretion of the appropriate public agency. These items will be
considered part of a conditional acceptance and a separate contract and cash
surety will be required prior to release of the original surety/bond and
construction contract. The amount and terms of the contract and the conditions
will be determined prior to acceptance and release of the original surety and
contract.
I. WARRANTY – As a material part of the developer’s duty to construct in
accordance with the plat, plans and specifications, as set forth above, the
developer shall warranty that the work performed and the products installed
under these regulations, have been performed in a good and workmanlike
manner and are free from defects. The minimum warranty period shall be twentyfour
(24) months starting at the time of acceptance by the appropriate legislative
body. In the event the developer(s) breaches their warranty, the appropriate
legislative body shall be entitled to recover its damages and costs, including
reasonable attorney’s fees.
J. RELEASE – Upon completion of the improvements as provided in these
regulations, the Planning Commission shall terminate the construction contract
and release its surety.

DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS
SECTION 6.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this article is to set forth the basic and minimum design and
improvement standards required as a prerequisite for development or in conjunction
with lot, street, utility and/or other physical development in the subdivision. The
developer may exceed the standards set forth in these regulations, or in some cases, be
required to exceed the standards.
SECTIO N 6.2 SUBDIVISION DESIGN PRINCIPLES
Design principles are those criteria that are used to guide the process of design to
achieve specific goals. The principles that shall be utilized to layout subdivisions are:
A. Circulation patterns laid out to discourage through traffic within the
neighborhoods but to provide for connectivity to multiple outlets from the
neighborhood.
B. Right-angle street intersections reduce traffic hazards.
C. Cul-de-sacs should serve no more than thirty (30) dwelling units nor extend
more than thirteen hundred (1,300) feet from the common street intersection.
D. Major access points to the subdivision are located away from major
intersections but lined up with other streets of equal classification in a manner
that promotes ingress and egress.
E. ADA compliant sidewalks will be used to provide pedestrian access within the
subdivision and to adjacent areas. If alternate methodology will improve
drainage or other significant design elements, such as post construction storm
water quality, then alternate designs may be approved in residential
developments outside of city limits. In order to be considered for approval to
eliminate sidewalks, the development must have thirty (30) foot of street
surface, six (6) foot shoulders and adequate drainage swales as described in
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 6, Page 42
Section F below. Amenities and infrastructure in adjacent developments will be
considered. (See Exhibit 6.1)
F. Curbs and gutters will be used to enhance the safety of the neighborhood and to
convey storm water when appropriate. Curbs and gutters must not conflict with
ADA requirements. A residential development not within any city limits may be
able to use grass swales in lieu of curb and gutter, if approved in conjunction
with a post construction storm water quality plan. Lot dimensions and ratios
shall be subject to approval by the Warren County Public Works Department
and Planning Commission review staff, with the minimum street frontage being
one hundred (100) feet and lots shall be at least thirty thousand (30,000) square
feet. Swales shall be sodded and meet applicable slope and velocity
requirements. Other engineered Low Impact Design (LID) will be considered.
Amenities and infrastructure in adjacent developments will be considered. (See
Exhibit 6.1)
G. Utilities buried in right-of-ways and easements enhance appearance and shall
be in compliance with City and County Ordinances.
H. Street lighting within developments shall be in compliance with City and County
Ordinances.
I. Access Management. Subdivisions with street improvements within the City of
Bowling Green shall comply with City guidelines concerning proper access
management. All other areas of Warren County are encouraged to implement
the same guidelines in subdivision development. Access management reduces
access points on major routes, conflict points for traffic delay, and improves
services flows and capacity of the roadways.
SECTION 6.3 ADEQUATE PUBLIC FACILITY STANDARDS
A. WATER SUPPLY AND SEWER – The developer shall provide a water and sewer
(when applicable) distribution system adequate to serve the proposed
subdivision. The water and sewer mains shall be of adequate size and quality
and designed in accordance with applicable City or County Ordinances and
standard specifications and design standards of Bowling Green Municipal
Utilities or Warren County Water District. The construction plans shall show
proposed water and sewer mains adequately sized in accordance with the
specifications of the serving utility. Details of construction material and
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 6, Page 43
methods shall be provided. See appendix D for more information on fire
protection.
B. FIRE PROTECTION AND HYDRANT SPACING – Fire protection shall meet
both the current City/County regulations, as well as the requirements outlined
within the Zoning Ordinance. In areas of potential annexation, the City of
Bowling Green fire standards may apply.
C. PUBLIC STREETS AND ROADS – The Planning Commission is responsible for
assuring that street development conforms to the standards contained in this
document, including any amendments, additions and changes thereto, and in
conformity to street or highway plans officially adopted by the applicable
jurisdictions. Proposed streets shall be considered in their relationship to
existing and planned streets, to topographical and drainage conditions, to public
convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses
of the land to be served by such streets.
D. NATURAL GAS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRIC SUPPLY – Every
subdivision shall be served by an adequate electric supply. Additionally, proper
communications facilities must be made available to all properties (either by
landline, cable, fiber or similar means). Natural gas supply may be provided at
the developer’s option dependent upon the ability of the local supplier to meet
the demands of the development.
E. UTILITY EASEMENTS – Easements shall be provided for utilities wherever
necessary.
SECTION 6.4 DRAINAGE STANDARDS
Every subdivision and development shall provide satisfactory drainage of storm water
by means of underground storm sewer pipes and/or surface ditches. The basic standard
for design of drainage systems for subdivisions will be to keep runoff characteristics
after development at the same or lower level as existed before development. The
“built-out” conditions appropriate to the zoning classification shall be the design basis
for control structures. This regulation shall be true for storms of all intensities and
durations. To achieve these objectives, storm water retention systems will be required
in most cases. Appendix B is provided as a guide for stormwater design and post
stormwater quality in areas outside of the City of Bowling Green. For areas

feet (and not in a designated critical watershed area): drainage plan may
be required at discretion of City Public Works, County Public Works or
Planning Commission.
3. Net change in impervious area greater than thirty-four hundred (3,400)
square feet: drainage plan shall be required.
4. Any construction which is proposed in an area of known hazard: drainage
plan shall be required.
C. DRAINAGE PLAN – The drainage plan will show existing and proposed contours of the
project, the street layout and street names, lotting pattern with lot numbers and the
location of all drainage structures. Street centerline stationing should be indicated. The
drainage calculations shall be for built-out conditions based on the zoning
classification. All culverts shall be terminated with headwalls. The drainage plan shall
include the following elements:

to the property, or whose proximity may affect the drainage or access to
the property.
6. ELEVATIONS – The plan shall show elevations that must be based on
Mean Sea Level Datum as established using third order accuracy or
better using the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) for horizontal
control and National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1988 (NGVD 88) for
vertical control.
7. STANDARD DRAINAGE FEATURES – To the maximum extent possible
all drainage features shall be specified as Kentucky Transportation
Cabinet (KYTC) standard drawings.
D. DRAINAGE DITCHES – Drainage ditches or swales shall be designed to
minimize erosion. Sod materials and method of construction shall be in
accordance with the standard specifications for construction in the City of
Bowling Green, Warren County or the Kentucky Department of Highways.

3. Channel linings will be required for any velocity greater than 5.0 fps.
Channel linings will be chosen that are both functional and maintainable.
4. Grass linings and low slopes are conducive to stormwater quality
treatment.
5. The minimum slope for open channel ditches shall be 0.8%
6. Open channel design shall be based on the time of concentration for the
25-year storm and the 100-year high water elevation shall be delineated
with a drainage easement.
E. STORM PIPE AND CULVERT- Driveway culvert pipes shall be designed for a
minimum 25-yr storm at one (1) hour. Storm sewer pipes within right-of-ways
and drainage easements shall be designed based on a 25-yr storm. The
minimum freeboard shall be one (1) foot when the maximum headwater is
achieved. Calculations for all pipes shall be shown and invert elevations
assigned. Use of energy dissipaters may be required as necessary. The minimum
velocity of storm pipes shall be 3 fps at full flow conditions. The maximum
velocity shall be 15 fps. Storm pipe shall be corrugated metal (not aluminum) or
concrete. Pipe alternates, such as Ultra Flow or HDP, may only be allowed with
the approval of City Public Works Department, County Public Works
Department or the Planning Commission. The minimum slope for storm pipe
design shall be 0.8%.
F. MANHOLES – Manholes shall be constructed of pre-cast concrete with a
concrete foundation.
G. INLETS OR CATCH BASINS – Inlets or catch basins shall be constructed of
concrete with reinforced concrete tops. The type of manholes, inlets and other
drainage structures shall be indicated on the plans for the proposed work. The
spacing of inlets for curb and gutter sections shall be designed as to not let the
spread exceed one-half of the lane width during a 25 year design event. Inlets
shall be placed as to not require surface drainage across any public streets. Each
inlet is required to have the environmental note “BOWLING GREEN / WARREN
COUNTY KEEP IT CLEAN / DUMP NO WASTE” placed visibly on the inlet unless
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 6, Page 47
otherwise approved by the City of Bowling Green or Warren County Public
Works Department for approval of alternate plans. Construction plans should
note the requirement on the plans.
H. BOX CULVERTS – Any box culvert, whether cast-in-place or pre-cast, shall be
constructed of reinforced concrete.
I. TRENCHING (Street-cut permit will be required in existing roads) – Drainage
shall be constructed according to the approved improvement plans for the
proposed work. Prior to any trench work in a proposed or existing public rightof-
way, a street cut permit will be required. Refer to Section 6.2.E and 6.2.F for
trenching requirements.
J. FLOODPLAINS AND FLOODWAYS – No construction of roads, principal or
accessory structures is permitted in floodplains and/or floodways. Construction
of any other facility in the floodplain may require a permit from the Kentucky
Division of Water. Construction of any kind within the floodway requires a
permit from the Kentucky Division of Water. Floodways of navigable rivers
must have the approval of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
K. RELATIONSHIP TO SANITARY SEWER SYSTEMS – No storm water drainage
system may be designed, constructed or connected so as to flow into any public
or private sanitary sewer system.
L. RETENTION AND DETENTION BASINS – Where required to be included in the
subdivision design, retention and/or detention basins shall be provided by the
developer. At a minimum, such facilities shall be designed so that they will drain
within seventy-two (72) hours after the cessation of a rainfall event and no
standing water will remain in the basin during dry weather.
Any proposed drywell shall be installed per Article 5.6.M and flow tested per
Article 6.2.T.1 prior to plan approval. Should the proposed drywell fail testing,
then the developer’s engineer shall provide an approved alternate design to
appropriately manage the storm water.
If at any point during construction a basin routinely fails to completely drain, the
developer may be required to take other actions such as aeration, draining to an
alternate site that functions, or creating a permanent pond sufficient to function
as a retention basin while providing an attractive open space for the
development. Retention basins designed to act as permanent ponds shall have
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 6, Page 48
adequate storage above the pool elevation sufficient to contain the runoff of the
required design rainfall event. Engineering solutions that adequately control
discharge (rate, velocity, spread etc.) will be considered by the City or County
Public Works Department.
1. DESIGN CRITERIA – Detention areas shall be sized based on a 1-hour,
100-year storm (2.95 inches). Retention basins shall be sized based on a
3-hour, 100 year storm (4.0 inches). Peak (10 minute) intensity of 7.56
inches per hour for a 100-year storm may be used to assess the impact
on conduits. Such facilities shall be designed so that they will drain
within seventy-two (72) hours and no free standing water will remain in
the basin during dry weather unless a permanent pond is to be
constructed to sufficient size that the standing water will not stagnate
and present health hazards. Storage basins shall not have slopes
exceeding 3:1, (4:1 slopes may be required for stability and safety). All
basins/ponds shall be designed to provide a minimum one (1) foot of
freeboard (additional retention) above the calculated high water
elevation for the 100-year storm. Ditches shall be designed so that each
segment will function without erosion.
2. DISCHARGE POINTS – The maximum discharge from a detention basin
shall not exceed the pre-developed discharge. Discharge to areas of
known flooding hazards shall be subject to approval of the City Public
Works Department, County Public Works Department or the Planning
Commission. Sinkhole and drywells located in retention basins shall be
assumed to have no outflow for purposes of computation.
3. EASEMENTS AND FINISHED FLOOR ELEVATIONS – Calculated 100-
year high water elevations shall be recorded on the subdivision plat. In
areas where a proposed basin is connected with an existing basin, the
recorded high water elevation shall be maintained. The minimum
finished floor elevations for structures and associated HVAC systems
adjacent to retention and detention basins shall be eighteen (18) inches
above the 3-hour, 100-year high water elevation. An unobstructed ten
(10) foot wide vehicular access to the bottom of the basin shall be
constructed at a maximum 5:1 slope in the provided easement.
M. DRYWELL INSTALLATION – An injection well (drywell) must provide a
connection to subsurface (karst) features that will drain the associated basin
within a twenty-four hour period. If testing/size indicates that a single well is
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 6, Page 49
insufficient, multiple wells must be constructed and each must be tested. Prior
to acceptance, the well (or wells) shall be tested for functionality. The Planning
Commission and developer’s representatives shall be present for the test.
Regardless of the basin’s size, the minimum accepted flow rate for any well is
the greater of 160 gallons/minute or (Basin Capacity gallons / 1,440 minutes) /
(Number of Wells in Basin). Flow must be delivered continuously for a period of
ten (10) minutes, with no ponding of water on the surface. An alternate drainage
method may be provided or required if testing fails.
The depth of the drywells shall be determined as the depth necessary to
intercept a sub-terrain aquifer, solution, fissure, cavity or cave. The drilled bore
hole shall extend a minimum of twelve (12) inches into the void area. The
unobstructed end of a minimum eight (8) inch steel casing pipe shall be inserted
to a minimum three (3) foot depth into the solid rock, measured by the length of
drill bit withdrawn. The inlet end of the casing shall be grouted in place allowing
a casing pipe stand of three (3) to five (5) feet. The exposed casing shall be
perforated by the means of a drill. No cutting below the structure shall be
allowed. The drywell inlet shall be constructed per the illustration for a Typical
Drywell found in Appendix A.
A permit application to the Environmental Protection Agency is required for all
Class V injection wells. Provide copy of this application to the Planning
Commission staff for inventory purposes. Existing drywells which are to be
utilized by new developments shall be re-tested for functionality, and the
developer shall be responsible for ensuring the functionality of each drywell
prior to final inspection.
N. STORM DRAINAGE EASEMENTS – On-site and off-site easements for storm
water drainage systems shall be shown on the recording plat in locations and
sizes approved by the Planning Commission. Special notes relating to the
maintenance of such easements shall be placed on the recording plat. Drainage
easements may be combined with utility and other easements if sufficient
widths are provided, however, no drainage easement containing underground
storm sewers may be combined with a utility easement containing underground
electric or natural gas lines except at necessary crossing points unless sufficient
clearance between the facilities is provided.
O. SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROLS – Drainage plans and
construction plans must include an Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control
Plan and Best Management Practices (BMP) plan, developed based on all
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 6, Page 50
applicable City/County/State/Federal ordinances and guidelines. If in the City of
Bowling Green, please consult the Bowling Green Public Works storm water
management standard drawings found in the City’s stormwater guide.
P. POST CONSTRUCTION BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES – Bowling Green
City Ordinance (21-2) and Warren County Ordinance (Wc11-31) requires postconstruction
Best Management Practices (BMPs) to be in place for any land
disturbance over one (1) acre and/or land disturbance that includes more than
ten thousand (10,000) square feet of impervious cover. Alone or together, BMPs
for any development meeting the threshold must reduce total suspended solids
by eighty percent (80%). In all cases the most current applicable City/County
legislation shall prevail.
SECTION 6.5 STREET STANDARDS
Each subdivision shall be served by public streets or streets for which improvement
bonds have been posted. A public street shall be provided for convenient access to
each property within the subdivision and each subdivision developer shall furnish proof
that the proposed subdivision is afforded proper access by way of a public street. All
new public road access to the subdivision and the individual building sites shall be not
lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. Whenever the proposed
subdivision contains or is adjacent to a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway,
no street shall be planned to intersect such right-of-way, except by prior written
approval of the appropriate agency. All streets classified herein as arterials, collectors,
frontages or alleys shall conform to the following standards: (See Appendix A)
A. RESPONSIBILITY OF STREETS – The developer shall construct streets and
appurtenances including all clearing, grading, laying of subbase, base,
pavements, culvert, bridges, storm drainage facilities and other structures. The
respective legislative bodies shall not accept any street until it has been
inspected by the City or County Engineer or Public Works Department, and it
has been determined that such construction is in conformance with the
approved plans and adopted standards.
B. TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY (TIS) Traffic Impact Studies, if required, shall be
prepared only by a Kentucky licensed Professional Engineer also certified as a
Professional Traffic Operations Engineer (PTOE). Requirements for Traffic
Impact Studies are outlined in Section 5.3.
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 6, Page 51
C. STREET GEOMETRICS – All streets shall conform to the applicable geometric,
cross-section and sight distance triangle standards.
D. STREET CONTINUITY – The Planning Commission may require consideration
for the inclusion of streets based on an overall thoroughfare plan to provide for
major routes through the City and County. Streets shall be related to
topography and shall provide for the continuation of existing or dedicated
streets in adjoining or nearby tracts and provide for connection to tracts,
especially those that would otherwise be landlocked.
E. STREET NAMES – The developer shall name the streets in the proposed
subdivision but shall avoid the use of street names that closely approximate
phonetically or in spelling the name of any existing street, except that the
extension of any existing street will carry the same name as the existing street.
Further, the Planning Commission should direct that any street be given the
same name as an existing street where it is apparent that the proposed street
will become an extension of any existing street upon the improvement of an
intervening parcel of undeveloped land. The street names should be in
conformance with the street naming and property numbering regulations of the
Planning Commission. The connection of two differently named streets should
be avoided but may be allowed if provisions are made for renaming one or the
other of the existing streets. The names of streets at locations where the speed
limit exceeds 25 mph shall be limited to fourteen (14) characters total, including
spaces. No street name shall be allowed to begin or end with a cardinal
direction (North, South, East, or West). The names of streets at locations where
the speed limit is less than or equal to 25 mph shall be limited to twenty-eight
(28) characters including spaces. The street name suffix will be determined as
follows:
Alley: An Alley is a service road, located at the rear of a property. It is
usually only wide enough for one vehicle. It may be used as a means to
gain access to the rear of a property (garages or dumpsters), but it may
not be considered as road frontage and addresses will not be given from
it. It may run in any direction.
Avenue: An Avenue runs primarily northwest to southeast.
Boulevard: A Boulevard may run in any direction, but it must have a
median between the lanes for trees, grass or flowers. The median must
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 6, Page 52
continue down the entire length of the Boulevard, with exceptions of
divisions for interconnected street access.
Circle: A Circle starts and terminates onto the same street.
Court: A Court may extend in any direction, but it must end in a cul-desac
bulb.
Drive: A Drive runs north-south.
Lane: A Lane usually has a change in direction, so it may run northsouth,
then turn and run east-west.
Road: A Road runs east-west.
Street: A Street runs southwest-northeast.
Way: A Way runs east-west.
F. INTERSECTIONS – Street curb intersections shall be rounded by a radius of at
least twenty-five (25) feet. (See Exhibit 6-1) Where one (1) or more streets
involved in an intersection is a highway or thoroughfare, intersection standards
shall be increased at the discretion of the Planning Commission upon the advice
of the street or highway department or as recommended in A Policy on
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets by AASHTO. Multiple intersections
involving the junction of more than two (2) streets shall be avoided. Centerlines
of streets shall intersect as nearly at right angles as possible, but in no case at an
angle of less than eighty (80) degrees. Streets intersecting the same street shall
be offset at least one hundred fifty (150) feet between centerlines. Minimum
safe sight distance at an intersection shall be determined as a straight line of
unobstructed view measured in each direction across the corner between
points, each fifty (50) feet back along the intersection of the right-of-way lines.
Between three and one-half (3 1/2) feet and ten (10) feet above the surface of
the pavement no bushes, trees, structures or other obstructions shall block the
view.
G. ENTRANCES – Entrances to be located on any other class roadway except local
streets shall require the approval and appropriate permit, if required, from the
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 6, Page 53
City, County and/or State. Entrances shall be required to meet minimum sight
triangle and stopping sight distance requirements.
H. STREETS SERVING MULTI-FAMILY USES – Streets serving these multi-family
uses shall connect directly to a collector or arterial street so as not to generate
large volumes of traffic on local streets
I. HALF STREETS – Dedication of new half streets along tract boundaries shall
not be permitted except to complete the other half where such street has been
previously platted.
J. STUB STREETS – Stub streets or dedicated easements are required as part of a
continuing street plan, to provide for access to any adjacent undeveloped tract
of ten (10) acres or larger. Likewise, connections to existing stub streets in an
adjacent development are required. Exceptions to this rule may be approved by
the Planning Commission staff if the adjacent use is incompatible or if the
project engineer can show substantive geologic, hydrologic or safety issues such
as excessively steep grade. In either case, then the stub street or dedicated
easement may not be required.
When stub streets extend beyond one lot, a temporary turn-around fifty (50)
feet wide and twenty-four (24) feet long, (see detail Appendix A) referenced
from the centerline, must be provided. The turn-around shall be paved with the
same pavement design as the adjacent street unless the turn-around is expected
to be removed in another phase within six (6) months. In such case, DGA is an
acceptable temporary surface course. Prior to release of the subdivision bond, a
cash bond may be imposed to guarantee paving the turn-around if future
development does not occur. Curb and gutter on the temporary turn-around is
not required. The stub street shall extend to the tract boundary.
Stub streets extending only one (1) lot will not require a turnaround, but will be
required to extend to the property line. The name of the stub street must be
consistent as it connects or continues. If a one (1) lot deep stub street is not
provided into adjacent undeveloped tracts of ten (10) acres or more, a dedicated
fifty (50) foot wide easement for future access should be provided.
K. STREET LIGHTING
1. Subdivisions in Warren County may have street lights provided in
accordance with Warren Fiscal Court Ordinance No. 88-46, (ordinance to
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 6, Page 54
provide means whereby existing and proposed subdivisions can obtain
the installation of street lights). (See Appendix C)
2. All subdivisions in the City of Bowling Green must be provided with
streetlights with the design to be approved by the City. The City will
provide street lights to a subdivision, per City Ordinance, to a subdivision
after it is fifty (50) percent complete. Only wood poles will be provided
without cost. Where underground utilities have been installed, the City
will be responsible for the cost of a wood pole installation, with the
developer responsible for providing and installing the conduit needed for
underground service lines. If decorative poles and poles of an alternate
material are desired, the developer will be required to pay the difference
between the alternate and the wood pole. Conduit must be installed, and
provisions for payment to the City must be made prior to acceptance of
the streets for maintenance.
L. STREET NAME SIGNS AND TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES – Street name signs
shall be placed on diagonally opposite corners of each street intersection in
conformance with the street signing plan as approved by the Planning
Commission. Traffic control devices, including sign faces and posts, shall be
installed in accordance with the current edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices (MUTCD) of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal
Highway Administration, current edition. Construction plans shall be
accompanied by a street sign plan showing the proposed location of street signs
and traffic control devices. All signage must be installed after the base course is
constructed and before the plat is recorded. If within City limits, signs shall be
furnished and installed by the City of Bowling Green, and the developer will be
billed for the costs of such signs. In all other areas of the County, signs shall be
furnished and installed by developer. If within the City limits of Bowing Green,
all pavement markings shall be thermoplastic and installed by developer.
M. DEDICATION OF RIGHT-OF-WAY – A subdivision platted among existing
streets shall dedicate such additional right-of-way to meet the minimum
standards set forth in these regulations. When the subdivision is located on only
one (1) side of an existing street, only one-half (1/2) of the width, measured from
the centerline of the right-of-way, shall be provided.
N. SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION – Minimum width of sidewalks parallel with the
roadway shall be five (5) feet. The sidewalk shall be a minimum thickness of four
(4) inches. Sidewalks shall continue to the pavement edge by an ADA-compliant
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 6, Page 55
ramp at intersections to facilitate crossing. Forms for sidewalks shall be either
steel or wood with flexible forms, which will deflect to conform with radii.
Sidewalk cross slopes shall not exceed one-fourth inch (¼”) per foot (1:50) per
ADA. The portion of entrances in alignment with sidewalk sections shall also
meet ADA compliant cross slope requirements. In developments where
sidewalks will be installed, the developer shall have the handicap access ramps
installed in conjunction with construction of the curb and gutter.
O. CUL-DE-SACS – Commercial and industrial paved cul-de-sacs shall include a
turnaround which shall be provided with a right-of-way radius of sixty (60) feet
and a paved curb radius of fifty (50) feet minimum. An island may be required in
the cul-de-sac with one-way traffic around the island.
Residential paved cul-de-sacs should not serve more than thirty (30) dwelling
units or be longer than thirteen hundred (1,300) feet, which shall be provided at
the closed end with a right-of-way radius of sixty (60) feet and a paved curb
radius of fifty (50) feet. Alternatively a bulb out shaped cul-de-sac may be used
with a right-of-way radius of fifty (50) feet and a paved radius of forty (40) feet
minimum for RS-1A, 1B and 1C. The bulb out cul-de-sac will consist of a
widened roadway at a 7:1 taper (minimum) from the normal roadway cross
section to the radius point of the cul-de-sac. For all cul-de-sac designs the
entry/exit radius should be at least thirty (30) feet for where the street intersects
the cul-de-sac. (See Appendix A)
Transitional curves on all cul-de-sac turnarounds shall have a curve radius as
recommended in A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets by
AASHTO. Alternate turnaround designs utilizing islands, bulb radiuses or other
features shall be approved on a case-by-case basis.
P. MEDIANS – Medians may be permitted in street cross sections when approved
by the Planning Commission. Medians shall only be allowed when the street
cross section is designed to provide for all necessary traffic movements inherent
in the standard cross sections contained in Appendix A. Provision for the
maintenance of any median areas and associated plantings shall be noted on the
final recording plat of the property. Plantings shall be of a nature that will not
conflict with sight distance or other traffic related requirements.
Q. PRIVATE STREETS – Private streets may be permitted by the Planning
Commission. Plats containing private streets shall conform to all other
subdivision regulations, unless different requirements are listed in the following:
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 6, Page 56
1. NO DISRUPTION TO THROUGH MOVEMENT – Private streets may be
permitted only if they meet the definition of local streets; if they provide
absolutely no present or future impediment to necessary through traffic
movement in the general area; and if adjoining properties and the
general area already have or are capable of providing a proper, efficient
and safe street system that will in no way depend upon the private
streets.
2. RIGHT-OF-WAY AND SETBACK – Private street right-of-ways and
building setback lines shall be shown on the plat and shall meet at least
the minimum requirements of these subdivision regulations and the
Zoning Ordinance as required for public streets to assure conformance if
such streets are ever accepted for public dedication at a later date.
3. STREET IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS – Any permitted private street
shall conform to standards established for public street sections in these
regulations.
R. STREET CONSTRUCTION – In order to provide for roads of suitable location,
width and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford
satisfactory access to police, fire, sanitation and road maintenance equipment
and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and avoid undue
hardships to adjoining properties, the following design standards for roads are
the minimum required. Exhibit 5-1 describes the appropriate minimum or
maximum standard acceptable for subdivision development.
1. EARTHWORK (GRADING, EMBANKMENTS, CUT/FILL,
EXCAVATION) Refer to Section 6.2.E.
2. SUBGRADE PREPARATION – Refer to Section 6.2.I
3. AGGREGATE BASE – Refer to Section 6.2.K
4. CONCRETE STREET PAVING – Refer to Appendix F
5. BITUMINOUS CONCRETE (ASPHALT) BASE AND SURFACE – Refer to
Appendix F
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 6, Page 57
6. STREET CROWN – A street crown of one-fourth (1/4) inch per foot of
street width from the center of the street shall be required for a standard
section. Other non-standard cross slopes may be used if designed and
submitted by the developer’s engineer and approved by the Planning
Commission staff and the City or County Engineer or Public Works
Department.
7. STANDARD CURB AND GUTTER – Standard curb and gutter when
used for Public streets shall measure twenty-four (24) inches from back
of curb to the outer edge of gutter. The back of curb shall be a full
fourteen (14) inches in depth. The curb shall be a full eight (8) inches in
thickness for its entire width. The gutter shall slope one-half inch (½”)
per foot toward the curb. Subgrade for curb and gutter shall be
constructed per Section 6.2.I.
8. VALLEY OR MOUNTABLE CURB AND GUTTER – A concrete valley or
mountable curb shall be permitted on residential local public streets.
(See Appendix A)
S. STREET IMPROVEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT ADJOINING
EXISTING ROADWAY – Any substantial development of subdivided property
may reasonably be anticipated to create a burden on existing public roads,
thereby posing a traffic and safety hazard. In order to mitigate that hazard and
to advance the interest in having safe and adequate roadways, any proposed
subdivision abutting an existing public roadway which does not meet the rightof-
way and pavement width standards for the functional classification of that
street shall be upgraded by the developer to meet the requirements as outlined
in Exhibit 6.1, if required by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, City or
County Engineer or Public Works Department.
T. PROPOSED SUBDIVISIONS WHICH ABUT LOCAL, COLLECTOR OR
ARTERIAL STREETS – Whenever a subdivision is proposed for property which
abuts a local or collector street as defined in these Subdivision Regulations, the
developer shall be required to dedicate right-of-way necessary to comply with
the standards as set out in Exhibit 6.1 of these regulations. It is assumed that the
same right-of-way dedication will be required on the opposite side of the
roadway at such time as that property develops, thereby providing the full
necessary right-of-way width.

ARTICLE 7
CONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION PROCEDURES
SECTION 7.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this article is to set forth the Planning Commission’s construction and
inspection procedures. These procedures should create a closer continuity between the
developer, developer’s engineering representative, contractor and/or representatives of the
Planning Commission.
The current edition of the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet’s Standard Specifications for Road
and Bridge Construction shall be the primary document to determine whether improvements
are acceptable. In the event of conflict between City of Bowling Green Standard Drawings or
Subdivision Regulations and engineer’s plan, Subdivision Regulations and City of Bowling
Green Standard Drawings shall govern. Construction materials and methods for streets, storm
sewers and sidewalks shall conform to those of the current edition of the Kentucky
Transportation Cabinet, Department of Highways, Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction, except as herein set forth and described; Portland cement concrete for all items
of construction shall conform to requirements of Class “A”, Kentucky Transportation Cabinet,
Department of Highways, Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, Current
Edition.
SECTION 7.2 PROCEDURES
The following procedures shall extend to all subdivision construction:
A. PRE-CONSTRUCTION CONFERENCE – The developer, contractor, and engineering
representative shall contact the Planning Commission to schedule a pre-construction
conference with the Planning Commission staff prior to starting construction. Major
items, all appurtenances, and incidental work, which cover the entire scope of work
involved, will be discussed. The developer and contractor will be requested to outline
their proposed construction procedures and magnitude of operations, covering all work
as detailed on approved subdivision plans. The developer’s engineer shall have
furnished one (1) digital copy and two (2) hard copies of the approved construction
plans with all required changes to the Planning Commission prior to the preconstruction
conference. The approved copy of the construction plans shall be the only
set used by the contractor in the field. The group in attendance shall include the
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 7, Page 62
developer, contractor, their engineering representative, Planning Commission staff,
City or County Public Works Department and representatives from all utilities to be
installed. At the pre-construction conference, it is the intention of the Planning
Commission staff to compile sufficient information to prepare an inspection calendar
for periodic and routine inspection. At the pre-construction conference, the developer
shall provide a preliminary schedule for the work items discussed herein. The developer
shall provide a copy of the encroachment permit from the City/County/State for access
to existing roadways.
B. NOTICE OF COVERAGE – The developer or his representative shall file a Notice of
Intent (NOI) with the Kentucky Division of Water (KyDOW) and receive a Notice of
Coverage (NOC) letter prior to commencing work. Provide a copy of the NOC to the
Planning Commission Staff. The NOC shall include an Erosion Prevention and
Sediment Control Plan and Best Management Practices (BMP) plan, developed based
on all applicable City/County/State/Federal ordinances and guidelines.
C. PLANNING COMMISSION INSPECTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS – Planning
Commission staff will provide routine site visits and visual observations of the
construction activities throughout the duration of the project. The developer, engineer,
surveyor, contractors, third party testing agencies and suppliers (collectively known as
External Party agents), shall be responsible for all density testing (soil, aggregate and
asphalt), drywell flow testing, concrete testing, utility testing, as-built drawings,
asphalt plant, aggregate plant, concrete plant testing, and any other testing and
paperwork needed for acceptance. External party agents shall be properly certified by
the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet or the appropriate trade organization for the
work they are performing. A copy of such certification shall be provided to the Planning
Commission prior to performing the work.
D. INSPECTION OF INITIAL GRADING OPERATION – All areas subject to grading
operations must have sedimentation and erosion controls in place prior to commencing
work. The Planning Commission and developer’s representatives shall inspect the
erosion controls prior to continuing with grading. The first field inspection will deal
with a general review of the area to be graded within the limits of the roadway with
emphasis on the subsoil in particular where any embankment is to be placed. The sod
and topsoil shall be removed from the roadway grading area and stockpiled for
redistribution. Any disturbed areas shall be stabilized and maintained according to
appropriate erosion protection and sediment control guidelines. The Planning
Commission and developer’s representatives will also review the alignment and grade
stakes. The grading operations will be inspected periodically throughout its
construction period.
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 7, Page 63
E. GRADING AND EMBANKMENTS – The area on which streets are to be constructed
should be cleared of all vegetation and disposed of outside of the limits of the right-ofway.
Grading shall be done to the extent of the right-of-way or to the back of the
sidewalk at a maximum cross slope of one-half inch (½”) per foot. Prior to the
construction of embankments, any unsuitable material on which the embankment will
be superimposed should be removed and the area should be stabilized by conventional
methods. Where development is proposed on areas of existing fill where the
composition and compaction of fill materials is in doubt test borings may be required by
the Planning Commission before development is permitted to occur. As the minimum,
the area will be proof rolled with a loaded tandom axle truck to determine suitability of
the base material. The embankments shall be formed by placing material in successive
horizontal layers of no more than twelve (12) inches in thickness, loose depth. Densities
shall be verified at minimum two hundred (200) foot interval and shall meet or exceed
ninety-five percent (95%) standard proctor. No organic material shall be permitted in
the embankments. No rock or similar irreducible material with a maximum dimension
greater than twelve (12) inches shall be buried or placed in embankments unless
approved by the Planning Commission staff. Small boulders or rock layers shall not be
deposited within two (2) feet of sub-grade elevation.
F. CUT SECTION EXCAVATION – Cut sections should be excavated to the required
typical section and any unsuitable material encountered shall be removed and the area
backfilled in six (6) inch horizontal layers and thoroughly compacted before successive
layers are placed. Densities shall be run at minimum two hundred (200) foot intervals
and shall meet or exceed ninety-five percent (95%) standard proctor.
G. SOLID ROCK EXCAVATION – If solid rock is encountered in connection with the
grading operation, the solid rock shall be removed to a depth of twelve (12) inches
below sub-grade elevation and backfilled to meet the grading and embankment
requirements.
H. INSPECTION OF CULVERT PIPE AND OTHER DRAINAGE OPERATIONS – The
Planning Commission and developer’s representatives will inspect or be present when
the installation of culvert pipe and retention/detention areas are started. The concrete
headwall construction and various other concrete items, such as sinkhole boxes,
drywells, etc., will be inspected. The Planning Commission’s representative shall be
notified twenty-four (24) hours before backfilling storm pipe so they may inspect the
drainage devices before backfill of major items occurs. In general reference, the overall
proposed drainage pattern of the subdivision will be reviewed extending from the
summit of the drainage area, along the meandering ravines and ditches to their
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 7, Page 64
terminus, whether it be to a natural waterway, natural sinkhole or ponding area and
drywell to determine if the drainage pattern is substantially in accordance with the
approved plans. Drainage operations shall be installed during the initial operations of
construction and remain functional (protected from silt and erosion issues) throughout
construction. Upon completion of the stormwater drainage system the developer’s
contractor may be required to furnish the Planning Commission with a video test of the
drainage system. The test and report shall be conducted by an approved and prequalified
Kentucky Transportation Cabinet certified video and pipe inspection
contractor. The video tests shall include the video and written report detailing pipe
deformation, pipe deflection, pipe grade, joints and connections. Any deficiencies
reported shall be corrected prior to a reduction of the initial bond.

K. INSPECTION OF SUBGRADE PREPARATION – The Planning Commission and
developer’s representatives will inspect the preparation and completion of subgrade. A
copy of the proctor test shall be supplied to the Planning Commission staff at the preapplication
conference. The subgrade shall meet the density requirement of ninetyseven
percent (97%) of standard proctor density. Test results shall be submitted to the
Planning Commission staff for approval. As the minimum, the area will be proof rolled
with a loaded tandom axle truck to determine suitability of the sub-grade material.
Nuclear density testing is preferred when material permits and must be done in the
presence of the Planning Commission's representative. Density tests will be required on
the compacted subgrade at random locations and intervals not to exceed two hundred
feet (200’). Sampling and testing is further defined in Appendix F. The roadway crosssection
(including crown and sidewalk areas) shall be checked for proper cross-slope on
fifty foot (50’) intervals. The Planning Commission and developer’s representatives
must be present for the density and cross-section tests and must give twenty-four (24)
hour notice. The contractor shall stop operations until approved by the Planning
Commission Executive Director.
L. INSPECTION OF CURB AND GUTTER CONSTRUCTION – Concrete curb and gutter
materials and construction shall be per requirements of the current edition of the

Director.
M. INSPECTION OF DENSE GRADED AGGREGATE (DGA) – Prior to commencing DGA
construction, the developer’s representative shall provide, at a minimum, a gradation
test for the DGA. The Planning Commission and developer’s representatives will
inspect the placing, shaping and compaction of the dense grade aggregate base
construction. DGA shall be pugged (minimum 5% moisture by weight) and placed to
proper grade and cross slope with a mechanical paver or approved spreader box such
that further grading is minimal. A box spreader may be used as long as the contractor
can demonstrate that it can be placed without segregation and can meet Kentucky
specifications for compaction. Tailgating is not permitted. Before the course will be
considered acceptable, the course shall meet the required eighty-four percent (84%) of
solid density or a control strip shall be constructed to obtain target density (historically
in Warren County, Kentucky, aggregate sources have produced mixes that had a
specific gravity of 2.65 and solid density of 165 pcf) with subsequent compaction
meeting ninety-five (95%) of target density. The Planning Commission staff may allow
deviation from this standard, or target density, or proof rolls if field conditions are
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 7, Page 68
justified. A representative sampling of nuclear density testing shall be done in the
presence of the Planning Commission and developer’s representatives. At a minimum,
density tests will be required on the compacted DGA at random locations and intervals
not to exceed two hundred (200) feet. Test results shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission staff for approval. Periodic inspection will be made during the construction
of this item. All density tests shall be certified by a licensed civil engineer. Sampling and

tests and must give twenty-four (24) hour notice. Immediately after the dense
DGA/CSB has been applied, the quantity used will be compiled to determine if the
quantity per square yard has been constructed. Weigh tickets and summary shall be
submitted to the Planning Commission staff for approval. The contractor shall stop
operations until approved by the Planning Commission.
N. INSPECTION OF ASPHALT BASE CONSTRUCTION – The asphalt mixture shall be
provided by a Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) certified asphalt plant. Prior to
commencing asphalt base construction, the developer’s asphalt supplier shall provide,
at a minimum, a job mix formula for the asphalt base, which includes tests and
calculations for percent air voids, VMA, maximum specific gravity, bulk specific gravity
and percent liquid asphalt content. The Planning Commission and developer’s
representatives will review the beginning of the asphalt base application and check the
truck to determine if they are equipped with heavy canvas covers to protect the
material from the elements and retain the heat in the mix while in transit. At a
minimum, the temperature of the material will also be checked when it arrives on the
project site. The course shall meet the required minimum ninety-three percent (93%) of
solid volume and maximum ninety-six percent (96%) of solid volume before it will be
acceptable. A representative sampling by PQI, coring or nuclear density testing shall be
done in the presence of the Planning Commission and developer’s representatives. At a
minimum, density tests will be required on the compacted asphalt base at random
locations and intervals not to exceed two hundred (200) feet. Test results shall be
submitted to the Planning Commission staff for approval. Periodic inspections will be
made as the operations progress. Sampling and testing is further defined in Appendix F.
The Planning Commission and developer’s representatives must be scheduled and
present for the density test. All test requests must have at least twenty-four (24) hour
notice. To assure the designed structural number is achieved, the median of field
measurements must equal or exceed the design thickness. If a deficiency develops in
the asphalt base course of any consequence, adjustments will be made in the overlying
or succeeding asphalt surface course to compensate for the deficiency. The developer’s
representative or contractor shall obtain, for the information of the Planning
Warren County Subdivision Regulations
Article 7, Page 69
Commission staff, the test reports showing, at a minimum, the test results and
calculations for percent air voids, VMA, maximum specific gravity, bulk specific gravity
and percent liquid asphalt content. Liquid asphalt shall be from a state approved
source. Weigh tickets and summary shall be submitted to the Planning Commission
staff for approval. At this time, the contractor shall check manholes, valve boxes and
other obstacles within the pavement and adjust them to match the finished cross
section, if needed. The contractor shall stop operations until approved by the Planning
Commission. The Planning Commission staff reserves the right to require core samples
of the finished asphalt base if insufficient thickness, poor compaction or other
deficiencies are suspected.
O. INSPECTION OF ASPHALT TACK COAT AND ASPHALT SURFACE APPLICATION –
Prior to commencing asphalt surface construction, the developer’s representative shall
provide, at a minimum, a job mix formula, which includes tests and calculations for
percent air voids, VMA, maximum specific gravity, bulk specific gravity and percent
liquid asphalt content for the asphalt surface. The Planning Commission and
developer’s representatives shall review the application of asphalt tack coat and the
application of the asphalt surface course. In like manner as the base construction, the
trucks will be reviewed to determine if they are equipped with canvas covers to protect
the material while in transit. At a minimum, the temperature of the mix when it arrives
on the project site will be checked. The developer’s representative or contractor shall
obtain for the information of the Planning Commission staff the test reports showing,
at a minimum, the test results and calculations for percent air voids, VMA, maximum
specific gravity, bulk specific gravity and percent liquid asphalt content. Liquid asphalt
shall be from a state approved source. Weigh tickets and summary shall be submitted
to the Planning Commission staff for approval. Periodic inspection will be made of this
construction. The Planning Commission and developer’s representatives must be
scheduled and present for the construction (all test requests must give twenty-four (24)
hour notice). To assure the designed structural number is achieved; the median of field
measurements must equal or exceed the design thickness. The Planning Commission
staff reserves the right to require core samples of the finished asphalt surface if
insufficient thickness, poor compaction or other deficiencies are suspected. Should the
developer elect to delay placement of asphalt surface then the design structural
number must be met with placement of the dense grade and asphalt base mats.
P. RIGID PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION – See requirements in Appendix F.
Q. CONSTRUCTION REVISIONS – Changes to the construction plans shall be submitted
to the Planning Commission for approval prior to continuing work affected by the
changes. Review will be performed in a timely manner to minimize delay.

R. PLANNING COMMISSION AUTHORITY – The Planning Commission reserves the right
to stop work being performed improperly on this project by the contractor or any
subcontractor until conditions can be agreed upon which work can proceed.
S. CITY / COUNTY ENGINEER OR PUBLIC WORKS AUTHORITY – The County or City
Public Works Director and/or Engineer will inspect the active construction occasionally,
if and when time will permit them away from their routine duties.
T. INSPECTION OF FINAL DRESSING – The Planning Commission and developer’s
representatives will review the final dressing of shoulder, ditches, buffer areas, the
back-slopes in cuts, embankment slopes and all other disturbed areas within the
subdivision. Soils and amendments suitable for vegetation must be placed on any
slopes that are to be seeded. Improvements will not be accepted until a good stand of
grass is achieved and it appears unlikely that damages will occur due to heavy rain.
U. STREET NAME SIGNS AND TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES – Refer to Section 5.7.L.
V. INSPECTION AT COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION – When all items,
appurtenances and incidentals have been completed in compliance with the approved
subdivision construction plans, the Planning Commission staff will request the City
and/or County Engineer to attend a semi-final inspection of the subdivision in its
entirety, and for final acceptance. The final inspection will be made by the Planning
Commission staff, the County or City Engineer or Public Works Department, the
developer’s engineer and the contractor.
1. ACCEPTANCE OF DRYWELLS – Drywells shall be inspected and retested for
functionality in accordance with Section 6.4.M prior to acceptance by the local
jurisdiction.
2. ACCEPTANCE OF SIDEWALKS – Sidewalks will be inspected by the City,
County or Planning Commission representative prior to and during concrete
placement. Sidewalk ramps and transition areas shall be the responsibility of the
developer as included in the construction contract and shall be installed when
curb and gutter are constructed.
W. “AS-BUILT” PLANS – When all improvements have been made and approved, two (2)
sets of “as-built” plans shall be submitted to the Planning Commission staff. The plans
shall show the finished plan and profile of all streets, finished contours and volume of all
retention/detention basins and profiles of all major drainage ditches, inlet/outlet

Article 7, Page 71
elevations of all pipe and storm sewer and all other pertinent construction. “As-built” of
the gutter flow lines, edges of pavement and centerline of road shall be done prior to
the surface course or as directed by the Planning Commission. Adjustments to the
grade shall be made, if needed, prior to proceeding with surface pavement
construction. The “as-built” plans shall be dated and signed by a licensed civil engineer
or surveyor. State statutes and regulations shall govern the division of work performed
by each profession.
X. ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW FEES – A fee for review and verification shall be paid prior
to the commencement of construction or recordation of plat, whichever shall first
occur. This review and verification is not a release of the responsibility of the
developer’s engineer and surveyor to certify that the improvements have been
completed according to design drawings and specifications. The purpose of the
Planning Commission’s review and verification is a review for compliance and
verification of methods and adherence to plans for the accepting agency. Review fees

WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 2
B.1 INTRODUCTION
Non-point source pollution is now responsible for up to eighty percent (80%) of pollution
in waters of the U.S., which include streams, lakes, rivers, and wetlands. This is true, in
part, due to significant reductions in direct discharges of pollutants by industry that have
been achieved since passage of the Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1972. In urban areas, nonpoint
source pollution occurs because storm water runoff collects impurities while
passing over rooftops, streets, parking lots, landscaping and gutters. This polluted storm
water runoff typically enters a storm drain system and is rapidly conveyed to a lake,
stream or river. The percentage of impervious land cover in urban and suburban
watersheds generally indicates the level of pollutant impact on receiving waters. In most
cases, impervious cover in excess of thirty percent (30%) results in streams that are
considered “degraded,” while impervious cover between ten and thirty percent (10%-
30%) causes “impacts” on the receiving streams. Typical residential development results
in approximately thirty-five percent (35%) of a watershed being impervious, which is
more than enough to degrade the receiving waters. Realization of this fact is important,
because healthy (non-impacted) streams are important for a healthy ecosystem, and a
healthy ecosystem is important for all living creatures including people.
In Warren County the karst cave system has been utilized, often overly so, to manage
storm water runoff. Utilization of karst for storm water management is not an exact
science. It is often difficult to predict the exact pathways of underground streams and
thus the impact of introducing increased runoff to downstream locations. We have also
come to realize that the karst system has limits and see this in the form of basins that do
not readily drain or may even surcharge when the cave system is full.
A second by-product of utilizing the karst for storm water drainage is the almost
immediate introduction of contaminates into our water systems. Fertilizers and other
chemicals that are used on lawns are carried directly into storm sewers then into basins
and often into drywells and sinkhole boxes with no treatment. Ultimately these toxins
travel into our ground water, streams lakes effecting wildlife and our source drinking
water.
To protect our natural resources, the CWA of 1972, as amended in 1987, prohibits the
discharge of pollutants to waters of the U.S. and mandates that storm water not be
discharged unless it is in compliance with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit. Bowling Green and Warren County are responsible for ensuring
that discharges of storm water from pubic storm water systems into waters of the state
comply with CWA requirements. The implementation of the requirements contained in
this manual will be a primary mechanism for accomplishing this objective.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 3
Storm water management in Bowling Green/Warren County shall include management
for quality as well as quantity (flood protection). This storm water appendix is intended
as a guide only to provide information on the structural water quality and water quantity
best management practices (BMPs).
Permanent water quality treatment measures described in this chapter should not be
confused with erosion and sediment controls required during construction.
B.2 GENERAL DESIGN CRITERIA
Storm water management in Bowling Green/Warren County shall include management
for quality and quantity. This section provides the general design criteria for both.
B.2.1 Water Quantity Control
Water quantity controls shall be implemented so that post-development peak discharges
do not exceed pre-development discharges for those storms listed in Table B.1.
B.2.2 Water Quality Controls
Research has indicated that capturing and treating eighty percent (80%) of the total
annual runoff volume provides effective water quality treatment volume based on
removal of particulates. Effective removal of solid particles in the runoff also provides for
removal of significant amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and oil and grease. Ninety
percent (90%) of the annual runoff seems to be a large volume, but the storm events that
cumulatively produce this runoff volume in Warren County produce less than 1.0 inches
of runoff each. Using historical rainfall records, typical soil parameters, and the SWMM
model, the runoff depth necessary for eighty percent (80%) runoff capture was
approximated as a function of percent impervious area. These values, which are shown in
Table B-1, represent the water quality depth that shall be treated for each development.
For example, a twenty (20)-acre development that is forty percent (40%) impervious has
a water quality depth of 0.7 inches over the whole area (not just the impervious area),
resulting in a water quality volume (WQV) of 50,820 cubic feet.
In addition to carrying pollutants, storm water runoff from developed areas increases the
frequency and duration of bankfull flows in the receiving streams, causing increased
erosion of the stream banks and further degradation of in-stream water quality. On-site
infiltration designed for the increased runoff due to development is the preferred
solution to this impact.

Notes:
1) The Water Quality Volume (WQV) is the volume resulting from applying the
prescribed Water Quality Depth to the drainage area to be developed.
2) For % impervious values between those given use linear interpolation.
3) Water quality controls are not required for sites that are less than ten percent
(10%) impervious.
B.3 BIORETENTION SYSTEMS
Bioretention is a practice to treat storm water runoff using a conditioned planting soil
bed and planting materials to filter runoff stored within a shallow depression. The
method combines physical filtering and absorption with biological processes. The
system consists of a structure to spread flow, a pretreatment filter strip or grass channel,
a sand bed, pea gravel overflow curtain drain, a shallow ponding area, a surface organic
layer of mulch, a planting soil bed, plant material, a gravel underdrain system, and an
overflow system. Figure B-1 shows a diagram of a bioretention system designed to
receive runoff from a paved area.
B.3.1 Applicability
Bioretention systems are very effective for water quality treatment. Bioretention
systems are particularly well suited for use in parking lot islands, roadside swales and
median strips.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 5
B.3.2 Design Criteria
Size the area of the filter bed in accordance with the design WQV corresponding to the
area draining to it. (See the next section for procedure)
Design the bioretention system to be on-line with an overflow catch basin, as shown in
Figure B-1, to handle volumes exceeding the design WQV.
Design the bioretention system to have a longitudinal slope of 0 to 1 percent (0-1%).
Provide a pretreatment system composed of a pea gravel diaphragm and a grassed filter
strip. The pea gravel diaphragm also serves as a flow spreader. Dimensions of the gravel
diaphragm and grass filter strip shown in Figure B.1 are minimums. When flow into a
bioretention system is parallel to its long dimension (i.e., from a drainage swale), omit
the gravel diaphragm shown in Figure B.1 and provide a berm across the downstream end
of the system to impede the flow. The top of the berm shall be level across the base of
the bioretention system and be twelve to eighteen (12-18) inches high in the center.
Provide a planting soil bed with a minimum width of four (4) feet and a minimum depth
of four (4) feet (including a twelve (12)-inch sand bed). The planting soil bed can be as
wide as fifteen (15) feet. The area of the system is determined by the required area of the
filter bed. The minimum length is fifteen (15) feet.
For widths greater than ten (10) feet, maintain at least a 2:1 length to width ratio.
Provide a pea gravel curtain drain, as shown in Figure B.1. The minimum width of the
curtain drain is eight (8) inches.
Provide a two to three (2-3) inch thick mulch layer above the planting soil bed.
Grade the top of the planting soil bed to provide a shallow ponding area with a maximum
depth of six (6) inches.
Provide an underdrain system of gravel and perforated pipe. Design the gravel bed to be
at least eight (8) inches deep. Connect the underdrain to the storm drainage system or
design it to daylight to a suitable non-erosive outfall.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 6
B.3.3 Design Procedures
Size the filter bed using the following equation:
Af = V*(df)/ [k*(hf + df)(tf)]
Where:
Af = surface area of the sand filter bed (ft²)
V = treatment or infiltration volume (ft³)
Df = planting bed depth (ft.)
k = coefficient of permeability for planting bed (ft. /day)
hf = average height of water above the planting bed (ft); hf = 0.5 * hmax
tf = time required for V to filter through the planting bed (days).
Note:
df = 4 feet (including sand filter) unless it is increased by designer
k = 0.5 feet/day (median value of a silt loam)
hf = 0.5 * hmax = 3 inches = 0.25 feet
tf = 3 days
Design the bioretention system to provide the minimum filter area required and to meet
the design criteria.
B.3.4 Specifications
Provide planting soil with the following characteristics:
 pH of 5.2 to 7.0
 organic content of 1.5 to 4 percent
 magnesium of 35 pounds per acre minimum
 phosphorus (as P2O5) of 75 pounds per acre minimum

B.4 INFILTRATION SYSTEMS
Infiltration practices and/or bioretention systems reduce the adverse impacts on the
receiving waters that result from increasing the impervious area. This chapter describes
several infiltration practices that can be used in many different situations. Many of the
practices cannot function as the sole water quality infiltration and treatment device, but
will provide significant “credits” toward reducing the magnitude of the runoff that must
be detained and treated.
Infiltration practices include a variety of practices such as directing downspouts to
grassed areas and using modular pavement. Infiltration practices also include swales,
terraforming, infiltration, and vegetative filters. Terraforming is a term for special
grading practices such as terracing and berming that are intended to promote
infiltration. This section presents infiltration practices and describes the minimum
requirements that must be met to obtain credits to reduce water quality treatment
volumes.
The infiltration volume credit listed for each practice can be used to satisfy an equal
amount of water quality volume.
B.4.1 Downspouts to Grass
Discharging downspouts from roofs onto grassed yards encourages infiltration and
reduces direct discharge to impervious areas such as driveways. The grass area shall be
greater than or equal to the roof area.
Infiltration Credit
When downspouts are discharged onto grass, the infiltration credit is 0.225 acre-feet per
acre of roof area.
Design Criteria
The lot must be graded so that the downspout discharge travels at least thirty (30) feet
over grass before reaching a driveway, roadway, paved ditch or any other impervious
conveyance.
B.4.2 Modular Pavement
Modular pavement consists of strong structural materials, typically concrete, having
regularly interspersed void spaces that are filled with pervious materials such as sand,
gravel, or sod. These pavements can be used as driveways or as overflow parking in areas
that are used less frequently than the main parking areas for civic, commercial and
industrial facilities. Modular pavement can be used for any portion of parking up to that
amount allowed by the Planning Commission.
Infiltration Credit
Any area that is paved using modular pavement can be treated as pervious for purposes
of calculating WQV and post-development peak runoff, as long as appropriate design
criteria and construction specifications are satisfied.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 11
Design Criteria
Large void spaces in modular pavement shall represent at least thirty percent (30%) of
the total surface area of the pavement.
Voids shall be filled with silty soil and vegetated with permanent grass. If vegetation is
inappropriate voids may be filled with sand or gravel, but the material shall be clean and
uniform (poorly graded) to ensure high permeability.
Construction Specifications
Install all modular pavements following manufacturer’s specifications.
To prevent premature clogging and/or failure, modular pavements shall not be placed
into service until the entire contributing surface drainage area has been completely
stabilized.
Clearly mark the planned area for modular pavement to prevent heavy equipment from
compacting the underlying soils.
Excavate the subgrade soil using equipment with tracks or oversized tires to minimize
compaction.
B.4.3 Swales
Swales are typically vegetated parabolic or trapezoidal channels with a large width to
depth ratio that are used for conveying storm water runoff. Swales can act both as
vegetated filters and infiltration practices because they tend to slow runoff rates and
allow for both particle settling and storm water infiltration. Swales are encouraged
wherever they can be used as an alternative to narrower, deeper channels that tend to
convey flow at higher velocities. Swales are especially effective in reducing water quality
impacts when used for roadside drainage instead of the traditional curb inlet/storm
sewer system. In this application, curb cuts are used instead of drop inlets in the gutter.
See Figure B.2.
Swales can be even more effective when constructed using berms or infiltration beds to
encourage additional ponding and infiltration. These cases are discussed in subsequent
sections.
Infiltration Credits
When swales are used, the infiltration credit is 0.25 acre-feet per acre of swale. To obtain
this credit, the area draining to the swale must be at least three (3) times the area of the
swale considering that the swale itself is part of the drainage area.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 12
To calculate the area of the swale, the width will be the average water surface width
corresponding to the flowrate associated with the 100-year storm.
Design Criteria
To be considered a swale, a channel must have a width to depth ratio of at least 6:1, have
a bed slope of not greater than four percent (4%), and be vegetated. When swales are
used for roadside drainage, curb cuts shall be provided no less frequently than on per
each one hundred (100) feet of curb.
Drop inlets in swales shall be spaced no closer than once per each three hundred (300)
feet in order to obtain the infiltration credit.
Grassed channels that do not satisfy the design criteria to be considered swales may be
given an infiltration credit only for the channel bottom, if the bed slope does not exceed
four percent (4%).
B.4.4 Bermed Swales
A bermed swale or infiltration swale is a grassed swale constructed with berms or swale
blocks across the swale to impound shallow pools of water, slowing flow and providing
additional opportunities for particle settling and storm water infiltration.
Infiltration Credit
Infiltration credit for a bermed swale is calculated in the same manner as the credit for a
swale, except that the calculated infiltration credit can be increased by fifty percent
(50%) of the water volume that can be impounded by the berms.
Design Criteria
Swale blocks or earthen berms built across the swale shall be constructed with a two (2)-
inch diameter PVC pipe through the berm to prevent long-term ponding of water.
Berms shall be no taller than eight (8) inches and spaced no closer than sixty (60) feet.
Drop inlets in swales shall be spaced no closer than once per each three hundred (300)
feet in order to obtain the infiltration credit.
Grassed channels that do not satisfy the design criteria to be considered swales may be
given an infiltration credit only for the channel bottom, if the bed slope does not exceed
four (4) percent.
B.4.5 Biofiltration Swales
A biofiltration swale is a version of a bioretention system without the pipe underdrain
system. This practice encourages infiltration from the swale bottom, through a planting
bed, to the underlying soil. See Figure B.3
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 13
Infiltration Credit
Infiltration credit for a biofiltration swale is 0.50 acre-feet per acre of swale plus one
hundred percent (100%) of the volume of the ponded water, when designed according to
the following criteria.
If biofiltration swales are designed consistent with the procedures for bioretention
systems, the infiltration credit equals the design treatment volume.
Design Criteria
Biofiltration swales shall be designed to have the following characteristics:
 trapezoidal or parabolic shape
 bottom width of 2 feet
 side slopes no steeper than 3:1
 longitudinal slope of 1 to 2 percent (up to 4 percent slope can be used with berms
constructed as required for bermed swales)
 length, width, depth, and slope necessary to provide surface storage of the design
volume with a maximum ponded depth of 18 inches.
 vegetated in accordance with requirements for vegetated channels with grass
lining
 capacity to convey the 100-year design storm with at least 6 inches of freeboard
 A soil bed 36 inches deep having the width of the swale bottom
Plan the soil bed to consist of soils that have a permeability of at least 0.5 feet per day
(USCS soils ML, SM, or SC). If native soils do not satisfy this criterion, a prepared soil bed
can be designed.
An alternative to the above criteria is to size the filter bed (i.e., planting soil bed) for a
biofiltration swale consistent with a bioretention system. Then the infiltration credit
would be calculated in the same manner as the credit for bioretention.
B.4.6 Terraforming
Terraforming is a term for special grading practices such as terracing and berming that
are intended to promote infiltration. Bermed swales are a special case of terraforming.
Terraforming can range from a small depression in permeable soil to an extensive series
of bermed terraces. A simple example is given in Figure B.4.
Infiltration Credit
The infiltration credit for terraforming is 0.25 acre-feet per acre of area terraformed plus
one hundred percent (100%) of the impounded water.
B.4.7 Infiltration Basins
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 14
Infiltration basins may be used in locations that have at least five (5) feet of soil, with a
permeability of at least 0.5 inches per hour underlying the device. The underlying five (5)
feet of soil must also be above the seasonal high water table.
If soils do not meet the permeability requirement, they can be modified by mixing sand
and gravel in the top five (5) feet of the soil underlying the device. If native soils are to be
modified with sand or gravel, provide a design that shows the depth of soil to be
modified and the total quantity of gravel or soil to be added. Include soil test data
documenting the permeability of the soils before and after modification.
If desired, large infiltration basins can be designed much like an extended detention pond
for storm peak control. The outlet structure and detention storage volumes are designed
to be above the level needed to store the design WQV. The difference is that an
infiltration basin does not have an extended detention outlet. Instead, the WQV is
allowed to infiltrate into the soils underlying the basin. If the infiltration basin is not
intended for peak flow control, it shall be designed so that volumes exceeding the WQV
can discharge through an overflow weir or pipe. For small excavated basins of less than
one-fourth (1/4) acre, volumes exceeding the WQV may be allowed to overflow onto the
ground surface without use of an overflow structure, if proper erosion control measures
are implemented.
The infiltration credit for an infiltrated basin is simply the volume designed to be
impounded before overflow or discharge to a spillway.
Design Criteria
Test soils prior to designing an infiltration basin to ensure that the site is capable of
infiltration. Obtain a minimum of three (3) soil test borings or test pits to verify that the
soil is at least five (5) feet deep below the base elevation and has a permeability of at
least 0.5 inch per hour.
Design the floor of the basin to be as flat as possible to promote infiltration. Provide side
slopes not greater than 3:1 (h:v).
Provide a sediment forebay at the inlet to the basin with a depth of at least four (4) feet
and a volume of at least ten percent (10%) of the WQV.
Size the basin to store the design WQV before discharging through the peak flow control
outlet. If the basin is intended only for water quality treatment, design an outlet that
allows volumes in excess of the WQV to discharge to a surface water conveyance.
If a base flow will be discharged into the infiltration basin, design a low flow orifice to
allow base flow to pass through.
Adjust the storage depth so that the basin will completely drain the WQV in seventy-two
(72) hours.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 15
When using an infiltration basin for peak flow control, provide a minimum of one (1) foot
of freeboard above the 100-year design storm high water elevation.
Impoundment depths shall not exceed fifteen (15) feet and storage volumes shall not
exceed twenty-five (25) acre-feet.
Design earthen embankments with side slopes not steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to
vertical).
Design basins to be placed outside the receiving stream except when a basin is designed
as a regional detention basin and Warren County Public Works has approved its use as a
regional basin.
Reserve adequate access from public or private right-of-way by establishing a
maintenance easement. Design the access to be at least ten (10) feet wide, with a slope
not greater than 5:1 (h:v). Design the access way to connect to the embankment so that
equipment can access the top of the embankment on a slope not greater than 5:1 (h:v).
Provide a minimum twenty-five (25)-foot wide buffer strip between the basin and the
nearest lot. Landscape the buffer strip with low-maintenance native grasses, shrubs and
trees. Provide a landscaping plan for the basin and the buffer. Objectives of landscaping
include improving the appearance for adjacent residents and providing wildlife habitat.
Specifications
Embankment, outlet and emergency spillway specifications are consistent with those for
detention basins.
Excavate the basin with light equipment having tracks or over-sized tires to minimize
compaction of the underlying soils. After the basin is excavated to the final design depth,
deeply till the basin floor with a rotary tiller or disc harrow to restore infiltration rates.
After tilling, apply a leveling drag.
Establish vegetation immediately after achieving final grade and preparing the
infiltration bed. Stabilize the floor of the basin with a dense cover of water-tolerant
herbaceous species consistent with requirements of bioretention systems.
B.4.8 Vegetated Filter Strips
A vegetated filter is a practice that relies upon the use of vegetation to filter out
sediment and other pollutants from storm water runoff. These filters also provide an
opportunity for storm water runoff to infiltrate. Vegetated filters can be used as water
quality devices. Vegetated filters can be used for small subareas of a larger development
in order to reduce the total volume to be treated by other devices in the development.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 16
A filter strip is a practice that relies upon sheet flow across the entire width of the
vegetated area. The vegetation is typically grass; however, other ground cover can be
used if it provides for dense vegetation. Filter strips are typically used at the edge of a
parking lot or other paved surface.
Design Criteria
Design a filter strip to have a width matching the width of the area draining to the filter.
Design a filter strip to have a smooth transition with the area draining to it so that sheet
flow can be developed across the filter.
Design filter strips to have a minimum slope of two percent (2%) and a maximum slope
of six percent (6%).
Provide a dense turf or other comparable vegetated ground cover over the whole filter
area.
When the contributing area draining to the filter strip is impervious, do not allow the
overland flow length of the impervious surface to exceed seventy-five (75) feet.
When the contributing area draining to the filter strip is pervious, do not allow the
overland flow length of the contributing surface to exceed one hundred fifty (150) feet.
Infiltration Credit
The infiltration credit for vegetated filters is 0.075 acre-feet per acre of filter.
B.5 SAND AND ORGANIC FILTERS
In general usage, storm water filters are a diverse group of techniques for treating storm
water quality with each using some sort of filtering media such as sand, soil, gravel, peat,
compost or vegetation. Filters will include systems with a designed filter bed composed
of sand, gravel, compost or peat and an outlet to the storm water drainage system or a
receiving stream. Systems described in this section include surface sand filters,
underground sand filters, perimeter sand filters and organic filters.
B.5.1 Applicability
Filters can be used for water quality treatment, but are not appropriate for peak flow
(quantity) control.
B.5.2 General Design Criteria
Design criteria in this section apply to all filtration devices in this section.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 17
Provide a pretreatment cell to allow sedimentation prior to the filter bed and reduce
clogging.
Locate inlet and outlet structures at extreme ends of the pretreatment cell.
Design the pretreatment or sedimentation cell to have a minimum depth of three (3) feet
to minimize resuspension and turbulence.
Design the bottom of the pretreatment cell to be nearly level to facilitate sedimentation.
Design the surface area of the pretreatment cell (in square feet) to be at least 0.0081
times the WQV (in cubic feet) for areas with seventy-five percent (75%) or more
impervious surface. For areas with less than seventy-five percent (75%) impervious
surface, design the surface area of the pretreatment cell (in square feet) to be at least
0.066 times the WQV (in cubic feet). The order of magnitude difference in the two
factors derives from the fact that areas with higher percentages of impervious surface
(i.e., seventy-five percent (75%) or more) tend to have a greater proportion of coarsegrained
sediments, which have a higher settling velocity.
Size the pretreatment cell with a minimum length to width ratio of 2:1.
The length to width ratio of the pretreatment cell can be less than 2:1 if baffles are
provided to obtain a flow length equivalent to or greater than would be obtained with a
2:1 ratio.
Design each filtering device for a capture or storage volume equal to or greater than
three-fourths (3/4) times the WQV.
Design filtration systems to be off-line by using a flow-splitter or other device to divert
flows in excess of the WQV around the filtration systems.
Provide sufficient access to the device for construction and maintenance. Provide an
access ramp with a maximum slope of ten percent (10%) for vegetated ramps, fifteen
percent (15%), if the slope is stabilized with crushed stone, or twenty-five percent (25%)
if paved.
Construct exposed piping and accessories out of durable, strong materials to avoid
susceptibility to damage by vandalism.
Provide access manholes and/or grates to underground and below grade structures for
each subsurface chamber. Provide manhole diameters of at least thirty (30) inches to
meet confined space access criteria. Place manhole steps to allow maintenance
personnel easy access to structure bottoms. Provide a five (5)-foot minimum height
clearance (from the top of the sand layer to the bottom of slab) for all fixed permanent
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 18
underground structures. Provide lifting rings or other suitable elements to lift and
replace structure top slabs.
Construct the underground sand filter with a dewatering gate valve located just above
the top of the sand filter bed. Should the filter bed and/or underdrain system clog
completely, the gate valve can be opened to dewater the filter chamber for needed
maintenance.
B.5.3 Surface Sand Filter
A surface sand filter is shown in Figure B-5. This system is constructed of reinforced
concrete with a pretreatment (sedimentation) chamber and a filter bed chamber with a
sand filter and underdrain system. Figure B-5 also shows a flow diversion chamber at the
inlet end of the structure.
The filter bed has an eighteen (18)-inch to twenty four (24)-inch sand layer which traps or
strains pollutants before runoff is collected in an underdrain system (gravel and
perforated pipe) and conveyed to the receiving stream, channel or pipe. The filter bed
surface may have sand or grass cover.
Surface sand filters are open at the top, which provides easy access for maintenance, but
renders these unsuitable in areas easily accessible to the general public, especially small
children. Control access to surface sand filters by enclosing them in an eight (8)-foot
chain link fence. Such a configuration is most suitable to industrial and warehousing
facilities rather than commercial/retail establishments where aesthetic impact is
significant. Even for industrial sites, consider proximity to residential areas and other
locations frequented by children. In some locations, an eight (8)-foot fence may not
provide adequate protection.
Design Procedures
Size the pretreatment chamber in accordance with design criteria in section B.5.2
Size the area of the filter bed using the following equation:
Af = WQV*(df)/[k*(hf+df)(tf)]
Where:
Af = surface area of the sand filter bed (ft²)
WQV = water quality treatment volume (ft³)
df = sand filter bed depth (ft)
k = coefficient of permeability for sand bed (ft/day)
hf = average height of water above the sand bed (ft); hf=0.5*hmax
tf = time required for the WQV to filter through the sand bed (days).
Note:
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 19
 Set df such that 1.5 feet ≤ df ≤ 2 feet
 hf can vary depending on the site conditions, but six feet is the maximum value.
 Use 1.7 days (i.e., 40 hours) for the filter bed draw-down time (tf).
 Use k = 3.5 ft/day.
Design the underdrain system beneath the filter bed to be at least six (6) inches deep,
with at least two (2) inches of gravel over drain pipes and pipe slopes of at least one-half
percent (0.5%).
Design the underdrain system to ensure that the flow through rate of the filter bed is
controlled by the filter media rather than the underdrain system.
Calculate the minimum volume which must be stored within the device as Vmin = 0.75
(WQV).
Compute the water volume within the filter bed as Vf = Af * 0.35 * (df+du), where df is the
depth of the sand bed and du is the depth of the gravel underdrain. The constant 0.35
represents the porosity of the sand and gravel. Figure 10-6 provides an illustration of the
parameters used for calculating storage volume.
Compute the temporary storage volume above the filter bed as Vf - temp = 2 * hf * Af.
Compute the remaining volume required for the pretreatment chamber as Vs = Vmin – (Vf
+ Vf-temp). Check that Vs is approximately 50 percent of Vmin. If it is not, decrease hf and
re-compute. Note that changing hf will change the computed Af.
Calculate the height in the pretreatment chamber, hs, as hs = Vs/As.
Check that hs is greater than 2* hf and hs is greater than three (3) feet. If not, adjust hf and
repeat computation.
Design a junction box flow splitter with either a pipe or weir overflow to the storm water
system. Set the invert of the overflow to the elevation of the design water level in the
pretreatment chamber. Design the overflow to convey the peak discharge anticipated
from the 10-year storm.
Design the structural concrete components in accordance with design loads and site soil
conditions.
Specifications
Select sand to meet AASHTO M-6 or ASTM C-33 requirements for medium aggregate
concrete sand with size range of 0.02 to 0.04 inches.
Select underdrain gravel to meet AASHTO classification M-43 with size range of one-half
(0.5) to two (2) inches.
Select geotextile fabric to have a minimum puncture strength of one hundred twentyfive
(125) pounds (ASTM D-751), minimum mullen burst strength of four hundred (400)
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 20
psi (ASTM D-117), and minimum tensile strength of three hundred (300) pounds (ASTM
D-1682). Geotextile fabric shall have an opening size equivalent to U.S. sieve size #80
and shall provide a minimum flow rate of one hundred twenty-five (125) gallons per
minute per square foot.
Select underdrain piping to meet AASHTO M-278 requirements for Schedule 40 PVC
pipe. Provide three-eighths (3/8)-inch perforations on six (6)-inch centers with four (4)
holes per row.
Construct the base of the sand filter structure on undisturbed soil or rock. If disturbed soil
must be used as a base, recompact it to ninety-five percent (95%) of maximum standard
dry density in six (6)-inch compacted lifts.
Do not allow runoff to enter the sand filter bed until the upstream drainage area is
completely stabilized and site construction is completed. The sedimentation pond may
serve as a temporary sediment control pond during site construction with the provision
that overflows will bypass the filtration bed.
Construct the top of the filter bed completely level.
Store materials which might be damaged during construction (such as perforated PVC
piping, geotextiles, etc.) in a safe location and handle carefully.
Construct overflow weirs, multiple orifices and flow distribution slots completely level to
ensure adequate distribution of design flows.
Construct the main collector pipe for underdrain systems at a minimum slope of one-half
percent (0.5%). Provide observation and clean-out pipes for all underdrain piping.
B.5.4 Underground Sand Filter
Underground sand filters are suitable for intensely developed urban areas where space is
at a premium. These systems are also suitable in locations that are easily accessible to
the public. Figure B-7 shows an underground sand filter. In this design, the sand filter is
placed in a three chamber underground vault accessible by manholes or grate openings.
The first chamber is a three (3)-foot deep sediment chamber used for pretreatment. It is
connected to the second chamber (the sand filter bed) by an inverted elbow or
submerged slot, which keeps the filter surface free from trash and oil. The filter bed is
eighteen (18) to twenty-four (24) inches in depth and has a protective screen of gravel
over filter fabric to act as a pre-planned failure plane that can easily be replaced when the
filter surface becomes clogged. During a storm, the WQV is temporarily stored in both
the first and second chambers. Flows in excess of the filter’s capacity are diverted
through an overflow weir.
Design Procedures
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 21
Design procedures are consistent with those described previously for a surface sand filter
with the following exceptions. See Figure B-8 for an illustration of the volume
parameters.
After computing the minimum volume which must be stored (Vmin.) and the volume in
the filter bed (Vf), compute the minimum wet pool volume in the settling basin as Vw = 3
ft * As.
Compute the temporary storage volume required within both chambers as Vtemp = Vmin –
(Vf + Vw).
Compute the total surface area of both chambers as (Af + As).
Calculate the height of temporary storage needed as htemp = Vtemp/(Af + As).
Check that htemp is greater than or equal to 2hf. If not, decrease hf and recalculate volume
requirements.
Specifications
Specifications are consistent with those provided for surface sand filters with the
following addition.
To help extend the design life of the sand filter bed for the underground sand filter, place
a wide mesh geotextile screen on the surface of the filter bed to trap the large quantities
of trash, litter, and organic detritus associated with highly urban areas. During
maintenance operations the screen is rolled up, removed, cleaned and reinstalled.
B.5.5 Perimeter Sand Filters
The perimeter sand filter consists of two (2) parallel trench-like chambers that are
typically installed along the perimeter of a parking lot. Figure B-9 shows a perimeter sand
filter. Parking lot runoff enters the first chamber that has a shallow permanent pool of
water. The first trench provides pretreatment before the runoff spills into the second
trench, which consists of an eighteen (18)-inch deep sand layer over a gravel/perforated
pipe underdrain system. During a storm event, runoff is temporarily ponded above the
normal pool and sand layer, respectively. When both chambers fill up to capacity, excess
parking lot runoff is routed to a bypass drop inlet.
Design Procedures
Design procedures are consistent with those described previously for a surface sand filter
with the following exceptions. See Figure B-10 for an illustration of the volume
parameters.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 22
After computing the minimum volume which must be stored (Vmin) and the volume in the
filter bed (Vf), calculate the minimum wet pool volume in the pretreatment basin as Vw =
As * 2 ft.
Calculate the temporary storage volume required as Vtemp = Vmin – (Vf + Vw).
Compute the total surface area of both chambers as (Af + As).
Check htemp is greater than or equal to 2hf. If not, decrease hf and recompute areas and
volumes. Note that changing hf will change the required Af.
Specifications
Specifications are consistent with those given for a surface sand filter.
B.5.6 Organic Filters
Organic filters are designed consistent with surface or underground filters except that
the sand filter bed is replaced or modified with organic media. There are two basic
options for organic filters: a peat-sand system and a compost system.
In the peat-sand system, the filter bed is a minimum of twenty-four (24) inches deep over
the underdrain system. This twenty-four (24)-inch bed consists of a six (6)-inch sand
layer overlain by an eighteen (18)-inch layer of peat-sand mix.
The compost filter system consists of a fabricated leaf compost filtration bed overlying
the underdrain system. The compost must be mature and humic so that the organic
material is no longer rapidly decaying, and it must be locally available at a reasonable
cost.
Design Procedures
Design procedures are consistent with those given previously for surface sand filters or
underground sand filters except that the coefficient of permeability, k, for the organic
filter is modified. For a peat-sand system, use k = 2.75 ft/day. For a compost system, use
k = 8 ft/day.
Specifications
For peat-sand filter beds, select a fibric peat that is shredded, uniform and clean.
For peat-sand filter beds, combine equal volumes of peat and sand and mix to obtain
uniform distribution of peat and sand. Sand specifications are given in Section B.5.3
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 23
For peat-sand filter beds, place a six (6)-inch layer of sand over the gravel underdrain.
Separate the sand layer from the gravel layer with geotextile fabric. Select sand and
geotextile consistent with specifications in Section B.5.3. Above the six (6)-inch sand
layer, place eighteen (18) inches of the 50/50 peat-sand mixture. Construct the filter bed
so that the surface of each layer is level. Provide nominal compaction of the gravel and
sand layers using a mechanical tamper. Do not compact the sand-peat layer.
For a compost filter bed, select a compost that is mature and humic, composed of leaf
medium rather than general yard waste compost.
For a compost filter bed, place a minimum of eighteen (18) inches above the geotextile
overlying the underdrain system. Do not compact the compost filter bed.
B.6 PREFABRICATED TREATMENT DEVICES
Several manufacturers produce devices that are effective in removing suspended solids
and floating oils from storm water runoff. These devices are typically well-suited to sites
that are relatively small and have a high percentage of impervious cover. These devices
are not as effective in applications where a majority of the ground cover is pervious and a
high percentage of the suspended solids are eroded fine soil particulars. Proposed
products shall be submitted for review and approval.
B.6.1 Design Criteria
The treatment devices shall be capable of demonstrating eighty percent (80%) capture
of particles in a size range of two (2) millimeters (very coarse sand) to 0.125 millimeters
(very fine sand). The design storm shall have an intensity of 2.1 inches per hour (three (3)-
month frequency storm with a time of concentration of ten (10) minutes).
B.7 DETENTION PONDS
A detention pond is a traditional storm water quantity control device that is designed for
peak discharge control. Detention ponds are designed to completely drain after the
design storm passes. Figure B-11 illustrates a detention pond.
B.7.1 Applicability
Detention ponds are not effective as water quality treatment devices and can only be
used for water quantity control (i.e. detention).
B.7.2 Design Criteria
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 24
Design detention ponds so that discharge rates do not exceed calculated predevelopment
peak runoff rates for the 10-year six (6)-hour and 100 year six (6)-hour
storm.
Design outlet structures so that detention volume is released within twenty-four (24)
hours.
Provide an emergency spillway sized to discharge the peak runoff from the 100-year
storm assuming the principal spillway is clogged, without overtopping the crest.
Provide a minimum of one (1) foot of freeboard above the calculated high water
elevation for the 100-year storm.
Embankment heights shall not exceed twenty (20) feet (measured from the downstream
toe) and storage volumes shall not exceed twenty-five (25) acre-feet and shall not be less
than 0.3-acre feet. Regional facilities may exceed these limits, but they must comply with
the applicable requirements of the Kentucky Division of Water.
Design earthen embankments with side slopes no steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to
vertical).
Provide anti-seep collars where the spillway barrel passes through the embankment.
Stabilize earthen embankments immediately with temporary or permanent vegetation.
Design ponds to be placed outside the receiving stream except when a pond is designed
as a regional detention pond and Warren County Public Works has approved its use as a
regional pond.
Reserve adequate access from public or private right-of-way by establishing a
maintenance easement. Design the access to be at least ten (10) feet wide and not
steeper than 5:1 (h:v). Design the access way to connect to the embankment so that
equipment can access the top of the embankment on a slope not steeper than 5:1 (h:v).
Provide a minimum twenty-five (25)-foot wide buffer strip between the pond and the
nearest property line. Landscape the buffer strip with low-maintenance native grasses,
shrubs and trees. Provide a landscaping plan for the pond and the buffer. Objectives of
landscaping include improving the appearance for adjacent residents and providing
wildlife habitat.
Outlet works may be a combination of pipes, weirs, orifices and drop inlets, but design
any outlet pipes to be at least fifteen (15) inches in diameter to facilitate maintenance.
Design ponds to have a minimum bottom slope of two percent (2%) with a pilot channel
for low flow.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 25
B.7.3 Design Procedures
Compute the inflow hydrographs for both pre- and post-developed conditions for the 10-
year and 100-year storms.
Size the outlet structure for the maximum allowable peak discharge at the estimated
peak stage.
Develop a stage-storage curve for the proposed pond.
Develop a stage-discharge cure for all outlet control structures.
Perform flood routing calculations using the post-development hydrographs determined
for the design storms.
If the routed post-development peak discharge(s) from the design storm(s) exceeds the
pre-development discharge, or the peak stage varies significantly from the estimated
peak stage, revise the pond volume and/or outlet structure design. Develop a revised
stage-storage curve and a revised stage-discharge curve and rerun the flood routing.
Design the emergency spillway to handle the 100-year peak discharge from the postdevelopment
hydrograph with no conveyance through the primary outlet structure.
Evaluate the downstream effects of detention outflow to ensure that the routed
hydrograph does not cause downstream flooding problems.
Evaluate the control structure outlet velocity and provide channel and bank stabilization
if the velocities are greater than the natural stream velocities.
B.7.4 Material Specifications
Construct embankments of ML, CL, MH, or CH soils as determined in accordance with
the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS).
Determine the maximum standard dry density (ASTM D698) of at least two (2) distinct
samples of the soils to be used for embankment construction.
All conduits used for principal spillways shall be reinforced concrete pipe (RCP). The
conduits shall be sealed with rubber gaskets to form a flexible watertight seal under all
conditions of service. All pipes shall meet the requirements set forth in the Kentucky
Transportation Cabinet’s Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction,
latest edition. The design engineer shall be responsible for determining the size and
grade of pipe to be used.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 26
Anti-seep collars shall be provided on all conduits through earthen embankments,
foundations, and abutments. The number and size of anti-seep collars shall be
determined based on guidance set forth in the Kentucky Department for Environmental
Protection, Division of Water’s Engineering Memorandum No. 5, Design Criteria for
Dams and Associated Structures.
All stone shall meet the requirements set forth in the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet’s
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, latest edition.
Gradation of stone material will be performed in accordance with ASTM C-33. Tests shall
be performed on every five (5) tons of stone installed or at least once per installation
location in locations where less than five (5) tons are placed.
All geotextiles shall meet the requirements for performance and strength as set forth by
the design engineer. Any alternative material used on the project shall be approved by
the design engineer.
The following tests shall be performed and included in the manufacturer’s certifications
for each shipment of geotextile for every five hundred (500) square yards (or once per lot
if manufacturer’s records show multiple rolls came from same lot), whichever is less:
 Mass per unit area per ASTM D-5261
 Grab tensile strength per ASTM D-4632
 Trapezoidal tear strength per ASTM D-4533

 Ultraviolet light resistance per ASTM D-4355
In the case that a more recent testing standard has been released, then that standard
shall be used in lieu of the listed testing standards.
B.7.5 Construction Specifications
Verify areas to be backfilled are free of debris, snow, ice, or water and ground surfaces
are not frozen.
When necessary, compact subgrade surfaces to density requirements for the backfill
material and prepare subgrade or previous layer of compacted fill prior to placement of
additional fill by scarifying or disking.
Cut out soft areas of subgrade not readily capable of in situ compaction. Backfill with
subsoil and compact to density equal to requirements for subsequent backfill material.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 27
Backfill areas to contours and elevations. Use materials that are not frozen. The
contractors shall keep the foundation and subgrade free from water or unacceptable
materials after the fill operations have started.
Backfill systematically, as early as possible, to allow minimum time for natural
settlement. Do not backfill over porous, wet or spongy subgrade surfaces.
Place and compact soil fill materials in continuous layers not exceeding eight (8) inches
loose depth. Compact soil fill materials to ninety-five percent (95%) of maximum dry
density. Field density tests shall be performed on each lift. Areas that fail to meet the
requirements will be reworked as necessary to meet the requirements and then tested
again. The process shall be repeated until the compaction requirements are met.
Tests shall be performed on each four hundred (400) square feet of surface area and on
each lift of the surface area.
Maintain optimum moisture content of backfill material to attain required compaction
density as specified. Material deposited on the fill that is too wet shall be removed or
spread and permitted to dry, assisted by disking or blading, if necessary, until the
moisture content is reduced to the specified limits.
All crushed stone fill and crushed stone backfill under structures and pavements adjacent
to structures shall be DGA crushed stone per Kentucky Highway Department Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, unless indicated otherwise. Stone fill
and backfill materials shall be placed in layers not exceeding six (6) inches in thickness
and compacted to ninety-five percent (95%) of maximum dry density.
Backfill shall not be placed against or on structures until they have attained sufficient
strength to support all loads without distortion, cracking or damage. Deposit soil evenly
around the structure.
Slope grade away from structures minimum two (2) inches in ten (10) feet, unless noted
otherwise.
Make changes in grade gradual. Blend slopes into level areas.
Remove surplus excavation materials to designated area.
Pipe bedding shall meet the requirements set forth in the Kentucky Highway
Department Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, latest edition,
and the Bowling Green and Warren County Standard Drawings, latest edition.
The pipe trench shall be over-excavated six (6) inches and properly backfilled prior to
laying pipe. In no case shall pipe be laid on solid or blasted rock.
Pipe bedding material shall be placed in six (6) inch loose lifts and compacted to ninetyfive
percent (95%) maximum dry density at ± two percent (2%) of the optimum moisture
content.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 28
When the subgrade is found to be unstable or to include ashes, cinders, refuse, organic
material or other unsuitable material, such material shall be removed to the depth
ordered by the design engineer and replaced under the directions of the design engineer
with clean, stable backfill material. When the bottom of the trench or the subgrade is
found to consist of material that is unstable to such a degree that, in the judgement of
the design engineer, it cannot be removed, a foundation for the pipe and/or other
appurtenance shall be constructed using piling, timber, concrete or other materials as
the direction of the design engineer.
All pipe shall be laid with ends abutting and true to the lines and grades indicated on the
drawings. The pipe shall be laid straight between changes in alignment and at uniform
grade between changes in grade. Pipe shall be fitted and matched so that when laid to
grade, it will provide a smooth and uniform invert.
The pipe shall be thoroughly cleaned prior to placement. Any piece of pipe or fitting
which is knows to be defective shall not be laid. If any defective pipe or fitting shall be
discovered after the pipe is laid, it shall be removed and replaced with a satisfactory pipe
or fitting.
The interior of the pipe, as the work progresses, shall be cleaned of dirt, jointing
materials, and superfluous materials of every description. When laying of pipe is stopped
for any reason, the exposed end of such pipe shall be closed with a plug fitted into the
pipe bell so as to exclude earth or other material. Other precautions shall be taken to
prevent flotation of pipe by runoff into trench.
All pipe shall be laid starting at the lowest point and installed so that the spigot ends
point in the direction of flow.
All joint surfaces shall be cleaned immediately before jointing the pipe. The bell or
groove shall be lubricated in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation. Each
pipe unit shall then be carefully pushed into place without damage to pipe or gasket. All
pipes shall be provided with home marks to insure proper gasket seating. Details of
gasket installation and joint assembly shall follow the direction of the manufacturers of
the joint material and of the pipe. The resulting joints shall be watertight and flexible. No
solvent cement joints shall be allowed.
After the embankment has been built to final grade, scarify or till the top and side slopes
to a depth of six (6) inches to prepare a seed bed. Immediately seed and mulch with
temporary or permanent seed.
B.8 EXTENDED DETENTION PONDS
In this manual, an extended detention pond is a dry detention pond equipped with an
outlet structure that provides extended detention time (typically twenty-four (24) hours)
for a specific water quality treatment volume. Figure B-12 illustrates an extended
detention pond.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 29
B.8.1 Applicability
Extended detention ponds can be used for both water quality treatment and water
quantity management. For water quality treatment, the extended detention volume is
at least equal to WQV derived from Table B-1 less any credits for infiltration or
bioretention.
In locations with continuous dry weather flow, an extended detention pond will tend to
be continuously wet. In this instance, quantify the base flow so that the peak flow and
water quality control structures can be designed accordingly.
Design ponds to be located outside the receiving stream except when a pond is designed
as a regional detention pond.
B.8.2 Design Criteria
The minimum drainage area for extended detention ponds shall be ten (10) acres.
Design the extended detention outlet so that the “design” WQV requires at least twentyfour
(24) hours to discharge.
To calculate the design WQV, take the full WQV for the site, minus any credits allowed
for bioretention and infiltration practices.
Design extended detention ponds with two (2) stages. The lower stage would be the
extended detention pool sized for the design WQV. The upper stage would be larger in
area and sized for storm peak control.
Design the bottom slopes with a two percent (2%) minimum slope to promote drainage.
When a base flow into the pond exists, design the lower stage as a wetland marsh. In this
case, provide a permanent pool of six (6) to twelve (12) inches below the design WQV.
See the Kentucky Division of Water for a list of wetland plants.
Provide an emergency spillway sized to discharge the peak runoff from the 100-year
storm, assuming the principal spillway is clogged, without overtopping the crest.
Provide a minimum of one (1) foot of freeboard above the calculated high water
elevation for the 100-year storm.
Embankment heights shall not exceed twenty (20) feet (measured from the downstream
toe) and storage volumes shall not exceed twenty-five (25) acre-feet. The minimum
storage volume shall be 0.3 acre-feet. Reginal facilities may exceed these limits, but they
must comply with the applicable requirements of the Kentucky Division of Water.
Design earthen embankments with side slopes not steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to
vertical).
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 30
Provide anti-seep collars where the spillway barrel passes through the embankment.
Stabilize earthen embankments immediately with temporary or permanent vegetation
in accordance with requirements of Chapter 11.
Reserve adequate access from public or private right-of-way by establishing a
maintenance easement. Design the access to be at least ten (10) feet wide and not
steeper than 5:1 (h:v) or less. Design the access way to connect to the embankment so
that equipment can access the top of the embankment on a slope not greater than 5:1
(h:v).
Provide a minimum twenty-five (25)-foot buffer strip between the pond and the nearest
property line. Landscape the buffer strip with low-maintenance native grasses, shrubs,
and trees. Provide a landscaping plan for the pond and the buffer. Objectives of
landscaping include improving the appearance for adjacent residents and providing a
wildlife habitat.
B.8.3 Design Procedures
Design procedures for storm water quantity and peak discharge control are the same for
extended detention ponds and traditional dry detention ponds, except that the design
WQV will be retained longer in the extended detention pond. To design the storm
detention volume and peak control structure for an extended detention pond, follow the
procedures given in Section 10.7.3 and assume for design purposes that the elevation of
the dry land bottom corresponds to the elevation of the surface of the design WQV (i.e.
the top of the extended detention pool).
Sand Filter Outlet
Figure B-13 illustrates an outlet configuration that may be used to regulate discharge of
the extended detention pool. A perforated riser may also be used.
To size this device pick a preliminary configuration and check it using the falling head
permeability equation. Set t equal to twenty-four (24) hours and calculate k. If the
calculated k varies significantly from 3.54 ft/hr., adjust the filter dimensions and
recalculate.
The falling head equation is:
K = 2.303 * (aL/At) * log (H/h)
Where:
K = coefficient of permeability (ft/hr),
a = average surface area of extended detention pool (ft2),
L = depth of sand (ft),
A = surface area of filter = width of sand layer * length of sand layer (ft2),
t = time (hr),
H = height of water over the perforated pipe with full extended detention pool (ft), and
h = height of filter from the top of the perforated pipe to the top of the sand (ft).
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 31
Size the sand filter trenches relative to the underdrain pipe such as the sand filter
controls the discharge rate rather than the drain pipe. Provide calculations
demonstrating that the underdrain pipe will convey the design flow rate under gravity
flow conditions.
B.8.4 Specifications
Specifications are consistent with those provided in Section B.7
B.9 WET PONDS
In this manual, wet pond refers to a basin designed for both water quality and water
quantity management and which as a permanent pool Figure B-14 illustrates a wet pond.
B.9.1 Applicability
Wet ponds can be used for water quantity management and water quality treatment. For
water quality treatment, the WQV is at least equal to the WQV derived from Table B-1,
less any credits earned from bioretention and infiltration.
B.9.2 Design Criteria
Design ponds to be placed outside the receiving stream except when a pond is designed
as a regional detention pond.
Design retention ponds to have a contributing drainage area of at least ten (10) acres and
a surface area of at least one-fourth (1/4) of an acre.
When using a wet pond with a permanent pool for water quality control, size the
permanent pool to at least equal the design WQV.
To calculate the design WQV, take the full WQV for the site, minus any credits allowed
for infiltration and bioretention.
Design the permanent pool to have an average depth between three (3) feet and six (6)
feet and a maximum depth of no more than eight (8) feet.
Design wet ponds to be wedge-shaped with the narrow end at the inlet and the wide end
at the embankment.
Provide a minimum length to width ratio of 3:1 or provide gabion baffles to extend the
flow path to a length that meets or exceeds the path that would be achieved using a 3:1
length to width ratio.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 32
Provide irregular shorelines so that the permanent pool has a natural appearance.
Provide a ten (10)-foot wide, twelve (12)-inch deep, underwater bench around the
perimeter except at the embankment.
Provide safety benches at least ten (10) feet wide around the perimeter above the
permanent pool. Design these benches to have a slope not greater than 10:1 (h:v).
Design a liner for the permanent pool using on-site soils or other materials. Document
that the proposed soils are suitable for use as a liner by providing soil classification data
(Unified Soil Classification System) and standard moisture-density data (proctor density
test). Design soil liners to be at least six (6) inches thick.
Provide an emergency spillway sized to discharge the peak runoff from the 100-year
storm, assuming the principal spillway is clogged.
Provide a minimum of one (1) foot of freeboard above the calculated high water
elevation for the 100-year storm.
Embankment heights shall not exceed twenty (20) feet (measured from the downstream
toe) and storage volumes shall not exceed twenty-five (25) acre-feet. Regional facilities
may exceed these limits, but they must comply with the applicable requirements of the
Kentucky Division of Water.
Design earthen embankments with side slopes not steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to
vertical).
Provide anti-seep collars where the spillway barrel passes through the embankment.
Stabilize earthen embankments immediately with temporary or permanent vegetation.
Reserve adequate access from public or private right-of-way by establishing a
maintenance easement. Design the access to be at least ten (10) feet wide and no
steeper than 5:1 (h:v). Design the access way to connect to the embankment so that
equipment can access the top of the embankment on a slope no steeper than 5:1 (h:v).
Provide a minimum twenty-five (25)-foot wide buffer strip between the pond and the
nearest lot. Landscape the buffer strip with low-maintenance native grasses, shrubs and
trees. Provide a landscaping plan for the pond and the buffer. Objectives of landscaping
include improving the appearance for adjacent residents and providing wildlife habitat.
B.9.3 Design Procedures
Design of the storm water detention volume and peak control structure for a wet pond is
similar to procedures given for a traditional dry detention pond. The permanent pool is
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 33
sized to match the design WQV, which allows for effective water quality treatment. For
quantity control, the pond must have capacity to hold the storm water detention volume
above the permanent pool. That portion of the storm water detention volume equal to
the design WQV is called the extended detention volume. The volume must be
discharged slowly to protect the receiving stream from increased flood frequency. See
Figure B-15.
Reverse Slope Pipe
This section describes the design procedure for sizing a reverse slope pipe to discharge
that portion of the storm water detention volume equal to the design WQV. Figure B-15
illustrates a reverse slope pipe.
Select a pipe diameter, length and material and use the energy equation to calculate the
discharge. The energy equation can be written as:
Q = A (2gH)0.5 / (1 + Ke + Kb + KcL)0.5
Where:
Q = Discharge (ft3/s)
A = cross-sectional area of pipe (ft2)
g = 32.2 ft/s2
H = head above discharge end of pipe (ft2)
Ke = entrance loss coefficient
Kb = bend loss coefficient (0 for no bends)
Kc = head loss coefficient for pipe
L = pipe length (ft)
Assume that the design WQV is placed above the permanent pool and calculate the
corresponding height above the permanent pool. This is the head valve, H,
corresponding to the WQV.
Calculate the discharge (Q) at 0.25-foot intervals from the top of the design WQV
(extended detention pool) to the bottom of the extended detention pool (i.e. top of
permanent pool).
Calculate the average discharge for each 0.25-foot increment by averaging the Q
calculated at the top and bottom of each increment.
Use the stage-storage curve for the ponds to determine the storage volume in cubic feet
corresponding to each 0.25-foot increment of depth.
Divide each incremental storage volume by its corresponding average discharge to
calculate the time required for each incremental volume to be discharged through the
selected pipe.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 34
Sum the incremental discharge durations to determine if the total design WQV required
twenty-four (24) hours to discharge. If not, adjust the pipe size and recalculate.
B.9.4 Specifications
Specifications are consistent with those provided in Section B.7.
B.10 CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS
Constructed wetlands can provide a very effective management measure for mitigation
of pollution from runoff, because they have the ability to assimilate large quantities of
suspended and dissolved materials from inflow. The term “constructed wetland” can
apply to a wetland which is constructed to mitigate impacts to a natural wetland (per a
Corps of Engineers permit), or a wetland which is constructed as part of a wastewater
treatment system. In this manual, a constructed wetland is advised to be constructed in
accordance with the following criteria and procedures to treat and control storm water.
B.10.1 Applicability
Constructed wetlands can be used for both water quality and water quantity
management or for water quality only. For management of water quantity, a wetland
would be constructed much like a wet pond with a six (6) to twelve (12) inch deep
permanent pool. The most important criterion in determining whether a constructed
wetland is applicable is the existence of a base flow that can be used to supply the
permanent pool.
B.10.2 Design Criteria
For water control, size the extended detention pool above the permanent pool equal to
the design WQV.
Design the extended detention outlet so that at least twenty-four (24) hours would be
required to release the design WQV.
To calculate the design WQV, take the full WQV for the site, minus any credits allowed
for infiltration and bioretention.
For storm water quantity control, determine the necessary detention volume and design
the peak control outlet consistent with the design criteria and design procedures for
detention ponds in Section B.7. The extended detention volume is a portion of the total
detention volume rather than being an addition to it.
Size the surface area of the wetland according to procedures described in the following
section.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 35
Provide a sediment forebay. Design the forebay to be four (4) to six (6) feet deep and
have a volume of at least ten percent (10%) of the design WQV at the inlet to the
constructed wetland.
Use a reverse slope pipe as the extended detention outlet and protect it from blockage
using aggregate as shown in Figure B-15.
Provide a micropool at the extended detention outlet so that the reverse slope outlet
pipe can be placed one (1) foot below the permanent pool surface. Design the micropool
to be four (4) to six (6) feet deep with a volume of at least ten percent (10%) of the WQV.
Provide a drain with a valve at the base of the micropool.
Design the permanent pool, with the exception of the sediment forebay and the outlet
micorpool, to be three (3) to twelve (12) inches deep with an average depth of six (6) to
nine (9) inches.
Design the grades in the constructed wetland so that the wetland will drain to the
micropool at the outlet if the micropool is drained. Providing the ability to drain the
wetland will facilitate maintenance and revegetation if necessary.
Design the wetland to have low marsh and high marsh in the permanent pool. Low
marsh refers to a zone with six (6) to twelve (12) inches of permanent pool, while high
marsh refers to a zone with zero to six (6) inches of permanent pool. Design the wetland
so that low marsh and high marsh each represent thirty-five to forty-five percent (35-
45%) of the total surface area. Design so that the total deep pool (i.e. the micropool plus
the sediment forebay) represent ten to twenty percent (10-20%) of the surface area.
Design the wetland to have a length to width ratio of at least 2:1.
Reverse adequate access from public or private right-of-way by establishing a
maintenance easement. Design the access to be at least ten (10) feet wide and no
steeper than 5:1 (h:v). Design the easement to provide access to the sediment forebay
and the outlet micropool.
Check the velocity of design storm flows at the inlet to the wetland and provide a stable
entrance to prevent erosion.
Design a planting plan that shows forty to fifty percent (40-50%) of the shallow (twelve
(12) inches or less) wetland planted with wetland vegetation. A list of suitable species is
available from the Kentucky Division of Water. Plan to include a minimum of three
emergent wetland species as the majority planting with at least three (3) additional
emergent species comprising the remaining planting.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 36
B.10.3 Design Procedures
Use Table B-2 to determine the minimum surface area required based upon the size of
the watershed draining to the wetland. Values in Table B-2 are based upon expected
nitrogen and phosphorus loading rates in urban areas and the maximum loading per acre
that a constructed wetland can effectively treat.
Procedures for sizing the reverse slope pipe outlet at the micropool are consistent with
procedures for wet retention ponds given in Section B.9.

BOWLING GREEN / WARREN COUNTY
PAVEMENT CATALOG

Section F.1 Flexible Pavement Thickness Design Procedures
The procedures for designing flexible (asphalt) pavement are listed below:
1) For a residential street, estimate the number of houses that will be served by the street. For a
loop/cul-de-sac/other low volume street, it will equal the number of houses on that street. For a
continuing (through) street, it will equal the number of houses that will use the street when
entering/exiting the subdivision.
For developments that are designed in phases, streets shall be designed to reflect the
usage they will experience over the life of the proposed development. Therefore, if a
street will be a primary access route for construction traffic during a subdivision’s site
development, this street shall be designed to meet the industrial/commercial
standards that reflect its true usage, versus being designed to reflect its eventual
usage as a residential street. This standard is required to prevent premature
damaging of the street’s pavement. Considerations for this requirement will include
phasing of subdivisions, number of street connections, density of the development or
other factors that may contribute to the projected traffic load on the road network at
the time of development.
In residential subdivisions, there will be a maximum of three (3) street classifications. The
hierarchy will be as follows: Low volume streets will be identified. Next, the local streets that
serve them will be identified. Finally, the minor collectors that serve the low volume and local
streets will be identified. Typically, only one minor collector will exist and serves as the "spine" of
the subdivision, channeling traffic to the main entrance. Transition between different classes
of pavements shall be done at intersections or over a distance of fifty (50) feet if not at an
intersection.
2) For a street that will serve industrial or commercial property, estimate the gross floor area for
the development. For hotels and motels, estimate the number of rooms. For a bank,
determine if a drive through will be present and number of bays associated with it. For
convenience stores, determine the number of gas pumps.
3) Determine the number of Equivalent Axle Loads (ESALs) from Table F-3 for residential
streets, and from Table F-4 for commercial/industrial streets.
4) Because the subgrade’s type and condition is critical to the final life expectancy of a street
proper geotechnical analysis must be completed. In particular testing shall include a
California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and a Proctor Test. Based on CBR (determined from ASTM D
1883, current edition), determine the required Structural Number from Table F-5. If rock
roadbed, use a CBR value of 7. The minimum structural numbers are shown in Table F-1.
Alternate methods of CBR determination must be approved by the Planning Commission
staff, in consultation with the developer’s geotechnical engineer prior to use. For ASTM D
PAVEMENT CATALOG Appendix F / Page 1
1883, determine dry unit weight and optimum water content from a Standard Proctor
Density Test. The CBR sample shall be within -2% to +1 % of maximum dry density and 0%
to +2% of optimum moisture content. It is recommended that the dry density and moisture
content of remolded (laboratory compacted) CBR samples should be equivalent to the
minimum allowable field compaction criteria (ninety-seven percent (97%) of standard Proctor
maximum dry density). The moisture content should be near optimum to ease compaction of
the sample as determined by the testing engineer.
Table F-1
Street Classification SN
Low Volume Street 2.00
Local (Residential) Street 2.40
Neighborhood Collector 3.00
Minor Collector 4.00
Major Collector 4.20
Arterial 4.20
Commercial 4.20
Industrial 4.20
Low volume streets are cul-de-sac streets that serve four hundred (400) ADT (approximately
forty (40) dwelling units) or less. In residential subdivisions, the SN for each classification
of street will be standardized to provide a maximum of three (3) different pavement designs
for the subdivision. Standardization will be based on average SN and adjusted based on good
engineering judgment.
5) Determine the required thickness of asphalt, DGA, No. 2 stone, and stabilized subgrade to achieve
the required structural number. The layer coefficients are listed below:
Table F-2
Flexible Pavement Layer Coefficient
Asphalt 0.44 (0.30 for existing asphalt)
DGA / CSB 0.12 (0.10 for existing DGA)
No. 2 Stone 0.08
Geogrids (within aggregate
Layer)
Increase DGA coefficient to 0.17
Stabilized Subgrade 0.08
Layer thickness designs may be specified as one of two categories, Maximum Asphalt Design
or Maximum Aggregate Design. Maximum Asphalt Designs include a minimum DGA layer of
four (4) inches, followed by asphalt base and surface to meet the required structural number.
Maximum Aggregate Designs include a ratio of one-third (1/3) asphalt (in inches) to two-thirds
(2/3) aggregate (in inches), in thicknesses to meet the required structural number. Maximum
PAVEMENT CATALOG Appendix F / Page 2
Asphalt Designs are typically used in soil/rock fill, rock cut situations, modified subgrade, and
when a wet subgrade is not a factor. Maximum Aggregate Designs are used in soil cut
situations, curb and gutter and when wet subgrade will be a factor.
If the asphalt surface course will not be placed immediately after the asphalt base is
laid then the asphalt base and DGA courses shall be designed such that the thickness
of asphalt base and DGA will meet the design structural number.
Minimum asphalt surface thickness shall be one and one-fourth (1 ¼)-inch and for
asphalt base two (2) inches shall be the minimum design thickness used in subdivision
design.
DGA is used in the aggregate layer in curb and gutter and shoulder/ditch sections in which the
aggregate layer does not "daylight" into the ditch. Alternate materials may be considered on
a case by case basis.
If pavements are constructed immediately after compaction of fine-grained soils, then major
problems typically will not be encountered when placing and compacting layers of paving
materials. Problems arise when surface and subsurface water penetrates compacted finegrained
soils. Water from rainfall, snowmelt and groundwater enters the fine-grained soils
subgrade, causing swelling and producing a loss of bearing capacity in the subgrade. When a
soil subgrade is exposed to extended wet periods an alternate design may be used where six
(6)-inch No. 2 stone is used for the first four (4) inches of DGA, i.e. four (4) inches DGA is
structurally equivalent to six (6) inches of No. 2 stone. A filter fabric shall be placed between
the No. 2 stone and the subgrade when using the winter design. Fabric shall be placed so that
longitudinal edges lap a minimum of eighteen (18) inches.
6) Subgrade shall be constructed and compacted per Article 6 of the Subdivision Regulations.
Subgrade shall be compacted or stabilized. Soils that fail to compact, have high moisture
content or a CBR less than four (4) may be stabilized by undercutting eight (8) inches and
replacing with No. 2 stone on filter fabric using geo-fabrics, hydrated lime or Portland cement as
approved by the Planning Commission representative. If unstable areas are discovered during
the subgrade proof roll test, then the areas must be stabilized. There are various stabilization
techniques available; whichever method the contractor chooses must be approved by the
Planning Commission representative. In the event that placing rock is chosen, then the
contractor shall remove at least twelve (12”) inches (or as directed by the Planning Commission
representative) of the unstable material and replace it with No. 2 stone, separated from the
subgrade with filter fabric.
7) Pavement at medians, traffic circles, islands and other obstacles in the road shall have fifteen
(15) foot lanes, or three (3) feet more width per lane in such entry areas, and corner radius of 35' at
entrances providing multiple wheel path opportunity which would lessen the constant isolated
pavement loading associated with single lane travel ways. Also, the structural number shall be
PAVEMENT CATALOG Appendix F / Page 3
increased by adding twenty percent (20%) to the calculated structural number for that street.
Increased structural number would provide additional strength in these areas which will
receive the constant isolated pavement loading. A distance of fifty (50) feet will be used to
transition from median section to road section.
8) Pavement drainage shall be required. The goal is to provide drainage of water that infiltrates
the pavement structure. Acceptable methods include but are not limited to:
 lowering the inlet elevation of curb inlets one and one-fourth (1 1/4)-inch and sloping concrete
gutter and asphalt surface to match
 adding weep holes in the upper section of the curb inlets
 edge drain systems
 scratch course of asphalt surface at curb inlet locations to direct water to the inlet; this
method shall require milling to remove the scratch course prior to final surface course.
Pavement drainage shall be shown on the construction plans and approved prior to
construction.

Notes:
Number of Houses Served by Street - For a loop/cul-de-sac/other low volume street, it will equal the number of houses on that street.
For a continuing (through) street, it will equal the number of houses that will use the street when entering/exiting the subdivision.
Construction Trucks - Based on twenty (20) loaded supply trucks per house and 1.5 ESALs per truck, for a total of thirty (30) ESALs per
house. Construction Trucks may be reduced or deleted if the engineer provides a separate construction entrance into the subdivision
that does not utilize the permanent streets.
Moving Vans - Based on each house selling four (4) times in twenty (20) years and each transaction involving one (1) loaded moving van
for the seller and buyer, for a total of eight (8) trucks per house. It assumes 1.5 ESALs per turck for a total of 12 ESALs per house.
Garbage Trucks - Based on the following for a 20-year design life:
2 garbage trucks/street/wk x 52 wks/yr x 20 yrs x 1.5 ESALs/truck = 3120 ESALs
1 recycling truck/street/wk x 52 wks/yr x 20 yrs x 1.5 ESALs/truck = 1560 ESALs
1 yard waste recycling truck/street/wk x 52 wks/yr x 20 yrs x 1.5 ESALs/truck = 1560 ESALs
Total of above = 6240 ESALs per street for garbage trucks
School Buses - Based on the following for a 20-year design life: 2 school buses/day/street x 200days/yr x 20 yrs x 1.5
ESALs/bus = 12000 ESALs per street

APPENDIX G
BONDING POLICY, PERFORMANCE BOND TEMPLATE,
AND CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS

BONDING POLICY Appendix G Page 1
Appendix G - Bonding Policy and Performance Bond Template
The following details the bonding process for public infrastructure development. Based
upon approved construction plans, a Planning Commission representative will prepare a
detailed cost estimate to cover infrastructure improvements in the event of developer
default. This estimate will be used for bonding purposes to ensure the Planning
Commission can complete the infrastructure to standards acceptable by local
government.
The Planning Commission accepts three (3) forms of sureties for infrastructure
development.
1. Cash
2. A Letter of Credit (LOC) from an approved financial institution.
3. A Performance Bond from an approved Institution.
Administrative fees are calculated at two percent (2%) of the bond estimate for cash or
LOC bonds and two and a half percent (2.5%) for performance bonds. The bond must be
in place and fees paid to the Planning Commission prior to construction starting. LOC
sureties shall be effective for one (1) year and may be renewed/reduced with Planning
Commission approval prior to the three (3) year completion deadline specified in the
construction contract. Performance Bonds shall be effective for the duration of the
construction contract or and until written authorization to reduce or release is submitted
by the Planning Commission to the bonding agent. The Planning Commission shall be
informed in writing by the bonding agent thirty (30) days prior to any changes in status of
the bond not specifically authorized by the Planning Commission.
The bond shall stipulate that in the event of developer default (as defined by the
construction contract) the bond amount is immediately due and payable to the Planning
Commission in the form of cash. These funds will be deposited into a separate financial
account in order that the Planning Commission can ensure completion of the
infrastructure. Upon acceptance of the infrastructure by the City/County government,
any unused funds will be returned to the bonding agent.
Reductions: As work is successfully completed, the Planning Commission
representative may recommend reductions in the bond amount. Recommendations for
bond reductions are subject to approval by the Planning Commission at regularly
scheduled meetings. Reductions shall be requested by the developer and a contingency
amount shall be included in the bond estimate in the event of unanticipated failures or
work oversights. The contingency amount will typically be fifteen percent (15%) of the
original project quantities but may be increased if issues have occurred during
construction or the Planning Commission representative has concerns regarding
materials or workmanship. In no case will the bond be reduced below twenty (20%) of
the original bond estimate, until such time as the developments infrastructure has been
accepted for maintenance by the governmental entity.
Reductions/Renewals: Approximately thirty (30) days prior to the current bond
expiration, the Planning Commission will inform the developer, by mail, if a reduction
has been allowed. In no case will the bond be reduced below twenty percent (20%) of the
Appendix G Page 2
original bond estimate, until such time as the developments infrastructure has been
accepted for maintenance by the governmental entity. The new bond shall be in place on
the date directed by the Planning Commission representative and in all cases prior to the
expiration date of the current bond.
Release: The developer has three (3) years from the date the construction contract is
signed to complete construction and have the infrastructure accepted by local ordinance.
If construction is not completed after three (3) years or the infrastructure has not been
accepted by local ordinance then the bond shall be converted to cash by the Planning
Commission. Once the infrastructure is accepted by local ordinance the bond will be
released.
Bonding Options:
Option A – At the time of the preconstruction conference the developer is required to
bond the entire estimated cost for constructing the proposed infrastructure, pay
administrative fees based upon the bond estimate and sign a construction contract. The
developer will then be allowed to plat and transfer lots while the subdivision
infrastructure is being constructed. During the construction process Planning
Commission representatives will be onsite monitoring construction and as work is
successfully completed the developer may request bond reductions. The developer shall
then be allowed to substitute a smaller bond amount that reflects work remaining plus
ten percent (10%) contingency. Quality issues during construction may influence the
allowable bond reduction. The bond will not be reduced below twenty percent (20%) of
the original bond estimate until such time as the developments infrastructure has been
accepted for maintenance by local ordinance.
Option B – At the time of the preconstruction conference the developer will be required
to bond twenty percent (20%) of the estimated cost for constructing the proposed
infrastructure, sign a construction contract, pay administrative fees based upon the
original bond estimate and may then begin construction of the development
infrastructure. The developer may not record the subdivision plat or transfer lots. During
the construction process Planning Commission representatives will be onsite monitoring
construction. Once the developer is ready to transfer lots, a request may be made to the
Planning Commission representative who will estimate the cost of the remaining work
items plus a minimum ten percent (10%) for contingencies. This shall be the bond
amount that the developer will provide as surety to the Planning Commission until the
project is accepted by the appropriate governmental entity. Once the bond is posted the
developer will be allowed to plat and transfer lots. The minimum bond will be at least
twenty percent (20%) of the original bond estimate until such time as the development’s
infrastructure has been accepted for maintenance by local ordinance. Quality issues
during construction may necessitate more than a twenty percent (20%) bond.

(Maintain until acceptance)
The developer has three (3) years from the date the construction contract is signed to
complete construction and have the infrastructure accepted by local ordinance. If after
three (3) years construction has not been completed or the infrastructure has not been
accepted by local ordinance then the bond shall be converted to cash.
Following acceptance by the appropriate local governing body the bond will be released.
Conditional acceptance may be allowed at the discretion of the governing body. In cases
where conditional acceptance is permitted, a separate construction contract and new
cash bond will be required for the remaining items left for the conditional acceptance.
The amount of the cash bond will be determined by staff of the Planning Commission in
consultation with staff from the appropriate jurisdiction. The length of the conditional
construction contract will be determined on a case by case basis. Following completion
of the conditional items and acceptance by the appropriate governing body, any
remaining bond will be released.

PERFORMANCE BOND EXHIBIT A:
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Whereas, the Subdivider petitioned the City-County Planning Commission of Warren
County (“Planning Commission”), Kentucky for permission to develop within its
jurisdiction; and
Whereas, the Site Development Plan and /or the Subdivision Construction Plans, were
approved by the Planning Commission on the Date of Planning Commission Approval;
and
Whereas, the Warren County Subdivision Regulations and Zoning Ordinance
(“Regulations”) requires that the site improvement (“Site Improvements”) set out below
be completed by Subdivider in conformance with the Regulations within three years
from the Date of Planning Commission Approval and executed Construction Contract;
and
Whereas, the Regulations require that release from the Construction Contract and any
associated sureties may not be undertaken until such Site Improvements have been
completed and accepted by the local governing jurisdiction; and
No therefore, the Subdivider, as principal, and Surety, as surety, jointly and severally
guarantee to the Planning Commission full payment of the Bond Amount if the required
Site Improvements are not completed and accepted by the local governing jurisdiction
within three years of the Date of Planning Commission Approval or such extended
deadline for performance as Subdivider may obtain in comformity with the Regulations.
Subdivider and Surety bind themselves and their respective heirs, administrators,
executors, and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly to this bond.
If the Site Improvements are not completed by the Construction Contract Default Date,
the Planning Commission need only to make written demand on the Surety for Demand
for the Planning’s estimate of the cost of the remaining Site Improvements. The Demand
cannot exceed the Bond Amount. If the Planning Commission demands less than the full
Bond Amount but is able to complete the Site Improvements, it may make multiple
draws until the Site Improvements are completed or until it has drawn the full Bond
Amount. If upon completion of the Site Improvements the Planning Commission still has
unspent Surety Funds, the Planning Commission must refund the unspent funds to
Surety.
Changes in the nature or extent of Site Improvements do no impair Surety’s obligations,
but nothing increases the Bond Amount without Surety’s written consent.
If within three years of the Date of Planning Commission Approval or such extended

B.1 INTRODUCTION
Non-point source pollution is now responsible for up to eighty percent (80%) of pollution
in waters of the U.S., which include streams, lakes, rivers, and wetlands. This is true, in
part, due to significant reductions in direct discharges of pollutants by industry that have
been achieved since passage of the Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1972. In urban areas, nonpoint
source pollution occurs because storm water runoff collects impurities while
passing over rooftops, streets, parking lots, landscaping and gutters. This polluted storm
water runoff typically enters a storm drain system and is rapidly conveyed to a lake,
stream or river. The percentage of impervious land cover in urban and suburban
watersheds generally indicates the level of pollutant impact on receiving waters. In most
cases, impervious cover in excess of thirty percent (30%) results in streams that are
considered “degraded,” while impervious cover between ten and thirty percent (10%-
30%) causes “impacts” on the receiving streams. Typical residential development results
in approximately thirty-five percent (35%) of a watershed being impervious, which is
more than enough to degrade the receiving waters. Realization of this fact is important,
because healthy (non-impacted) streams are important for a healthy ecosystem, and a
healthy ecosystem is important for all living creatures including people.
In Warren County the karst cave system has been utilized, often overly so, to manage
storm water runoff. Utilization of karst for storm water management is not an exact
science. It is often difficult to predict the exact pathways of underground streams and
thus the impact of introducing increased runoff to downstream locations. We have also
come to realize that the karst system has limits and see this in the form of basins that do
not readily drain or may even surcharge when the cave system is full.
A second by-product of utilizing the karst for storm water drainage is the almost
immediate introduction of contaminates into our water systems. Fertilizers and other
chemicals that are used on lawns are carried directly into storm sewers then into basins
and often into drywells and sinkhole boxes with no treatment. Ultimately these toxins
travel into our ground water, streams lakes effecting wildlife and our source drinking
water.
To protect our natural resources, the CWA of 1972, as amended in 1987, prohibits the
discharge of pollutants to waters of the U.S. and mandates that storm water not be
discharged unless it is in compliance with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit. Bowling Green and Warren County are responsible for ensuring
that discharges of storm water from pubic storm water systems into waters of the state
comply with CWA requirements. The implementation of the requirements contained in
this manual will be a primary mechanism for accomplishing this objective.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 3
Storm water management in Bowling Green/Warren County shall include management
for quality as well as quantity (flood protection). This storm water appendix is intended
as a guide only to provide information on the structural water quality and water quantity
best management practices (BMPs).
Permanent water quality treatment measures described in this chapter should not be
confused with erosion and sediment controls required during construction.
B.2 GENERAL DESIGN CRITERIA
Storm water management in Bowling Green/Warren County shall include management
for quality and quantity. This section provides the general design criteria for both.
B.2.1 Water Quantity Control
Water quantity controls shall be implemented so that post-development peak discharges
do not exceed pre-development discharges for those storms listed in Table B.1.
B.2.2 Water Quality Controls
Research has indicated that capturing and treating eighty percent (80%) of the total
annual runoff volume provides effective water quality treatment volume based on
removal of particulates. Effective removal of solid particles in the runoff also provides for
removal of significant amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and oil and grease. Ninety
percent (90%) of the annual runoff seems to be a large volume, but the storm events that
cumulatively produce this runoff volume in Warren County produce less than 1.0 inches
of runoff each. Using historical rainfall records, typical soil parameters, and the SWMM
model, the runoff depth necessary for eighty percent (80%) runoff capture was
approximated as a function of percent impervious area. These values, which are shown in
Table B-1, represent the water quality depth that shall be treated for each development.
For example, a twenty (20)-acre development that is forty percent (40%) impervious has
a water quality depth of 0.7 inches over the whole area (not just the impervious area),
resulting in a water quality volume (WQV) of 50,820 cubic feet.
In addition to carrying pollutants, storm water runoff from developed areas increases the
frequency and duration of bankfull flows in the receiving streams, causing increased
erosion of the stream banks and further degradation of in-stream water quality. On-site
infiltration designed for the increased runoff due to development is the preferred
solution to this impact.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 4

Notes:
1) The Water Quality Volume (WQV) is the volume resulting from applying the
prescribed Water Quality Depth to the drainage area to be developed.
2) For % impervious values between those given use linear interpolation.
3) Water quality controls are not required for sites that are less than ten percent
(10%) impervious.
B.3 BIORETENTION SYSTEMS
Bioretention is a practice to treat storm water runoff using a conditioned planting soil
bed and planting materials to filter runoff stored within a shallow depression. The
method combines physical filtering and absorption with biological processes. The
system consists of a structure to spread flow, a pretreatment filter strip or grass channel,
a sand bed, pea gravel overflow curtain drain, a shallow ponding area, a surface organic
layer of mulch, a planting soil bed, plant material, a gravel underdrain system, and an
overflow system. Figure B-1 shows a diagram of a bioretention system designed to
receive runoff from a paved area.
B.3.1 Applicability
Bioretention systems are very effective for water quality treatment. Bioretention
systems are particularly well suited for use in parking lot islands, roadside swales and
median strips.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 5
B.3.2 Design Criteria
Size the area of the filter bed in accordance with the design WQV corresponding to the
area draining to it. (See the next section for procedure)
Design the bioretention system to be on-line with an overflow catch basin, as shown in
Figure B-1, to handle volumes exceeding the design WQV.
Design the bioretention system to have a longitudinal slope of 0 to 1 percent (0-1%).
Provide a pretreatment system composed of a pea gravel diaphragm and a grassed filter
strip. The pea gravel diaphragm also serves as a flow spreader. Dimensions of the gravel
diaphragm and grass filter strip shown in Figure B.1 are minimums. When flow into a
bioretention system is parallel to its long dimension (i.e., from a drainage swale), omit
the gravel diaphragm shown in Figure B.1 and provide a berm across the downstream end
of the system to impede the flow. The top of the berm shall be level across the base of
the bioretention system and be twelve to eighteen (12-18) inches high in the center.
Provide a planting soil bed with a minimum width of four (4) feet and a minimum depth
of four (4) feet (including a twelve (12)-inch sand bed). The planting soil bed can be as
wide as fifteen (15) feet. The area of the system is determined by the required area of the
filter bed. The minimum length is fifteen (15) feet.
For widths greater than ten (10) feet, maintain at least a 2:1 length to width ratio.
Provide a pea gravel curtain drain, as shown in Figure B.1. The minimum width of the
curtain drain is eight (8) inches.
Provide a two to three (2-3) inch thick mulch layer above the planting soil bed.
Grade the top of the planting soil bed to provide a shallow ponding area with a maximum
depth of six (6) inches.
Provide an underdrain system of gravel and perforated pipe. Design the gravel bed to be
at least eight (8) inches deep. Connect the underdrain to the storm drainage system or
design it to daylight to a suitable non-erosive outfall.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 6
B.3.3 Design Procedures
Size the filter bed using the following equation:
Af = V*(df)/ [k*(hf + df)(tf)]
Where:
Af = surface area of the sand filter bed (ft²)
V = treatment or infiltration volume (ft³)
Df = planting bed depth (ft.)
k = coefficient of permeability for planting bed (ft. /day)
hf = average height of water above the planting bed (ft); hf = 0.5 * hmax
tf = time required for V to filter through the planting bed (days).
Note:
df = 4 feet (including sand filter) unless it is increased by designer
k = 0.5 feet/day (median value of a silt loam)
hf = 0.5 * hmax = 3 inches = 0.25 feet
tf = 3 days
Design the bioretention system to provide the minimum filter area required and to meet
the design criteria.
B.3.4 Specifications
Provide planting soil with the following characteristics:
 pH of 5.2 to 7.0
 organic content of 1.5 to 4 percent
 magnesium of 35 pounds per acre minimum
 phosphorus (as P2O5) of 75 pounds per acre minimum

D-448 size no. 6 with diameter ranging from one-eighth to one-fourth (1/8-1/4) inch.
Provide gravel for the underdrain sized to meet AASHTO M-43 with size range of one
half to two (1/2-2) inches in diameter.
Provide PVC piping for the underdrain satisfying AASHTO M-278 standard for rigid
schedule 40 pipe. Provide three-eights (3/8) inch diameter perforations on six (6)-inch
centers with four holes per row.

shrubs. Plant side slopes of bioretention system in herbaceous ground covers, vines and
shrubs. Trees may also be used in the bioretention system. Use direct seeding for
herbaceous varieties and nursery stock for vines, shrubs and trees.

tool. Seeding rates shall be a minimum of ten (10) pounds of seed mix per one thousand
(1,000) square feet of area.

B.4 INFILTRATION SYSTEMS
Infiltration practices and/or bioretention systems reduce the adverse impacts on the
receiving waters that result from increasing the impervious area. This chapter describes
several infiltration practices that can be used in many different situations. Many of the
practices cannot function as the sole water quality infiltration and treatment device, but
will provide significant “credits” toward reducing the magnitude of the runoff that must
be detained and treated.
Infiltration practices include a variety of practices such as directing downspouts to
grassed areas and using modular pavement. Infiltration practices also include swales,
terraforming, infiltration, and vegetative filters. Terraforming is a term for special
grading practices such as terracing and berming that are intended to promote
infiltration. This section presents infiltration practices and describes the minimum
requirements that must be met to obtain credits to reduce water quality treatment
volumes.
The infiltration volume credit listed for each practice can be used to satisfy an equal
amount of water quality volume.
B.4.1 Downspouts to Grass
Discharging downspouts from roofs onto grassed yards encourages infiltration and
reduces direct discharge to impervious areas such as driveways. The grass area shall be
greater than or equal to the roof area.
Infiltration Credit
When downspouts are discharged onto grass, the infiltration credit is 0.225 acre-feet per
acre of roof area.
Design Criteria
The lot must be graded so that the downspout discharge travels at least thirty (30) feet
over grass before reaching a driveway, roadway, paved ditch or any other impervious
conveyance.
B.4.2 Modular Pavement
Modular pavement consists of strong structural materials, typically concrete, having
regularly interspersed void spaces that are filled with pervious materials such as sand,
gravel, or sod. These pavements can be used as driveways or as overflow parking in areas
that are used less frequently than the main parking areas for civic, commercial and
industrial facilities. Modular pavement can be used for any portion of parking up to that
amount allowed by the Planning Commission.
Infiltration Credit
Any area that is paved using modular pavement can be treated as pervious for purposes
of calculating WQV and post-development peak runoff, as long as appropriate design
criteria and construction specifications are satisfied.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 11
Design Criteria
Large void spaces in modular pavement shall represent at least thirty percent (30%) of
the total surface area of the pavement.
Voids shall be filled with silty soil and vegetated with permanent grass. If vegetation is
inappropriate voids may be filled with sand or gravel, but the material shall be clean and
uniform (poorly graded) to ensure high permeability.
Construction Specifications
Install all modular pavements following manufacturer’s specifications.
To prevent premature clogging and/or failure, modular pavements shall not be placed
into service until the entire contributing surface drainage area has been completely
stabilized.
Clearly mark the planned area for modular pavement to prevent heavy equipment from
compacting the underlying soils.
Excavate the subgrade soil using equipment with tracks or oversized tires to minimize
compaction.
B.4.3 Swales
Swales are typically vegetated parabolic or trapezoidal channels with a large width to
depth ratio that are used for conveying storm water runoff. Swales can act both as
vegetated filters and infiltration practices because they tend to slow runoff rates and
allow for both particle settling and storm water infiltration. Swales are encouraged
wherever they can be used as an alternative to narrower, deeper channels that tend to
convey flow at higher velocities. Swales are especially effective in reducing water quality
impacts when used for roadside drainage instead of the traditional curb inlet/storm
sewer system. In this application, curb cuts are used instead of drop inlets in the gutter.
See Figure B.2.
Swales can be even more effective when constructed using berms or infiltration beds to
encourage additional ponding and infiltration. These cases are discussed in subsequent
sections.
Infiltration Credits
When swales are used, the infiltration credit is 0.25 acre-feet per acre of swale. To obtain
this credit, the area draining to the swale must be at least three (3) times the area of the
swale considering that the swale itself is part of the drainage area.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 12
To calculate the area of the swale, the width will be the average water surface width
corresponding to the flowrate associated with the 100-year storm.
Design Criteria
To be considered a swale, a channel must have a width to depth ratio of at least 6:1, have
a bed slope of not greater than four percent (4%), and be vegetated. When swales are
used for roadside drainage, curb cuts shall be provided no less frequently than on per
each one hundred (100) feet of curb.
Drop inlets in swales shall be spaced no closer than once per each three hundred (300)
feet in order to obtain the infiltration credit.
Grassed channels that do not satisfy the design criteria to be considered swales may be
given an infiltration credit only for the channel bottom, if the bed slope does not exceed
four percent (4%).
B.4.4 Bermed Swales
A bermed swale or infiltration swale is a grassed swale constructed with berms or swale
blocks across the swale to impound shallow pools of water, slowing flow and providing
additional opportunities for particle settling and storm water infiltration.
Infiltration Credit
Infiltration credit for a bermed swale is calculated in the same manner as the credit for a
swale, except that the calculated infiltration credit can be increased by fifty percent
(50%) of the water volume that can be impounded by the berms.
Design Criteria
Swale blocks or earthen berms built across the swale shall be constructed with a two (2)-
inch diameter PVC pipe through the berm to prevent long-term ponding of water.
Berms shall be no taller than eight (8) inches and spaced no closer than sixty (60) feet.
Drop inlets in swales shall be spaced no closer than once per each three hundred (300)
feet in order to obtain the infiltration credit.
Grassed channels that do not satisfy the design criteria to be considered swales may be
given an infiltration credit only for the channel bottom, if the bed slope does not exceed
four (4) percent.
B.4.5 Biofiltration Swales
A biofiltration swale is a version of a bioretention system without the pipe underdrain
system. This practice encourages infiltration from the swale bottom, through a planting
bed, to the underlying soil. See Figure B.3
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 13
Infiltration Credit
Infiltration credit for a biofiltration swale is 0.50 acre-feet per acre of swale plus one
hundred percent (100%) of the volume of the ponded water, when designed according to
the following criteria.
If biofiltration swales are designed consistent with the procedures for bioretention
systems, the infiltration credit equals the design treatment volume.
Design Criteria
Biofiltration swales shall be designed to have the following characteristics:
 trapezoidal or parabolic shape
 bottom width of 2 feet
 side slopes no steeper than 3:1
 longitudinal slope of 1 to 2 percent (up to 4 percent slope can be used with berms
constructed as required for bermed swales)
 length, width, depth, and slope necessary to provide surface storage of the design
volume with a maximum ponded depth of 18 inches.
 vegetated in accordance with requirements for vegetated channels with grass
lining
 capacity to convey the 100-year design storm with at least 6 inches of freeboard
 A soil bed 36 inches deep having the width of the swale bottom
Plan the soil bed to consist of soils that have a permeability of at least 0.5 feet per day
(USCS soils ML, SM, or SC). If native soils do not satisfy this criterion, a prepared soil bed
can be designed.
An alternative to the above criteria is to size the filter bed (i.e., planting soil bed) for a
biofiltration swale consistent with a bioretention system. Then the infiltration credit
would be calculated in the same manner as the credit for bioretention.
B.4.6 Terraforming
Terraforming is a term for special grading practices such as terracing and berming that
are intended to promote infiltration. Bermed swales are a special case of terraforming.
Terraforming can range from a small depression in permeable soil to an extensive series
of bermed terraces. A simple example is given in Figure B.4.
Infiltration Credit
The infiltration credit for terraforming is 0.25 acre-feet per acre of area terraformed plus
one hundred percent (100%) of the impounded water.
B.4.7 Infiltration Basins
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 14
Infiltration basins may be used in locations that have at least five (5) feet of soil, with a
permeability of at least 0.5 inches per hour underlying the device. The underlying five (5)
feet of soil must also be above the seasonal high water table.
If soils do not meet the permeability requirement, they can be modified by mixing sand
and gravel in the top five (5) feet of the soil underlying the device. If native soils are to be
modified with sand or gravel, provide a design that shows the depth of soil to be
modified and the total quantity of gravel or soil to be added. Include soil test data
documenting the permeability of the soils before and after modification.
If desired, large infiltration basins can be designed much like an extended detention pond
for storm peak control. The outlet structure and detention storage volumes are designed
to be above the level needed to store the design WQV. The difference is that an
infiltration basin does not have an extended detention outlet. Instead, the WQV is
allowed to infiltrate into the soils underlying the basin. If the infiltration basin is not
intended for peak flow control, it shall be designed so that volumes exceeding the WQV
can discharge through an overflow weir or pipe. For small excavated basins of less than
one-fourth (1/4) acre, volumes exceeding the WQV may be allowed to overflow onto the
ground surface without use of an overflow structure, if proper erosion control measures
are implemented.
The infiltration credit for an infiltrated basin is simply the volume designed to be
impounded before overflow or discharge to a spillway.
Design Criteria
Test soils prior to designing an infiltration basin to ensure that the site is capable of
infiltration. Obtain a minimum of three (3) soil test borings or test pits to verify that the
soil is at least five (5) feet deep below the base elevation and has a permeability of at
least 0.5 inch per hour.
Design the floor of the basin to be as flat as possible to promote infiltration. Provide side
slopes not greater than 3:1 (h:v).
Provide a sediment forebay at the inlet to the basin with a depth of at least four (4) feet
and a volume of at least ten percent (10%) of the WQV.
Size the basin to store the design WQV before discharging through the peak flow control
outlet. If the basin is intended only for water quality treatment, design an outlet that
allows volumes in excess of the WQV to discharge to a surface water conveyance.
If a base flow will be discharged into the infiltration basin, design a low flow orifice to
allow base flow to pass through.
Adjust the storage depth so that the basin will completely drain the WQV in seventy-two
(72) hours.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 15
When using an infiltration basin for peak flow control, provide a minimum of one (1) foot
of freeboard above the 100-year design storm high water elevation.
Impoundment depths shall not exceed fifteen (15) feet and storage volumes shall not
exceed twenty-five (25) acre-feet.
Design earthen embankments with side slopes not steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to
vertical).
Design basins to be placed outside the receiving stream except when a basin is designed
as a regional detention basin and Warren County Public Works has approved its use as a
regional basin.
Reserve adequate access from public or private right-of-way by establishing a
maintenance easement. Design the access to be at least ten (10) feet wide, with a slope
not greater than 5:1 (h:v). Design the access way to connect to the embankment so that
equipment can access the top of the embankment on a slope not greater than 5:1 (h:v).
Provide a minimum twenty-five (25)-foot wide buffer strip between the basin and the
nearest lot. Landscape the buffer strip with low-maintenance native grasses, shrubs and
trees. Provide a landscaping plan for the basin and the buffer. Objectives of landscaping
include improving the appearance for adjacent residents and providing wildlife habitat.
Specifications
Embankment, outlet and emergency spillway specifications are consistent with those for
detention basins.
Excavate the basin with light equipment having tracks or over-sized tires to minimize
compaction of the underlying soils. After the basin is excavated to the final design depth,
deeply till the basin floor with a rotary tiller or disc harrow to restore infiltration rates.
After tilling, apply a leveling drag.
Establish vegetation immediately after achieving final grade and preparing the
infiltration bed. Stabilize the floor of the basin with a dense cover of water-tolerant
herbaceous species consistent with requirements of bioretention systems.
B.4.8 Vegetated Filter Strips
A vegetated filter is a practice that relies upon the use of vegetation to filter out
sediment and other pollutants from storm water runoff. These filters also provide an
opportunity for storm water runoff to infiltrate. Vegetated filters can be used as water
quality devices. Vegetated filters can be used for small subareas of a larger development
in order to reduce the total volume to be treated by other devices in the development.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 16
A filter strip is a practice that relies upon sheet flow across the entire width of the
vegetated area. The vegetation is typically grass; however, other ground cover can be
used if it provides for dense vegetation. Filter strips are typically used at the edge of a
parking lot or other paved surface.
Design Criteria
Design a filter strip to have a width matching the width of the area draining to the filter.
Design a filter strip to have a smooth transition with the area draining to it so that sheet
flow can be developed across the filter.
Design filter strips to have a minimum slope of two percent (2%) and a maximum slope
of six percent (6%).
Provide a dense turf or other comparable vegetated ground cover over the whole filter
area.
When the contributing area draining to the filter strip is impervious, do not allow the
overland flow length of the impervious surface to exceed seventy-five (75) feet.
When the contributing area draining to the filter strip is pervious, do not allow the
overland flow length of the contributing surface to exceed one hundred fifty (150) feet.
Infiltration Credit
The infiltration credit for vegetated filters is 0.075 acre-feet per acre of filter.
B.5 SAND AND ORGANIC FILTERS
In general usage, storm water filters are a diverse group of techniques for treating storm
water quality with each using some sort of filtering media such as sand, soil, gravel, peat,
compost or vegetation. Filters will include systems with a designed filter bed composed
of sand, gravel, compost or peat and an outlet to the storm water drainage system or a
receiving stream. Systems described in this section include surface sand filters,
underground sand filters, perimeter sand filters and organic filters.
B.5.1 Applicability
Filters can be used for water quality treatment, but are not appropriate for peak flow
(quantity) control.
B.5.2 General Design Criteria
Design criteria in this section apply to all filtration devices in this section.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 17
Provide a pretreatment cell to allow sedimentation prior to the filter bed and reduce
clogging.
Locate inlet and outlet structures at extreme ends of the pretreatment cell.
Design the pretreatment or sedimentation cell to have a minimum depth of three (3) feet
to minimize resuspension and turbulence.
Design the bottom of the pretreatment cell to be nearly level to facilitate sedimentation.
Design the surface area of the pretreatment cell (in square feet) to be at least 0.0081
times the WQV (in cubic feet) for areas with seventy-five percent (75%) or more
impervious surface. For areas with less than seventy-five percent (75%) impervious
surface, design the surface area of the pretreatment cell (in square feet) to be at least
0.066 times the WQV (in cubic feet). The order of magnitude difference in the two
factors derives from the fact that areas with higher percentages of impervious surface
(i.e., seventy-five percent (75%) or more) tend to have a greater proportion of coarsegrained
sediments, which have a higher settling velocity.
Size the pretreatment cell with a minimum length to width ratio of 2:1.
The length to width ratio of the pretreatment cell can be less than 2:1 if baffles are
provided to obtain a flow length equivalent to or greater than would be obtained with a
2:1 ratio.
Design each filtering device for a capture or storage volume equal to or greater than
three-fourths (3/4) times the WQV.
Design filtration systems to be off-line by using a flow-splitter or other device to divert
flows in excess of the WQV around the filtration systems.
Provide sufficient access to the device for construction and maintenance. Provide an
access ramp with a maximum slope of ten percent (10%) for vegetated ramps, fifteen
percent (15%), if the slope is stabilized with crushed stone, or twenty-five percent (25%)
if paved.
Construct exposed piping and accessories out of durable, strong materials to avoid
susceptibility to damage by vandalism.
Provide access manholes and/or grates to underground and below grade structures for
each subsurface chamber. Provide manhole diameters of at least thirty (30) inches to
meet confined space access criteria. Place manhole steps to allow maintenance
personnel easy access to structure bottoms. Provide a five (5)-foot minimum height
clearance (from the top of the sand layer to the bottom of slab) for all fixed permanent
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 18
underground structures. Provide lifting rings or other suitable elements to lift and
replace structure top slabs.
Construct the underground sand filter with a dewatering gate valve located just above
the top of the sand filter bed. Should the filter bed and/or underdrain system clog
completely, the gate valve can be opened to dewater the filter chamber for needed
maintenance.
B.5.3 Surface Sand Filter
A surface sand filter is shown in Figure B-5. This system is constructed of reinforced
concrete with a pretreatment (sedimentation) chamber and a filter bed chamber with a
sand filter and underdrain system. Figure B-5 also shows a flow diversion chamber at the
inlet end of the structure.
The filter bed has an eighteen (18)-inch to twenty four (24)-inch sand layer which traps or
strains pollutants before runoff is collected in an underdrain system (gravel and
perforated pipe) and conveyed to the receiving stream, channel or pipe. The filter bed
surface may have sand or grass cover.
Surface sand filters are open at the top, which provides easy access for maintenance, but
renders these unsuitable in areas easily accessible to the general public, especially small
children. Control access to surface sand filters by enclosing them in an eight (8)-foot
chain link fence. Such a configuration is most suitable to industrial and warehousing
facilities rather than commercial/retail establishments where aesthetic impact is
significant. Even for industrial sites, consider proximity to residential areas and other
locations frequented by children. In some locations, an eight (8)-foot fence may not
provide adequate protection.
Design Procedures
Size the pretreatment chamber in accordance with design criteria in section B.5.2
Size the area of the filter bed using the following equation:
Af = WQV*(df)/[k*(hf+df)(tf)]
Where:
Af = surface area of the sand filter bed (ft²)
WQV = water quality treatment volume (ft³)
df = sand filter bed depth (ft)
k = coefficient of permeability for sand bed (ft/day)
hf = average height of water above the sand bed (ft); hf=0.5*hmax
tf = time required for the WQV to filter through the sand bed (days).
Note:
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 19
 Set df such that 1.5 feet ≤ df ≤ 2 feet
 hf can vary depending on the site conditions, but six feet is the maximum value.
 Use 1.7 days (i.e., 40 hours) for the filter bed draw-down time (tf).
 Use k = 3.5 ft/day.
Design the underdrain system beneath the filter bed to be at least six (6) inches deep,
with at least two (2) inches of gravel over drain pipes and pipe slopes of at least one-half
percent (0.5%).
Design the underdrain system to ensure that the flow through rate of the filter bed is
controlled by the filter media rather than the underdrain system.
Calculate the minimum volume which must be stored within the device as Vmin = 0.75
(WQV).
Compute the water volume within the filter bed as Vf = Af * 0.35 * (df+du), where df is the
depth of the sand bed and du is the depth of the gravel underdrain. The constant 0.35
represents the porosity of the sand and gravel. Figure 10-6 provides an illustration of the
parameters used for calculating storage volume.
Compute the temporary storage volume above the filter bed as Vf - temp = 2 * hf * Af.
Compute the remaining volume required for the pretreatment chamber as Vs = Vmin – (Vf
+ Vf-temp). Check that Vs is approximately 50 percent of Vmin. If it is not, decrease hf and
re-compute. Note that changing hf will change the computed Af.
Calculate the height in the pretreatment chamber, hs, as hs = Vs/As.
Check that hs is greater than 2* hf and hs is greater than three (3) feet. If not, adjust hf and
repeat computation.
Design a junction box flow splitter with either a pipe or weir overflow to the storm water
system. Set the invert of the overflow to the elevation of the design water level in the
pretreatment chamber. Design the overflow to convey the peak discharge anticipated
from the 10-year storm.
Design the structural concrete components in accordance with design loads and site soil
conditions.
Specifications
Select sand to meet AASHTO M-6 or ASTM C-33 requirements for medium aggregate
concrete sand with size range of 0.02 to 0.04 inches.
Select underdrain gravel to meet AASHTO classification M-43 with size range of one-half
(0.5) to two (2) inches.
Select geotextile fabric to have a minimum puncture strength of one hundred twentyfive
(125) pounds (ASTM D-751), minimum mullen burst strength of four hundred (400)
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 20
psi (ASTM D-117), and minimum tensile strength of three hundred (300) pounds (ASTM
D-1682). Geotextile fabric shall have an opening size equivalent to U.S. sieve size #80
and shall provide a minimum flow rate of one hundred twenty-five (125) gallons per
minute per square foot.
Select underdrain piping to meet AASHTO M-278 requirements for Schedule 40 PVC
pipe. Provide three-eighths (3/8)-inch perforations on six (6)-inch centers with four (4)
holes per row.
Construct the base of the sand filter structure on undisturbed soil or rock. If disturbed soil
must be used as a base, recompact it to ninety-five percent (95%) of maximum standard
dry density in six (6)-inch compacted lifts.
Do not allow runoff to enter the sand filter bed until the upstream drainage area is
completely stabilized and site construction is completed. The sedimentation pond may
serve as a temporary sediment control pond during site construction with the provision
that overflows will bypass the filtration bed.
Construct the top of the filter bed completely level.
Store materials which might be damaged during construction (such as perforated PVC
piping, geotextiles, etc.) in a safe location and handle carefully.
Construct overflow weirs, multiple orifices and flow distribution slots completely level to
ensure adequate distribution of design flows.
Construct the main collector pipe for underdrain systems at a minimum slope of one-half
percent (0.5%). Provide observation and clean-out pipes for all underdrain piping.
B.5.4 Underground Sand Filter
Underground sand filters are suitable for intensely developed urban areas where space is
at a premium. These systems are also suitable in locations that are easily accessible to
the public. Figure B-7 shows an underground sand filter. In this design, the sand filter is
placed in a three chamber underground vault accessible by manholes or grate openings.
The first chamber is a three (3)-foot deep sediment chamber used for pretreatment. It is
connected to the second chamber (the sand filter bed) by an inverted elbow or
submerged slot, which keeps the filter surface free from trash and oil. The filter bed is
eighteen (18) to twenty-four (24) inches in depth and has a protective screen of gravel
over filter fabric to act as a pre-planned failure plane that can easily be replaced when the
filter surface becomes clogged. During a storm, the WQV is temporarily stored in both
the first and second chambers. Flows in excess of the filter’s capacity are diverted
through an overflow weir.
Design Procedures
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 21
Design procedures are consistent with those described previously for a surface sand filter
with the following exceptions. See Figure B-8 for an illustration of the volume
parameters.
After computing the minimum volume which must be stored (Vmin.) and the volume in
the filter bed (Vf), compute the minimum wet pool volume in the settling basin as Vw = 3
ft * As.
Compute the temporary storage volume required within both chambers as Vtemp = Vmin –
(Vf + Vw).
Compute the total surface area of both chambers as (Af + As).
Calculate the height of temporary storage needed as htemp = Vtemp/(Af + As).
Check that htemp is greater than or equal to 2hf. If not, decrease hf and recalculate volume
requirements.
Specifications
Specifications are consistent with those provided for surface sand filters with the
following addition.
To help extend the design life of the sand filter bed for the underground sand filter, place
a wide mesh geotextile screen on the surface of the filter bed to trap the large quantities
of trash, litter, and organic detritus associated with highly urban areas. During
maintenance operations the screen is rolled up, removed, cleaned and reinstalled.
B.5.5 Perimeter Sand Filters
The perimeter sand filter consists of two (2) parallel trench-like chambers that are
typically installed along the perimeter of a parking lot. Figure B-9 shows a perimeter sand
filter. Parking lot runoff enters the first chamber that has a shallow permanent pool of
water. The first trench provides pretreatment before the runoff spills into the second
trench, which consists of an eighteen (18)-inch deep sand layer over a gravel/perforated
pipe underdrain system. During a storm event, runoff is temporarily ponded above the
normal pool and sand layer, respectively. When both chambers fill up to capacity, excess
parking lot runoff is routed to a bypass drop inlet.
Design Procedures
Design procedures are consistent with those described previously for a surface sand filter
with the following exceptions. See Figure B-10 for an illustration of the volume
parameters.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 22
After computing the minimum volume which must be stored (Vmin) and the volume in the
filter bed (Vf), calculate the minimum wet pool volume in the pretreatment basin as Vw =
As * 2 ft.
Calculate the temporary storage volume required as Vtemp = Vmin – (Vf + Vw).
Compute the total surface area of both chambers as (Af + As).
Check htemp is greater than or equal to 2hf. If not, decrease hf and recompute areas and
volumes. Note that changing hf will change the required Af.
Specifications
Specifications are consistent with those given for a surface sand filter.
B.5.6 Organic Filters
Organic filters are designed consistent with surface or underground filters except that
the sand filter bed is replaced or modified with organic media. There are two basic
options for organic filters: a peat-sand system and a compost system.
In the peat-sand system, the filter bed is a minimum of twenty-four (24) inches deep over
the underdrain system. This twenty-four (24)-inch bed consists of a six (6)-inch sand
layer overlain by an eighteen (18)-inch layer of peat-sand mix.
The compost filter system consists of a fabricated leaf compost filtration bed overlying
the underdrain system. The compost must be mature and humic so that the organic
material is no longer rapidly decaying, and it must be locally available at a reasonable
cost.
Design Procedures
Design procedures are consistent with those given previously for surface sand filters or
underground sand filters except that the coefficient of permeability, k, for the organic
filter is modified. For a peat-sand system, use k = 2.75 ft/day. For a compost system, use
k = 8 ft/day.
Specifications
For peat-sand filter beds, select a fibric peat that is shredded, uniform and clean.
For peat-sand filter beds, combine equal volumes of peat and sand and mix to obtain
uniform distribution of peat and sand. Sand specifications are given in Section B.5.3
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 23
For peat-sand filter beds, place a six (6)-inch layer of sand over the gravel underdrain.
Separate the sand layer from the gravel layer with geotextile fabric. Select sand and
geotextile consistent with specifications in Section B.5.3. Above the six (6)-inch sand
layer, place eighteen (18) inches of the 50/50 peat-sand mixture. Construct the filter bed
so that the surface of each layer is level. Provide nominal compaction of the gravel and
sand layers using a mechanical tamper. Do not compact the sand-peat layer.
For a compost filter bed, select a compost that is mature and humic, composed of leaf
medium rather than general yard waste compost.
For a compost filter bed, place a minimum of eighteen (18) inches above the geotextile
overlying the underdrain system. Do not compact the compost filter bed.
B.6 PREFABRICATED TREATMENT DEVICES
Several manufacturers produce devices that are effective in removing suspended solids
and floating oils from storm water runoff. These devices are typically well-suited to sites
that are relatively small and have a high percentage of impervious cover. These devices
are not as effective in applications where a majority of the ground cover is pervious and a
high percentage of the suspended solids are eroded fine soil particulars. Proposed
products shall be submitted for review and approval.
B.6.1 Design Criteria
The treatment devices shall be capable of demonstrating eighty percent (80%) capture
of particles in a size range of two (2) millimeters (very coarse sand) to 0.125 millimeters
(very fine sand). The design storm shall have an intensity of 2.1 inches per hour (three (3)-
month frequency storm with a time of concentration of ten (10) minutes).
B.7 DETENTION PONDS
A detention pond is a traditional storm water quantity control device that is designed for
peak discharge control. Detention ponds are designed to completely drain after the
design storm passes. Figure B-11 illustrates a detention pond.
B.7.1 Applicability
Detention ponds are not effective as water quality treatment devices and can only be
used for water quantity control (i.e. detention).
B.7.2 Design Criteria

steeper than 5:1 (h:v). Design the access way to connect to the embankment so that
equipment can access the top of the embankment on a slope not steeper than 5:1 (h:v).
Provide a minimum twenty-five (25)-foot wide buffer strip between the pond and the
nearest property line. Landscape the buffer strip with low-maintenance native grasses,
shrubs and trees. Provide a landscaping plan for the pond and the buffer. Objectives of
landscaping include improving the appearance for adjacent residents and providing
wildlife habitat.
Outlet works may be a combination of pipes, weirs, orifices and drop inlets, but design
any outlet pipes to be at least fifteen (15) inches in diameter to facilitate maintenance.
Design ponds to have a minimum bottom slope of two percent (2%) with a pilot channel
for low flow.

peak stage.
Develop a stage-storage curve for the proposed pond.
Develop a stage-discharge cure for all outlet control structures.
Perform flood routing calculations using the post-development hydrographs determined
for the design storms.
If the routed post-development peak discharge(s) from the design storm(s) exceeds the
pre-development discharge, or the peak stage varies significantly from the estimated
peak stage, revise the pond volume and/or outlet structure design. Develop a revised
stage-storage curve and a revised stage-discharge curve and rerun the flood routing.
Design the emergency spillway to handle the 100-year peak discharge from the postdevelopment
hydrograph with no conveyance through the primary outlet structure.
Evaluate the downstream effects of detention outflow to ensure that the routed
hydrograph does not cause downstream flooding problems.

B.7.5 Construction Specifications
Verify areas to be backfilled are free of debris, snow, ice, or water and ground surfaces
are not frozen.
When necessary, compact subgrade surfaces to density requirements for the backfill
material and prepare subgrade or previous layer of compacted fill prior to placement of
additional fill by scarifying or disking.
Cut out soft areas of subgrade not readily capable of in situ compaction. Backfill with
subsoil and compact to density equal to requirements for subsequent backfill material.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 27
Backfill areas to contours and elevations. Use materials that are not frozen. The
contractors shall keep the foundation and subgrade free from water or unacceptable
materials after the fill operations have started.
Backfill systematically, as early as possible, to allow minimum time for natural
settlement. Do not backfill over porous, wet or spongy subgrade surfaces.
Place and compact soil fill materials in continuous layers not exceeding eight (8) inches
loose depth. Compact soil fill materials to ninety-five percent (95%) of maximum dry
density. Field density tests shall be performed on each lift. Areas that fail to meet the
requirements will be reworked as necessary to meet the requirements and then tested
again. The process shall be repeated until the compaction requirements are met.
Tests shall be performed on each four hundred (400) square feet of surface area and on
each lift of the surface area.
Maintain optimum moisture content of backfill material to attain required compaction
density as specified. Material deposited on the fill that is too wet shall be removed or
spread and permitted to dry, assisted by disking or blading, if necessary, until the
moisture content is reduced to the specified limits.
All crushed stone fill and crushed stone backfill under structures and pavements adjacent
to structures shall be DGA crushed stone per Kentucky Highway Department Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, unless indicated otherwise. Stone fill
and backfill materials shall be placed in layers not exceeding six (6) inches in thickness

Pipe bedding material shall be placed in six (6) inch loose lifts and compacted to ninetyfive
percent (95%) maximum dry density at ± two percent (2%) of the optimum moisture
content.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 28
When the subgrade is found to be unstable or to include ashes, cinders, refuse, organic
material or other unsuitable material, such material shall be removed to the depth
ordered by the design engineer and replaced under the directions of the design engineer
with clean, stable backfill material. When the bottom of the trench or the subgrade is
found to consist of material that is unstable to such a degree that, in the judgement of
the design engineer, it cannot be removed, a foundation for the pipe and/or other
appurtenance shall be constructed using piling, timber, concrete or other materials as
the direction of the design engineer.
All pipe shall be laid with ends abutting and true to the lines and grades indicated on the
drawings. The pipe shall be laid straight between changes in alignment and at uniform
grade between changes in grade. Pipe shall be fitted and matched so that when laid to

discovered after the pipe is laid, it shall be removed and replaced with a satisfactory pipe
or fitting.
The interior of the pipe, as the work progresses, shall be cleaned of dirt, jointing
materials, and superfluous materials of every description. When laying of pipe is stopped
for any reason, the exposed end of such pipe shall be closed with a plug fitted into the
pipe bell so as to exclude earth or other material. Other precautions shall be taken to
prevent flotation of pipe by runoff into trench.
All pipe shall be laid starting at the lowest point and installed so that the spigot ends
point in the direction of flow.
All joint surfaces shall be cleaned immediately before jointing the pipe. The bell or
groove shall be lubricated in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation. Each
pipe unit shall then be carefully pushed into place without damage to pipe or gasket. All
pipes shall be provided with home marks to insure proper gasket seating. Details of
gasket installation and joint assembly shall follow the direction of the manufacturers of
the joint material and of the pipe. The resulting joints shall be watertight and flexible. No
solvent cement joints shall be allowed.
After the embankment has been built to final grade, scarify or till the top and side slopes
to a depth of six (6) inches to prepare a seed bed. Immediately seed and mulch with
temporary or permanent seed.
B.8 EXTENDED DETENTION PONDS
In this manual, an extended detention pond is a dry detention pond equipped with an
outlet structure that provides extended detention time (typically twenty-four (24) hours)
for a specific water quality treatment volume. Figure B-12 illustrates an extended
detention pond.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 29
B.8.1 Applicability
Extended detention ponds can be used for both water quality treatment and water
quantity management. For water quality treatment, the extended detention volume is
at least equal to WQV derived from Table B-1 less any credits for infiltration or
bioretention.
In locations with continuous dry weather flow, an extended detention pond will tend to
be continuously wet. In this instance, quantify the base flow so that the peak flow and
water quality control structures can be designed accordingly.
Design ponds to be located outside the receiving stream except when a pond is designed
as a regional detention pond.
B.8.2 Design Criteria
The minimum drainage area for extended detention ponds shall be ten (10) acres.
Design the extended detention outlet so that the “design” WQV requires at least twentyfour
(24) hours to discharge.
To calculate the design WQV, take the full WQV for the site, minus any credits allowed
for bioretention and infiltration practices.
Design extended detention ponds with two (2) stages. The lower stage would be the
extended detention pool sized for the design WQV. The upper stage would be larger in
area and sized for storm peak control.
Design the bottom slopes with a two percent (2%) minimum slope to promote drainage.
When a base flow into the pond exists, design the lower stage as a wetland marsh. In this
case, provide a permanent pool of six (6) to twelve (12) inches below the design WQV.
See the Kentucky Division of Water for a list of wetland plants.
Provide an emergency spillway sized to discharge the peak runoff from the 100-year
storm, assuming the principal spillway is clogged, without overtopping the crest.
Provide a minimum of one (1) foot of freeboard above the calculated high water
elevation for the 100-year storm.
Embankment heights shall not exceed twenty (20) feet (measured from the downstream
toe) and storage volumes shall not exceed twenty-five (25) acre-feet. The minimum
storage volume shall be 0.3 acre-feet. Reginal facilities may exceed these limits, but they
must comply with the applicable requirements of the Kentucky Division of Water.
Design earthen embankments with side slopes not steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to
vertical).
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 30
Provide anti-seep collars where the spillway barrel passes through the embankment.
Stabilize earthen embankments immediately with temporary or permanent vegetation
in accordance with requirements of Chapter 11.
Reserve adequate access from public or private right-of-way by establishing a
maintenance easement. Design the access to be at least ten (10) feet wide and not
steeper than 5:1 (h:v) or less. Design the access way to connect to the embankment so
that equipment can access the top of the embankment on a slope not greater than 5:1
(h:v).
Provide a minimum twenty-five (25)-foot buffer strip between the pond and the nearest
property line. Landscape the buffer strip with low-maintenance native grasses, shrubs,
and trees. Provide a landscaping plan for the pond and the buffer. Objectives of
landscaping include improving the appearance for adjacent residents and providing a
wildlife habitat.
B.8.3 Design Procedures
Design procedures for storm water quantity and peak discharge control are the same for
extended detention ponds and traditional dry detention ponds, except that the design
WQV will be retained longer in the extended detention pond. To design the storm
detention volume and peak control structure for an extended detention pond, follow the
procedures given in Section 10.7.3 and assume for design purposes that the elevation of
the dry land bottom corresponds to the elevation of the surface of the design WQV (i.e.
the top of the extended detention pool).
Sand Filter Outlet
Figure B-13 illustrates an outlet configuration that may be used to regulate discharge of
the extended detention pool. A perforated riser may also be used.
To size this device pick a preliminary configuration and check it using the falling head
permeability equation. Set t equal to twenty-four (24) hours and calculate k. If the
calculated k varies significantly from 3.54 ft/hr., adjust the filter dimensions and
recalculate.
The falling head equation is:
K = 2.303 * (aL/At) * log (H/h)
Where:
K = coefficient of permeability (ft/hr),
a = average surface area of extended detention pool (ft2),
L = depth of sand (ft),
A = surface area of filter = width of sand layer * length of sand layer (ft2),
t = time (hr),
H = height of water over the perforated pipe with full extended detention pool (ft), and
h = height of filter from the top of the perforated pipe to the top of the sand (ft).
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 31
Size the sand filter trenches relative to the underdrain pipe such as the sand filter
controls the discharge rate rather than the drain pipe. Provide calculations
demonstrating that the underdrain pipe will convey the design flow rate under gravity
flow conditions.
B.8.4 Specifications
Specifications are consistent with those provided in Section B.7
B.9 WET PONDS
In this manual, wet pond refers to a basin designed for both water quality and water
quantity management and which as a permanent pool Figure B-14 illustrates a wet pond.
B.9.1 Applicability
Wet ponds can be used for water quantity management and water quality treatment. For
water quality treatment, the WQV is at least equal to the WQV derived from Table B-1,
less any credits earned from bioretention and infiltration.
B.9.2 Design Criteria
Design ponds to be placed outside the receiving stream except when a pond is designed
as a regional detention pond.
Design retention ponds to have a contributing drainage area of at least ten (10) acres and
a surface area of at least one-fourth (1/4) of an acre.
When using a wet pond with a permanent pool for water quality control, size the
permanent pool to at least equal the design WQV.
To calculate the design WQV, take the full WQV for the site, minus any credits allowed
for infiltration and bioretention.
Design the permanent pool to have an average depth between three (3) feet and six (6)
feet and a maximum depth of no more than eight (8) feet.
Design wet ponds to be wedge-shaped with the narrow end at the inlet and the wide end
at the embankment.
Provide a minimum length to width ratio of 3:1 or provide gabion baffles to extend the
flow path to a length that meets or exceeds the path that would be achieved using a 3:1
length to width ratio.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 32
Provide irregular shorelines so that the permanent pool has a natural appearance.
Provide a ten (10)-foot wide, twelve (12)-inch deep, underwater bench around the
perimeter except at the embankment.
Provide safety benches at least ten (10) feet wide around the perimeter above the
permanent pool. Design these benches to have a slope not greater than 10:1 (h:v).
Design a liner for the permanent pool using on-site soils or other materials. Document
that the proposed soils are suitable for use as a liner by providing soil classification data
(Unified Soil Classification System) and standard moisture-density data (proctor density
test). Design soil liners to be at least six (6) inches thick.
Provide an emergency spillway sized to discharge the peak runoff from the 100-year
storm, assuming the principal spillway is clogged.
Provide a minimum of one (1) foot of freeboard above the calculated high water
elevation for the 100-year storm.
Embankment heights shall not exceed twenty (20) feet (measured from the downstream
toe) and storage volumes shall not exceed twenty-five (25) acre-feet. Regional facilities
may exceed these limits, but they must comply with the applicable requirements of the
Kentucky Division of Water.
Design earthen embankments with side slopes not steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to
vertical).
Provide anti-seep collars where the spillway barrel passes through the embankment.
Stabilize earthen embankments immediately with temporary or permanent vegetation.
Reserve adequate access from public or private right-of-way by establishing a
maintenance easement. Design the access to be at least ten (10) feet wide and no
steeper than 5:1 (h:v). Design the access way to connect to the embankment so that
equipment can access the top of the embankment on a slope no steeper than 5:1 (h:v).
Provide a minimum twenty-five (25)-foot wide buffer strip between the pond and the
nearest lot. Landscape the buffer strip with low-maintenance native grasses, shrubs and
trees. Provide a landscaping plan for the pond and the buffer. Objectives of landscaping
include improving the appearance for adjacent residents and providing wildlife habitat.
B.9.3 Design Procedures
Design of the storm water detention volume and peak control structure for a wet pond is
similar to procedures given for a traditional dry detention pond. The permanent pool is
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 33
sized to match the design WQV, which allows for effective water quality treatment. For
quantity control, the pond must have capacity to hold the storm water detention volume
above the permanent pool. That portion of the storm water detention volume equal to
the design WQV is called the extended detention volume. The volume must be
discharged slowly to protect the receiving stream from increased flood frequency. See
Figure B-15.
Reverse Slope Pipe
This section describes the design procedure for sizing a reverse slope pipe to discharge
that portion of the storm water detention volume equal to the design WQV. Figure B-15
illustrates a reverse slope pipe.
Select a pipe diameter, length and material and use the energy equation to calculate the
discharge. The energy equation can be written as:
Q = A (2gH)0.5 / (1 + Ke + Kb + KcL)0.5
Where:
Q = Discharge (ft3/s)
A = cross-sectional area of pipe (ft2)
g = 32.2 ft/s2
H = head above discharge end of pipe (ft2)
Ke = entrance loss coefficient
Kb = bend loss coefficient (0 for no bends)
Kc = head loss coefficient for pipe
L = pipe length (ft)
Assume that the design WQV is placed above the permanent pool and calculate the
corresponding height above the permanent pool. This is the head valve, H,
corresponding to the WQV.
Calculate the discharge (Q) at 0.25-foot intervals from the top of the design WQV
(extended detention pool) to the bottom of the extended detention pool (i.e. top of
permanent pool).
Calculate the average discharge for each 0.25-foot increment by averaging the Q
calculated at the top and bottom of each increment.
Use the stage-storage curve for the ponds to determine the storage volume in cubic feet
corresponding to each 0.25-foot increment of depth.
Divide each incremental storage volume by its corresponding average discharge to
calculate the time required for each incremental volume to be discharged through the
selected pipe.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 34
Sum the incremental discharge durations to determine if the total design WQV required
twenty-four (24) hours to discharge. If not, adjust the pipe size and recalculate.
B.9.4 Specifications
Specifications are consistent with those provided in Section B.7.
B.10 CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS
Constructed wetlands can provide a very effective management measure for mitigation
of pollution from runoff, because they have the ability to assimilate large quantities of
suspended and dissolved materials from inflow. The term “constructed wetland” can
apply to a wetland which is constructed to mitigate impacts to a natural wetland (per a
Corps of Engineers permit), or a wetland which is constructed as part of a wastewater
treatment system. In this manual, a constructed wetland is advised to be constructed in
accordance with the following criteria and procedures to treat and control storm water.
B.10.1 Applicability
Constructed wetlands can be used for both water quality and water quantity
management or for water quality only. For management of water quantity, a wetland
would be constructed much like a wet pond with a six (6) to twelve (12) inch deep
permanent pool. The most important criterion in determining whether a constructed
wetland is applicable is the existence of a base flow that can be used to supply the
permanent pool.
B.10.2 Design Criteria
For water control, size the extended detention pool above the permanent pool equal to
the design WQV.
Design the extended detention outlet so that at least twenty-four (24) hours would be
required to release the design WQV.
To calculate the design WQV, take the full WQV for the site, minus any credits allowed
for infiltration and bioretention.
For storm water quantity control, determine the necessary detention volume and design
the peak control outlet consistent with the design criteria and design procedures for
detention ponds in Section B.7. The extended detention volume is a portion of the total
detention volume rather than being an addition to it.
Size the surface area of the wetland according to procedures described in the following
section.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 35
Provide a sediment forebay. Design the forebay to be four (4) to six (6) feet deep and
have a volume of at least ten percent (10%) of the design WQV at the inlet to the
constructed wetland.
Use a reverse slope pipe as the extended detention outlet and protect it from blockage
using aggregate as shown in Figure B-15.
Provide a micropool at the extended detention outlet so that the reverse slope outlet
pipe can be placed one (1) foot below the permanent pool surface. Design the micropool
to be four (4) to six (6) feet deep with a volume of at least ten percent (10%) of the WQV.
Provide a drain with a valve at the base of the micropool.
Design the permanent pool, with the exception of the sediment forebay and the outlet
micorpool, to be three (3) to twelve (12) inches deep with an average depth of six (6) to
nine (9) inches.
Design the grades in the constructed wetland so that the wetland will drain to the
micropool at the outlet if the micropool is drained. Providing the ability to drain the
wetland will facilitate maintenance and revegetation if necessary.
Design the wetland to have low marsh and high marsh in the permanent pool. Low
marsh refers to a zone with six (6) to twelve (12) inches of permanent pool, while high
marsh refers to a zone with zero to six (6) inches of permanent pool. Design the wetland
so that low marsh and high marsh each represent thirty-five to forty-five percent (35-
45%) of the total surface area. Design so that the total deep pool (i.e. the micropool plus
the sediment forebay) represent ten to twenty percent (10-20%) of the surface area.
Design the wetland to have a length to width ratio of at least 2:1.
Reverse adequate access from public or private right-of-way by establishing a
maintenance easement. Design the access to be at least ten (10) feet wide and no
steeper than 5:1 (h:v). Design the easement to provide access to the sediment forebay
and the outlet micropool.
Check the velocity of design storm flows at the inlet to the wetland and provide a stable
entrance to prevent erosion.
Design a planting plan that shows forty to fifty percent (40-50%) of the shallow (twelve
(12) inches or less) wetland planted with wetland vegetation. A list of suitable species is
available from the Kentucky Division of Water. Plan to include a minimum of three
emergent wetland species as the majority planting with at least three (3) additional
emergent species comprising the remaining planting.
WARREN COUNTY STORMWATER GUIDE Appendix B / Page 36
B.10.3 Design Procedures
Use Table B-2 to determine the minimum surface area required based upon the size of
the watershed draining to the wetland. Values in Table B-2 are based upon expected
nitrogen and phosphorus loading rates in urban areas and the maximum loading per acre
that a constructed wetland can effectively treat.
Procedures for sizing the reverse slope pipe outlet at the micropool are consistent with
procedures for wet retention ponds given in Section B.9.
