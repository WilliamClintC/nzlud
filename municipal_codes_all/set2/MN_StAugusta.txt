then the City of St. Augusta may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.
Section 12 Requirement to Prevent, Control and Reduce Storm Water Pollutants by the Use of
Best Management Practices. The owner or operator of any activity, operation, or facility which may

United States shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the
use of structural and non-structural Best Management Practices. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise that is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at
said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of
pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the
discharge of storm water associated with industrial or construction activity, to the extent practicable, shall
be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a Storm
Water Management Plan (SWMP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
Section 13 Notification of Spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation

in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the
United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup
of such release, at their own expense. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch
services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the City of St.
Augusta in person or by phone or email no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by
phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the City of St. Augusta within two
(2) business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an
on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall
be retained for at least three (3) years. Failure to provide notification of a release as provided above is a
violation of this ordinance.
Section 14 Violations, Enforcement, and Penalties.
A. Violations. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of
the requirements of this ordinance. Any person who has violated or continues to violate the
provisions of this ordinance, may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section or
may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law.
In the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, the City
of St. Augusta is authorized to enter upon the subject private property, without giving prior notice, to
take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. The City of St
Augusta is authorized to seek costs of the abatement as outlined in Section X.21.
B. Warning Notice. When the City of St. Augusta finds that any person has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this ordinance, or any order issued hereunder, the City of St. Augusta may
serve upon that person a written Warning Notice, specifying the particular violation believed to have
occurred and requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution
whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in response
to the Warning Notice in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring
before or after receipt of the Warning Notice. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of
the City of St. Augusta to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement
action, without first issuing a Warning Notice.
C. Notice of Violation. Whenever the City of St. Augusta finds that a person has violated a prohibition
or failed to meet a requirement of this Ordinance, the City of St. Augusta may order compliance by
written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation, at
their own expense: :
1. The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
2. The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
3. That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist;
4. The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or contamination hazards and the
restoration of any affected property; and
5. Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and
6. The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required, the notice shall set forth a
deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise
that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work will be done
by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the
violator.
Section 15 Costs. In addition to the other penalties provided herein, the City may recover
engineering fees, court costs, court reporter's fees, attorney fees, and other expenses of litigation or
enforcement by an appropriate action against the person or entity found to have violated this ordinance or
the orders, rules, regulations, and permits issued hereunder.
Section 16 Suspension of MS4 Access.
A. Emergency Cease and Desist Orders. When the City of St. Augusta finds that any
person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, or any
order issued hereunder, or that the persons past violations are likely to recur, and that
the persons violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened
discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to present
an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the
environment, the City of St. Augusta may issue an order to the violator directing it
immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to:
1. Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements; and
2. Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
B. Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this Subsection shall immediately
comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a dischargers failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the City of St. Augusta may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States,
and/or endangerment to persons or to the environment, including immediate termination of a facilitys
water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The City of St. Augusta may
allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City
of St. Augusta that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are
initiated against the discharger under this ordinance. A person that is responsible, in whole or in part,
for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence, to the City of St. Augusta within five (5) days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance
of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the violator.
C. Suspension due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The City of St. Augusta may, without
prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If
the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the City of St. Augusta
may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
D. Suspension due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation
of this ordinance may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an
illicit discharge. The City of St. Augusta will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4
access. The violator may petition the City of St. Augusta for a reconsideration and hearing.
E. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated
pursuant to this Section, without the prior approval of the City of St. Augusta.
Section 17 Civil Penalties. In the event the alleged violator fails to take the remedial measures set
forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described therein within ten (10)
days, or such greater period as the City of St. Augusta shall deem appropriate, after the City of St.
Augusta has taken one or more of the actions described above, the City of St. Augusta may impose a
penalty not to exceed $ 1,000.00 (depending on the severity of the violation) for each day the violation
remains un-remedied after receipt of the notice of violation.
Section 18 Criminal Penalties. Any person violating any of the provisions of this Ordinance shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not more than $
1,000.00 or by imprisonment for not to exceed ninety (90) days or both.
Section 19 Appeal of Notice of Violation. Any person receiving a Notice of Violation may appeal
the determination of the City of St. Augusta. The notice of appeal must be received within thirty (30) days
from the date of the Notice of Violation, except in the instance where a Cease and Desist Order is issued
as described in Section X.14, then the notice of appeal must be received within ten (10) days from the
date of the Cease and Desist Order. Hearing on the appeal before the appropriate authority or his/her
designee shall take place within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The
decision of the municipal authority or their designee shall be final.
Section 20 Enforcement Measures after Appeal. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to
the requirements set forth in the Notice of Violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within ten (10) days of
the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the City of St. Augusta, then
representatives of the City of St. Augusta shall enter upon the subject private property and are authorized
to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be
unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the
government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above.
Section 21 Cost of Abatement of the Violation. Within forty-five (45) days after abatement of the
violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative
costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within
thirty (30) days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the
municipal authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a
special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the
assessment. Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall become liable to the City of St.
Augusta by reason of such violation. The liability shall be paid in not more than twelve (12) equal
payments. Interest at the rate of eight (8) percent per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on

penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this
Ordinance is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and
may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or
otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.

other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the discretion of
the authorized enforcement agency to seek cumulative remedies.

CITY OF ST. AUGUSTA
COUNTY OF STEARNS
STATE OF MINNESOTA
ORDINANCE NO. 2005-12
AN ORDINANCE TO PROVIDE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE
ENFORCEMENT OF CODE REGULATIONS
The City Council of the City of St. Augusta ordains as follows:
SECTION 1. Administrative Enforcement of Code and Ordinance Regulations.
Subd. 1. Purpose and Intent. The Administrative enforcement procedures
established within this Ordinance are intended to provide the City of St. Augusta with
an informal, cost-effective and more efficient alternative to criminal prosecution or
civil litigation for certain violations of the adopted City Code and City Ordinances.
The City of St. Augusta retains the right, at its sole discretion, to enforce provisions
of its Code and Ordinances by bringing criminal charges or commencing civil
litigation in any case where the City determines it is appropriate or necessary, but
finds that an administrative process is beneficial to the residents of the City and
further finds that that such a process is a legitimate and necessary alternative method
of enforcing Code or Ordinance violations.
Subd. 2 Definitions.
A. Code Compliance Officer. Is any officer of the Stearns County Sheriffs
Department, any employee of the City of St. Augusta, or any person or company
contracted to provide code enforcement services who has received official
authority by the St. Augusta City Council to enforce the City Code and
Ordinances. There may be more than one person designated as Code Compliance
Officer at any given time.
B. Code Offense. Is a violation of any section, subdivision, paragraph or provision
of the St. Augusta City Code or any St. Augusta City Ordinance and is subject to
a civil penalty determined according to a schedule adopted by Resolution of the
St. Augusta City Council from time to time and payable directly to the City
Treasurer. Each day the violation exists constitutes a separate Code Offense.
C. Owner. Is an individual, association, syndicate, partnership, corporation, limited
liability company, trust or any other legal entity holding an equitable or legal
ownership interest in land, buildings, structures, dwelling unit(s) or other
property.
2
D. Person. Means a natural person of either sex, a firm, partnership, corporation,
limited liability company, any other association of people, and includes the
manager or agent of that person or organization.
Subd. 3 Procedure.
A. Administrative Notice. A Code Compliance Officer may issue, either in person
or by United States first class mail, an Administrative Notice to a person
suspected or known to have committed a Code Offense and/or to be the owner of
property upon which a Code Offense is being committed. The Administrative
Notice shall identify the Code Offense, the location upon which the Code Offense
occurred or is occurring, and the recommended corrective action for the Code
Offense. The Administrative Notice may also state that the alleged violator has, at
the discretion of the Code Compliance Officer, up to fifteen (15) days to correct
or abate the Code Offense. If the alleged violator and/or owner of property upon
which a Code Offense is being committed is unable to correct or abate the Code
Offense within the prescribed time, that person may request in writing an
extension of no more than 30 additional days from the Code Compliance Officer.
Any extension granted by the Code Compliance Officer shall be in writing and
shall specifically state the date of expiration. If the Code Offense is not corrected
or abated, as outlined in the Administrative Notice, within the prescribed time or
any extension thereto, the Code Compliance Officer may issue a citation, as
provided below.
B. Citation. A Code Compliance Officer is authorized to issue a citation upon the
belief that a Code Offense has occurred, whether or not an Administrative Notice
has first been issued in regard to said Code Offense. The citation shall be given to
the person responsible for the violation and/or to the owner of the property upon
which the violation has occurred, either by personal service or by United States
first class mail. Said citation shall state the nature of the Code Offense, the time
and date said Code Offense occurred, the civil penalty applicable to that Code
Offense as set forth in a schedule of civil penalties which shall be adopted by
Resolution of the City Council from time to time, and the manner for paying the
civil penalty or requesting a hearing before a Hearing Officer to contest the
citation.
C. Responding to a Citation / Payment. Once a citation is issued, the alleged
violator and/or the owner of the property upon which the violation has occurred
shall, within fifteen (15) days of the time of issuance of the citation, either pay the
civil penalty set forth in the citation or request a hearing in writing according to
the procedure set forth in this Section. The civil penalty may be paid either in
person at City Hall, or by United States first class mail, postage prepaid and
postmarked within said prescribed fifteen (15) days. Payment of the civil penalty
shall be deemed to be an admission of the Code Offense.
Subd. 4 Appeal to Hearing Officer.
3
A. Requesting a Hearing. Any person contesting a citation issued pursuant to this
Chapter may, within fifteen (15) days of the time of issuance of the citation,
request a hearing before a Hearing Officer. Any request for a hearing before a
Hearing Officer shall be made in writing on a form provided by the City for such
a request and either delivered personally to the City at City Hall or mailed to the
City by United States first class mail, postage prepaid and postmarked within said
prescribed fifteen (15) days. The hearing shall be held at City Hall within thirty
(30) days of the date the City received a timely written notice that a hearing has
been requested. Failure to attend the hearing constitutes a waiver of the violators
rights to an administrative hearing and an admission of the violation. A hearing
officer may waive this result upon good cause shown. A determination of good
cause shall be made by the Hearing Officer, but does specifically not include
forgetfulness or intentional delay.
B. Hearing Officer. The City Council shall by Resolution from time to time appoint
a list of persons authorized to act as a Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer is
authorized to conduct an informal hearing to determine if a Code Offense has
occurred. The Hearing officer may be compensated by the City for such hearings
and related findings. The Hearing Officer shall have the authority to uphold or
dismiss the citation or reduce, stay or waive the civil penalty imposed upon such
terms and conditions as the Hearing Officer shall determine. The Hearing
Officers decision shall be made in writing on a form provided by the City for
such purpose. A copy of the Hearing Officers decision shall be served by United
States first class mail upon the person requesting the hearing. The Hearing
Officers decision is final, except for appeal of the Hearing Officers decision in
limited cases to the City Council, as set forth below.
C. Conduct of Hearing. At the hearing, the parties will have the opportunity to
present testimony, documents and exhibits and question witnesses. The Hearing
Officer shall tape record the proceedings and receive testimony and exhibits.
Strict rules of evidence will not apply. The Hearing Officer must receive and give
weight to evidence, including hearsay evidence, that possesses probative value
commonly accepted by reasonable and prudent persons in the conduct of their
affairs.
Subd. 5 Appeal of Hearing Officer Decision.
A. The Hearing Officers decision shall be appealable to the City Council only for
the following matters:
1. an alleged failure to obtain a required permit, license, or other approval
from the City Council as required by the City Code;
4
2. an alleged violation of a permit, license, or other approval, or the
conditions attached to the permit, license or approval, that was issued by
the City Council; or
3. an alleged violation of regulations governing a person or entity who has
received a license issued by the City Council.
B. An appeal to the City Council of the Hearing Officers decision must be made in
writing on a form provided by the city for such an appeal and must be served on
the City Clerk by United States first class mail, postage prepaid, within ten (10)
days after the date of the Hearing Officers decision.
C. A timely appeal will be heard by the City Council after a notice of hearing is
served by the City upon the appellant in person or by certified mail at least ten
(10) days in advance of the date of the hearing. The parties to the hearing will
have an opportunity to present oral or written arguments regarding the Hearing
Officers decision.
D. The City Council shall consider the record, the Hearing Officers decision, and
any additional arguments before making a determination. The City Council is not
bound by the Hearing Officers decision, but may adopt all or part of the Hearing
Officers decision. The City Councils decision may be voted upon and given at
the hearing or may be given in writing within fifteen (15) days of the hearing.
E. The failure of the appellant to appear in front of the City Council or participate in
the appeal constitutes a waiver of the violators right of appeal and an admission
of the violation. The Council may waive the result upon good cause shown. The
determination of a showing of good cause shown shall be made solely at the
discretion of the City Council but does not include forgetfulness and intentional
delay.
Subd. 6 Failure to Pay.
A. In the event a person charged with a Code Offense fails to pay the civil penalty
and correct or abate the Code Offense for which a citation was issued within the
prescribed time, a late charge of fifteen percent (15%) shall be imposed thereon
for each seven (7) days the civil penalty remains unpaid and the Code Offense
remains uncorrected or unabated beyond the due date.
B. An unpaid civil penalty and accrued late charges will constitute a personal
obligation of the person(s)to whom the citation was issued and the City shall have
the right to collect such unpaid civil penalty and accrued late charges, together
with the Citys costs and reasonable attorneys fees, in criminal or civil
proceedings.
5
D. Pursuant to Minn. Stat. Chapter 429.101., Minn. Stat. Chapter 514.67 and other
applicable law, a lien in the amount of the civil penalty and any accrued late
charges may be assessed against the property where the Code Offense occurred
and collected in the same manner as taxes. Any such assessment shall not
preclude the City from issuing additional citations for a continuing Code Offense,
nor shall it preclude the City from making additional assessments against the
same property resulting from a continuing or new Code Offense.
E. The City may suspend or revoke a license or permit or other approval associated
with the Code Offense if the civil penalty and accrued late charges are not timely
paid.
Subd. 7 Subsequent Violations. If a second citation for a Code Offense is issued by
the City to the alleged violator and/or owner of the property upon which the violation has
occurred within twenty four (24) months of the issuance of a previous citation for the
same Code Offense, the civil penalty shall increase by 25% over the scheduled civil
penalty amount. If a third citation for a Code Offense is issued by the City to the alleged
violator and/or the owner of the property upon which the violation has occurred within
twenty four (24) months of the issuance of a previous citation for the same Code Offense,
the civil penalty shall increase by 50% over the scheduled civil penalty amount. If a
fourth citation for a Code Offense is issued by the City to the alleged violator and/or the
owner of the property upon which the violation has occurred within twenty-four (24)
months of the issuance of a previous citation for the same Code Offense, the civil penalty
shall increase by 100% over the scheduled civil penalty amount.
SECTION 2: This Ordinance shall take effect upon its passage and publication
according to law.

ORDINANCE #2008-06
ESTABLISHING A POLICY ON THE
USE OF OUTDOOR WOOD BURNERS (OWB)
THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF ST. AUGUSTA, MINNESOTA,
HEREBY ORDAINS:
Section 1: Purpose: The City of St. Augusta has the responsibility to protect the
general health, welfare, and safety of the residents of the City. It is recognized
and found that the type of fuel used by and the scale and duration of the burning
by outdoor wood burners (OWB) and the smoke and particulate emissions
emanating from them create noxious and hazardous smoke, soot, fumes, odors,
and air pollution that can be detrimental to the citizens health, and can deprive
neighboring property owners/users of the enjoyment of their property or premises
when such devices are located in an urban setting. Such devices are hereby
declared to be a public nuisance.
Section 2: Definition: OWB means any equipment, device or apparatus, or any
part thereof, which is installed or constructed for the purpose of combustion of
fuel to produce heat, hot water, and/or energy that is used as a component of a
heating system providing heat for the interior of a building or for a pool, where
the equipment, device, or apparatus is located outside of the building or pool for
which the heat, hot water, and/or energy is to be generated. Said device shall be
deemed to be outdoors, even if it is located in a building.
Section 3: Prohibition of OWB: It shall be unlawful for any person to install,
construct, operate, or use an OWB in any of the Citys residential zoning districts,
except as set forth in Section 4.
Section 4: Non-Conforming Use:
Subdivision 1: The lawful use or operation of any OWB, existing as of
the effective date of this ordinance, may be continued, subject to the
requirements of this subsection.
Subdivision 2: No non-conforming OWB shall hereafter be extended,
enlarged, or expanded.
Subdivision 3: Any OWB existing as of the effective date of this section,
which use has been discontinued for a period of twelve (12) consecutive
months, shall not be permitted to be re-established as a non-conforming
use, cannot be used or operated, and must be immediately removed by the
property owner from the subject premises. If the property owner fails to
remove the OWB at the end of said twelve (12) months, the City shall give
written notice by certified mail or personal service. Such notice shall
provide that such person shall remove OWB within fifteen (15) days of the
notice.
Subdivision 4: OWB permitted to be used or operated, pursuant to Subd.
1 of this Section, shall be required to use clean wood or wood/product
specifically permitted by the manufacturer as fuel. Clean wood is defined
as natural wood which has not been painted, varnished, or coated with a
similar material, has not been pressure-treated with preservatives, and
does not contain resins or glues as in plywood or other composite wood
products. The use of the following materials as fuel, unless they are
specifically engineered as a backup source, is strictly prohibited:
1. Rubbish or garbage including but not limited to food wastes,
food wraps, packaging, animal carcasses, paint or painted
materials, furniture, composite shingles, construction or
demolition debris, or other household or business wastes.
2. Kerosene, gasoline, or petroleum products.
3. Asphalt and products containing asphalt.
4. Wood or wood products, other than clean wood.
5. Any plastic material including but not limited to nylon, PVC,
ABS, polystyrene or urethane foam, and synthetic fabrics,
plastic film and plastic containers.
6. Rubber, including tires and synthetic rubber-like products.
7. Newspaper, corrugated cardboard, container board, and office
paper.
Section 5: Permissible Uses: An OWB furnace may be installed and used in the
City of St. Augusta only in accordance with the following provisions:
Subdivision 1: The OWB shall be installed and used only in an area
zoned for Agricultural, Commercial or Industrial with an administrative
permit.
Subdivision 2: The OWB shall not be used to burn any of the prohibited
materials listed in Section 4, subdivision 4 of this ordinance. The burning
of prohibited materials will cause the immediate suspension of the
administrative permit and the owner will be subject to fine imposed under
the Administrative Code Enforcement (Ordinance #2005-12).
Subdivision 3: The OWB shall be located at least two hundred feet
(200) from the nearest building which is not on the same property as the
OWB.
Subdivision 4: The OWB shall have a chimney that extends at least
fifteen feet (15) above the ground surface. If there are any residences
within five hundred feet (500), the chimney shall also extend at least as
high above the ground surface as the height of the roofs of all such
residences. The Building Official may approve a lesser height on a caseby-
case basis if necessary to comply with the manufacturers
recommendations and if the smoke from the lower chimney height does
not create a nuisance for neighbors.
Section 6: Enforcement: The Stearns County Sheriff, the Fire Chief, City
Administrator, Building Official, or their subordinates are authorized to enforce
the provisions of this ordinance.
Section 7: Effective Date: This ordinance shall be in full force and effective
immediately following passage and publication.

7.05 Performance Security
7.06 Certification of Taxes Paid
7.01 PURPOSE: The purpose of this section is to provide for deviations from the literal
provisions of this Ordinance in instances where their strict enforcement would cause undue
hardship because of physical circumstances unique to the individual property under
consideration, and to grant such variances only when it is demonstrated that such actions
will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of this Ordinance.
7.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS AND STANDARDS:
A. The City Council shall serve as the Board of Adjustment and Appeals.
B. Conditions governing considerations of both major and minor variance requests:
1. In considering all requests for a variance and in taking subsequent action,
the City staff, the Planning Commission and the City Council shall make a
finding of fact that the proposed action will not:
a. Impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property.
b. Unreasonably increase the congestion in the public street.

d. Unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within
the neighborhood, or in any way be contrary to the intent of this

2. A variance from the terms of this Ordinance shall not be granted unless it

a. Undue hardship will result if the variance is denied due to the
existence of special conditions and circumstances which are peculiar
to the land, structure or building involved:
1) Special conditions may include exceptional topographic or
water conditions or, in the case of an existing lot or parcel of
record, narrowness, shallowness, insufficient area or shape of
the property.
2) Undue hardship caused by the special conditions and
circumstances may not be solely economic in nature, if a
reasonable use of the property exists under the terms of this
Ordinance.
3) Special conditions and circumstances causing undue hardship
shall not be a result of lot size or building location when the lot
qualifies as a buildable parcel.
b. Literal interpretation of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive
the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this Ordinance, or deny the applicant
the ability to put the property in question to a reasonable use.
c. The special conditions and circumstances causing the undue
hardship do not result from the actions of the applicant.
d. Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any
special privilege that is denied by this Ordinance to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same district.
e. The request is not a use variance.
f. Variance requested is the minimum variance necessary to accomplish
the intended purpose of the applicant.
3. Application for a variance shall set forth reasons that the variance is justified
in order to make reasonable use of the land, structure or building.
4. Should the City Council find that the conditions outlined heretofore apply to
the proposed lot or parcel, the City Council may grant a variance from the
strict application of this Ordinance so as to relieve such difficulties or
hardships to the degree considered reasonable, provided such relief may be
7-3
granted without impairing the intent of this Ordinance. In the case of major
variance, the Planning Commission, based upon a report and
recommendation by the City staff, shall have the power to advise and
recommend such conditions related to the variance regarding the location,
character and other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as it
may deem advisable in the interest of the intent and purpose of the
Ordinance.

SECTION 9. ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
Subdivision
9.01 Purpose
9.02 General Provisions
9.03 Environmental Assessment Worksheets (EAWs)
9.04 Environmental Impact Statements (EISs)
9.01 PURPOSE: The purpose of this section is to determine whether certain projects
have or may have the potential for significant environmental effects and should undergo
special procedures of the Minnesota Environmental Review Program.
9.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS:
A. No development project shall be approved prior to review by the Zoning
Administrator to determine the necessity for completion of an Environmental
Assessment Worksheet (EAW) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).
Procedures for EAWs and EISs are set forth in the Minnesota Environmental
Quality Review Board (EQB) regulations for the Environmental Review Program
authorized by Minnesota Statute 116D.04 and 116D.04S and specified in Minnesota
Rules Parts 4410.0200 to 4410.7800.
B. Environmental reviews (EAWs and EISs) shall be conducted as early as practical in
the processing of a development project. Time delays in the normal permit process
caused by the filing and review of the EAW or EIS shall not be considered part of
the permit approval time requirements set forth within this Ordinance. Such delays
shall be considered as additional required time for each required permit. The permit
process for the proposed project may be continued from the point it was interrupted
by the EAW/EIS process. No decision on granting a permit or other approval
required to commence the project may be issued until the EAW/EIS process is
completed.
9.03 ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT WORKSHEETS (EAWs):
A. Purpose: The purpose of an EAW is to rapidly assess, in a worksheet format,
whether or not a proposed action has the potential for significant environmental
effects.
B. Mandatory EAWs: The preparation of an EAW shall be mandatory for those
9-2
projects that meet or exceed the thresholds contained in the State Environmental
Review Program regulations, Minnesota Rules 4410.4300, as may be amended.
C. Discretionary EAWs: A discretionary EAW may be required when it is determined
that, because of the nature or location of a proposed project, the project may have
the potential for significant environmental effects. The Zoning Administrator may
suggest and/or the City Council may require the preparation of a discretionary EAW
if it is determined that a development project may have some significant
environmental impact or when there is a perception of such, provided that the
project is not specifically exempted by Minnesota Rules 4410.4600, as may be
amended.
D. Procedures:
1. Preparation and Distribution:
a. If the Zoning Administrator determines that an EAW shall be
prepared, the proposer of the project shall submit an Application for
Environmental Review along with the EAW prepared in draft form.
The applicant shall agree in writing, as a part of the application, to
reimburse the City prior to the issuance of any permits for all
reasonable costs, including legal and consultants fees, incurred in
preparation and review of the EAW.
b. Pursuant to Minnesota Rules 4410.1400, within thirty (30) days of
submission of the Application for Environmental Review, the Zoning
Administrator shall review the draft EAW for completeness and
accuracy, add supplementary material if necessary and approve the
EAW for distribution.
c. If the EAW is ordered to be prepared pursuant to the petition process
of Minnesota Rules 4410.1100, the EAW must be prepared within
twenty-five (25) working days of the date of that decision, unless an
extension of time is agreed upon by the proposer of the project and
the Zoning Administrator.
d. Within five (5) days of approving the EAW for distribution, the Zoning
Administrator shall distribute copies of the EAW to the EQB for
publication of the notice of availability of the EAW in the EQB
Monitor. Copies shall be distributed at the same time to the official
EAW distribution list maintained by the EQB staff. Within five (5) days
of submission of the EAW to the EQB, the Zoning Administrator shall
provide a press release to the Citys official newspaper, containing
notice of availability of the EAW for public review.
9-3
2. Neighboring Property Owner Notification:
a. Upon completion of the EAW for distribution, the Zoning Administrator
shall provide mailed notice of the availability of the EAW and date of
the meeting at which the Planning Commission will consider the
matter to all property owners within at least five hundred (500) feet of
the boundaries of the property which is the subject of the EAW. Said
notice shall be mailed at minimum ten (10) days before the date of the
Planning Commission meeting during which the EAW will be
considered.
b. Failure of a property owner to receive notice shall not invalidate any
such proceedings as set forth within this Ordinance.
3. Review by Planning Commission: During the thirty (30) day comment period
that follows publication of the notice of availability of the EAW in the EQB
Monitor, the Planning Commission shall review the EAW. The Commission
shall make recommendations to the City Council regarding potential
environmental impacts that may warrant further investigation before the
project is commenced and the need for an EIS on the proposed project.
4. Decision by City Council: The City Council shall make its decision on the
need for an EIS for the proposed project at its first meeting more than ten
(10) days but not more than thirty (30) days after the close of the comment
period. The Board shall base its decision on the need for an EIS and the
proposed scope of an EIS on the information gathered during the EAW
process and on the comments received on the EAW. Pursuant to Minnesota
Rules 4410,1700, in deciding whether a project has the potential for
significant environmental effects, the following factors shall be considered:
a. Type, extent and reversibility of environmental effects.
b. Cumulative potential effects of related or anticipated future projects.
c. The extent to which the environmental effects are subject to mitigation
by ongoing public regulatory authority.
d. The extent to which environmental effects can be anticipated and
controlled as a result of other environmental studies undertaken by
public agencies or the project proposer, or of EISs previously
prepared on similar projects.
9-4
5. Within five (5) days of City Councils decision on the need for an EIS, notice
shall be provided to all persons on the EAW distribution list, to all persons
who commented in writing during the thirty (30) days comment period, to the
EQB staff for publication of the decision in the EQB Monitor and to any
person upon written request.
E. Mitigation Measures: Any measures for mitigating that are considered by the City
Council in making their EIS need decision may be incorporated as conditions for
approval of conditional use permits, interim use permits, variances, planned unit
development, and/or site plan requests as required by this Ordinance.
9.04 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENTS (EISs):
A. Purpose: The purpose of an EIS is to provide information for governmental units,
the proposer of the project and other persons to evaluate proposed projects which
have the potential for significant environmental effects, to consider alternatives to
the proposed projects and to explore methods for reducing adverse environmental
effects.
B. Mandatory EISs: An EIS shall be prepared for any project that meets or exceeds
the thresholds of any of the EIS categories listed in Minnesota Rules 4410.4400, as
may be amended.
C. Discretionary EISs: An EIS shall be prepared when the City Council determines
that, based on the EAW and any comments or additional information received
during the EAW comment period, the proposed project has the potential for
significant environmental effects, or when the City Council and the proposer of the
project agree that an EIS should be prepared.
D. Procedures:
1. All projects requiring an EIS must have an EAW on file with the City, which
will be used to determine the scope of the EIS. All EISs shall be prepared
according to the procedures and requirements of the State Environmental
Review Program, Rules 4410.2100-4410.3000, as may be amended. The
costs of preparation of an EIS shall be assessed to the project proposer in
accordance with Minnesota Rules Parts 4410.6000 to 4100.6500, as may be
amended.
2. Any proposal, project or use on which an EIS is required shall be considered
a conditional use as defined in Section 2.02 of this Ordinance and shall
comply with the procedure for approval of a conditional use permit.
Mitigating measures identified in the EIS shall be incorporated as conditions
9-5
of issuance of the conditional use permit.

that all non-conformities shall be eventually brought into conformity.
14.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS:
A. Conditional Uses: Any established use, building or lot legally existing prior to
October 7, 2003 and which is herein classified by this Ordinance as requiring a
conditional use permit may be continued in like fashion and activity and shall
automatically be considered as having received conditional use permit approval.
Any change to such a use or building shall however require a new conditional use
permit be processed according to this Ordinance.

be limited to factors such as the initial investment and the degree of
threat or danger being posed.
b. The acceptability of the time schedule shall be determined by the City
Council with right of appeal.
c. In no case shall a time schedule exceed two (2) years.
14.03 NON-CONFORMING USES:

continued; provided, however, that no such non-conforming use of land shall be
enlarged or increased, nor shall any such non-conforming use be expanded to
occupy a greater area of land than that occupied by such use at the time of the
adoption of this Ordinance, nor shall any such non-conforming use be moved to any
other part of the parcel of land upon which the same was conducted at the time of
the adoption of this Ordinance.
B. Continued Use: A lawful, non-conforming use shall not be enlarged, but may be
continued at the same size and in the same manner of operation as it existed on the
date it became legally non-conforming except as hereinafter specified.
C. Changes to Non-Conforming Uses:
1. When a lawful non-conforming use of any structure or land in any district has
been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed to any
non-conforming use.
2. A lawful non-conforming use of a structure or parcel of land may be changed
to lessen the non-conformity of use. Once a non-conforming structure or
parcel of land has been changed, it shall not thereafter be so altered to
increase the non-conformity.
D. Discontinuance: In the event that a non-conforming use of any building or premises
is discontinued for a period of one (1) year, the use of the same shall thereafter
conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located.
14-3

comply with the standard of the applicable zoning district, then those more
restrictive provisions will apply. In no circumstances will there be approval of
any proposal for multiple lot developments based upon lots of record, and
not conforming with the provisions of the existing zoning district.

homes and temporary real estate offices in new subdivisions without adversely affecting
the character of surrounding residential neighborhoods or creating a general nuisance. As
model homes represent a unique temporary commercial use, special consideration must
be given to the peculiar problems associated with them and special standards must be
applied to ensure reasonable compatibility with their surrounding environment.
19.02 PROCEDURE: The erection of a model home(s) and temporary real estate offices
shall require approval of an administrative use permit as may be issued by the Zoning
Administrator.

or temporary real estate office shall be provided. The overall design, drainage, and
surfacing of the temporary parking facility shall be subject to the approval of the
Zoning Administrator.
C. Access from a temporary parking facility onto a local, residential street shall be
minimized. Where this requirement is physically impractical, access shall be
directed away from residential neighborhoods to the greatest extent possible.
D. No model home or temporary real estate office shall incorporate outside lighting
which creates a nuisance due to glare or intensity, as provided for in Section 15.10
of this Ordinance.
E. All model home and temporary real estate office signage shall comply with the sign
regulations as contained in Section 31 of this Ordinance.
F. The administrative permit shall terminate three (3) years from its date of issuance or
19-2
until eight-five (85) percent of the development is completed, whichever occurs first.
G. No residential occupancy permit shall be issued for a model home until such time as
the structure has been fully converted to a residence. Such conversion shall include
but not be limited to parking lot restoration and the removal of signage and lighting.
H. The restoration of all temporary parking areas with appropriate landscaping shall be
completed by the end of the next growing season.

20.05 PARKING AREA DESIGN:
A. Calculating Space.
1. Floor Area: The term floor area for the purpose of calculating the number
of off-street parking spaces required shall be determined on the basis of the
exterior floor area dimensions of the buildings, structure or use times the
number of floors, minus ten (10) percent except as may be hereinafter
modified, and where a gross floor area calculation is specified.
2. Computation: When determining the number of off-street parking spaces,
any fraction of a number shall constitute an additional space.
3. Places of Public Assembly: In stadiums, sports arenas, churches and other
places of public assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches,
pews or other similar seating facilities, each eighteen (18) inches of such
seating facilities shall be counted as one (1) seat for the purpose of
determining parking requirements.
4. Snow Storage in Parking Stalls: Provision shall be made in the parking area
for adequate snow storage or removal in order to ensure that the required
number of spaces are available at all times during the year.
5. Use of Required Area: Required accessory off-street parking spaces in any

20-4
storage of inoperable vehicles unless approved by the Zoning Administrator.
B. Design.
1. Circulation: Traffic circulation systems shall be designed to accommodate
anticipated traffic demands. Vehicular traffic generated by a use shall be
channeled and controlled in a manner which will avoid congestion or
interference with other vehicular transportation systems and pedestrians and
which will avoid creating traffic hazards or excessive traffic. The adequacy of
any proposed traffic circulation system to accomplish these objectives shall
be determined by the City, which may require additional measures for traffic
control as it may deem necessary, including but not limited to the following:
directional signage, channelization, standby turn lanes, sidewalks,
illumination and other facilities within the site to prevent a backup of vehicles
on public streets.
2. Parking Space Size: All required off-street parking spaces shall comply with
the minimum dimension requirements of Section 20.05.B.5 of this Ordinance.
3. Pedestrian Provision: All off-street parking areas shall be designed with due
regard to pedestrian circulation. Off-street parking areas shall be designed
such that vehicle and pedestrian circulation is accommodated in a safe,
complementary, and orderly fashion.

structure attached thereto; however, unless provisions are made, no building
permit shall be issued to convert said parking structure into a dwelling unit or
living area or other activity until other adequate provisions are made to
comply with the required off-street parking provisions of this Ordinance.
8. Lot Circulation: Except in the case of single family dwellings, parking areas
shall be designed so that circulation between parking bays or aisles occurs

25.04 Requirement; General Provisions
25.05 Non-Conforming Uses
25.06 Inspection
25.07 Revocations
25.01 PURPOSE: The purpose of this Section is to provide a means through the
establishment of specific standards and procedures by which home occupations can be
conducted without jeopardizing land use harmony and compatibility, and the health, safety
and general welfare of the surrounding neighborhood. In addition, this Section is intended
to provide a mechanism enabling the distinction between permitted home occupations and
interim or customarily "more sensitive" home occupations, so that permitted home
occupations may be allowed through an administrative process rather than a legislative
hearing process.
25.02 APPLICATION: Subject to the Non-Conforming Use Section and other applicable
provisions of this Ordinance, all occupations conducted in the home shall comply with the
provisions of this Ordinance. This Section shall not be construed, however, to apply to
home occupations related to farming.

A. Permitted Home Occupations:
1. Permitted home occupations, as defined in this Ordinance, shall be
considered permitted accessory uses in the Citys agricultural and residential
zoning districts and shall comply with the provisions of Section 25.04.A and

B. Interim Home Occupations:
1. Qualification: Any home occupation which does not meet the specific
requirements for a permitted home occupation as defined in this Section
shall require an "interim home occupation permit" which shall be applied for,

25-2
Section 5 of this Ordinance.
2. Declaration of Conditions: The City Council may impose such conditions on
the granting of an "interim home occupation permit" as may be necessary to
ensure compatibility and to carry out the purpose and provisions of this
Section.
3. Effect of Permit: An "interim home occupation permit" may be issued for a
period of one (1) year after which the permit may be reissued for periods of
up to three (3) years each. Each application for permit renewal shall be
processed and subject to the approval of the Zoning Administrator, except in
cases where written complaints have been received concerning the operation
or where there has been a change in conditions or violation, a renewal shall
be processed in accordance with the procedural requirements of the initial
interim home occupation permit.
4. Transferability: Home occupation permits shall not run with the land and
shall not be transferable.
5. Renewal of Permit: An applicant shall not have a vested right to a permit
renewal by reason of having obtained a previous permit. In applying for and
accepting a permit, the permit holder agrees that the monetary investment in
the home occupation will be fully amortized over the life of the permit and
that a permit renewal will not be needed to amortize the investment. Each
application for the renewal of a permit will be reviewed without taking into
consideration that a previous permit has been granted. The previous
granting or renewal of a permit shall not constitute a precedent or basis for
the renewal of a permit.

occupation. The home occupation shall not change the residential character
of the premises nor result in incompatibility or disturbance to the surrounding
residential uses.
4. No home occupation shall require internal or external alterations or involve
construction features not customarily found in dwellings except where
required to comply with local and state fire and police recommendations.

63.01 PURPOSE: The purpose of the PUD, Planned Unit Development District is to
provide comprehensive procedures and standards intended to allow greater flexibility in the
development of neighborhoods and/or non-residential areas by incorporating design
modifications and/or a mixture of uses. The PUD process is intended to encourage:
A. Innovations in development to the end that the growing demands for all styles of
economic expansion may be met by greater variety in type, design, and placement
of structures and by the conservation and more efficient use of land in such
developments.
B. Higher standards of site and building design through the use of trained and
experienced land planners, architects, landscape architects and engineers.
C. More convenience in location and design of development and service facilities.
D. The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such as natural
topography, wetlands, woodlands, and geologic features and the prevention of soil
erosion which are over and above minimum standards and expectations.
E. A creative use of land and related physical development which allows a phased and
orderly development and use pattern.
F. An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets, thereby
lowering development costs, long term maintenance expenses, and public
investments.
G. A development pattern in harmony with the objectives of the St. Augusta
Comprehensive Plan. (PUD is not intended as a means to vary applicable planning
and zoning principles.)
H. A more desirable and creative environment than might be possible through the strict
application of zoning and subdivision regulations of the City.
63.02 USES: All permitted, permitted accessory, conditional uses, interim uses, and uses
by administrative permit contained in Sections 45 through 61 of this Ordinance which are
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan shall be treated as potentially allowable uses
within a PUD District.
63-3
63.03 REQUIREMENTS, CONDITIONS AND STANDARDS FOR APPROVING A PUD:
A. General Standards:
1. Comprehensive Plan Consistency: The proposed PUD shall be consistent
with the City Comprehensive Plan.
2. Common Open Space: Common private or public open space and facilities
at least sufficient to meet the minimum requirements established in the
Comprehensive Plan and such complementary structures and improvements
as are necessary and appropriate for the benefit and enjoyment of the
residents/occupants of the PUD may be provided within the area of the PUD
development.
3. Operating and Maintenance Requirements for PUD Common Open Space
Facilities: Whenever common private or public open space or service
facilities are provided within the PUD, the PUD shall contain provisions to
assure the continued operation and maintenance of such open space and
service facilities to a predetermined reasonable standard. Common private
or public open space and service facilities within a PUD may be placed under
the ownership of one or more of the following, as approved by the City
Council:
a. Dedicated to the public, where a community-wide use is anticipated
and the City Council agrees to accept the dedication.
b. Landlord control, where only use by tenants is anticipated.
c. Property owners association, provided all of the following conditions
are met:
1) Prior to the use, occupancy, sale or the execution of contracts
for sale of individual buildings, units, lots, parcels, tracts or
common areas, a declaration of covenants, conditions and
restrictions or an equivalent document or a document such as
specified by Minnesota Statutes 515, Article 2 and a set of
floor plans such as specified by Minnesota Statutes 515,
Article 2-110 shall be filed with St. Augusta. Said filing with the
City is to be made prior to the filings of said declaration or
document or floor plans with the recording officers of Stearns
County.
2) The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions or
equivalent document shall specify that deeds, leases or
63-4
documents of conveyance affecting buildings, units, lots,
parcels, or tracts shall subject said properties to the terms of
said declaration.
3) The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions shall
provide that an owners association or corporation shall be
formed and that all owners shall be members of said
association or corporation which shall maintain all properties
and common areas in good repair and which shall assess
individual property owners proportionate shares of joint or
common costs. This declaration shall be subject to the review
and approval of the City Attorney. The intent of this
requirement is to protect the property values of the individual
owner through establishing adequate private control.
4) The declaration shall additionally, amongst other things,
provide that in the event the association or corporation fails to
maintain properties in accordance with the applicable rules and
regulations of St. Augusta or fails to pay taxes or assessments
on properties as they become due and in the event St.
Augusta City incurs any expenses in enforcing its rules and
regulations, which said expenses are not immediately
reimbursed by the association or corporation, then the City
shall have the right to assess each property its prorata share of
said expenses. Such assessments, together with interest
thereon and costs of collection, shall be a lien on each
property against which each such assessment is made.
5) Membership must be mandatory for each owner, and any
successive buyer.
6) The open space restrictions must be permanent and not for a
limited period of years, unless specifically approved by the
City.
4. Staging of Public and Common Open Space: When a PUD provides for
common private or public open space, and is planned for a staged
development over a period of time, the total area of common or public open
space or land escrow security in any stage of development shall, at a
minimum, bear the same relationship to the total open space to be provided
in the entire PUD as the stages or units completed or under development
bear to the entire PUD.
5. Density: The maximum allowable density in a PUD Zoning District shall be
determined by standards negotiated and agreed upon between the applicant
63-5
and the City. In all cases, the negotiated standards shall be consistent with
the development policies as contained in the St. Augusta Comprehensive
Plan.
6. Principal Buildings: No More than one (1) principal building may be
constructed on each platted lot within a PUD.
7. Land Use/Housing Type: A PUD which involves only one (1) land use or
housing type may be allowed, provided that it is otherwise consistent with the
stated purposes and objectives of this section and the Comprehensive Plan.
8. Ordinance Modifications: The uniqueness of each PUD requires that
specifications and standards for streets, utilities, public facilities and the
approval of land subdivisions may be subject to modifications from the City
ordinances generally governing them. The City Council may therefore
approve streets, utilities, public facilities and land subdivisions which are not
in strict compliance with usual specifications or ordinance requirements
where it is found that such are not required in the interests of the City.
9. Utilities: In any PUD, all utility installations and connections including
telephone, electricity, gas, telecable, public sewer and water, private septic
systems and wells shall conform to the applicable provisions of the St.
Augusta Subdivision Ordinance, unless otherwise approved by the City
Council.

property to which the PUD is applied shall at a minimum be the same
as the setbacks which are common to the area and generally
consistent with this Ordinance.
b. No building shall be located less than fifteen (15) feet from the back of
the curb line along those roadways which are part of the internal
street pattern.
c. No building within the project shall be nearer to another building, than
63-6
one-half (1/2) the sum of the building heights of the two (2) buildings.
13. Height: The maximum building height to be considered within a PUD Zoning
District shall comply with the height standards specified within this Ordinance
in general.
B. Benefit: The proposed PUD shall accomplish one or more of the objectives stated
in Section 63.01 and shall not simply be for the enhanced economic gain of the
applicant. It shall be the applicants responsibility to demonstrate compliance with
this requirement.
63.04 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
A. Purpose: The purpose of this section is to establish standards for residential, nonresidential,
and mixed use residential and non-residential PUD Zoning Districts, in
addition to those standards contained elsewhere in this Ordinance for all PUD

Where no existing plats control, the blocks in residential subdivisions shall not exceed one thousand three hundred (1,300) feet nor be less than three hundred (300) feet in length, except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from this minimum. In blocks longer than nine hundred (900) feet, ten (10) foot wide pedestrian rights-of-way and/or easements through the block may be required in locations deemed necessary for the public health, convenience and necessity. Suitable surfacing shall be provided in pedestrian ways.
C. Block Width: The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two (2) tiers of lots of minimum depth as required by the Zoning Ordinance except adjoining a lake, stream, river, railroad or arterial or where one tier or lot is necessary because of topographic conditions. Blocks intended for business or industrial uses shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for their respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking, deliveries and loading. Such facilities shall be provided with safe and convenient limited access to the street system.
3.04 LOTS:
A. Area: The minimum lot area, width and depth shall not be less than that established by the City Zoning Ordinance in effect at the time of adoption of the final plat.
B. Side Lot Lines: Side lines of lots shall be at right angles to street lines, radial to curved street lines, or radial to lake or stream shores unless topographic conditions necessitate a different arrangement or the City Engineer finds such deviation acceptable.
C. Building Sites: Each lot shall provide an adequate building site at least eighteen (18) inches above the top of the adjacent curb unless approved by the City Engineer upon the basis of plans submitted showing alternative, acceptable surface drainage measures.
D. Butt Lots: Butt lots in subdivisions are to be discouraged. Where such lots must be used to fit a particular type of design, they shall be platted at least twenty (20) feet wider than the average width of interior lots in the block.
E. Frontage: Every lot shall have the minimum frontage on a City approved public street other than an alley, as required in the City Zoning Ordinance.
3-3
F. Access: Each lot shall directly access a public street. In cases where special conditions require an alternative means of access, it shall be subject to the review and approval of the City Council.

M. Regular Yard Setback Infringements: All lots should be designed in consideration of potentials for buildings and accommodating three (3) car garages, porches and decks, etc. Said buildings and structures are to be compatible in size and character with the surrounding area.
N. Lot Remnants: All remnants of lots below minimum size for the respective zoning district in which they are located must be added to abutting lots or lots immediately adjoining. For remnants, separated by a public right-of-way, the lot remnants shall be designated an outlot. Lot remnants may be allowed if a plan for future use is found acceptable by the City Council.
O. Boundaries: Reserved.
P. Frontage on Two Streets:
1. Double-frontage, or lots with frontage on two (2) parallel or non-intersecting streets shall not be permitted except:
3-4
a. Where lots back on arterial streets or highways, or
b. Where topographic or other conditions render subdividing otherwise unreasonable.
2. Such double-frontage lots shall have an additional depth of at least ten (10) feet or a reserve strip shall be created in order to allow space for screen planting along the rear lot line.
Q. Turn-Around Access: Where proposed residential lots abut a collector street, they shall be platted in such a manner as to encourage turn-around access and egress on each lot and discourage direct access onto such streets.
R. Access to Arterial Streets: In the case where a proposed plat is adjacent to a limited access highway, other major highway, or other arterial street, said streets to be defined by the City's Comprehensive Plan, there shall be no direct vehicular access from individual lots to such streets. In the platting of small tracts of land fronting on limited access highways or arterial street where there is no other alternative, a temporary entrance may be granted, subject to terms and conditions defined by the City Council and applicable County or State agencies. As neighboring land becomes subdivided and more preferable access arrangements become possible, such temporary access permits shall become void.
S. Access to Collector Streets: Direct vehicular access from individual lots to collector streets shall be prohibited where possible and subject to the determination of the City Council. In such cases where direct lot access to collector streets is allowed, special traffic safety measures including, but not limited to, provisions for on-site vehicle turn around shall be required.
T. Outlots: The creation of outlots is to be discouraged. In such cases where outlots are created or exist, their area shall not be utilized in calculating minimums for buildable lot area requirements. Said outlots are also prohibited from qualifying for building permits.

B. Streets shall be logically related to the topography, so as to produce usable lots and reasonable grades.
C. Access shall be given to all lots and portions of the tract in a subdivision and to adjacent unsubdivided parcels, unless the topography clearly indicates that such connection is not feasible. Reserved strips and land-locked areas shall not be created.
3-5
D. The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the appropriate continuation of existing streets in adjoining areas.
E. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, but may be subdivided, the arrangement of streets in a new subdivision shall make provision for the proper projection of streets into adjoining areas by carrying the new streets to the boundaries of the new subdivision at appropriate locations. A temporary turn-around facility shall be provided at the closed end, in conformance with cul-de-sac size requirements. Temporary facilities shall not require curb and gutter and the construction standards shall be established by the City Engineer. Construction of said streets shall be to the boundary of the plat.
F. Local streets shall be laid out to discourage their use by through traffic. The arrangement of arterial and collector streets shall be considered in their relation to the reasonable circulation of traffic, to topographic conditions, to runoff of storm water, to public convenience and safety, to their appropriate relationship to the proposed uses of the area to be served and in compliance with the City's Comprehensive Plan.
G. Provisions for Resubdivision of Large Lots and Parcels: When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or parcels which have the potential for further subdivision with the installation of public utilities, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical location and openings of future streets and appropriate resubdivision, with provision for adequate utility connections for such resubdivision.
H. Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs to permit future street extension into adjoining tracts with temporary cul-de-sacs, or when designed as cul-de-sac streets.
I. Private streets and reserve strips, except in the case of planned unit developments, shall be prohibited and no public improvements shall be approved for any private street. All streets shall be dedicated for public use. If any person applies to subdivide or replat any land or parcels adjoining an existing private street, the private street shall be required to be dedicated for public use and scheduled for improvement to public street standards at the time of final plat.
J. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or planned arterial or a railroad right-of-way, a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such arterial and right-of-way may be required for adequate protection of residential properties and separation of through and local traffic. Such service streets shall be located at a distance from the major arterial or railroad right-of-way suitable for appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial and industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances also shall be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
3-6
K. The street design shall not be such as to cause hardship to owners of adjoining property in platting their land and providing convenient access thereto.
3.06 CUL-DE-SAC STREETS
A. Cul-de-sac streets shall only be allowed where one or more of the following criteria have been met:
1. Area topography or other physical site conditions warrant a cul-de-sac, dead-end design.
2. A through street is not physically feasible.
3. Lots on the cul-de-sac turn-around shall exceed the zoning district minimum lot width (frontage) standard by twenty-five (25) percent.
B. Cul-de-sac streets permanently designed as such, shall not exceed six hundred (600) feet in length, including a terminal turn-around which shall be provided at the closed end, with a right-of-way radius of not less than sixty (60) feet. The length shall be measured along the centerline from the nearest intersection to the center point of the cul-de-sac.
C. Where a temporary cul-de-sac is required, the turn-around right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to a plat boundary line and a right-of-way of the same width as the street shall be carried to said property line in such a way as to permit future extension of the street into the adjoining tract. At such time as such a street is extended, the acreage covered by the turn-around outside the boundaries of the extended street shall revert in ownership to the property owner fronting on the temporary turn-around.
3.07 STREET DESIGN:
A. Widths: Street right-of-way widths shall be as determined in the Comprehensive Plan and official map, and where applicable, shall conform to County and State standards for trunk highways. In cases where no standard is provided, the following minimum standards shall apply:

2. Local streets and frontage streets - five (5) percent.
G. Centerline Curvature: The minimum horizontal curvature of streets shall be in accordance with the MnDOT Highway Design Manual for the type of street and design speed. The minimum curvature shall be three hundred (300) feet radius.
H. Access to Limited Access Highways: In the case where a proposed plat is adjacent to a limited access highway, there shall be no direct vehicular or pedestrian access from individual lots to such highways. As a general requirement, access to such limited access highways shall be at intervals of not less than one-half (1/2) mile and through existing and established crossroads where possible. Any such proposed access shall be subject to State, County, or City approval as may be applicable.
I. Platting of Small Tracts: In the platting of small tracts of land fronting on a limited access highway where there is no convenient access to existing entrances and where access from such plat would be closer than one-half (1/2) mile from an existing access point, a temporary entrance permit may be granted. Provision shall be made in such plats for the connection of streets to neighboring land. As the neighboring land is platted and developed, and access becomes possible at a preferred location, such temporary entrance permits shall become void at the discretion of the City.
J. Half Streets: Half streets shall be prohibited except where it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided, in which case the dedication of a half street may be permitted. The probable length of time elapsing before dedication of the remainder shall be considered in this decision. No permanent street improvement shall be permitted within a half street right-of-way. All lots having frontage or access solely from a half street are prohibited from being eligible for building permits.

Curb and Gutter: All urban streets, and all streets in commercial and industrial areas, shall have curb and gutter in compliance with established City standard design detail plates, unless exempted by the City Council upon recommendation of the City Engineer that curb and gutter is not necessary to control drainage.
S. Street Designation: Streets shall be designated pursuant to established City standards in compliance with these standards and as approved by the City Council. The following policies may be generally applied when designating awkward street and avenue configurations.
1. Cul-de-sacs less than three hundred feet (300') shall assume the designation of the street or avenue they abut.
2. Street names shall not be used unless approved by the City Council.
3. Loops shall be designated avenues, streets or a combination of both, depending on the depth of the configuration. Generally, the longer the length or depth, the greater the applicability for a separate street and avenue designation. For short loops, the word "circle" shall be used to indicate the configuration.
4. Names of new streets shall not duplicate existing or platted street names, unless a new street is a continuation of or in alignment with the existing or platted street. In that event, it shall bear the same name of the existing or platted street. Street names shall conform to the City's Street Naming and Property Numbering System as applicable.
T. Streets in Flood Hazard Area: No street shall be approved if its final surface is at a lower elevation than two feet (2') below the regulatory flood protection elevation. The City Council may require profiles and elevations of finished streets for areas subject to flooding. Fill may be used for streets, provided such fill does not unduly increase flood heights and provided any such fill would not result in a stage increase violating the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, Chapters 104 and 105, as such chapters may be amended, supplemented, or replaced from time to time, and any applicable requirements imposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency pursuant to its rules and regulations. Drainage openings shall not restrict the flow of water so as to unduly increase flood heights and provided any such drainage opening would not violate the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, Chapters 104
3-10
and 105, as such chapters may be amended, supplemented, or replaced from time to time, and any applicable requirements imposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency pursuant to its rules and regulations.

C. Sewage Disposal: Extension of the public sanitary sewer system, when available, shall be designed so as to provide public sewer service to each lot.
3.11 SEWAGE DISPOSAL AND STORM DRAINAGE FOR AREAS WITHOUT CENTRAL OR PUBLIC SERVICES: In areas being platted without central or public sewers, the on-site sewer system, including the size and relative location of same, shall be in conformance with City, County, State and Federal requirements including specifically any FEMA rules and regulations pertinent to on-site sewer and water. When such requirements conflict, the most restrictive shall apply. In addition to those standards, the following requirements shall also apply unless in conflict with a more restrictive requirement referenced above:
A. The subdivision shall be subject to soil and percolation tests being made to determine whether or not the lot sizes proposed will meet minimum standards of health and sanitation due to limitations of soils as shown on existing soils maps. Such tests shall be made at the expense of the applicant and a sketch map shall be submitted with the preliminary plat to identify the specific locations where tests were made.
B. No cesspools or seepage pits shall be allowed.
C. The City may prohibit installation of sewage disposal facilities requiring soil absorption systems where such systems will not function due to high ground water, flooding, or unsuitable soil characteristics.
D. Storm Water Drainage Facilities: Storm water drainage facilities, where required, shall be designed to convey the flow of surface waters without damage to persons or property. The system shall insure drainage at all points along streets, and provide positive drainage away from building and on-site waste disposal to accommodate frequent floods. Drainage plans shall be consistent with local and regional drainage plans. The facilities shall be designed to protect against surface erosion and siltation of surface water and to prevent the discharge of excess runoff onto adjacent properties.
E. Storm Water Drainage Standards: All developments are responsible for control of surface or storm water to equal or improve pre-development conditions. Developmental drainage systems shall be provided that accept flow from upstream areas, that control, convey, and pond developmental runoff, that limit outflow to the natural pre-development rate, and that do not have detrimental impacts on downstream properties. All pipe conveyance shall be to ten (10) year design return frequency. Flood protection shall be provided for one hundred (100) year design return frequency. Where determined feasible, all ponding, detention or retention shall be designed for 100 year frequency storm condition.

G. The limitation of development on slopes steeper than three to one (3:1).
H. Structure conformance to the natural limitations presented by the topography and soil so as to create the least potential of soil erosion.
3.18 TREE PRESERVATION: With respect to existing trees in new developments, all trees on the site are to be saved which do not have to be removed for street, buildings, utilities, drainage or active recreational purposes. Trees over six (6) inches in diameter that are to remain, are to be marked with a red band, and to be protected with snow fences or other suitable enclosure, prior to any excavation. The City may further require that the property owner and/or developer retain a professional forester to prepare a forest inventory and management plan for the development, in order to control and abate any existing or potential shade tree disease and to save trees from construction loss.
3.19 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES (PARK LAND DEDICATION):
A. As a prerequisite to final plat approval, and at the sole determination by the City, applicants and/or developers shall dedicate land for parks, playgrounds, public open spaces or trails and/or shall make a cash contribution to the City's Park and Multi-Purpose Trail Funds roughly related to the anticipated effect of the plat on the park and trail system. The amounts listed in this section are the Citys best estimate of the dedication or cash contribution needed to offset the effect on those systems. The requirement may also be met with a combination of land and cash if approved by the City Council.
B. Land to be dedicated shall be reasonably suitable for its intended use as determined by the City and shall be at a location convenient to the public to be served. Factors used in evaluating the adequacy of proposed park and recreation areas shall include size, shape, topography, geology, hydrology, tree cover, access and location.
C. The applicant shall confer with City Staff and the Parks and Recreation Advisory Committee at the time the preliminary plat is under consideration, to secure a recommendation as to the location of any property that should be dedicated to the public, such as parks, playgrounds or other public property. The preliminary plat shall show the location and dimensions of all areas to be dedicated in this manner. Such contribution requirement recommendation(s) shall be sent to the Planning Commission for review and comment and subsequently to the City Council for their approval.
3-16
D. When a proposed park, playground, recreational area, or other public ground has been indicated in the City's official map or Comprehensive Plan and is located in whole or in part within a proposed plat, it shall be dedicated to the appropriate governmental unit. If the applicant elects not to dedicate an area in excess of the land required hereunder for a proposed public site that the City feels is in the public interest to acquire, the City may consider acquiring the excess land through purchase or condemnation.
E. Land area conveyed or dedicated to the City shall not be used in calculating density requirements of the City Zoning Ordinance and shall be in addition to and not in lieu of open space requirements for planned unit developments.
F. Where private open space for park and recreation purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision, such areas shall not be used for credit against the requirement of dedication for park and recreation purposes, unless the City Council finds it is in the public interest to do so.
G. The City, upon consideration of the particular type of development, may require that a lesser parcel of land should be dedicated due to particular features of the development. In such cases, a cash contribution shall be required above the land dedication to insure that compensation is received for the full amount of the impact on the Citys park and trail system.
H. In all new subdivisions an amount of land equaling the proportion of the gross area to be subdivided, no greater than the percentage of the monetary amount of park dedication fee pursuant to §3.19.J as a percentage of the total value of the parcel to be subdivided prior to development, or a different percentage as the City Council shall determine to be reasonably necessary as a result of the subdivision approval, when so requested by the City Council, shall be dedicated for public recreation space or other public use as established by City Council resolution. The dedicated percent of the gross area subdivided shall be in addition to property dedicated for streets, alleys, easements, or other public ways. No areas may be dedicated for public use until such areas have been approved by the City Council as suitable and necessary for the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the City.
I. All land proposed for trail and/or bikeway dedication shall be subject to the recommendations of the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board and the approval of the City Council.
J. When a subdivision is proposed, the Developer shall make a dedication of land for public parks and trail use, as provided for in Section 3.19.H of this Ordinance, or shall pay a cash fee in lieu of such land equal to five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) per dwelling unit. Said amount is the Citys best estimate of the effect of the residential subdivision on the Citys trail system.
K. The City may elect at its sole discretion to receive a combination of cash, land, and development of the land for park and/or trail use in accordance with City policy
3-17
established by resolution of the City Council. The potential cash donation generated by the dedicated land and/or the value of the development of land shall be calculated as forth in Subsection J above. That amount shall be subtracted from the cash contribution required by Subsections H and J above.
L. Planned unit developments with mixed land uses shall make cash and/or land contributions in accordance with this Section based upon the percentage of land devoted to the various uses.
M. Park cash contributions are to be calculated and established at the time of final plat approval. The City Council may require the payment at the time of final plat approval or at a later time under terms agreed upon in the development agreement. Delayed payment may include interest at a rate set by the City.
N. Cash contributions for parks and trails shall be deposited in either the City's Park Fund or multi-purpose trail fund and shall only be used for park acquisition or development, and trail acquisition or development as determined by the City. Additionally, said funds may be utilized anywhere within the City park and trail systems.
O. Wetlands, ponding areas, and drainageways accepted by the City may not be considered in the park land and/or cash contribution to the City.
P. Property being replatted with the same number of lots and same number of dwelling units shall be exempt from all park land dedication requirements. If the number of lots or the number of dwelling units is increased, or if land outside the previously recorded plat is added, then the park land dedication and/or park cash contributions shall be based on the additional lots and on the additional land being added to the plat. If the additional land does not create additional lots, then each one-third (1/3) acre added shall be considered a new lot for purposes of calculating the dedication requirements.
Q. When land is dedicated and deeded to and accepted by the City for park purposes, it shall be the responsibility of the City to maintain such dedicated property.
R. Land dedication to the City shall be in the form of lots or outlots with approved lot and block numbers.
S. If the applicant or developer does not believe that the estimates contained in this section fairly and accurately represent the effect of the subdivision on the park or trail system of the City, the applicant or developer may request that the City prepare an in-depth study of the effect of the subdivision on the park and trail system and an estimate of that effect in money and/or land. All costs of such study shall be borne by the developer or applicant. If the developer or applicant requests the preparation of such a study, no application for development submitted shall be deemed complete until the study has been completed and a determination is made as to the appropriate amount of land or money necessary to offset the effects of the
3-18
subdivision.
3.20 DEDICATION OF STORM WATER HOLDING AREAS OR PONDS: Upon approval by the City Council, the applicant may be required to dedicate to the public land for storm water holding areas or ponds. The storm water holding area dedication shall not be considered part of the dedication for parks and recreation purposes or trail/bikeway purposes.
3.21 MAINTENANCE OF PRIVATE OPEN SPACE: In the event certain land areas or structures are provided within the subdivision for private recreational use or as service facilities, the owner of such land and buildings shall enter into an agreement with the City to assure the continued operation and maintenance to a predetermined reasonable standard.

A.	The City Council shall serve as the Board of Adjustment and Appeals.

c.	The special conditions and circumstances causing the undue hardship do not result from the actions of the applicant.

granted without impairing the intent of this Ordinance. In the case of major variance, the Planning Commission, based upon a report and recommendation by the City staff, shall have the power to advise and recommend such conditions related to the variance regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as it may deem advisable in the interest of the intent and purpose of the Ordinance.

Review by Planning Commission: During the thirty (30) day comment period that follows publication of the notice of availability of the EAW in the EQB Monitor, the Planning Commission shall review the EAW. The Commission shall make recommendations to the City Council regarding potential environmental impacts that may warrant further investigation before the project is commenced and the need for an EIS on the proposed project.

4.	Decision by City Council: The City Council shall make its decision on the need for an EIS for the proposed project at its first meeting more than ten
(10) days but not more than thirty (30) days after the close of the comment period. The Board shall base its decision on the need for an EIS and the proposed scope of an EIS on the information gathered during the EAW process and on the comments received on the EAW.

9.4	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENTS (EISs):

A.	Purpose: The purpose of an EIS is to provide information for governmental units, the proposer of the project and other persons to evaluate proposed projects which have the potential for significant environmental effects, to consider alternatives to the proposed projects and to explore methods for reducing adverse environmental effects.

B.	Mandatory EISs: An EIS shall be prepared for any project that meets or exceeds the thresholds of any of the EIS categories listed in Minnesota Rules 4410.4400, as may be amended.

C.	Discretionary EISs: An EIS shall be prepared when the City Council determines that, based on the EAW and any comments or additional information received during the EAW comment period, the proposed project has the potential for significant environmental effects, or when the City Council and the proposer of the project agree that an EIS should be prepared.



D.	Procedures:

1.	All projects requiring an EIS must have an EAW on file with the City, which will be used to determine the scope of the EIS. All EISs shall be prepared according to the procedures and requirements of the State Environmental Review Program, Rules 4410.2100-4410.3000, as may be amended. The costs of preparation of an EIS shall be assessed to the project proposer in accordance with Minnesota Rules Parts 4410.6000 to 4100.6500, as may be amended.

2.	Any proposal, project or use on which an EIS is required shall be considered a conditional use as defined in Section 2.02 of this Ordinance and shall comply with the procedure for approval of a conditional use permit.

c.	Land shall be developed in increments of workable size such that adequate	erosion and siltation controls can be provided as construction progresses. The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one period of time.

d.	The  drainage  system  shall  be  constructed   and  operational  as quickly as possible during construction.

e.	Whenever  possible,  natural  vegetation  shall   be  retained  and protected.

f.	Where the topsoil is removed, sufficient arable soil shall  be set aside for re-spreading over the developed area. The soil shall be restored to a depth of four (4) inches and shall be of a quality at least equal to the soil quality prior to development.

g.	When soil is exposed, the exposure shall be for the shortest feasible period of time. No exposure shall be planned to exceed sixty (60) days. Said time period shall be extended only if the City Engineer	is satisfied that adequate measures have been established and will remain in place.

h.	The natural drainage system shall be used as far as is feasible for the storage and flow of runoff. Storm water drainage shall be discharged to marshlands, swamps, retention basins or other treatment facilities. Diversion of storm water to marshlands or swamps shall be considered for existing or planned surface drainage.	Marshlands and swamps used for storm water shall provide for natural or artificial water level control.  Temporary storage areas or retention basins scattered throughout developed areas shall be encouraged to reduce peak flows, erosion damage, and construction costs.

2.	Exposed Slopes:  The following control measures shall be taken to control erosion during any activity where soils are exposed:

a.	No slope should be steeper in grade than four (4) feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical

b.	Exposed slopes steeper in grade than ten (10) feet  horizontal to one (1) foot vertical should be contour plowed to minimize direct runoff of water.

c.	At the foot of each exposed slope, a channel and berm should be constructed  to  control  runoff.    The  channelized  water  should  be
 
diverted to a sedimentation  basin (debris basin, silt basin or silt trap) before being allowed to enter the natural drainage system.

d.	Along the top of each exposed slope, a berm should be constructed to prevent runoff from flowing over the edge of the slope. Where runoff collecting behind said berm cannot be diverted elsewhere and must be directed down the slope, appropriate measures shall be taken to prevent erosion. Such measures should consist of either an asphalt paved flow apron and drop chute laid down the slope or a flexible slope drain. At the base of the slope drain or flow apron, a gravel energy dissipater should be installed to prevent erosion at the discharge end.

e.	Exposed slopes shall be protected by whatever means will effectively prevent erosion considering the degree of slope, soils material, and expected length of exposure. Slope protection shall consist of mulch, sheets of plastic, burlap or jute netting, sod blankets, fast growing grasses or temporary seedings of annual grasses.	Mulch consists of hay, straw, wood chips, corn stalks, bark or other protective material. Mulch should be anchored to slopes with liquid asphalt, stakes , and netting, or should be worked into the soil to provide additional slope stability.

f.	Control measures, other than those specifically stated above, may be used in place of the above measures if it can be demonstrated that they will as effectively protect exposed slopes.

3.	Design Standards :

a.	Waterways:

(1)	The natural above ground drainage system shall be utilized to the extent possible to dispose of runoff. Storm sewers are only be used where it can be demonstrated that the use of the	above ground natural drainage system will not adequately dispose of runoff. Above ground runoff disposal waterways	may be constructed to augment the natural drainage system. To the extent  possible, the natural and constructed waterways shall be coordinated with an open space trail system.


(2)	The widths of a constructed waterway shall be sufficiently large to adequately channelrunoff from a ten (10) inch storm.  Adequacy shall be determined by the expected runoff
when full development of the drainage area is reached.
 
(3)	No fences or structures shall be constructed across the waterway that will reduce or restrict the flow of water .

(4)	· The banks of the waterway shall be  protected  with  a permanent turf vegetation.

(5)	The banks of the waterway shall  not exceed five  (5) feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical in gradient.

(6)	The gradient of the waterway bed shall not exceed a grade that will result in a velocity that will cause erosion of the banks of the waterway.

(7)	The bed of the waterway shall be protected with turf , sod, or concrete. If turf or sod will not function properly, rip rap may be used. Rip rap shall consist of quarried limestone, fieldstone	(if random rip rap is used) or  construction materials provided said construction materials are limited to asphalt cement and concrete. The rip rap shall be  no smaller than two (2) inches square nor no larger than two (2) feet square . Construction materials shall be used only in those areas where the waterway is not used as part of a recreation trail system.

(8)	If the flow velocity in the waterway is such that erosion of the turf sidewall will occur and said velocity cannot be decreased via velocity control structures , then other materials may replace turf on the sidewalls. Either gravel or rip rap may be allowed to prevent erosion at these points.

b.	Water Velocity:

(1)	The flow velocity of runoff in waterways shall be controlled to a velocity that will minimize erosion of the waterway.

(2)	Flow velocity shall be controlled through the installation of diversions, berms, slope drains, and other similarly effective velocity control structures .

c.	Sediment Control:

 	_.i.(..1.;..)ir    ----T;- o    p.:..:r..-e7--v=-e;:_n:-'-t''--s':_e:: diment=a:tion _ of   waterways,	pervious    aod	_
impervious sediment traps and other sediment control structures shall be incorporated · throughout the contributing watershed .
 
(2)	Temporary pervious sediment traps could consist of a construction of bales of hay with a low spillway embankment section of sand and gravel that permits a slow movement of water while filtering sediment. Such structures may serve as temporary sediment control features during the construction stage of a development.

(3)	Permanent impervious sediment control structures consist of sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basins, or silt traps) and shall be utilized to remove sediment from runoff prior to its disposal in any permanent body of water.

d.	Maintenance of Erosion Control System:

(1)	The erosion and velocity control structures shall be maintained	in a condition that will insure continuous functioning according to the provisions of this Ordinance.

(2)	Sediment basins shall be maintained as the need occurs to insure continuous desilting action.

(3)	The areas utilized for runoff waterways and sediment basins shall  not be allowed to exist in an unsightly condition.   The banks  of  the  sediment  basins  and  waterways  shall  be landscaped.

(4)	Prior to the approval of any development, the developer shall make provision for continued maintenance of the erosion and sediment control system.

D.	The top of any exterior foundation shall extend above the elevation of the street, gutter  or inlet of an approved drainage device a minimum of twelve (12) inches plus two (2) percent.  Exceptions to this standard may be approved by the City Building Official when it can be demonstrated that required drainage to the point of discharge and away from the structure is provided at all locations on the site.



15.10	GLARE: Any lighting used to illuminate an off-street parking area, sign or other structure, shall be arranged as to deflect light away from any adjoining residential use or zone and from public streets.

63.1	PURPOSE: The purpose of the PUD, Planned Unit Development District is to provide comprehensive procedures and standards intended to allow greater flexibility in the development of neighborhoods and/or non-residential areas by incorporating design modifications and/or a mixture of uses.  The PUD process is intended to encourage:

A.	Innovations in development to the end that the growing demands for all styles of economic expansion may be met by greater variety in type, design, and placement of structures and by the conservation and more efficient use of land in such developments.

B.	Higher standards of site and building design through the use of trained and experienced land planners, architects, landscape architects and engineers.

C.	More convenience in location and design of development and service facilities.

D.	The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such as natural topography, wetlands, woodlands, and geologic features and the prevention of soil erosion which are over and above minimum standards and expectations.

E.	A creative use of land and related physical development which allows a phased and orderly development and use pattern.

F.	An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets, thereby lowering development costs, long term maintenance expenses, and public investments.



G.	A development pattern in harmony with the objectives of the St. Augusta Comprehensive Plan. (PUD is not intended as a means to vary applicable planning and zoning principles.)

H.	A more desirable and creative environment than might be possible through the strict application of zoning and subdivision regulations of the City.



63.2	USES: All permitted, permitted accessory, conditional uses, interim uses, and uses by administrative permit contained in Sections 45 through 61 of this Ordinance which are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan shall be treated as potentially allowable uses within a PUD District.
 
63.3	REQUIREMENTS, CONDITIONS AND STANDARDS FOR APPROVING A PUD:

A.	General Standards:

1.	Comprehensive Plan Consistency: The proposed PUD shall be consistent with the City Comprehensive Plan.

2.	Common Open Space: Common private or public open space and facilities at least sufficient to meet the minimum requirements established in the Comprehensive Plan and such complementary structures and improvements as are necessary and appropriate for the benefit and enjoyment of the residents/occupants of the PUD may be provided within the area of the PUD development.

3.	Operating and Maintenance Requirements for PUD Common Open Space Facilities: Whenever common private or public open space or service facilities are provided within the PUD, the PUD shall contain provisions to assure the continued operation and maintenance of such open space and service facilities to a predetermined reasonable standard. Common private or public open space and service facilities within a PUD may be placed under the ownership of one or more of the following, as approved by the City Council:

a.	Dedicated to the public, where a community-wide use is anticipated and the City Council agrees to accept the dedication.

b.	Landlord control, where only use by tenants is anticipated.



c.	Property owners association, provided all of the following conditions are met:

1)	Prior to the use, occupancy, sale or the execution of contracts for sale of individual buildings, units, lots, parcels, tracts or common areas, a declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions or an equivalent document or a document such as specified by Minnesota Statutes 515, Article 2 and a set of floor plans such as specified by Minnesota Statutes 515, Article 2-110 shall be filed with St. Augusta. Said filing with the City is to be made prior to the filings of said declaration or document or floor plans with the recording officers of Stearns County.

2)	The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions or equivalent  document  shall  specify  that  deeds,  leases  or
 
documents of conveyance affecting buildings, units, lots, parcels, or tracts shall subject said properties to the terms of said declaration.

3)	The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions shall provide that an owners association or corporation shall be formed and that all owners shall be members of said association or corporation which shall maintain all properties and common areas in good repair and which shall assess individual property owners proportionate shares of joint or common costs. This declaration shall be subject to the review and approval of the City Attorney. The intent of this requirement is to protect the property values of the individual owner through establishing adequate private control.

4)	The declaration shall additionally, amongst other things, provide that in the event the association or corporation fails to maintain properties in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of St. Augusta or fails to pay taxes or assessments on properties as they become due and in the event St. Augusta City incurs any expenses in enforcing its rules and regulations, which said expenses are not immediately reimbursed by the association or corporation, then the City shall have the right to assess each property its prorata share of said expenses. Such assessments, together with interest thereon and costs of collection, shall be a lien on each property against which each such assessment is made.

5)	Membership must be mandatory for each owner, and any successive buyer.

6)	The open space restrictions must be permanent and not for a limited period of years, unless specifically approved by the City.

4.	Staging of Public and Common Open Space: When a PUD provides for common private or public open space, and is planned for a staged development over a period of time, the total area of common or public open space or land escrow security in any stage of development shall, at a minimum, bear the same relationship to the total open space to be provided in the entire PUD as the stages or units completed or under development bear to the entire PUD.

5.	Density: The maximum allowable density in a PUD Zoning District shall be determined by standards negotiated and agreed upon between the applicant

63-4
 
and the City. In all cases, the negotiated standards shall be consistent with the development policies as contained in the St. Augusta Comprehensive Plan.

6.	Principal Buildings: No More than one (1) principal building may be constructed on each platted lot within a PUD.

7.	Land Use/Housing Type: A PUD which involves only one (1) land use or housing type may be allowed, provided that it is otherwise consistent with the stated purposes and objectives of this section and the Comprehensive Plan.

8.	Ordinance Modifications: The uniqueness of  each PUD requires that specifications and standards for streets, utilities, public facilities and the approval of land subdivisions may be subject to modifications from the City ordinances generally governing them. The City Council may therefore approve streets, utilities, public facilities and land subdivisions which are not in strict compliance with usual specifications or ordinance requirements where it is found that such are not required in the interests of the City.

9.	Utilities: In any PUD, all utility installations and connections including telephone, electricity, gas, telecable, public sewer and water, private septic systems and wells shall conform to the applicable provisions of the St. Augusta Subdivision Ordinance, unless otherwise approved by the City Council.

B.	Benefit: The proposed PUD shall accomplish one or more of the objectives stated in Section 63.01 and shall not simply be for the enhanced economic gain of the applicant. It shall be the applicants responsibility to demonstrate compliance with this requirement.

64.2	: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION: This Section is adopted pursuant to the authorization and policies contained in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 103A, 8, E, F, G, and I, Minnesota Regulations, and the planning and zoning enabling legislation in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 462.



64.3	: SHORELAND DISTRICTS: The shorelands within the City of St. Augusta  are hereby designated as shoreland districts and the requirements set forth in this Section shall govern development and other activities within these districts. The classification of the shoreland areas shall govern the use, alteration and development of these areas according to said classification as per M.S. 103F.201, .205, .211, .215, and .221, and Minnesota Regulations NR 82-84.
 
64.4	: DISTRICT APPLICATION: The Shoreland District shall be applied to and superimposed as an overlay upon all zoning districts as contained herein as existing or amended by this Ordinance and official Zoning Map. The regulations and requirements imposed by the Shoreland District shall be in addition to those established for districts which jointly apply. Under the joint application of districts, the more restrictive requirements shall apply.



64.5	: BOUNDARIES: The boundaries of the Shoreland Overlay District are established within the following distances from the ordinary high water mark of the surface water depending on the size of the surface water as indicated on the official Zoning Map.

SURFACE WATER	DISTANCE  (FEET)*

 
Greater than ten (10) acres (Table 1)

Rivers and Streams (draining an area greater
than two (2) square miles)***	300**

*		The practical distance may be less whenever the waters involved are bounded by topographical divides which extend landward from the waters for lesser distances and prevent flowage toward the surface water.
 
**

***
 
The distance requirement shall be increased to the limit of the floodplain when the floodplain is greater than three hundred (300) feet.
Does not include Wild, Scenic, and Recreational River
 


64.6	: SHORELAND CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM: The surface waters affected by this Ordinance and which require controlled development of their shoreland (Shoreland District) shall be shown on the official Zoning Map established by Subd. 44.03 of this Ordinance. Surface waters generally greater than ten (10) acres and given an identification number by the State of Minnesota are defined and listed below.

A.	Lakes Classification System:

1.	Natural Environmental Lakes: Natural environmental lakes are generally small, often shallow lakes with limited capacities for assimilating the impacts of development and recreational use. They often have adjacent lands with substantial constraints for development such as high water tables, exposed bedrocks, and unsuitable soils.

These lakes, particularly in rural areas, usually do not have much existing development or recreational use.

2.	Recreational Development Lakes: Recreational development lakes are generally medium sized lakes of varying depths and shapes with a variety of land form, soil, and ground water situations on the lands around them. They often are characterized by moderate levels of recreational use and existing development. Development consists mainly of seasonal and year-round residences and recreationally-oriented commercial uses. Many of these have capacities for accommodating additional development and use.

B.	Rivers and Streams Classification System:

1.	Agricultural Rivers: Agricultural river segments are located in well-roaded, intensively cultivated areas of the western and southern regions of the state. Cultivated crops are the predominant land use, with some pasture and occasional	feedlots, small municipalities, and small forested areas. Residential development is not common, but some year-round residential use is occurring within commuting distances of major cities. Some intensive recreational use occurs on these river segments in particular areas,  but overall recreational use of these waters and adjacent lands is low. Although potential exists for additional development and recreation, water quality constraints and competing land uses, particularly agriculture, will inhibit expansions .

Agricultural River	Legal Description




2.	Tributary Rivers: Tributary river segments consists of water courses mapped in the Protected Waters Inventory that have not been assigned one of the river classes. These segments have a wide variety of existing land and recreational use characteristics.  The segments  have considerable  potential for additional development and recreational use, particularly  those  located near roads and within cities.

2.	Design Criteria for Structures:

a.	High Water Elevations : Structures shall be placed in accordance with any floodplain regulations applicable to the site. Where these controls do not exist, the elevation to which  the  lowest  floor,  including basement, is placed or flood-proofed shall be determined as follows :

(1)	For lakes, by placing the lowest floor at a level at least three feet above the highest known water level, or three feet above the ordinary high water level, whichever is higher.

(2)	For rivers and streams, by placing the lowest floor at least three feet above the flood of record, if data are available. If data is not available, by placing the lowest floor at least three feet above the ordinary high water level, or by conducting a technical evaluation to determine effects of proposed construction upon flood stages and flood lows and to establish a flood protection elevation.	Under all three approaches, technical evaluations shall be done by a qualified engineer or hydrologist consistent with parts 6120.5000 to 6120.6200 governing the management of floodplain areas . If more than one approach is used, the highest flood protection elevation determined shall be used for placing structures and other facilities;

(3)	Water-oriented accessory structures may have the lowest floor placed lower than the elevation determined if the structure is constructed	of flood-resistant materials to the elevation, electrical and mechanical equipment is placed above the elevation and, if long duration flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to withstand ice action and wind-driven waves and debris.

b.

(2)	The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high water level shall be at least ten (10) feet;

(3)	The structure or facility shall be treated to reduce visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography, increased setbacks or color, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions;

(4)	The roof may be used as a deck with safety rails, but shall not be enclosed or used as a storage area;

(5)	The structure or facility shall not be designed or used for human habitation and must not contain water supply  or  sewage treatment facilities; and

(6)	As an alternative for general development and recreational development water bodies, water-oriented accessory structures used solely for watercraft storage, and including storage of related boating and water-oriented supporting equipment, may occupy an area up to four hundred (400) square feet, provided the maximum width of the structure is twenty (20) feet as measured parallel to the configuration of the shoreline.

c.	Stairways, Lifts and Landings: Stairways and lifts are  the preferred alternative to major topographic alterations for  achieving  access  up and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Subject to other more restrictive limitations which may be imposed by this  Ordinance, stairways and lifts shall meet the following design requirements:

(1)	Stairways and lifts shall not exceed four feet in width on residential lots. Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties, and public open space recreational properties;

(2)	Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots shall not exceed thirty-two (32) square feet in area. Landings larger than thirty-two	(32) square feet may be used for commercial properties, and public open space recreational properties;

(3)	Canopies or roofs shall  not  be allowed  on stairways,  lifts,  or landings;
 


(4)	Stairways, lifts, and landings may be either constructed above the ground on posts or pilings, or placed into the ground, provided they are designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion.

(5)	Stairways, lifts, and landings shall be located in the most visually inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface	of the public water assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever practical.

(6)	Facilities such as ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for physically handicapped persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore areas, provided that the dimensional and performance standards of subitems (a) to (e) shall be complied with  in addition to the requirements of Minnesota Regulations, Chapter 1340.

d.	Significant Historic/Archeological Sites: No structure may be placed on a significant historic and/or archeological site in a manner that affects the values of the site unless adequate information about the site has been removed and documented in a public repository.

e.	Steep Slopes: The Zoning Administrator shall evaluate possible soil erosion impacts and development visibility from public waters before issuing a permit for construction of sewage treatment systems , roads, driveways, structures,  or other improvements on steep slopes. When determined necessary,  conditions  shall be attached to  issued permits to prevent erosion and to preserve existing vegetation screening of structures, vehicles, and other facilities as viewed from the surface of public waters, assuming summer , leaf-on vegetation .

E.	Shoreland Alterations: Alterations of vegetation and topography shall be regulated to prevent erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic value, prevent bank slumping, and protect fish and wildlife habitat.

1.	Vegetation  Alterations:

1.	Residential PUD "Base" Density Evaluation:

a.	The suitable a.rea within each tier is divided by the single residential lot size standard for lakes or, for rivers, the single residential lot width
 

standard times the tier depth, unless the local unit of government has specified an alternative minimum lot size for rivers which shall then be used to yield a base density of dwelling units or sites for each tier . Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or sites for the residential planned unit developments shall then be compared with the tier, density, and suitability analysis herein and the design criteria in Subd. 64.17.D.

2.	Commercial PUD "Base" Density Evaluation: The density evaluation as follows pertains to those commercial planned unit developments that provide transient service oriented operations such as hotel/motel accommodations, resorts, recreational vehicles, and camping parks and other like service activities .

a.	Determine the average inside living area size of dwelling units or sites within each tier, including both existing and proposed units and sites. Computation of inside living area sizes .shall not include decks, patios, stops, steps, garages or porches and basements, unless they are habitable space.
b.	Select the appropriate floor area ratio from the following table: Commercial Planned Unit Development

*For average  unit floor areas less than shown, use the floor area ratios listed for 200 square feet. For areas greater than shown, use the ratios listed for 1,500 square feet. For recreational camping areas, use the ratios listed at 400 square feet. Manufactured home sites  in recreational camping areas shall use a ratio equal to the size of the manufactured home, or if unknown, the ratio listed for 1,000 square feet.

c.	Multiply the suitable area within each tier by the floor area ratio to yield total floor area for each tier allowed to be used for dwelling units or sites.

d.	Divide the total floor area by tier computed in Item C above by the average inside living area size determined in Item A above. This yields a base number of dwelling units and sites for each tier.

e.	Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or sites for the commercial planned unit development are then compared with the tier, density, design criteria and suitability analysis.

3.	Density Increase Multipliers:

a.	Increases to the dwelling unit or dwelling site base densities previously determined are allowable if the dimensional standards in Subd. 64.17.E are met or exceeded and the design criteria in Subd.
64.17.F are satisfied. The allowable density   increases  in  Item  b below may only be allowed if  structure  setbacks  from  the  ordinary high water level are  increased  to  at  least  50  percent  greater  than the minimum setback, or  the  impact  on  the  water  body  is  reduced an  equivalent  amount   through   · vegetative   management, topography, or additional means acceptable to the local unit of government and the setback is at least 25 percent greater than the minimum   setback.

65.01: PURPOSE: The purpose and intent of this Section is to insure that the wetland resources within the City of St. Augusta are protected and conserved. Wetland resources serve to provide food, shelter and habitat for fish and wildlife, store surface runoff and reduce flooding damages, replenish subsurface water supplies, provide outdoor recreation areas and enhance the natural beauty and biodiversity of landscapes within the City. This section incorporates by reference the Wetland Conservation Act of 1991, Laws of Minnesota 1991, chapter 354, as amended by Laws 1993, chapter 175 and the accompanying rules of the Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources (Minnesota Rules Chapter 8420, as amended) whose purpose is to:

A	Achieve no net loss in the quantity, quality, and biological diversity of Minnesota's existing wetlands;

B.	Increase the quantity, quality and biological diversity·of Minnesota's wetlands by restoring or enhancing diminished or drained wetlands;

C.	Avoid  direct  or  indirect  impacts  from  activities  that  destroy  or  diminish  the quantity, quality and biological diversity of wetlands;  and

D.	Replace wetland values where avoidance of activity is not feasible and prudent.
These. purposes  being  consistent  with  the  City's . desire  to  preserve  areas cont.aining low lands,  marshes, wetlands,  drainage areas,  water  bodies and
 
waterways which are essential to the health, safety and general welfare of the	'-
City's residents .



65.2	: SCOPE: Wetlands must not be drained or filled wholly or partially unless replaced by restoring or creating wetland areas of at least equal public value . This Section, along with the above mentioned references , shall be utilized by the City to insure the protection of the City's wetland resources.

In addition to the provisions of this Section, City decisions on draining and filling of wetlands are subject to Minnesota Statutes,  chapters  1168 and  116D, which  provide that an action which is likely to have material adverse effects on natural resources must not be allowed if there is a feasible and prudent alternative consistent with the requirements of the public health, safety and welfare and the state's paramount concern for the protection of its natural resources. Economic considerations alone do not justify adversely effective actions.



65.3	: DISTRICT APPLICATION:

A	All wetlands within the City of St. Augusta are hereby designated as part of the W, Wetlands Overlay District, and the requirements set forth in this Section shall govern development and other activities within these districts.

8. The W, Wetlands Overlay District shall be applied to and superimposed as an overlay upon all zoning districts as contained herein as existing or amended by the text of this Section. The regulations and requirements imposed by the W, Wetlands Overlay District shall be in addition to those established for districts which jointly apply. Under the joint application of districts, the more restrictive requirements shall apply.

C.	The boundaries of wetlands within the City may be changed by the City Council, Department of Natural Resources, or Army Corps of Engineers, whatever applicable, when it can be demonstrated by registered site survey and topographic work, and hydrologic analysis performed by registered engineer or land surveyor that the established boundaries are incorrect.



65.4	: PERMITTED USES: Permitted uses within a wetland, and as described in this Section, are subject to guidelines established by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Uses within a wetland which are not prohibited by this Section are:
 
A	The use of the bed of the wetlands for pasture or cropland during dry period if dikes, ditches, tile lines, or buildings are not constructed and the agricultural use does not result in the drainage of the wetlands.

B.	The filling of a wetland to accommodate wheeled booms on irrigation devices if the fill does not impede normal drainage.

C.	The control of noxious weeds if the control does not drain or fill the wetland.

D.	Excavation in wetlands if done in a manner such that the wetlands are  not drained or filled.



65.5	: CONDITIONAL USES:  Permitting for conditional uses in the W District shall be based upon procedures set forth in and regulated by Chapter 4 of this Ordinance. Conditional use permits shall be subject to the elevation criteria as set forth in Subd.
4.02 of this Ordinance. Subject to other more restrictive limitations which  may  be imposed by this Section, the uses listed in part B may be allowed in wetlands by conditional use permit subject to the following:

A	A wetland may not be drained or filled, wholly or partially, unless either the activity meets the exemption criteria stated in part B or unless it is replaced under an approved replacement plan meeting the criteria of Subd. 65.14. C. A wetland activity will be considered exempt if it qualifies for any one of the exemptions, even though it may be indicated as not exempt under another exemption.

These exemptions do not apply to calcareous fens as identified by the commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources.

No exemptions apply to wetlands that have been previously restored or created as a result of an approved replacement  plan. All such wetlands are subject to replacement on subsequent drainage or filling.

Nonexempt wetlands cannot be partially drained or filled in order to claim  an exemption or no-loss determination on the remainder. Therefore, no exemptions or no-loss determinations can be applied to the remaining wetland that would not have been applicable before the impact.

Present  and future  owners  of  wetlands  drained  or  filled  without  replacement under an exemption in part 8, subparts 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 and 23, can make no use of the wetland area after it is drained or filled, other than as agricultural land, for ten years after the draining or filling, unless it is first replaced under the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 103G.222, paragraph (g).  Also, for ten years the wetland  may not be restored for replacement  credit.   At the time of draining or filling, the landowner shall record a notice of these restrictions in the office of the
 

Stearns County Recorder. At a minimum, the recorded document must contain the name or names of the landowners, a legal description of the property to which the restrictions apply, a statement of the restrictions, the date on which the ten-year period expires, the City of St. Augusta as the local government which certified the exemption, if such occurred, the signatures of all owners, and an acknowledgment.

A person conducting an activity in a wetland under an exemption in part B shall ensure that:

1.	Appropriate erosion control measures are taken to prevent sedimentation of the water;

2.	The activity does not block fish activity in a watercourse; and

3.	The activity is conducted in compliance with all other applicable federal, state, and local requirements, including best management practices and water resource protection requirements established under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 103H.

The wetland landowner must provide the same proofs required by the first paragraph of exemption 1, for lands abutting at least 50 percent of the wetland's boundary. The City of St. Augusta may seek the advice of the technical panel as to whether the wetland is a type 1 wetland not of the bottomland hardwood type.

The type of the wetland will be determined according to United States Fish and Wildlife Service Circular No. 39 (1971 edition) . Alternatively, the type of the wetland can be determined from the Cowardin (et al. 1979) classification system: PEM1A, PEMA, PEMJ, and PEM1J may be considered to be a type 1 wetland .

This exemption applies if the wetland is all type 1 wetland , or is a combination of types 1 and 2 wetlands , on agricultural land, and the type 2 wetland area is less than two acres.

8.	Activities in a type 2 wetland that is two acres in size or less located on agricultural land.

The wetland landowner must provide the same material as required from  , the landowner by exemption 7.	The City of St. Augusta may seek the advice  of the technical  panel  as to whether  the wetland  is a type 2 wetland, two acres or less in size.

private entity;
c.	Actions by public entities that were taken for a purpose other than
creating the wetland; or
d.	Any combination of a. to c.

Wetland areas created by beaver activities may be drained by removing those materials placed by beaver. Drainage is permitted by removing or moving materials blocking installed roadway culverts and drainage structures. Additional excavation or removal of other materials  is not permitted unless it can be shown by aerial photographs that the proposed activity will not drain or fill wetland that was there before the beaver dam was built or the culvert became plugged.

Wetlands may be drained or filled if the landowner can show that the wetland was created solely by actions the purpose of which was not to create the wetland and were approved, permitted, funded, or overseen by a public entity.

Impoundments or excavations constructed in. nonwetlands solely for the purpose of effluent treatment, storm water retention, soil and water conservation practices, and water quality improvements, and not as part of a compensatory wetland mitigation process that may, over time, take on wetland characteristics, are also exempted.

b.	The proposed project significantly modifies or alters less than one­ half acre of wetlands.
 
For new placement and enhancement of existing facilities, the utility must demonstrate that the character and extent of the impacts of the proposed project on the wetlands have been minimized and that the entire project will, cumulatively , drain or fill less than one-half acre of wetland.

for maintenance, repair, and replacement, the City of  St. Augusta  may issue a seasonal or annual exemption certification or the utility may proceed without City of St.  Augusta certification if it is carrying out the work according to best management practices . Work of an emergency nature may proceed as necessary and any drain or fill activities shall be addressed with the City of St. Augusta after the emergency work has been completed.

12.	Activities associated with routine maintenance of utility and pipeline rights­ of-way, provided the activities do not result in additional intrusion into the wetland .

This exemption is for maintenance, but not expansion, of the rights-of-way in which utilities are located.  Spill remediation is not routine maintenance.

The City of St. Augusta may issue a seasonal or annual exemption certification or the utility may proceed if it is carrying out the work according to best management practices. Work of an emergency nature may proceed as necessary and any drain or fill activities shall be addressed with the City of St. Augusta after the emergency work has been completed.

13.	Alteration of a wetland associated with the operation, maintenance, or repair  of an interstate pipeline within all existing or acquired interstate pipeline rights-of-way. This exemption includes construction activities.

14.	Temporarily crossing or entering a wetland  to  perform  silvicultural activities, including timber harvest as part of a forest management activity , so long as the activity limits the impact on the hydrologic and biologic characteristics	of the wetland; the activities do not result in  the construction of dikes, drainage ditches, tile lines, or buildings; and  the timber harvesting and other silvicultural practices do not result in the drainage of the wetland or public waters . This exemption is for temporary­ use roads constructed for 'the primary purpose of providing access for the conduct of silvicultural activities.

A person who does not do so is subject to the enforcement provisions in Subd. 65.12 and Minnesota Statutes, section 103G.2372. An application for approval of a replacement plan may  be obtained from the City of St. Augusta .  The City of St. Augusta will, within ten days of receipt of the application, mail a copy of the application and an invitation to submit comments to:

A	The Board of Water and Resources, who will subsequently  publish  the application in the Environmental Quality Board Monitor.
B.	Members of the public who have requested a copy.
C.	The Soil and Water Conservation District.
D.	The watershed district or water management organization, if there is one.
E.	The Stearns County board of water and soil resources.
F.	Mayors of the cities within the watershed.
G.	The commissioners of agriculture and natural resources.

At the same time, the City of St. Augusta will publish notice of the application with an invitation to comment in a general circulation newspaper in- the area affected.   The City of St. Augusta  will  not make its decision  before 30 days and not more than 60 days have elapsed from the mailing of notice, publication in the Environmental Quality Board Monitor, when required, or publication in the newspaper, whichever is later.  The City of St. Augusta  decision will not be effective until 30 days after a copy of the decision has been mailed to the Environmental Quality Board Monitor for publication, when required, and mailed to  the  same  list specified  above for  notice of the  application  and to  the
 
-

applicant. The mailing to the applicant will be by registered mail and will advise that the decision is not effective for 30 days, and is stayed if it is appealed.

Publication in the Environmental Quality Board Monitor of replacement plan applications and decisions will be performed, except for the fill activities described in the next paragraph, when the City of St. Augusta will publish a general notice in the Environmental Quality Board Monitor that it will not be publishing notice of such individual activities,  but will instead provide mailed notice of each project to anyone asking to be put on the City of St. Augusta's mailing list for such projects. This notice will be published not less often than once every year. The notice will advise how persons may submit their names and addresses to be put on the mailing list.

Projects eligible for this form of Environmental Quality Board Monitor notice are all those which will fill less than one-tenth acre of wetland; and all those which will fill less than one-quarter acre of wetland, and result from a private road fill or the construction or expansion of a single-family dwelling unit or a farm building· when the project cannot be modified so as to avoid the fill.                             ··

The City of St. Augusta's decision shall be based on the replacement standards contained in this Section and on the technical determination of the technical evaluation panel concerning the public values, location, size, and type of the wetland being altered. The City of St. Augusta will consider the recommendation of the technical evaluation panel to approve, modify, or reject the proposed replacement plan.

For wetland replacement plans involving both the City of St. Augusta and one or more other local government units, approval of all local government units involved must be obtained before the project may proceed.



65.9	:   TECHNICAL  EVALUATION  PANEL AND PROCEDURES:   The City  of St.
Augusta will form, by resolution, a technical evaluation panel consisting of three persons:

A       A technical professional employee of the Board of Water and Soil Resources.

B.	A  technical  professional  employee  of  the  Stearns  County  Soil  and  Water Conservation District.

C.	A	technical	professional	with	expertise	in  water	resources	management appointed by the City of St. Augusta.

The member appointed by the City of St. Augusta will act as the contact person and coordinator for the panel. Two members of the technical review panel will be knowledgeable and trained in applying methodologies of the "Federal Manual for Identifying	and   Delineating   Jurisdictional   Wetlands"   (January   1989),  and
 
-


evaluation of public values. The technical evaluation panel reserves the right to invite additional wetland experts to help the panel in its work .

The panel will make technical determinations on questions of public values, location, size, and type for replacement plans if requested to do so by the City of St. Augusta, the landowner, or a member of the technical evaluation panel. The panel may review replacement plans and recommend to the City of St. Augusta either approval, approval with changes or conditions, or rejection. The panel will make no determinations or recommendations without at least one  member having made an on-site inspection. Panel determinations and recommendations must be endorsed by at least two of the three members.

The panel, or one of its members when so authorized by all of the members, may assist the City of St. Augusta in making wetland size and type determinations when asked to do so by the City of St. Augusta as part of making an exemption or no-loss determination.

If requested by the City of St. Augusta, the landowner, or a member of the technical evaluation panel, the panel will answer technical  questions  or participate in the monitoring of replacement wetlands and will similarly participate in the monitoring of banked wetlands.



65.10	:	APPEAL OF CITY OF ST. AUGUSTA DECISIONS.

A	Appeal of replacement plan decisions: The decision of the City of St. Augusta to approve, approve with conditions, or reject a replacement plan, becomes final if not appealed to the Board of Water and Soils Resources within 30 days after the date on which the decision is mailed to those required to receive notice of the decision.

Appeal may be  made by the landowner, by any of  those required to receive notice of the decision, or by 100 residents of the county in which a majority of the wetland is located.

Appeal is effective upon mailing of the notice of appeal to the Board of Water and Soils Resources with an affidavit  that a copy of the notice of appeal has been mailed to the City of St. Augusta.  The City of St. Augusta shall then mail a copy of the notice of the appeal to all those to whom it was required by this Section to mail a copy of the notice of decision.

B.	Appeal of exemption and no-loss determinations:
 
-


1.	An exemption or no-loss determination  may be appealed to the board by the landowner after first exhausting all City of St. Augusta administrative appeal options .

2.	Those required to receive notice of replacement plan decisions as provided for in Subd. 65.08 may petition the board to hear an appeal from an exemption or no-loss determination. The board will grant the petition unless it finds that the appeal is meritless, trivial, or brought solely for the purposes of delay. In determining whether to grant the appeal, the board will also give consideration to the  size of the wetland, other factors in controversy , any patterns of similar acts  by the City of St. Augusta or landowner or petitioner, and the consequences of the delay .

3.	The determination of the City of St. Augusta on the exemption or no-loss application is final unless an appeal or petition is mailed to  the  board within 30 days after the decision is mailed to the landowner. The appeal or petition must be accompanied by an affidavit that a copy has been sent to the City of St. Augusta and to the landowner if it is a petition.

C.		Board of Soil arid Water Resources Procedures: The appeal will be decided by the board within 60 days after receiving the notice of appeal and affidavit or granting the petition. Parties to the appeal will be the app llant, the City of St. Augusta and in the case of replacement plan appeals, all those required to receive notice of the City of St. Augusta's decision.

Upon appeal, the City of St. Augusta will forward to the board the record on which it based its decision. The board will make its decision on the appeal after hearing. Thirty days' notice of the hearing will be given by the board to the parties. The parties may present written and oral argument. When the City of St. Augusta has made formal findings contemporaneously with its decision and there is an accurate verbatim transcript of the proceedings and the proceedings were fairly conducted, the board will base its review on the record. Otherwise, it may take additional evidence, or remand the matter.

The board will affirm the City of St. Augusta's decision if the City of St. Augusta's findings of fact are not clearly erroneous; if the City of St. Augusta correctly applied the law to the facts, including this Section; and if the City of St. Augusta made no procedural errors prejudicial to a party. Otherwise, the  board will reverse the decision, amend it, or remand it with instructions for further proceedings .
 
-

65.11	:   COMPENSATION:   Replacement plan applicants who have completed the City of St. Augusta process and the Board of Water and Soil Resources appeal process and the plan has not been approved as submitted, may apply to the Board of Water and Soil Resources for compensation under Minnesota Statutes, section 103G.237.



65.12	: ENFORCEMENT  PROCEDURES:

A		Enforcing Authorities : The commissioner of the Department of  Natural Resources, conservation officers, and other peace officers may issue cease and desist orders and restoration and replacement orders.

B.	Cease and Desist Orders: Site-specific cease and desist orders may be issued when the enforcement authority has probable cause that a drain or fill activity is being or has been conducted in a wetland and does not qualify for an exemption or a no-loss determination and is being or has been conducted without prior approval of a replacement plan by the City of St. Augusta.

A cease and desist order will not be issued if the landowner has a valid certificate of exemption or no-loss from the City of St. Augusta or has evidence to support an exemption. Otherwise:

1.	The enforcement authority may issue a cease and desist order upon discovery of the drain or fill activity;

2.	The order may be withheld to give the landowner time to produce the evidence required by the City of St. Augusta to the enforcement authority of qualification for an exemption or no-loss determination; or

3.	A cease and desist order may be issued with an effective date three weeks   from the date of issuance. The enforcement  authority  may exercise this option when the enforcement authority cannot readily make a determination on the facts and circumstances to deny a landowner's claim of exemption or no-loss, and continued drain or fill activity would not cause irreparable harm to the wetland .

The enforcement authority will advise the landowner  that  the  landowner's application, if any, for an exemption or no-loss determination, should be made immediately to the City of St. Augusta and that whatever drain and fill work the landowner has done may  require  restoration  according  to  a  restoration  plan designed by the soil and · water conservation  district,  if  the  application  for exemption  or  no-loss  determination  is denied.

The enforcement authority issuing a cease and desist order will submit copies to the soil and water conservation district, City of St. Augusta , and department.
 
-



If an application for an exemption or no-loss determination is triggered by a cease and desist order, the City of St. Augusta or the technical evaluation panel will make a decision within three weeks from the date of application. The City of St. Augusta or the technical evaluation panel will review evidence of exemption or no-loss produced by  the landowner, inspect the site if necessary, and determine:

1.	If the area in question is a wetland; and

2.	If the activity qualifies for an exemption or no-loss determination.

In cases where the cease and desist order has been issued to the City of St. Augusta, the determination of exemption or no-loss will be made by the Board of Soil and Water Resources.

If the decision is that the activity is exempt or results in a no-loss determination, the decision maker will issue a certificate of exemption or no-loss, request that the enforcement authority rescind the cease and desist order, and notify the soil and water conservation district, the department, and the landowner.

If the application is denied, the decision-maker shall immediately notify the soil and water conservation district, the department, the enforcement authority, and the landowner.

C.	Restoration and replacement orders: The enforcement authority will issue a restoration order or replacement order when the drain or fill has already been completed when discovered, or after a cease and deist order has been issued and the landowner does not seek an exemption or no-loss determination within three weeks, or the City of St. Augusta denies the application.

Promptly upon being informed by the enforcement authority of the need, the soil and water conservation district staff person shall inspect the site and prepare a plan in consultation with the City of St. Augusta for restoring the site to its prealtered condition, unless the soil and water conservation district person concludes that restoration is impossible. The soil and water conservation district shall incorporate its plan into a restoration or replacement order and send it to the enforcement authority for service in person or by certified mail to the landowner.

The restoration order will specify a date by which the andowner must either:

1.	Restore the wetland according to the soil and water conservation district plan and obtain a certificate of satisfactory restoration from the soil and water conservation district; or
 
-



2.	Submit a replacement plan to the City of St. Augusta.

The order will  state that it will be canceled when the landowner obtains a certificate of exemption or no-loss from the City of St. Augusta or a certificate that restoration has been completed according to  an approved restoration plan. Otherwise , the landowner must restore the wetland in the manner required by the restoration order .

If the soil and water conservation district determines that restoration will not restore all the loss caused by the drain or fill activity, the enforcement authority may order a combination of restoration and replacement, or  may  order replacement rather than restoration, as determined by the soil and water conservation district. The order will direct the landowner to obtain replacement plan approval from the City of St. Augusta. The order must specify that if replacement plan approval is not obtained, the l ndowner must restore the wetland in a manner determined by the soil and water conservation district.

Each cease and desist, restoration, and replacement order will tell the landowner that violation of the order is a misdemeanor .

If, as part of a misdemeanor proceeding, the court orders restoration or replacement, the soil and water conservation district will determine which is appropriate, and if it is restoration, the method of restoration. If the court orders replacement, the landowner must follow the replacement plan process in this Section unless the court orders otherwise.



65.13	: MINING: Wetlands may not be drained or filled as part of a project for which a permit to mine is required by Minnesota Statutes, section 93.481 or by the City of St. Augusta City Code. Draining or filling of wetlands created . by pits, stockpiles or tailing basins by actions whose purpose was not to create the wetland may be exempt. The landowner must contact the City of St. Augusta to verify this exemption.



65.14	:	STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATING WETLAND REPLACEMENT  PLANS:

A        Procedures:

1.	General: No person shall drain or fill a wetland, wholly or partially, without first having a wetland value replacement plan approved by the City Council of the City of St. Augusta consistent with this Section  and provided that the activity is not prohibited under the special considerations provisions in Subd. 65.14.D.9.
 
-



2.	Preapplication conference and site visit: Before preparation of a wetland value replacement plan, the landowner must meet with the City of  St. Augusta for a preapplication conference and site visit. A landowner  may submit the sequencing  information required in Subd. 65. 14.B and request a determination of compliance with the sequencing requirements from the City of St. Augusta before preparing a replacement plan.

3.	Evaluation: Technical questions concerning the public value, location, size, and type of wetland shall be submitted to the technical evaluation panel. Wetland boundaries must be determined using the methodologies in the federal Manual for Identifying and Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands (January 1989).

Wetland type must be identified according . to Cowardin, et al. 1979, Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats  of the  United States and according to United States Fish and Wildlife Service Circular No. 39 (1971 edition) 'Wetlands of the United States." The technical evaluation panel will provide its determinations to the City of St. Augusta for consideration.

B.	Sequencing:

1.	Requirement: Except for wetlands located in cultivated fields that are subject to Subd. 65.14.8.8, and calcareous fens that are subject to Subd. 65.14.8.9, the City of St. Augusta will not consider or approve a wetland replacement plan unless the City of St. Augusta finds that the applicant has demonstrated that the activity impacting a wetland has complied with all of the following principles in descending order or priority:

a.	avoids direct or indirect impacts to the wetland that may destroy or diminish the wetland under the criteria in Subd. 65.14.8.3;

b.	minimizes the impact to the wetland by limiting the degree or magnitude of the wetland activity and its implementation under the criteria in Subd. 65.14.B.4;

c.	rectifies the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected wetland under the criteria in Subd. 65.14.8 .6;

d.	reduces or eliminates the impact to the wetland over time by preservation and maintenance operations under the criteria in Subd. 65.14.8.6; and
 
-

e.	replaces unavoidable impacts to the wetland by restoring or creating substitute wetland areas having equal or greater public value as provided for in this Section.

2.	Application options: An applicant may either submit the information required for sequencing analysis as part of the application for replacement plan approval or apply for a preliminary sequencing determination from the City of St. Augusta before preparing a replacement plan. The City of St. Augusta	may request additional information needed to make a determination.	For projects impacting wetland areas less than 0.1 acres, the City of St. Augusta may provide an on-site sequencing determination without written documentation from the applicant.

3.	Determination of impact avoidance :

a.	Avoidance  will   be   required   when   indicated   by   special considerations as stated in this Section.

b.	Wetland dependence determination:

(i)	Based on information provided by the applicant, the City of St. Augusta will determine if the .proposed project is wetland dependent.		A project is wetland dependent if wetland features, functions , or values are essential to fulfill the basic purpose of the project. A wetland present at the site of a proposed	project does not make that project wetland dependent.

(ii)	A  project  that  has  been  determined  by  the  City  of  St.
Augusta  to  be  wetland  dependent  is  exempt  from  the analysis of avoidance alternatives in Subd. 65.14.B.3.c.

c.	Alternative  analysis:

(i)	The applicant shall provide the City of St. Augusta with documentation describing at least two alternatives in addition to the proposed project, one of .which may be the no-build alternative, that would avoid impacts to wetlands. The alternatives may include consideration of alternate sites or alternative project configurations on the proposed site. The alternatives must be judged by the City of St. Augusta as good faith efforts, or the City of St. Augusta will require the applicant to redraft them for reconsideration .
 
-

(ii)	The City of St. Augusta will determine whether any feasible and prudent alternatives are available that would avoid impacts to wetlands . An alternative will be considered feasible and prudent if it is capable of being done from an engineering point of view, is in accordance with accepted engineering standards and practices, is consistent with reasonable requirements of the public health, safety, and welfare, is an environmentally preferable alternative based on a review of social, economic, and environmental impacts, and would create no truly unusual problems. The City of St. Augusta will consider the following in evaluating alternatives as applicable:

(a)	whether the basic project purpose can be reasonably accomplished using one or more other sites in the same general area that would avoid wetland impacts. An	alternate site will not be excluded from consideration only because it includes or requires an area not owned by the applicant that could reasonably be obtained , used, expanded, or managed to fulfill the basic purpose of the proposed project;

(b)	the general suitability of alternate sites considered by the applicant;

(c)	whether reasonable modification of the size, scope configuration,  or  density  of  the  project  would  avoid impacts to wetlands;

(d)	efforts by the applicant to accommodate or remove constraints		on alternatives imposed by zoning standards	or infrastructure, including request for conditional use permits,  variances, or planned unit developments; and

(e)	the physical, economic and demographic requirements of the project. Economic considerations alone do not make an alternative not feasible and prudent.

(iii)	If the City of St. Augusta determines that a feasible and prudent	alternative exists that would avoid impacts to wetlands, it will deny the replacement plan. If no feasible and prudent alternative is available that would avoid impacts to  wetlands,  the  City  of  St.  Augusta  will  evaluate  the
 
-

replacement  plan for compliance with Subd. 65.14.B.4 to Subd. 65.14.B.6.

4.	Determination of impact minimization:

a.	The applicant shall demonstrate to the City of  St.  Augusta satisfaction that the activity will minimize impacts to wetlands. In reviewing the sufficiency of the applicant's efforts to minimize wetland impacts, the City of St. Augusta will consider:

(i)	the spatial requirements of the project;

(ii)	the location of existing structural or natural features that may dictate the placement or configuration of the project;

(iii)	the purpose of the project and how the purpose relates to placement, configuration, or density;

(iv)	the sensitivity of the site design to the natural features of the site,	including topography, . hydrology and existing vegetation ;

(v)	the value, function,  and spatial  distribution  of the wetlands on the site;                                                                   ·

(vi)	individual and cumulative impacts; and

(vii)	an applicant's efforts to:

(a)	modify the size, scope, configuration, or density of the project;

(b)	remove  or  accommodate   site  constraints   including zoning, infrastructure, access, or natural features ; and

(c)	otherwise minimize impacts.

b.	If the City of St. Augusta finds that an applicant has not complied with the requirements to minimize wetland impacts, the City of St. Augusta will list, in writing, its objections to the project. If, within 30 days, the applicant does not withdraw the project proposal or indicate intent to submit an amended project proposal satisfying the City of St. Augusta's objections, the statement of objections shall constitute a denial.
 
-

5.	Determination of impact rectification: Temporary  impacts to  a wetland must be rectified by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected wetland:

a.	Activities may qualify for a no-loss determination in Subd. 65.07 by meeting all of the following conditions:

(i)	the physical characteristics of the affected wetland, including ground	elevations, contours, inlet dimensions, outlet dimensions, substrate,  and hydrologic regime,  are restored to preproject conditions sufficient to ensure that all preproject functions and values are restored;

(ii)	the activity is completed and the physical characteristics of the wetland are restored within six months of the start of the activity; and

(iii)	the party responsible for the activity provides a performance bond to the City of St. Augusta. for an amount  sufficient to cover the estimated cost to restore the wetland to preproject conditions.	The City of St. Augusta will return the performance	bond to the responsible party upon a determination by the City of St. Augusta that the conditions in this item and item b. have been met.

b.	An applicant shall be granted a no-loss determination under the criteria in item a. once in a ten-year ·period for a particular site within a wetland, except that repairs to the original project shall be allowed under the no-loss determination, if the City of St. Augusta determines the request to be necessary and reasonable.

c.	Wetland impacts that do not qualify for a no-loss determination according to the criteria in item a. are subject to replacement under the criteria in 65.14.C to I.

6.	Determination of reduction or elimination of impacts  over time. After  an activity is completed, further wetland impacts from the draining or filling must be reduced or eliminated by maintaining, operating, and managing the project in a manner that preserves and maintains remaining wetland functions and values. The City of St. Augusta will require applicants to implement best management practices to protect wetland functions and values.
 
-


7.	Unavoidable impacts: Unavoidable wetland impacts that remain  after efforts to minimize, rectify, or reduce or eliminate them must be replaced according to 65.14.B to I.

8.	Wetlands on cultivated fields: If the wetland is located on a cultivated field, replacement must be accomplished through restoration  without regard to the priority order in 65.14.8.1. A wetland drained or filled under this provision must not be converted to nonagricultural land for ten years. The landowner must execute and record a notice of this requirement in the office of the county recorder for Wright County.

9.	Calcareous fens: Calcareous fens,  as  identified  by  the  commissioner, may not be filled, drained, or otherwise degraded, wholly or partially, by any action, unless the commissioner, under an  approved  management plan, decides some alteration is necessary, as provided in this Section.

C.	Replacement Plan Components:

On an application form provided by the City of St.  Augusta and with needed attachments supplied by the applicant, the following documentation must be provided, except that for replacement plans utilizing the wetland bank in Subd. 65.15, items 2 and 4 do not apply; instead the applicant shall submit the credit transfer form prescribed in Subd. 65.15.E.2.e:

The  applicant  must  demonstrate  to  the  City  of  St.  Augusta  that  the replacement plan complies with this part and Subd. 65.14.E.

2.	Type of replacement: The order of preference for the method of replacement, from most preferred to least preferred, is project-specific restoration, project-specific creation, then wetland banking. Modification or conversion of nondegraded wetlands from one wetland type to another, for example by impoundment of additional water, does not constitute adequate replacement.

Wetlands drained or filled under an exemption may not be restored for replacement credit for ten years after draining or filling.

3.	Timing of replacement: Replacement of wetland values must be completed before or concurrent with the actual draining or filling of a wetland, unless an irrevocable bank letter of credit is submitted to the City of St. Augusta to guarantee successful completion of the replacement. All wetlands to be restored or created for replacement must be designated for replacement before restoration or creation. Submission to the City of St. Augusta of the information required in Subd. 65.14. C and subsequent approval shall be considered evidence of designation for replacement, provided the information is submitted before the actual restoration or creation.

4.	Location of replacement wetlands: Replacement wetlands must be located within the same watershed or county as the impacted wetlands.

5.	Statewide replacement for public transportation projects: Wetlands impacted by public transportation projects may be replaced statewide, provided they are approved by the commissioner under an established wetland banking system or under this Section.

6.	Size of replacement wetlands: Replacement wetlands must be of a size sufficient to ensure that they provide equal or greater public value than the wetland	that was drained or filled. For a wetland located on nonagricultural land, the minimum  size of the replacement wetland must be. in the ratio of two acres of replaced wetland for each acre of drained or
 
-


filled wetland. For a wetland located on agricultural land, the  minimum size of the replacement wetland must be in the ratio of one acre  of replaced wetland for each acre of drained or filled wetland. The actual replacement ratios required for a replacement wetland may be more than the minimum, subject to the evaluation of wetland functions and values. A review by the City of St. Augusta will determine the actual required replacement ratios.   Future owners may make no use of the wetland after it is altered, other than as agricultural land for a period of ten years unless future replacement to achieve a 2: 1 ratio occurs. The landowner shall record a notice of this restriction in the office of the Stearns County recorder.

7.	Carbon balance: When it is necessary to replace a drained or filled peatland, the replacement wetland must be revegetated with planted or naturally invading vegetation established within three growing seasons.

8.	Ecological consistency: Restoration and replacement of wetlands must be accomplished according to the ecology of the landscape area affected. A replacement plan that would result in wetlands or wetland characteristics that do not naturally occur in the landscape area in which the replacement will occur will not be approved.

9.	Special considerations: The factors in items a. to i., when identified as being applicable to an impact site or a replacement site, will be considered by the City of St. Augusta in the review of replacement plans.

a.	Federal or state-listed endangered species: A replacement plan for activities that involve sites where federal or state-listed endangered species are known to be present will not be approved if it is determined that the proposed activities will constitute a taking of those listed species under Minnesota Statutes, section 84.0895. Limited information on the presence of listed species at a particular site is available from the department's natural heritage program. Activities that involve taking listed species are subject to Minnesota Statutes, section 84.0895.

b.	Rare natural communities: A replacement plan for activities that involve the modification of a rare natural community as determined by the department's natural heritage program will not be approved if the City of St. Augusta determines that the proposed activities will permanently adversely affect the natural community.

c.	Special fish and wildlife resources: A replacement plan for activities that  would  have  a  significant  adverse  impact  that  cannot  be
 
-


mitigated on a special or locally significant fish and wildlife resource will not be approved.  These activities include, but are not limited to:

(i)	fish passage and spawning areas;
(ii)	colonial waterbird nesting colonies;
(iii)	migratory waterfowl concentration areas;
(iv)	deer wintering areas; and/or
(v)	wildlife travel corridors.

Activities  involving  streams  must  not  block  fish  passage  unless approved by the department.

d.	Archaeological or historic sites: A replacement plan for activities that  involve the modification of known archaeological or historical sites on or eligible for the  National Register of Historic Places, as designated  by  the  state  historic  preservation  officer,  will  not  be approved  if the City  of St. Augusta  determines  that the proposed activities	will have a    significant    adverse    impact    on    the archaeological or historical value of the site.

e.	Groundwater sensitivity: A replacement' plan for activities will not be approved if the City of St. Augusta determines the activities would have a significant adverse impact on groundwater quality. The publication	"Criteria and Guidelines for Assessing Geologic Sensitivity of Ground Water Resources in Minnesota"  (MDNR, 1991) may be used as a guide in determining potential impacts.

f.	Sensitive surface waters:   A replacement plan will not be approved if the City of St. Augusta determines the activities will have a significant adverse impact on the water quality of outstanding resource value waters or on trout waters designated by the commissioner .

g.	Education or research use: Wetlands known to be used for educational	or research purposes must be maintained or adequately  replaced.

h.	Waste disposal sites: The City of St. Augusta will evaluate the type and amount of waste material found at the site. Activities involving known or potential hazardous wastes or contaminants must be conducted according to applicable federal and state standards.

i.	Consistency with other plans: The City.of St. Augusta will consider the  extent  to which  proposed  activities  are  consistent  with  other

e.	Groundwater sensitivity: A replacement plan for activities will not be approved if the City of St. Augusta determines the activities would have a significant adverse impact on groundwater quality. The publication	"Criteria and Guidelines for Assessing Geologic Sensitivity of Ground Water Resources in Minnesota" (MDNR, 1991) may be used as a guide in determining potential impacts.

f.	Sensitive surface waters:   A replacement plan will not be approved if the City of St. Augusta determines the activities will have a significant adverse impact on the water quality of outstanding resource value waters or on trout waters designated by the commissioner .

g.	Education or research use: Wetlands known to be used for educational	or research purposes must be maintained or adequately  replaced.

h.	Waste disposal sites: The City of St. Augusta will evaluate the type and amount of waste material found at the site. Activities involving known or potential hazardous wastes or contaminants must be conducted according to applicable federal and state standards.

-


plans,  such  as  watershed  management  plans,  land  use  plans, zoning, and master plans.

10.	Evaluation of wetland functions and values:

a.	Evaluation options : Replacement wetlands must replace the functions and values that are lost from a wetland that is drained or filled. A replacement wetland should replace the same combination of functions and values provided by the impacted wetland. The evaluation of wetlands  shall be performed  in accordance  with part
8420.540  of  the  Board  of  Water  and  Soil  Resources  Wetland Conservation Act Rules (August, 1993).

E.	Wetland Replacement Standards :

1.	General requirements: The standards and guidelines in this part shall be used in wetland creation and restoration efforts to ensure adequate replacement of wetland functions and values .

2.	Specific requirements:  The standards in items a. to h. shall be followed in all wetland replacements unless the technical evaluation panel determines  . that a standard is clearly not appropriate.	·

a.	Water control structures must be constructed using specifications provided in the Minnesota Wetland Restoration Guide or their equivalent.	Control structures may be subject to the department dam safety regulations.

b.	Best management practices must be established and maintained adjacent to the entire perimeter of all replacement wetlands.

c.	For replacement wetlands where the dominant vegetation of the wetland type identified as the replacement goal is not likely to recover naturally in a five-year period, wooded and shrub wetlands especially, the replacement wetland must be seeded or planted with appropriate species, as determined by the soil and water conservation district, in coordination with the department. If the replacement wetland is seeded or planted, the seed or planting stock should be of local wetland origin to preserve local genotypes. During the monitoring period, the applicant must take reasonable steps to prevent invasion by any species, for example, purpose loosestrife	and Eurasian water milfoil, that would defeat the revegetation goal of the replacement plan.
 
-


	d.	Erosion control measures as determined by the soil and water conservation district must be employed during  construction  and until permanent ground cover is established to prevent siltation of the replacement wetland or nearby water bodies.
	
e.	
For all restored wetlands where the original organic  substrate  has been stripped away and for  all created wetlands,  provisions must
		be made for providing an organic substrate.	When feasible, the
		organic soil used for backfill should be taken from the drained or
		filled wetland.
	
f.	
The bottom contours of created types 3, 4, and 5 wetlands shall be undulating, rather than flat, to provide a variety of water depths.
	
g.	
Side  slopes  of  created  wetlands  and  buffer  strip  must  not  be
		steeper than 5:1, five feet  horizontally for every one foot vertically
as averaged around the wetland.	Side slopes of 1O:1 to 15:1 are preferred.
	
h.	
Created wetlands shall have an irregular edge to create points and bays.
