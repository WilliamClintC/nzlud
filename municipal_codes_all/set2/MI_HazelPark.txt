HAZEL PARK MUNICIPAL CODE 1976 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances 
of the City of Hazel Park, Michigan 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 10, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Hazel Park, Michigan Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1976, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 10, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Raymond Retrauskas, city attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 10, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 03-18, passed January 16, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 10, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 10, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 10, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 10, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 10, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

SECTION 11.2. 
When the Council shall propose to make any public improvement, any part of the cost of which is to be defrayed by special assessment, it shall refer the matter to the City Manager who shall prepare or cause to be prepared plans showing the improvement and the location thereof, and an estimate of the cost thereof. Upon receipt of such plans and estimate the Council shall order the same to be filed with the City Clerk and if it shall desire to proceed with the improvement it shall by resolution declare its intention to make such public improvement and shall designate the special assessment district and what part or proportion of the cost of said improvement shall be made by special assessment against the lots and parcels of land in said special assessment district and what part, if any, shall be paid from the general funds of the city. The Council shall also fix a time and place when it will meet and hear any objections to such improvement and to the special assessment district, and shall cause notice of such hearing to be given by publication thereof twice prior to such hearing in a newspaper circulating in the city, the first publication to be at least one week prior to the time of such hearing. Such notice shall state that the plans and estimate are on file with the City Clerk and shall contain a description of the proposed assessment district. At the time of such hearing, or any adjournment thereof, which may be without further notice, the Council shall hear any objections to such improvement and to the special assessment district, and may without further notice, revise, correct, amend or change the plans, estimate and/or district, provided that no property shall be added to the district until notice be given as above provided or by personal service upon the owners thereof, and a hearing afforded such owners. The Council, in order to ascertain whether or not a reasonable number of property owners to be assessed desire a public improvement to be made under the provisions of this chapter, may request that a petition therefor be presented to it but in event a petition be so filed it shall be advisory only and shall not be jurisdictional.

SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ROLL 

SECTION 11.3. 
After the hearing provided for in the preceding section, if the Council desires to proceed with such improvement it shall by resolution determine to make such improvement and shall approve said plans and estimate as originally presented or as revised, corrected, amended or changed. The Council shall also direct the City Assessor to make a special assessment roll in which shall be entered and described all the lots and parcels of land to be assessed, with the names of the respective owners thereof, if known, and the amount to be assessed against each such lot or parcel of land, which amount shall be such relative portion of the whole sum to be levied against all the lots and parcels of land in the special assessment district as the benefit to such lot or parcel of land bears to the total benefits to all lots and parcels of land in the special assessment district. There shall also be entered upon said roll the amount which has been assessed to the city at large. When the City Assessor shall have completed the assessment roll, he/she shall affix thereto a certificate stating that it was made pursuant to a resolution of the Council of said city adopted on a specified date and that in making such assessment roll he/she has, according to his/her best judgment, conformed in all respects to the directions contained in such resolution and to the charter of the city.

SECTION 11.5. 
When any lot, building, or structure within the city, because of accumulation of refuse or debris, the uncontrolled growing of weeds, or age or dilapidation, or because of any other condition or happening, becomes in the opinion of the Council a public hazard or nuisance which is dangerous to the health or safety of the inhabitants of the city or of those of them residing or habitually going near such lot, building, or structure, the Council may, after investigation give notice to the owner of the land upon which such nuisance exists, or to the owner of the building or structure itself, specifying the nature of the nuisance and requiring such owner to alter, repair, tear down, or remove the nuisance promptly and within a time to be specified by the Council which shall be commensurate with the nature of the nuisance. If, at the expiration of the time limit in said notice, said owner has not complied with the requirements thereof, or in any case where the owner of the land or of the building or structure itself is not known, the Council may order such hazard or nuisance abated by the proper department or agency of the city which is qualified to do the work required and the cost of such abatement assessed against the lot, premises, or description of real property upon which such hazard or nuisance was located.

INSTALLMENTS 

SECTION 11.9. 
Special assessments shall be payable in one installment or in such number of approximately equal annual installments not exceeding ten (10) as the Council may determine. The amount of each installment (if more than one) need not be extended upon the special assessment roll until after confirmation. The first installment of a special assessment shall be due on or before such time after confirmation as the Council shall fix, and the several subsequent installments shall be due at intervals of twelve (12) months from the due date of the first installment. All unpaid installments prior to their transfer to the city tax roll, shall bear interest, payable annually, at a rate to be fixed by the Council not exceeding six percent (6%) per annum from the date the first installment becomes due. The whole assessment against any lot or parcel of land may be paid to the City Treasurer at any time in full with interest and penalties accrued to the date of such payment. If any installment of a special assessment is not paid when due, then the same shall be deemed to be delinquent and there shall be collected thereon, in addition to interest as above provided, a penalty at the rate of one-half of one percent (1/2 of 1%) for each month or fraction thereof that the same remains unpaid before being reported to the Council for reassessment upon the city tax roll.

(ft.nt.- For statutory provisions on the payment of special assessments, see MCL § 211.53; for provisions authorizing cities to provide by charter for the assessment of the costs of public improvements to special districts, see MCL § 117.4d(1).) 
SECTION 11.10. 
All special assessments contained in any special assessment roll, including any part thereof deferred as to payment, shall from the date of the confirmation of such roll, constitute a lien upon the respective lots or parcels of land assessed and until paid shall be a charge against the respective owners of the several lots and parcels of land. Such lien shall be of the same character and effect as the lien created for city taxes and shall include accrued interest and penalties. No judgment or decree, nor any act of the Council vacating a special assessment, shall destroy or impair the lien of the city upon the premises assessed, for such amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against the same, or as by a regular mode of proceeding might be lawfully assessed thereon.

APPORTIONMENT OF LIEN 

SECTION 11.11.

The report of such apportionment when confirmed shall be conclusive upon all parties, provided that before such confirmation, notice of hearing shall be given to all the interested parties either by personal service or by publication as above provided in case of an original assessment roll.

ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS, REFUNDS 

SECTION 11.12. 
Should the assessments in any special assessment roll prove insufficient for any reason, including the non-collection thereof, to pay for the improvement for which they were made or to pay the principal and interest on the bonds issued in anticipation of the collection of such assessments, then the Council shall make additional pro rata assessments to supply the deficiency, but the total amount assessed against any lot or parcel of land shall not exceed the value of the benefits received from the improvement. Should the amount collected on assessments prove larger than necessary by five percent (5%) or less of the amount of the original roll, the Council may place the excess in any of the funds of the city, but if such excess shall exceed such five percent (5%), then the same shall be refunded pro rata to the several owners of the lots and parcels of land in the special assessment district at the time of the passage of the resolution ordering such refund, in accordance with the amount paid by each such owner or his/her predecessor in title.

VALIDITY 

SECTION 11.13. 
Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the Council, be invalid by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be illegal, the Council shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or whether any part of the assessment has been paid or not, have power to cause a new assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was made. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be conducted in the same manner as provided for the original assessment, and whenever the assessment, or any part thereof, levied upon any premises has been so set aside, if the same has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made shall be applied upon the reassessment and the reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied.

COLLECTION 

SECTION 11.14.

The City Clerk shall thereupon deliver to the City Treasurer said special assessment roll to which he/she shall attach his/her warrant commanding the City Treasurer to collect from each of the persons assessed in said roll the amount of money assessed to and set opposite his/her name therein, and in case any such person shall neglect or refuse to pay his/her assessment, or any part thereof, upon demand after the same has become due, then to levy and collect the same by distress and sale of the goods and chattels of such person. Said warrant shall further require the City Treasurer on the first day of May following the date when any such assessments, or any part thereof, have become due, to submit to the Council a sworn statement setting forth the names of the persons delinquent, if known, a description of the lots and parcels of land upon which there are delinquent assessments, and the amount of such delinquency, including accrued interest and penalties computed to May first of such year.

In case the Treasurer, pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.14, shall report as delinquent any assessment or part thereof, the Council shall certify the same to the Assessor who shall reassess on the next annual city tax roll in a column headed special assessments, the sum so delinquent with interest and penalty to May first of such year and an additional penalty of three percent (3%) of such total amount, and when so reassessed upon said tax roll shall be collected in all respects as provided for the collection of city taxes, except from and after the 31st day of July of the year of such reassessment and until March first of the following year, there shall be added a penalty of one percent (1%) for each month or fraction thereof that the same remains unpaid.

COURT PROCEDURE 

SECTION 11.17. 
In addition to any other remedies and without impairing the lien therefor, any delinquent special assessment together with interest and penalties may be collected in an action of assumpsit in the name of the city against the person assessed, in any court having jurisdiction of the amount. If in any such action it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities or informalities the assessment has not been properly made against the defendant or upon the premises sought to be charged, the court may, nevertheless, on satisfactory proof that expense has been incurred by the city, which is a proper charge against the defendant or the premises in question, render judgment for the amount properly chargeable against such defendant or upon such premises.

B.  In an action in which the court may place the defendant on probation, the court may delay sentencing the defendant for not more than one year to give the defendant an opportunity to prove to the court his or her eligibility for probation or other leniency compatible with the ends of justice and the defendant's rehabilitation, such as participation in a drug treatment court under M.C.L. 600.1060 to 600.1082. When sentencing is delayed, the court shall enter an order stating the reason for the delay upon the court's records. The delay in passing sentence does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to sentence the defendant at any time during the period of delay. 
C.  If a defendant is before the court and the court delays imposing sentence under subsection B of this section, the court shall include in the delayed sentence order that the department of corrections shall collect a supervision fee of not more than one hundred thirty-five dollars ($135.00) multiplied by the number of months of delay ordered, but not more than twelve (12) months. The fee is payable when the delayed sentence order is entered, but the fee may be paid in monthly installment if the court approves installment payments for the defendant. In determining the amount of the fee, the court shall consider the defendant's projected income and financial resources. The court shall use the following table of projected monthly income in determining the amount of the fee to be ordered: 
Projected Monthly Income Amount of Fee $ 0-249.99 $ 0 250.00-499.99 10.00 500.00-749.99 25.00 750.00-999.99 40.00 1,000.00 or more 5% of projected monthly income but not more than $135.00  
    The court may order a higher amount than indicated by the table, up to the maximum of one hundred thirty-five dollars ($135.00) multiplied by the number of months of delay ordered but not more than twelve (12) months, if the court determines that the defendant has sufficient assets or other financial resources to warrant the higher amount. If the court orders a higher amount, the amount and the reasons for ordering that amount shall be stated in the court order. The fee shall be collected as provided in Section 25a of the Corrections Code of 1953, 1953 PA 232, M.C.L. 791.225a. A person shall not be subject to more than one supervision fee at the same time.

1.  The city's annual appropriation for members' current service shall be a percent of their annual compensations which will be an amount which if paid annually by the city during their future service will be sufficient to provide the pension reserves at the time of their retirements for the city-financed portions of the pensions to be paid them based upon their future service. 
2.  The city's annual appropriation for members' accrued service shall be a percent of their annual compensations which will be an amount which if paid annually by the city over a period of years, to be determined by the board, will amortize at regular interest the unfunded pension reserves, if any, for the accrued service portions of the pensions to be paid them upon their retirements. 
3.  The city's annual appropriation for pensions being paid retirants and beneficiaries shall be a percent of the annual compensations of members which will be an amount which if paid annually by the city over a period of years, to be determined by the board, will amortize at regular interest the unfunded pension reserves, if any, for pensions being paid retirants and beneficiaries.

The board shall have full power to hold, sell, purchase, assign, transfer and dispose of any securities and investments in which any moneys of the system have been invested, as well as the proceeds of the investments and any moneys belonging to the system. There shall be kept on deposit available cash not to exceed five percent of the total assets of the system. 
B.  All assets of the retirement system shall be held for the sole purpose of meeting disbursements authorized by this chapter and shall be used for no other purpose.

There shall be paid from the income fund all investment expense and all amounts required to credit regular interest to the funds of the system as provided in this chapter. Whenever the balance in the income fund is more than sufficient to cover current charges to the fund, such excess amount, or any part thereof, may be used to provide contingency reserves or to meet special requirements of the other funds of the system as the board shall determine. Whenever the balance in the income fund is insufficient to meet the charges to the fund the amount of the insufficiency shall be transferred from the pension reserve fund to the income fund. A member's accumulated contributions transferred from the members' deposit fund to the income fund may be paid from the income fund upon proper claim for same approved by the board. 
B.  The board shall, at the end of each fiscal year, allow and credit regular interest to each member's individual account in the members' savings fund; such interest to be computed on the member's balance at the beginning of the fiscal year after deducting any withdrawal of accumulated contributions made by him or her during the year.

(Ord. 445 § 37, 1968) 
Chapter 2.100 - 1989 RETIREMENT PLAN 
Sections: 

2.100.010 - Amendment of the retirement ordinance and trust. 
A.  Pursuant to city ordinance (the "retirement ordinance"), the city of Hazel Park ("city") established the Hazel Park employee retirement system ("retirement system") effective July 1, 1945. It has been maintained continuously since then, subject to certain amendments. The city now wishes to amend and restate the retirement ordinance in order to comply with changes in applicable federal income tax laws relating to qualified defined benefit plans and trusts, and in order to generally improve the retirement system. 
    The retirement ordinance is therefore amended and restated in its entirety as hereinafter set forth. The provisions of the amended and restated retirement ordinance shall be effective as of July 1, 1989 except as otherwise specified herein. If a participant (or person claiming a benefit with respect to a participant) terminated employment, died, became disabled, or otherwise became entitled to a benefit prior to July 1, 1989 (or other applicable effective date), benefits under the retirement system shall be determined and paid in accordance with the retirement ordinance as in effect as of the date the termination of employment, death, disability, or other benefit entitlement occurred. 
B.  The city hereby amends and restates its defined benefit pension plan and trust previously known as the "1968 retirement plan," which effective July 1, 1989 shall be known as the 1989 retirement plan (the "retirement ordinance"). This retirement ordinance is intended to be a qualified plan and trust pursuant to Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code") as such rules apply to "governmental plans" (as defined at Section 414(d) of the Code.). 
    Notwithstanding the general effective date, this restated 1989 plan was not adopted by city council until February 28, 1994. Thus, while the tax qualification provisions of the amended and restated retirement ordinance are generally effective July 1, 1989, the non-tax qualification design changes, specifically deletion of the workers' compensation offset provision of the 1968 plan, should be and hereby is prospective on February 28, 1994, the date of effective adoption of the amended and restated plan by the city council. General coverage plan participants who seek to redeem workers' compensation benefits and who terminate employment prior to February 28, 1994 will be subject to the workers' compensation offset of the 1968 plan. 
    Neither the amended and restated retirement ordinance nor any subsequent amendment shall diminish or impair any participant's accrued financial benefits (in violation of Article 9, Section 24 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, as amended) under the retirement ordinance as constituted prior to such amendment and restatement (or subsequent amendment). If at any time it shall appear that this restated retirement ordinance (or a subsequent amendment) would diminish or impair benefits contrary to the preceding sentence, the board of trustees shall construe the terms of this amended and restated ordinance to achieve, as nearly as possible, the same result as would have occurred under the retirement ordinance prior to amendment and restatement (or subsequent amendment). 
(Ord. 17-02 § 3 (part), 2002: Ord. 865 (part), 1994)

C.  "Beneficiary" means any person or persons designated as such by the participant on a form supplied by the board to receive benefits payable under the provisions of Section 2.100.290 of this chapter.

The determination by the board of the identity of such person or persons shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, and the board and the retirement system shall be fully protected and shall incur no liability regardless of any error that it may make in such determination.

2.100.200 - Re-evaluation of disability retired participant-Termination of pension. 
A.  The board of trustees may require a disability retired participant to undergo a medical evaluation or other re-evaluation by a medical examiner satisfactory to the board not more frequently than once a year, at the retirement system's expense, or to submit acceptable evidence of continuation of disability, if the participant has not met the age requirement for normal retirement as specified in the coverage plan applicable to the participant. Therefore, the participant shall have no claim of physician patient privilege with respect to the medical evaluation. The medical evaluation requested by the board of trustees shall not be for the purpose of obtaining information in order that the medical examiner/physician be able to render medical advice or treatment on behalf of the participant. The medical evaluation shall be for the express purpose of determining initial and/or continuing eligibility for a disability pension benefit as a participant in the retirement system. Medical examinations or other re-evaluations not specifically required by the board of trustees shall be solely at the retired participant's expense. 
B.  The board of trustees may suspend payment of a disability pension if the disability retired participant refuses to submit to re-evaluation. If the refusal continues for one year, the board of trustees may, at the board's discretion, terminate the disability retirement pension and revoke the disability retired participant's right to the disability retirement pension. 
C.  A disability pension shall be terminated if the medical examiner reports that the disability retired participant is capable of resuming the participant's duties of employment with the city. A former disability retired participant who returns to the employ of the city shall again be a participant, and credited service at time of disability retirement shall be restored to the participant' s credit. Credited service shall not be granted for the period of disability retirement unless the board of trustees has found the disability to have been the natural and proximate result of causes arising out of and in the course of the participant's employment by the city. 
(Ord. 17-02 § 3 (part), 2002: Ord. 865 (part), 1994) 
2.100.210 - Disability retired participant-Earnings from gainful employment. 
A.  The provisions of this section apply only to a disability retired participant who has not met the age requirement for normal retirement. The amount of a disability pension shall not exceed the difference between (i) one hundred percent (100%) of the retired participant's annual base rate of compensation at the time of disability increased proportionately for changes in the rate of compensation for the rank, grade, or position held at time of disability retirement; and (ii) the annual amount of the retired participant's considered income. The retired participant's considered income is compensation obtained as a result of the participant's own personal services but shall not include passive income, from investments, for example. As a condition of continuing eligibility for an unreduced disability pension benefit, a disability retired participant shall inform the board annually in writing on a form prescribed by the board of the annual amount of income obtained as a result of gainful employment, as described above. 
    Upon receipt of the information, the administrative committee shall determine whether an adjustment to the amount of disability pension is necessary and inform the board of trustees of its determination. In the event an adjustment is necessary, the administrative committee shall engage the actuary to recalculate the pension applying the limitation to the disabled retiree pension. Application of the limitation shall be to the amount of pension under form of payment option SL. The effect of an election of any other form of payment option shall be taken into account after application of the limitation to the amount of pension under form of payment option SL. 
B.  "Compensation" for purposes of this section shall mean the base salary or wages paid a participant for personal services rendered to the city at the time of disability. Compensation includes: 
1.  Longevity pay, shift premiums and fill-in time; 
2.  Vacation pay and holiday pay; 
3.  Cost of living payments; 
4.  Reimbursement on the annual option for sick time in excess of one hundred (100) days (or equivalent); 
5.  Base salary or wages while absent from work with pay or on account of illness; 
6.  City contributions on behalf of the participant to a deferred compensation program maintained pursuant to Section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code; 
7.  Educational premium payments. 
C.  In no event shall the amount of a retired participant's disability pension payable prior to age fifty-five (55) (or age sixty (60) in the case of a participant in the general coverage plan) be reduced below fifty percent (50%) of final average compensation. 
(Ord. 17-02 § 3 (part), 2002: Ord. 865 (part), 1994) 
2.100.220 - Workers' compensation-Police or fire participant election between workers' compensation and pension benefits. 
A.  Police or fire participants who qualify for workers' compensation benefits may totally waive receiving a disability retirement benefit under the retirement system and instead elect workers' compensation benefits as provided in Section 161 of the Workers' Disability Compensation Act of 1969, MCLA Section, 418.161, et seq. ("Workers' Compensation Act"). 
B.  A police or fire participant who elects to receive workers' compensation benefits in lieu of a disability retirement benefit shall, within ninety (90) days of becoming eligible for workers' compensation benefits, give written notice on a form prescribed by the board of trustees and filed with the retirement system administrator. The waiver shall be irrevocable until the participant reaches the age or level of service, or combination thereof, which shall allow such participant to receive a retirement benefit under the retirement ordinance not conditioned on his disability. 
C.  Upon meeting the requirements for a service-based or age- and service-based pension benefit, such a benefit shall not constitute "like benefits" under the Workers' Compensation Act. The participant need no longer choose between workers' compensation or pension benefits. However, such pension benefits shall not commence under the retirement system until the participant makes written application on a form prescribed by the board of trustees and filed with the retirement system administrator. At such time, pension benefits shall be paid on a prospective basis only, and subject to all provisions of the retirement ordinance applicable to the pension benefit in question. 
D.  Under the terms of the retirement ordinance codified in this chapter, it is intended that pension benefits be primary and workers' compensation benefits secondary such that workers' compensation benefits shall be reduced by any pension benefits payable. However, if a participant waives pension benefits under subsection A of this section, receives a lump sum redemption of workers' compensation benefits, and thereafter becomes entitled to an age- or service-based pension under subsection C of this section, such age or service pension must be coordinated with the lump sum redemption award to avoid a duplication of payments prohibited by Section 354 of the Workers' Compensation Act. 
    Therefore, the age- or service-based pension shall be reduced by the portion of a lump sum redemption relating to wage loss and applicable to the time period commencing with the age- or service-based pension, to the extent such redemption has not been reduced by reason of the age- or service-based pension to which the participant is eligible.

The contribution shall be made directly to the participant contribution fund, and credited as an accumulated participant contribution on behalf of the serving city manager. All contributions shall be made on a pre-tax basis, and excluded from the city manager's gross income in the year in which the amounts are contributed, since such contributions are being directly deposited in the retirement system in the city. 
C.

For this purpose both retroactive pay increases and longevity payments which have accrued to the participant but have yet to be paid shall be counted; provided, however, that up to twenty-four (24) days of accrued but unused sick days shall be converted, paid as compensation, and counted for purposes of final average compensation for the employee groups set forth below, subject to the effective dates described below:

    The two consecutive years of service shall be contained within the ten years of credited service immediately preceding the participant's last termination of participation.

2.100.310 - Required distribution date. 
A.  Notwithstanding anything in the retirement ordinance to the contrary, distribution of a participant's benefits hereunder shall be made or commence to be paid not later than April 1 of the year following the year in which the later of the following occurs: 
1.  The participant attains age seventy and one-half (70 1/2); or 
2.  The participant retires. 
    The later of these events shall be the participant's "required distribution date." 
B.  Benefit payments, if not made in a lump sum, may only be made over one of the following periods (or a combination thereof): 
1.  The life of the participant; 
2.  The life of the participant and a designated beneficiary as that term is defined in Section 401(a)(9)(E) of the Code; 
3.  A period certain not extending beyond the life expectancy of the participant; or 
4.  A period certain not extending beyond the joint and last survivor expectancy of the participant and a designated beneficiary. 
    If the participant's entire interest is to be distributed in a manner other than a lump sum, then the amount to be distributed each year must be at least an amount equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the participant's entire interest by the life expectancy of the participant or joint and last survivor expectancy of the participant and designated beneficiary. Life expectancy and joint and last survivor expectancy are computed by the use of the return multiples contained in Treasury Regulation Section 1.72-9. For purposes of this computation, a participant's life or a participant's and spouse's expectancy may be recalculated no more frequently than annually; however, the life expectancy of a non-spouse beneficiary may not be recalculated. If the participant's spouse is not the designated beneficiary, the method of benefit payment selected must assure that at least fifty (50) percent of the present value of the amount available for distribution is paid within the life expectancy of the participant. Effective October 1, 2005, if the participant's spouse is not the designated beneficiary, the method of payment selected must assure that the periodic annuity payable to the designated beneficiary must not at any time on or after the participant's required beginning date, as defined in the applicable Treasury Regulations exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment payable to the participant using the table prescribed in the applicable provisions of Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6. 
C.  Upon the death of a participant, the following benefit payment provisions shall apply: 
1.  If the participant dies after distribution of his interest has commenced, the remaining portion of such interest will continue to be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used prior to the participant's death. 
2.  If the participant dies before distribution of his interest commences, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death except to the extent that an election is made to receive distributions in accordance with: 
a.  If any portion of the participant's interest is payable to a designated beneficiary, distributions may be made in substantially equal installments over the life or life expectancy of the designated beneficiary commencing on or before December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant's death occurs; or 
b.  If the designated beneficiary is the participant's surviving spouse, the date distributions are required to begin in accordance with subsection (C)(1) of this section shall not be earlier than the December 31 of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age seventy and one-half (70 1/2), and if the spouse dies before payments begin, subsequent distributions shall be made as if the spouse had been the participant. 
3.  For purposes of subsection (C)(2) of this section, payments will be calculated by use of the return multiples specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.72-9. Life expectancy of a surviving spouse may be recalculated annually, however, in the case of any other designated beneficiary, such life expectancy will be calculated at the time payment first commences without further recalculation. 
4.  For purposes of subsections (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)(3) of this section any amount paid to a child of the participant will be treated as if it had been paid to the surviving spouse if the amount becomes payable to the surviving spouse when the child reaches the age of majority.

1.  The participant, at time of death, had fifteen (15) or more years of credited service or was age fifty-five (55) years or older and had ten or more years of credited service; and 
2.  The designated survivor pension beneficiary files written application on a form prescribed by the board of trustees for the pension with the retirement system administrator. 
    The age and service requirement is waived for participants of the firefighters and patrol officers coverage plans if the board of trustees finds the participant's death to have been the result of a personal injury or disease arising out of and in the course of the deceased participant's performance of duty in the employ of the city. 
B.  The amount of pension is the deceased participant's normal retirement pension computed in the same manner as if the participant had (a) retired the day preceding the date of death, notwithstanding that the participant might not have satisfied the age and service requirements for retirement as specified in the applicable coverage plan; and (b) elected form of payment option one hundred (100) percent JS with the spouse or children of the deceased participant as determined under subsection D of this section as the survivor pension beneficiary. For participants of the firefighters coverage plan, patrol officers coverage plan, and the fire chief, the amount of the pension is based on service credit the deceased participant would have earned had the participant lived to age fifty-five (55). 
C.

A participant may revoke such designation at any time by filing a new designation. The most recent designation received by the retirement system administrator before the participant's death shall be deemed to revoke all prior designations. A participant who is married at time of death shall be presumed to have designated the spouse as beneficiary if no valid written designation is on file with the retirement system administrator. In the event no spouse survives the participant, this benefit shall be paid to the participant's natural born or legally adopted children ("child" or "children") as follows: 
    The age of the youngest child on the participant's date of death shall be used as the measuring life for the Pre-Retirement Survivor Pension ("PRSB"). The PRSB as so calculated shall be converted to an actuarial equivalent lump sum pursuant to Section 2.100.680 of this chapter. The resulting lump sump shall be divided equally among surviving children (if more than one child survives) or paid to the surviving child (or in either case, paid to a conservator or other proper legal representative for any child who has not reached age eighteen (18) as of the date of payment. 
    If the deceased participant is not survived by a spouse or child, no PRSB is payable. 
E.  A participant's beneficiary may elect to withdraw the participant's accumulated participant contributions in a lump sum in lieu of the pre-retirement survivor pension described above in this section. Such election must be made in writing, on a form prescribed by the board of trustees, filed with the retirement system administrator prior to the commencement of the pre-retirement survivor pension.

The city shall pick up the participant contributions from funds established and available for participant salaries, which funds would otherwise have been designated as participant contributions and paid to the pension fund. In no event shall a participant have a right to receive the participant contribution in cash in lieu of having such monies contributed to the plan.

The city shall not contribute any amounts to the health benefit fund or a welfare benefit fund (as defined in Code Section 419(e)(1)) with respect to qualified current retiree health liabilities as defined in Code Section 420(e)(1)(A) for which transferred assets are required to be used as described in subsection (A)(3) of Section 2.100.460A of this chapter. 
(Ord. 04-04 § 3 (part), 2004: Ord. 17-02 § 3 (part), 2002: Ord. 14-00 (part), 2000: Ord. 865 (part), 1994)) 
2.100.460A - Code Section 420 transfer of excess assets to the health benefit fund. 
A.  In addition to contributions made directly by the city under Section 2.100.460, the health benefit fund may be funded by a "qualified transfer" of "excess assets" of the retirement system to the health benefit fund. "Excess assets" means the excess (if any) of the retirement system's assets (determined as the lesser of actual market value or actuarial value determined in accordance with Code Section 412(c)(2)) over the greater of the (i) full funding limit; or (ii) one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the retirement system's current liability (as described in Code Section 412(c)(7)(B). The "qualified transfer" of assets does not otherwise count against the limits on city contributions described in Section 2.100.460 to the health benefit fund. The "qualified transfer" of excess assets is subject to the requirements described below: 
1.  Limitation on Number of Qualified Transfers Per Taxable Year. No more than one transfer of excess assets under this section during a taxable year of the city; provided that in no event shall any such "qualified transfer" be made after December 31, 2005. 
2.  Limit on Amount of Transfer. The amount of excess assets transferred from the retirement system to the health care fund shall not exceed the amount reasonably estimated to be paid during the tax year of the transfer for "qualified current retiree health liabilities" as defined in Code Section 420(e)(1)(A). The amount to be transferred shall be reduced by the ratio of (i) assets (as of June 30 preceding the plan year of the transfer) previously set aside to pay for the qualified current retiree health liabilities (as defined in Code Section 420(e)(1)(B)(i)), to pay for the qualified current retiree health liabilities, to (ii) the present value of the qualified current retiree health liabilities for all plan years (as defined in Code Section 420(e)(1)(B)(ii)). In the event the amount transferred exceeds the amount used to pay qualified current retiree health liabilities, the excess (including income thereon) shall be returned from the health benefit fund to the retirement system. 
3.  Use of Transferred Assets. Any assets (and any income allocable thereto) of the retirement system transferred to the health benefit fund shall be used only to pay reasonably estimated current retiree health liabilities (other than liabilities of key employees not taken into account under Section 420(e)(1)(D)) for the taxable year of the transfer. For purposes of this section, any amount paid out of the health benefits fund shall be treated as first being paid out of excess assets transferred to the health benefit fund pursuant to this section and income thereon. 
4.  Accelerated Vesting Requirement. 
(a)  An employee who is a participant in the retirement system on the date of the transfer shall be one hundred (100) percent vested on the date of the qualified transfer in his then currently accrued benefit in the retirement system, in the same manner as if the plan had terminated immediately before the qualified transfer. 
(b)  A participant who separated from service at the city during the one-year period ending on the date of the qualified transfer shall be one hundred (100) percent vested in his then currently accrued benefit as if the plan had terminated immediately before his separation from service. 
    A participant who vests in an accrued benefit under this Section 2.100.460A(4) shall nonetheless be subject to the vesting requirements of the applicable coverage plan at Section 2.100.230, 2.100.240, 2.100.250, or 2.100.260 with respect to future benefit accruals in the retirement system. In the case of a participant who becomes vested pursuant to Section 2.100.460A for (b) above, which participant has been paid his accumulated participant contributions and has accordingly forfeited his credited service, such participant shall have his accrued benefit based upon his previously forfeited credited service retroactively reinstated and vested, provided that the vested accrued benefits so reinstated and vested shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent of his accumulated participant contributions previously paid to him. 
5.  Maintenance of Applicable Employer Retiree Health Costs. As more fully set forth at Section 2.100.940A of the city of Hazel Park retiree health benefits plan, in the event of a qualified transfer, the city shall maintain levels of applicable employer retiree health costs during the cost maintenance period, as such terms are defined in Section 2.100.940A of the city of Hazel Park retiree health benefits plan. 
6.  Key Employees Excluded. Assets transferred to the health benefits fund cannot be used to pay the retiree health benefits of any participant who was a key employee (within the meaning of Code Section 416(i)(11)) at any time during the plan year ending within the tax year of the city in which the qualified transfer was made. If an employee is a key employee with respect to any plan year, such employee shall not be taken into account in computing qualified current retiree health liabilities for such taxable year, or in calculating applicable employer retiree health costs during the cost maintenance period as such terms are defined in Section 2.100.940A of the city of Hazel Park retiree health benefit plan. 
7.  Limitation of city deductions. The city shall not be entitled to a deduction for amounts transferred to the health benefit fund or where amounts are used from the health benefit fund to pay retiree health benefits which otherwise would have been deductible in a tax year had the expenses been paid directly by the city. 
B.  State law limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, excess amounts transferred under Section 2.100.460A(2), "Limit on Amount of Transfer" shall not exceed state law limitations as set forth in Michigan Compiled Laws Annotation (MCLA) 38.571 which section is incorporated by reference in this retirement plan.

2.100.460B - Cashouts of accelerated vested accrued benefit pursuant to a Code Section 420 transfer under Section 2.100.460A or pursuant to the Reciprocal Retirement Act. 
A.  This section shall only apply to a participant who becomes vested in his accrued benefit: 
1.  Pursuant to a qualified transfer under Section 2.100.460A; or 
2.  By reason of the Reciprocal Retirement Act. 
    This section shall not apply to any participant who completes ten years of credited service with the city. 
B.  Upon termination of such a participant's employment, the following shall apply: 
1.  Involuntary Cashout. If the present value of the vested normal retirement pension of a participant described in subsection A of this section is seven thousand dollars ($7,000.00) or less, then the retirement system administrator shall pay an immediate lump sum distribution of the greater of: 
(a)  The present value of such participant's vested normal retirement pension; or 
(b)  His accumulated participant contributions, and such participant's credited service and all rights to any further benefits of the retirement system shall be forfeited. With respect to distributions under this subsection made on or after January 1, 2006, the seven thousand dollars ($7,000.00) threshold for a mandatory distribution is reduced to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). 
2.  Voluntary Cashout. If the present value of the vested normal retirement pension of a participant described in subsection A of this section is more than seven thousand dollars ($7,000.00) and less than or equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), then such participant may elect to receive his benefits in an immediate lump sum distribution. In such event, the retirement system administrator shall pay an immediate lump sum distribution of the greater of: 
(a)  The present value of such participant's vested normal retirement pension; or 
(b)  His accumulated participant contributions, and such participant's credited service and all rights to any further benefits of the retirement system shall be forfeited. 
(c)  With respect to a voluntary cashout distribution under this subsection on or after January 1, 2006, the minimum threshold amount of seven thousand dollars ($7,000.00) is reduced to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). 
    If such participant elects not to receive an immediate lump sum distribution, he shall be treated as a vested former participant entitled to a deferred pension in accordance with Sections 2.100.140 and 2.100.150. 
3.  Other Participants. If the present value the vested normal retirement pension of a participant described in subsection A of this section is more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), such participant shall be treated as a vested former participant entitled to withdraw his accumulated participant contributions in accordance with Section 2.100.160 or to receive a deferred pension in accordance with Sections 2.100.140 and 2.100.150. 
4.  Present Value. For purposes of the foregoing, present value shall be calculated using the interest rate for actuarial equivalencies described in Section 2.100.680, and shall be determined on the later of (i) the date of distribution or (ii) the date of a qualified transfer under Section 2.100.460A. 
5.  Service Upon Reemployment. If a vested participant who received a distribution pursuant to this section is reemployed by the city, his years of credited service for vesting shall be reinstated. The credited service which related to the distribution shall not be reinstated unless he repays to the plan the benefit he received together with interest at a rate of 7.25% from the date of payment to him to the date of repayment to the retirement system. Repayments under subsection (B)(3) of this section shall be made in accordance with Section 2.100.100. 
    If a vested participant who received a distribution pursuant to this section becomes employed by another governmental employer, his years of credited service for purposes of the Reciprocal Retirement Act shall be reinstated if he repays to the retirement system the benefit he received, together with interest at a rate of 7.25% from the date of payment to him to the date of repayment to the retirement system. Repayments under subsection (B)(3) of this section shall be made in accordance with Section 2.100.100. 
6.  Timing. All cashout distributions made pursuant to this section shall be made as soon as administratively feasible following the later of: 
(a)  The participant's termination of employment; or 
(b)  The date of a qualified transfer under Section 2.100.460A.

2.100.460C - Vested termination of participation-Forfeiture of vested pension. 
    A vested former participant may elect to be paid accumulated participant contributions at any time after termination of employment and before commencement of his pension benefits, which election and payment shall result in forfeiture of credited service and all rights to any benefits of the retirement system other than payment of the accumulated participant contributions. Such election must be made in writing, on a form prescribed by the board of trustees, filed with the retirement system administrator prior to the commencement of pension benefits. 
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, a participant who becomes vested in all or part of his accrued benefit pursuant to a qualified transfer under Section 2.100.460A, who does not receive a cashout pursuant to Section 2.100.460B, shall be entitled to a pension from the retirement system subject to all other terms and conditions of the retirement plan. If such participant withdrew his accumulated participant contributions, the amount of his pension shall be determined by subtracting the actuarial equivalent of his accumulated participant contributions from his accrued benefit.

As custodian of all of the assets and funds of this trust, the city treasurer (or corporate custodian, as the case may be) shall accept and receive all sums of money paid to it from time to time by the city pursuant to the terms of this retirement ordinance, and shall hold and administer those monies and the increment earnings and income thereof as the trust fund for the exclusive benefit of participants and their beneficiaries. 
C.  All payments by the retirement system shall be authorized in advance by a specific or continuing resolution of the board of trustees.

2.100.660 - Assignments prohibited-Nonalienation of benefits. 
A.  Benefits under this retirement ordinance shall be subject to the Michigan Public Employee Retirement Benefit Protection Act (the "Benefit Protection Act"), Michigan Compiled Laws 38.1681-38.1689. Neither the principal of the trust fund nor any of the income therefrom, nor interest in the trust whatever, shall be subject to any conveyance, transfer or assignment by any participant or survivor pension beneficiary, nor shall the same be pledged as collateral by any participant or survivor pension beneficiary, nor shall the same be subject to any claim of any creditor of any participant or survivor pension beneficiary through legal process or otherwise. The preceding sentence shall also apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order, except as specifically provided for eligible domestic relations orders ("EDROs") pursuant to the Michigan Compiled Laws 38.1701-38.1711 and except as provided for domestic relations orders described in the Benefit Protection Act which comply with the requirements set forth in subsection (C)(1) of this section. It is the intention to place the absolute title to all property which shall constitute the assets of the trust in the trustee, with power to pay out the same and distribute the trust assets as provided in this retirement ordinance. Any attempted sale, conveyance, assignment or pledge of any of the funds or properties held in trust, or any part thereof, or of any income from the trust, by any participant, beneficiary or survivor pension beneficiary shall be null and void, and shall not be recognized by the board of trustees. 
B.  Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a participant who is convicted of or enters a plea of nolo contendere accepted by the court for a felony as defined in P.A. No. 350 of 1994, as amended, and which arises out of his service as a public employee may, by order of the court, have all or part of his pension forfeited. If a court orders such a forfeiture the order shall comply with the legal requirements of P.A. No. 350 of 1994, as amended, which are incorporated by reference. 
C.  Benefits under the retirement system may be assigned pursuant to a domestic relations order in accordance with Michigan Compiled Laws 38.1681-38.1689, provided that such domestic relations order meets the requirements of Section 414(q) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (as if the retirement ordinance were the qualified retirement plan of a private employer rather than of a government) (a "QDRO") in whichever of the following methods is specified in such order: 
1.  Unless the participant has already commenced to receive benefits in an annuity form, a QDRO may divide the value of the participant's benefits between the participant and the alternate payee, in which case, the value of the benefits payable to the alternate payee shall be deducted from the participant's benefits. The alternate payee shall have the right to receive such benefits in any form available to a participant, except a joint and survivor annuity for the alternate payee and his or her subsequent spouse, and commencing at any time after the participant attains his earliest retirement age (as specified in Section 2.100.230(D) for participants in the general coverage plan, in Section 2.100.240(D) for participants in the patrol officers coverage plan, in Section 2.100.250(D) for participants in the police command officers plan, in Section 2.100.260(D) for participants in the police chief and fire chief coverage plan, and in Section 2.100.270(D) for participants in the firefighters coverage plan) but prior to the participant's required distribution date (as defined in Section 2.100.310) and, as specified in the QDRO or as specified by the alternate payee if the QDRO does not specify a form and/or time for payment. Benefits awarded to the alternate payee in the QDRO shall be paid whether or not the participant dies prior to such payment, and the alternate payee shall have the right to designate a beneficiary to receive his or her benefits in the event of his or her death to the extent permitted for a participant electing the same form of payment, unless the QDRO provides otherwise. 
2.  If a participant has already started to receive his or her benefits, the form of payment may not be changed and, if the form of payment is a joint and survivor annuity, the joint annuitant may not be changed. However, the QDRO may order that all or any portion of the annuity payments be paid to the alternate payee, and may specify that any amounts not paid to the alternate payee may be paid to the participant or the participant's subsequent spouse after the participant's death, but only over the life of the joint annuitant named at the commencement of the participant's benefits, for a joint and survivor annuity. 
3.  An order shall not be an EDRO or a QDRO unless it includes directions with respect to the participant's accumulated participant contributions. An order shall (a) direct that all, any, or no portion of the accumulated participant contributions be awarded to the alternate payee; (b) direct the form of payment of the alternate payee's share of the accumulated participant contributions, which may only be as an annuity if the order is an EDRO, but which may be an annuity or a lump sum refund pursuant to Section 2.100.350, if the order is a QDRO. 
4.  The retirement system may, in the sole discretion of the board of trustees, charge for the cost to review the EDRO or QDRO by the retirement system's actuary or attorney. An order shall not be an EDRO or QDRO unless it includes directions on who will pay such charges. In the event a portion of a participant's benefit is assigned to an alternate payee pursuant to an EDRO or an order meeting the requirements of a QDRO, the alternate payee's choice of a form of payment shall not affect the right of the participant to independently elect a form of payment of the remainder of benefits, unless the alternate payee is designated as the participant's surviving spouse in an EDRO or unless the participant's benefits are already in pay status (in which case the form of payment is already fixed). 
(Ord. 19-04 § 3 (part), 2004; Ord. 18-04 § 3, 2004; Ord. 04-04 § 3 (part), 2004; Ord. 17-02 § 3 (part), 2002: Ord. 945 (part), 1999; Ord. 865 (part), 1994) 
2.100.670 - Qualified retirement system. 
A.  The city intends the retirement system to be a qualified pension plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and that the trust be exempt under Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The board shall administer the retirement system so as to fulfill this purpose. The provisions of this retirement ordinance notwithstanding, the board of trustees shall at all times administer the retirement system in compliance with the provisions of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, and applicable regulations thereunder, which are applicable to public employee retirement plans and which are incorporated herein by reference as permitted by Tax Reform Act of 1986, Section 1106(h). 
B.  The term "compensation" means for purposes of the limitations set forth in this Section 2.100.670 all compensation of the participant from the participating employer (as described in Section 415 of the Code and the regulations thereunder) for the limitation year. For purposes of applying the limitations of this Section 2.100.670, compensation paid or made available during such limitation period shall include the following: 
1.  Effective for limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 1998, any elective deferral (as defined in Section 402(g)(3) of the Code), and any amount which is contributed or deferred by the participating employer at the participant's election and which is not includible in the participant's gross income by reason of Section 125 or 457 of the Code; and 
2.  Effective for limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2001, any amount which is not includible in the participant's gross income under a salary reduction agreement used for qualified transportation fringe benefits pursuant to Section 132(f)(4) of the Code. 
    For purposes of applying the limitations of this Section 2.100.670 for limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, an amount which is contributed or deferred by the participating employer by reason of Section 125 of the Code shall include any amounts not available to a participant in cash in lieu of group health coverage because the participant is unable to certify that he has other health coverage. For this purpose, an amount shall be treated as a contribution or deferral by reason of Section 125 of the Code only if the participating employer does not request or collect information regarding the participant's other health coverage as part of the enrollment process for the health plan. 
C.  The term "limitation year" means for purposes of this Section 2.100.670 the plan year. 
D.  The maximum permissible annual benefit computed under this Section 2.100.670 shall not include benefits attributable to mandatory or voluntary participant contributions, if any. The sum of such contributions shall be deemed to be a separate defined contribution plan subject to the limitations for such plans, as set forth in Section 415 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. 
E.  For purposes of determining the maximum permissible annual benefit under this Section 2.100.670, any contributions by a participant to purchase permissive service credits under this retirement ordinance shall comply with the requirements of Section 415(n) of the Code. 
F.  General Provisions. If the annual benefit under this retirement ordinance to a participant is in a form other than a straight life annuity, the maximum permissible amount shall be adjusted to the actuarial equivalent of a straight life annuity beginning at the same age. The interest rate assumption used for determining the actuarial equivalent of such other forms of benefits will be the greater of: 
1.  Five percent; or 
2.  The rate specified in Section 2.100.680 of this retirement ordinance for determining actuarial equivalence. 
    For distributions with an annuity starting date between July 1, 1989 and June 30, 1995, the applicable mortality table shall be the mortality table set forth in Section 2.100.680 of this retirement ordinance. For distributions with an annuity starting date between July 1, 1995 and June 30, 2003, the applicable mortality table shall be the mortality table set forth in Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Revenue Ruling 95-6. For distributions with an annuity starting date on or after July 1, 2003, the applicable mortality table shall be the mortality table set forth in IRS Revenue Ruling 2001-62. 
(Ord. 04-04 § 3 (part), 2004: Ord. 17-02 § 3 (part), 2002: Ord. 865 (part), 1994) 
2.100.680 - Actuarial equivalencies. 
A.  "Actuarial equivalency" or "actuarially equivalent" means a benefit of equivalent value to the benefit it replaces based upon the following actuarial assumptions to be used by the plan actuary in determinations hereunder: 
1.  Mortality: a percent of the male mortality rates and a percent of the female mortality rates contained in the 1971 Group Annuity Mortality Table (set back zero years for males and five years for females). The percentages of male and female mortality rates will be ninety (90) percent male and ten percent female. 
2.  Interest: for purposes of Actuarial Equivalency between the standard form of payment (straight life pension) described in Section 2.100.290 and the optional forms of payment described in Sections 2.100.300(A) through (F) and (H): seven percent a year, compounded yearly. For purposes of determining the remaining amount of pension payable in the straight life form after a participant has withdrawn his Accumulated Participant Contributions under Section 2.100.300(G), an interest rate determined as follows: 
a.  For participants of the firefighters coverage plan, the patrol officers coverage plan and the fire chief: the applicable monthly interest rate for an immediate annuity published by the pension benefit guaranty corporation for a trusteed single employer plan to value a benefit upon termination of an insufficient trusteed single employer plan. 
b.  For participants of the police command officers coverage plan and the police chief: the interest rate adopted by the board of trustees for use in the annual actuarial valuation. Effective July 1, 1996, the interest rate shall be the applicable monthly interest rate for an immediate annuity published by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for a trusteed single employer plan to value a benefit upon termination of an insufficient trusteed single employer plan. 
c.  For participants in the general coverage plan: seven percent a year, compounded yearly. 
B.  No change in the interest rate or mortality table shall reduce the accrued benefit of any participant. In the event of a change in these actuarial assumptions as applicable to any participant, actuarially equivalent benefits for affected participants after the date of such change shall be the greater of subsection (B)(1) or (2) of this section: 
1.  The actuarial equivalent of the benefit accrued to the date of change, based upon the participant's final average compensation and credited service (both determined as of the date of change) and the provisions of the plan as of the date of change, including the Actuarial Equivalency factors prior to the date of change; or 
2.  The actuarial equivalent of a benefit based upon all final average compensation and credited service determined as of the date of calculation after the amendment, and based upon the terms of the plan after the amendment, applying the new Actuarial Equivalency factors. 
(Ord. 17-02 § 3 (part), 2002: Ord. 865 (part), 1994) 
2.100.690 - Diversion of assets prohibited. 
A.  All assets of the retirement system shall be held and invested for the sole purpose of meeting the legitimate obligations of the retirement system and shall be used for no other purpose. No part of the assets shall be used for or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of participants and beneficiaries prior to satisfaction of all retirement system obligations. 
B.  However, without regard to the provisions of this section: 
1.  If a contribution or any portion thereof is made by the city by a mistake of fact, the board of trustees shall, upon written request of the city, return the contribution or such portion to the city within one year after the date of payment; and 
2.  Earnings attributable to amounts to be returned to the city pursuant to subsection (B)(1) of this section shall not be returned, and losses attributable to amounts to be returned pursuant to subsection (B)(1) of this section shall reduce the amount to be so returned. 
C.  Participants of the board of trustees and its employees and agents are prohibited from having a beneficial interest, direct or indirect, in an investment of the retirement system; borrowing from the retirement system; and receiving any pay or emolument from any individual or organization providing services to the retirement system. 
(Ord. 17-02 § 3 (part), 2002: Ord. 865 (part), 1994) 
2.100.700 - Amendment or discontinuance of retirement system. 
A.  It is the intent of the city that the retirement system be permanent and remain in effect for an indefinite period. The city, however, subject to any applicable collective bargaining agreements, reserves the right at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate to conform with governmental regulations or other policies, to amend, modify or terminate, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the retirement ordinance codified in this chapter. No amendment to the retirement ordinance codified in this chapter (including a change in the actuarial basis for determining optional benefits) shall be effective to the extent that it has the effect of decreasing a participant's accrued pension benefit. For purposes of this paragraph, a retirement ordinance amendment which has the effect of eliminating an optional form of benefit, with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits. Furthermore, an amendment to the retirement ordinance codified in this chapter shall not have the effect of decreasing a participant's vested interest determined without regard to such amendment as of the later of the date such amendment is adopted, or becomes effective. 
B.  In the event the retirement system is discontinued or terminated, all participants shall immediately become fully vested in their benefits. The discontinuance or termination shall be carried out in all respects in conformance with the code and with applicable statute, rule or regulation of the state of Michigan, or any duly constituted agency thereof.

2.100.710 - Early retirement. 
    As part of its efforts to reduce the city's workforce, the city shall make available an "early retirement window benefit." This early retirement window benefit is made available to such person employed as the deputy treasurer for the city on May 31, 1993 and who retires not later than June 3, 1993. Under the terms of this early retirement window benefit such deputy treasurer employee shall receive a normal retirement benefit that is not actuarially reduced to reflect early commencement. If such deputy treasurer employee retires from the city after June 3, 1993 such employee's eligibility for early retirement and the amount of the employee's benefits under the retirement ordinance codified in this chapter are determined without regard to the early retirement window benefit. 
(Ord. 17-02 § 3 (part), 2002: Ord. 865 (part), 1994) 
2.100.720 - Direct rollovers. 
A.  This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the retirement ordinance codified in this chapter to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board of trustees, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
B.  Definitions. 
1.  An "eligible rollover distribution" means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (paid not less frequently than annually) paid over any one of the following periods: the life of the participant (or the joint lives of the participant and the participant's designated beneficiary), the life expectancy of the participant (or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and the participant's designated beneficiary), or a specified period of ten years or more. 
    Effective January 1, 2002, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includable in gross income. However, such portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includable in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includable. 
2.  "Eligible retirement plan" means as follows: 
a.  An individual retirement account described in Code Section 408(a); 
b.  An individual retirement annuity (other than an endowment contract) described in Code Section 408(b); 
c.  A qualified plan described in Section 401(a) of the Code if it is a defined contribution plan which permits the acceptance of rollover distributions; 
d.  An annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code; 
e.  Effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code; or 
f.  Effective January 1, 2002, an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan. 
    Effective January 1, 2002, the definition of an eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relation order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code. 
3.  A distributee means and includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. 
4.  A "direct rollover" means a payment by the retirement system to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.

2.100.740 - Preservation of retirement system service credits. 
    The city has elected to become a reciprocal retirement system within the meaning of the Michigan Reciprocal Retirement Act (MCLA Section 3.1101 et seq.) Accordingly, a participant who leaves the employ of the city and enters the employ of another governmental unit and participates in a reciprocal retirement system at such unit, may be entitled to have his or her credited service earned at the succeeding governmental unit recognized under this chapter as credited service for purposes of determining eligibility for a pension hereunder (but not for determining the amount of such pension). Furthermore, a participant who enters the employ of the city from another governmental unit where he participated in a reciprocal retirement system may be entitled to have his or her credited service earned at such preceding governmental unit for purposes of determining eligibility for a pension hereunder (but not for determining the amount of such pension). This section shall only apply to a participant who meets all requirements of the Reciprocal Retirement Act, as same may be amended. The provisions of the Reciprocal Retirement Act are incorporated into this plan by reference as though fully set forth herein. 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the completion of thirty (30) months of service with the city, any participant of the city's Supervisor's Union Local 1917 who has received or is currently receiving a pension from another municipality shall be eligible to receive a pension from the city based on the participant's credited service with the city without regard as to whether the preceding governmental employer participated in a reciprocal retirement system. 
(Ord. 17-02 § 3 (part), 2002: Ord. 865 (part), 1994) 
2.100.750 - Employment rights. 
    The retirement system shall not be construed as giving an employee any right to be retained in the service of the city without its consent nor shall the retirement system interfere with the right of the city to discharge an employee, nor shall an employee be given any right, claim or interest in any benefits of the retirement system except upon fulfillment of the conditions and requirements of the retirement system. 
(Ord. 17-02 § 3 (part), 2002: Ord. 865 (part), 1994) 
2.100.760 - Correction of errors. 
    The board of trustees shall correct errors in the records and actions of the retirement system. The board of trustees shall seek to recover overpayments and shall make up underpayments. Recovery of overpayments may be accomplished by reducing the amount of future payments so that the actuarial present value of actual payments is equal to the actuarial present value of correct payments. 
(Ord. 17-02 § 3 (part), 2002: Ord. 865 (part), 1994)

2.100.840 - Disability retirement of Brian Sanders. 
    In March 1994, the board of trustees authorized participant Brian Sanders' duty-related disability retirement. At the time of his retirement, Mr. Sanders' duty disability pension benefit was calculated in accordance with the usual terms of this chapter as a normal retirement benefit, based on credited service as of the date of duty disability retirement plus projected credited service to age fifty-five (55). A normal retirement benefit is equal to a percentage of final average compensation times years of service. 
    A grievance arose between Mr. Sanders and the city as to whether he was entitled to a terminal payment of certain vacation pay, which he did not receive. Such a terminal payment would have increased Mr. Sanders' final average compensation amount, as well as his duty disability benefit. Pursuant to grievance procedures in the applicable collective bargaining agreement, the issue was resolved with the city not paying the additional vacation pay, but with Mr. Sanders' final average compensation under this chapter to be calculated as if the amount had been paid. By this section, Mr. Sanders' benefit is accordingly so calculated, retroactively to his date of retirement. Except as modified by this section, Mr. Sanders' benefit is subject to the usual terms of this chapter. 
    For purposes of this section, "final average compensation" means that which is set forth at Section 2.100.240; provided, however, that vacation pay which was determined to be owing to the participant but had not been paid shall be counted for purposes of calculating the final average compensation of this participant.

Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Lehr is permitted to commence a retirement benefit under this chapter under the terms of the patrol officers coverage plan at Section 2.100.240 in accord with this section. 
    By this section, Mr. Lehr shall be entitled to purchase four additional years of credited service for purposes of increasing the years of service multiplier for a normal retirement pension. Such purchased credited service shall be aggregated with actual credited service to calculate the amount of Mr. Lehr's retirement benefit. In order to purchase such credited service, Mr. Lehr shall pay in full to the pension reserve fund the applicable amount set forth below: 
 Five and one-half percent of the maximum police officer's compensation, such compensation to be determined as of the effective date of retirement. 
    The participant's benefit as described in this section is conditioned upon satisfaction of all terms and conditions of the agreement. Except as modified by this section, Mr. Lehr's benefit is subject to the usual terms of this chapter.

2.100.860 - Transfers of employment within the same employer. 
    A participant who transfers from one job category to another with the same participating employer (whether or not such job categories are in the same coverage plan) shall be eligible to receive a benefit (that is, shall be vested) based on his total years of credited service with the participating employer. Such benefit shall be calculated as follows: 
A.  If the participant transferred to another position within the same coverage plan, the participant's benefit shall be based on his total credited service and his compensation and final average compensation (as defined by the applicable coverage plan) earned at all such positions. 
B.  If the participant transferred to another position in a different coverage plan, then his final average compensation shall be determined based upon the prescribed period of credited service in which the total amount of compensation paid to the participant is highest, regardless of which coverage plan the participant was in when such credited service was rendered. The prescribed period for determining final average compensation shall be as set forth in each coverage plan in which the participant rendered service. A separate benefit amount shall be calculated for such a transferred participant under each separate coverage plan in which the participant has rendered service, based upon credited service earned under each respective coverage plan, and based upon the specifications for compensation, final average compensation, and the benefit multiplier percentage of each separate coverage plan. The entire benefit as separately calculated shall be aggregated and paid in a single form of benefit as elected by the participant, provided that option LS shall only apply to accumulated participant contributions made during the periods of credited service rendered under a coverage plan eligible for option LS (together with investment earnings applicable to such accumulated participant contributions). 
    The computation of the pension benefit earned in each applicable coverage plan shall be in accord with Section 2.100.120 and the coverage plans applicable to a participant as provided in Sections 2.100.230, 2.100.240, 2.100.250, 2.100.260A, 2.100.260B and 2.100.270 of this chapter.

2.100.870 - Transfers of employment among participating employers in the retirement system. 
    The pension of a participant who transfers to a position with a different participating employer in the retirement system shall be determined as follows: 
A.  The amount of pension shall be determined in accordance with Section 2.100.860 of this chapter, as if all credited service had been rendered to the same participating employer, but on the basis of all applicable coverage plans.

Such amendment shall cover the full effect of such withdrawal, including without limitation the effect on current or future vesting, the disposition of retirement system assets or liabilities, and the payment of benefits to affected persons, including the payment of benefits to retired participants and the future payment of benefits to vested terminated participants who were library employees. The specific provisions of the amendment shall depend upon the following factors: the nature of the withdrawal, any subsequent qualified retirement plan arrangements made for the affected persons, and any other relevant considerations.

Such coverage shall be extended to twenty-nine (29) months if the covered individual is totally disabled, as defined by the Social Security Act, at the time of such termination of employment or reduction in hours of work and so notifies the administrator within sixty (60) days after the date of such determination.

4.  The covered individual becomes eligible for Medicare after the date the individual elects continuation coverage.

    Any benefits provided to a participant pursuant to this retiree health benefit plan after a retiree terminates employment with the city shall be counted in the total number of months of continuation coverage that must be extended to qualified beneficiaries.

Title 8 - HEALTH AND SAFETY* 
Chapters: 
Chapter 8.02 - VACANT AND ABANDONED STRUCTURES 
Sections: 

8.02.010 - Findings. 
    The city council determines that the presence of vacant and abandoned structures creates an element of neighborhood and commercial blight. It is recognized that blight lowers property values, leads to deteriorating housing conditions, undermines the quality of neighborhood life, affects the public health, safety and general welfare and can also result in human injury and criminal activities. It is also determined that vacant and unoccupied structures occupy an inordinate amount of city administrative and ordinance enforcement resources. As such, the city council finds the prolonged presence of vacant and abandoned structures to be unacceptable to the citizens of Hazel Park.

Chapter 9.39 - SYNTHETIC MARIJUANA AND DANGEROUS PRODUCTS 
Sections: 

9.39.010 - Findings, intent and purpose. 
(a)  The city finds that synthetic marijuana, consisting of plant or other material treated with chemicals or other substances that have not been approved for human consumption, is being marketed and sold as herbal incense and is being used in the same manner and for the same purposes as marijuana, with that use having become increasingly popular, particularly among teens and young adults. 
(b)  The city further finds based on information and reports from poison control centers, hospitals, emergency room doctors, and police agencies, that individuals who use synthetic marijuana experience dangerous side effects including convulsions, tremors, seizures, hallucinations, unconsciousness, anxiety attacks, dangerously elevated heart rates, increased blood pressure, vomiting, and disorientation, evidencing that these herbal incense products are harmful if consumed and present an imminent and significant public health danger to persons consuming such products and other persons coming in contact with them. 
(c)  The city further finds that, notwithstanding the high potential for abuse, and lack of any accepted medical use, the ability of the state to prohibit all forms of synthetic marijuana as a controlled substance has been frustrated due to the changing nature of the chemicals used in the manufacturing process. 
(d)  The city further finds that in addition to synthetic marijuana, there may be other products or materials containing chemicals or substances, that while not approved for human consumption, are or may be marketed and sold in a form that allows for such consumption and which, upon consumption, may result in the same serious side effects and public health dangers as synthetic marijuana. 
(c)  Based on these findings, this chapter is adopted for the purpose and with the intent to protect the public health and safety of the city and its residents from the threat posed by the availability and use of synthetic marijuana and other dangerous products by prohibiting persons from trafficking in, possessing, and using them in the city.

Basins with orifice or pumped outlets will be required to hold the volume for a ten-year storm while basins with no outlets will be required to hold two one-hundred-years storms. Discharge on an orifice or pumped outlet must be throttled to a restricted rate of 0.2 cfs per acre, or throttled to a restricted flow of 0.3 cfs if the total property area requiring detention is one and one-half acres or less. 
(Ord. No. 13-13, pt. I, 9-24-2013) 
13.13.070 - Submittal procedure. 
    For city approval of stormwater detention, the applicant shall furnish the city engineer three sets of detention plans, twenty-four (24) inches by thirty-six (36) inches, with detention calculations shown on the plans. The plans shall comply with the following: 
A.  A professional engineer, licensed in the state of Michigan, shall affix his or her seal on the plans. 
B.  The plans shall not be drawn to a scale smaller than one inch equals forty (40) feet. The city engineer shall review the plans and calculations for conformity to the standards set forth in this chapter, and certify that they are consistent with the overall utility plans of the city, after which he will return a letter of review with appropriate comments. The applicant, after making any changes requested, shall resubmit three sets of the revised plans to the city engineer for approval. The applicant may be required to obtain approval of the city of Hazel Park building department, Oakland County water resources commissioner, the road commission for Oakland County, the road commission for Macomb County or the Michigan Department of Transportation when the outlet discharges to facilities under their jurisdiction. 
C.  The detention plans shall clearly indicate the perimeter of all acreage contributing to the detention basin. The perimeter of the water surface for the volume of detention provided shall also be indicated on the plans including the water surface elevation. 
D.  The plans shall include the calculation of an overall coefficient of runoff for the acreage contributing to the detention basin. The range of this coefficient shall vary from 0.15 for completely grassed areas to 0.90 for completely paved areas. 
E.  The detention calculations for each site shall include the number of total acres calculated to the nearest hundredth contributing to the detention basin. The total cumulative volume of required detention shall be calculated using all areas of proposed site improvements and shall include previous site improvement areas covered by this chapter. 
F.  The detention calculations shall include the sizing of the restricting orifice or structure cover. The calculations for the restricting orifice size or restricted structures cover openings shall be made using a coefficient for a sharp-edged orifice entrance. Details for the restrictor are to be clearly indicated on submitted plans. The smallest pipe orifice size allowed is two and one-half inches in diameter. The orifice size shall be rounded down to the nearest one-half inch from the actual calculated size. 
G.  Calculations for the volume of detention provided shall be included on submitted plans. The volume calculations shall be made using standard geometric formulas to determine the volume between appropriate contour elevations. For irregular-shaped basins, the geometric formula for the volume of a frustum of a cone or pyramid shall be used to estimate the volume between appropriate contour elevations. 
H.  Plan approval constitutes conformance with this chapter in regards to calculations and method used to control runoff and achieve the required detention. Plan approval does not infer sanction or approval of construction governed by any other permit or subsequent approvals. 
I.  After approval of plans, any change to the storm detention system must be submitted to the city engineer for approval prior to its construction. 
(Ord. No. 13-13, pt. I, 9-24-2013) 
13.13.080 - General basin design and construction. 
A.  All basin design shall incorporate components that allow for visual inspection and maintenance by mechanical means of all areas designated for stormwater storage or restricted outflow. 
B.  Acceptable means of detention can be achieved through standing water in parking areas, landscaped ponds, or buried vaults, chambers, pipes or other approved buried device. Either one or any combination of these designs may be utilized to achieve the required detention. 
C.  All components of storm detention systems shall be constructed entirely on the private property of the proposed development, except for discharge piping and connections to public sewers. No portion of a basin shall be installed within a publicly owned utility easement or right-of-way. Connections to public sewers shall be at locations as approved by the city engineer. 
D.  Basins with orifice or pumped outlets must be constructed to drain entirely unless designed to retain a permanent water level that conforms to a planning commission approved landscape plan. 
E.  Basins with no outlets must be constructed in soils that have a saturated hydraulic conductivity of at least 0.004 feet per minute. 
F.  A minimum of twelve (12) inches of freeboard must be provided above the retained water surface of all detention basins and below the finished floor of all adjacent buildings. A minimum of six inches of freeboard must be provided above the maximum water surface created by the required positive nonerodable overflow to both adjacent buildings and adjacent properties. 
G.  A positive nonerodable overflow capable of handling the capacity of a one-hundred-year storm must be provided and clearly identified on the plans, which shall not discharge onto abutting private property. 
H.  Drainage from a development, renovation and addition shall not be diverted onto abutting private property. Drainage from a development, renovation and addition requiring detention shall be directed to the detention basin. Discharge from the basin and overflow shall not be diverted onto abutting private property. 
I.  The city requires a building permit for all piping and drainage structures for compliance with other codes and ordinances including the current Michigan Plumbing Code requirements for approved materials and drainage pipe cleanouts. 
J.  All storm detention systems shall be maintained in proper working order, free of debris, trash or anything else that may adversely affect the operability of the system, the required volume and outlet capacity. The storm detention systems shall be kept free of vermin and any creatures that may cause the system to become inoperable or harm the public. Maintenance of the storm detention system also requires treatment to prevent and control insects and microbes. 
(Ord. No. 13-13, pt. I, 9-24-2013) 
13.13.090 - Open pond basin construction. 
A.  An open channel must be provided along the bottom of all detention basins designed to drain entirely. The open channel shall begin at the outlet for the basin and shall run the entire length of the basin with the channel extending to all pipes discharging into the basin. The channel shall be sized to equal the capacity of the outlet for the basin when flowing full with no pressure head. The channel shall provide a minimum velocity of two feet per second when the basin outlet is flowing full with no pressure head. 
B.  The entire basin must be sodded, or have some other city approved method of stabilization. The maintenance of all stabilization and fencing in and around the detention basin shall be the responsibility of the property owner. 
C.  All grass and noxious weeds growing in or around the basin shall be maintained in accordance with Chapter 15.10, Landscape and Maintenance, as amended or other similarly adopted property maintenance code. No hydrophilic plants such as rushes, reeds, water iris, willow or cattails shall be allowed to grow or thrive within an open basin, or any tree, shrub or plant not specifically shown and approved on the required plans.

All final acceptance tests shall be witnessed by the Oakland County department of public works. 
A.  Infiltration Test. All sewers over twenty-four (24) inch diameter shall be subjected to infiltration tests. All sewers of twenty-four (24) inch diameter or smaller where the ground water level above the top of the sewer is over seven feet shall be subjected to an infiltration test. 
    Maximum allowable infiltration shall not exceed two hundred fifty (250) gallons per inch of diameter per mile of pipe per twenty-four (24) hours for the overall project. Maximum allowable infiltration shall not exceed five hundred (500) gallons per inch of diameter per mile of pipe per twenty-four (24) hours for any individual run between manholes. 
B.  Air Test or Exfiltration Test. All sewers of twenty-four (24) inch diameter or less, where the ground water level above the top of the sewer is seven feet or less, shall be subjected to air tests or exfiltration tests. 
    For exfiltration tests, the internal water level shall be equal to the external water level plus seven feet as measured from the top of pipe. The allowable exfiltration rate shall be the same as that permitted from infiltration. 
    The procedure for air testing of sewers shall be as follows: 
    The sewer line shall be tested in increments between manholes. The line shall be cleaned and plugged at each manhole. Such plugs shall be designed to hold against the test pressure and shall provide an airtight seal. One of the plugs shall have an orifice through which air can be introduced into the sewer. An air supply line shall be connected to the orifice. The air supply line shall be fitted with suitable control valves and a pressure gauge for continually measuring the air pressure in the sewer. The pressure gauge shall have a minimum diameter of three and one-half inches and a range of 0-10 PSIG. The gauge shall have minimum divisions of 0.10 PSIG and an accuracy of +0.04 PSIG. 
    The sewer shall be pressurized to four PSIG greater than the greatest back pressure caused by ground water over the top of the sewer pipe. At least two minutes shall be allowed for the air pressure to stabilize between three and five-tenths and four PSIG. If necessary, air shall be added to the sewer to maintain a pressure of three and five-tenths PSIG or greater. 
    After the stabilization period, the air supply control valve shall be closed so that no more air will enter the sewer. The sewer air pressure shall be noted and timing for the test begun. The test shall not begin if the air pressure is less than three and five-tenths PSIG, or such other pressure as is necessary to compensate for ground water level. 
    The time required for the air pressure to decrease one and 0/10 (1.0) PSIG during the test shall not be less than the time shown in the "Oakland County Department of Public Works Air Test Tables." 
    Manholes on sewers to be subjected to air tests shall be equipped with one-half inch diameter galvanized capped pipe nipple extending through the manhole, three inches into the manhole wall and at an elevation equal to the top of the sewer pipe. Prior to the air test, the groundwater elevation shall be determined by blowing air through the pipe nipple to clear it and then connecting a clear plastic tube to the pipe nipple. The tube shall be suspended vertically in the manhole and the groundwater elevation determined by observing the water level in the tube. The air test pressure shall be adjusted to compensate for the maximum ground water level above the top of the sewer pipe to be tested. After all tests are performed and the sewer is ready for final acceptance, the pipe nipple shall be plugged in an acceptable manner. 
    If a sewer fails to pass any of the previously described tests, the contractor shall determine the location of the leaks, repair them and retest the sewer. The tests shall be repeated until satisfactory results are obtained. 
    All visible leaks and cracks shall be repaired regardless of test results.

13.16.210 - Discharge prohibitions 
A.  General Pollutant Prohibitions. No user shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the POTW, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will cause interference or pass through. These general discharge prohibitions shall apply to all users of the POTW whether or not the user is subject to national categorical pretreatment standards or to any other federal, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. In addition, it shall be unlawful for a user to discharge into the POTW: 
1.  Any liquid, solid or gas, which by reason of its nature or quantity, is sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to create a fire or explosion hazard or to be injurious in any other way to persons, to the POTW, or to the operations of the POTW. Pollutants, which create a fire or explosion hazard in a POTW, include, but are not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flash point of less than 140°F or 60°C using the test methods specified in 40 C.F.R. § 261.21; or 
2.  Any solid or viscous substance in concentrations or quantities, which are sufficient to cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other encumbrances to the operation of the POTW, including, but not limited to, grease, animal guts or tissues, bones, hair, hides or fleshing, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, cement, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, strings, fibers, spent grains, spent hops, wastepaper, wood, plastic, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining or processing of fuel or lubrication oil, mud or glass grinding or polishing wastes, or tumbling and deburring stones; or 
3.  Any wastewater having a pH of less than 5.0 units or greater than 11.5 units; or 
4.  Any wastewater containing petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, products of mineral oil origin, or toxic pollutants in sufficient concentration or quantity either singly or by interaction with other pollutants to cause interference, or pass through, or constitute a hazard to humans or animals; or 
5.  Any liquid, gas, solid or form of energy, which either singly or by interaction with other waste is sufficient to create toxic gas, vapor, or fume within the POTW in quantities that may cause acute worker health and safety problems, or may cause a public nuisance or hazard to life, or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for their maintenance and repair; or 
6.  Any substance which is sufficient to cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW, such as residue, sludge, or scum to be unsuitable for reclamation processing where the POTW is pursuing a reuse and reclamation program. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria guidelines or regulations developed under 33 U.S.C. § 1345, with any criteria, guidelines, or developed and promulgated regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Federal Clean Air Act, the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act, or with State criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used; or 
7.  Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate either the consent judgment in U.S. EPA v city of Detroit et al., Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Case No. 77-1100, or the city of Detroit's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit; or 
8.  Any discharge having a color uncharacteristic of the wastewater being discharged; or 
9.  Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into a public sewer which exceeds 150°F or which will cause the influent at the wastewater treatment plant to rise above 104°F (40°C); or 
10.  Any pollutant discharge which constitutes a slug; or 
11.  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established in compliance with applicable federal or state regulations; or 
12.  Any floating fats, oil or grease which are sufficient to cause interference with or pass through the POTW; or 
13.  Any solid materials having a specific gravity greater than 1.2 or a cross section dimension of one-half (1/2) inch or greater which are sufficient to cause interference with the POTW. 
B.  Specific pollutant prohibitions. No user shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following limitations: 
1.  Compatible Pollutants. See Appendix C 
2.  Non-Compatible Pollutants. No user shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of: 
mg/l Arsenic (As) 1.0 Cadmium (Cd) See Appendix C Chromium (Cr) 25.0 Copper (Cu) 2.5 Cyanide (CN) (Available) 1.0 Iron (Fe) 1000.0 Lead (Pb) 1.0 Nickel (Ni) 5.0 Silver(Ag) 1.0 Zinc(Zn) 7.3 Total Phenolic Compounds 1.0 or See Appendix B  
    All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance with 40 C.F.R. part 136. 
a.  The Limitation for Total PCB is Non-Detect. Total PCB shall not be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 608, and the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/l, unless a higher level is appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one or more samples indicate detectable levels of total PCB, the user shall be required to demonstrate compliance. For purposes of this section, this demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the total PCB concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with Section 13.16.460(d). 
b.  The Limitation of Mercury (Hg) is Non-Detect. Mercury (Hg) shall not be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 245.1, and the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/l, unless a higher level is appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one or more samples indicate detectable levels of mercury, the user shall be required to demonstrate compliance. For the purposes of this section, this demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the mercury concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with Section 13.16.460(d). 
    All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance 40 CFR Part 136. 
3.  Compliance Period. Within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this article, the department shall notify all industrial user's operating under an effective wastewater discharge permit of the requirement to submit a compliance report within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of this ordinance. The compliance report shall demonstrate the user's compliance or non-compliance with these limitations, and, in the event of non-compliance, include the submission of a plan and schedule for achieving compliance with the stated limitation. In no event shall a compliance schedule exceed eighteen (18) months from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. An industrial user who does not demonstrate compliance may petition the department for a second extension as part of an administrative consent order. The department shall include appropriate monitoring, reporting, and penalties into an administrative consent order that relates to a second extension, and shall enter into such an agreement only upon a good-faith showing by the industrial user of the actions taken to achieve compliance with this provision. 
C.  National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. All users shall comply with the applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards and requirements promulgated pursuant to the act as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Subchapter N, Effluent Guidelines and Standards, which are hereby incorporated by reference and with all other applicable standards and requirements, provided, that where a more stringent standard or requirement is applicable pursuant to state law or regulation, or to this division, then the more stringent standard or requirement shall be controlling. Affected dischargers shall comply with applicable reporting requirements under 40 C.F.R. part 403 and as established by the department. The National Categorical Pretreatment Standards which have been promulgated as of the effective date of this section are delineated in Appendix A. 
1.  Intake Water Adjustment. Industrial users seeking adjustment of National Categorical Pretreatment Standards to reflect the presence of pollutants in their intake water must comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. 403.15. Upon notification of approval by the department, the adjustment shall be applied by modifying the permit accordingly. Intake water adjustments are not effective until incorporated into an industrial user's permit. 
2.  Modification of National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The department may apply to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, whichever is appropriate, for authorization to grant removal credits in accordance with the requirements and procedures in 40 C.F.R § 403.7. Such authorization may be granted only when the POTW treatment plant can achieve consistent removal for each pollutant for which a removal credit is being sought, provided, that any limitation of such pollutant(s) in the NPDES permit neither are being exceeded nor pose the prospect of being exceeded as a result of the removal credit being granted. Where such authorization is given to the department, any industrial user desiring to obtain such credit shall make an application to the department, consistent with the provisions of 40 C.F.R. § 403.7 and of this division. Any credits which may be granted under this section may be subject to modification or revocation as specified in 40 C.F.R. § 403.7, or as determined by the department. A requisite to the granting of any removal credit may be that the industrial user pay a surcharge based upon the amounts of such pollutants removed by the POTW, such surcharge being based upon fees or rates which the board may establish and, when appropriate, revise from time to time. Permits shall reflect, or be modified to reflect, any credit granted pursuant to this section. 
3.  New Sources. Industrial users who meet the new sources criteria shall install, maintain in operating condition, and "start-up" all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time and not to exceed ninety (90) days, new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards. 
4.  Concentration and Mass Limits. When limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the department may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. Equivalent limitations shall be calculated in accordance with Sections 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c)(3) and/or 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c)(4) and shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of 33 U.S.C. § 1317(d) and of this division. Industrial users will be required to comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
5.  Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of categorical pretreatment standards-baseline report. Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or one hundred eighty (180) days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under Section 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging into or scheduled to discharge into the Detroit POTW shall submit to the department a report containing the information listed in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(l-7). Where reports containing this information have already been submitted to the Director or regional administrator in compliance with the requirement of 40 C.F.R. § 128.140(b), the industrial user will not be required to resubmit this information. At least ninety (90) days before commencement of any discharge, each new source and any existing sources that become industrial users after the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall submit to the department a report which contains the information listed in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(1-5). In such report, new sources shall include information concerning the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall provide estimates of the information requested in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b,)(4) and (5). 
D.  Dilution Prohibited. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no user shall increase the use of process water, or in any way dilute or attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant specific limitation or requirement imposed by the city of Hazel Park, the city of Detroit or by the state of Michigan. 
E.  Hauled in Wastewater. Any waste material or wastewater which is hauled into or within the service region for discharge to the POTW is subject to the requirements of this division including, but not limited to, permits, inspection, monitoring and enforcement. Unloading liquid or solid waste from hauling vehicles, directly or indirectly, into the POTW, with or without the benefit of pretreatment, is prohibited unless the person proposing to unload such waste has applied for and received a permit from the department for unloading such waste in accordance with the boards rules pertaining thereto. The discharger shall be subject to applicable terms and conditions, surcharges, fees or rates as established by the board. Hauled in wastewater shall only be discharged at points designated by the POTW after authorization or approval issued pursuant to the general permit requirements specified in Section 13.16.330 of this code. The department may establish specific limitations for sludge from municipally owned or operated POTW treatment plants which are different than the specific limitations in this division. 
F.  Centralized Waste Treatment. It is unlawful for a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility to discharge any industrial waste or wastewater into the POTW without a wastewater discharge permit from the department. Any authorization granted, or permit issued, by the department to a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall specify the type of wastewater for which treatment is provided, and discharge approval is sought, from the POTW. Unless such industrial waste or wastewater is determined by the department to require further authorization, a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility that has submitted an application to, and received previous approval from, the department to discharge wastewater is not required to obtain further authorization from the department before discharging such wastewater. An industrial user, that provides centralized waste treatment services and files an application for the treatment and discharge of such types of wastewater to the POTW, shall provide the following minimum information in support thereof: 
1.  The general nature, source and process(es) generating the type of wastewater. Any wastewater, which is generated from those processes and is subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards as delineated in Appendix A, shall be so designated; 
2.  The identity of the toxic pollutants known or suspected to be present in the wastewater; 
3.  At least one sample report showing the results of an analysis for the EPA priority pollutants for each type of wastewater for which application is made in subsection (f)(l) of this section; 
4.  A statement, that is certified by a professional engineer, which addresses the treatability and compatibility of the wastewater, received or collected by the facility's treatment process(es); 
5.  The identity of the materials and/or pollutants whose transport or treatment are regulated by the EPA, by the state, or by any other governmental agency. Upon request, the centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall provide a copy of its permit and/or license to the department; and 
6.  Other information requested by the department including, but not limited to, information required by Section 13.16.330(c)(l) through (18) of this code, or by rules adopted by the board. The discharge from a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility will be deemed approved for those specific types of wastewater delineated in a permit and, upon issuance of such permit in accordance with the procedures contained in Section 13.16.330 of this code, will be deemed approved for discharge into the POTW. The centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall comply with all applicable provisions contained in Section 13.16.330 of this code regarding permits. In furtherance of its obligations as control authority, the department may include in the permit a requirement to report at selected intervals the information mandated in subsections (F)(1) through (F)(6) of this section. 
    All users granted a permit under this section shall maintain records which, at a minimum, identify the source, volume, character, and constituents of the wastewater accepted for treatment and disposal. These records may be reviewed at any time by the department. 
G.  Groundwater Discharges. Unless authorization has been granted by the department, the discharge of any groundwater into the POTW is prohibited. 
    The department may authorize the discharge of groundwater resulting from maintenance and related activities of gas, steam, or electrical utilities through the use of general permits. Subject to appropriate reporting requirements, the general permit shall authorize discharge in accordance with the terms of the permit. Utilities shall comply with this provision within one hundred eighty (180) days after its enactment. 
    If a person, who proposes to discharge groundwater resulting from purge, response activity, or UST projects, has applied for and received a permit from the department, the department may authorize the discharge of such wastewater. Permits shall be issued in accordance with the procedures contained in Section 13.16.330 of this code, or in accordance with any rules adopted by the board. 
H.  City of Hazel Park Right of Revision. The city of Detroit and city of Hazel Park reserve the right to establish rules or regulations adopted by the board, additional or more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW. (These rules and regulations shall be adopted in accordance with the rule-making procedures Section 2-111 of the 1997 Detroit City Charter in the 1997, if any.) Ninety (90) days after adoption by the board, industrial users shall comply with such rules and regulations. 
I.  Accidental Discharges. 
1.  Each industrial user, which does not currently have an approved spill prevention plan or slug control plan, shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this division, and all significant industrial users shall submit to the department detailed plans which show facilities and operating procedures to be implemented to provide protection against such accidental discharges. Facilities and measures to prevent and abate accidental discharges shall be implemented, provided, and maintained at the owner's or industrial user's cost or expense. Unless the significant industrial user has an approved spill prevention or slug control plan, all existing significant industrial users shall complete and submit such a plan within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this division (November 19, 1986). New significant industrial users shall submit such a plan prior to the time they commence discharging. For purposes of this section, the information provided shall include the approximate average and maximum quantities of such prohibited materials or substances kept on the premises in the form of raw materials, chemicals and/or waste therefrom and the containment capacity for each. Only substances that are in a form which could readily be carried into the POTW and constitute a concentration of five percent or greater in the raw material, chemical solution or waste material, are required to be reported. Volumes of less than fifty-five (55) gallons, or the equivalent thereof, need not be reported unless lesser quantities could cause pass through or cause interference with the POTW. 
    The industrial user shall promptly notify the department of any significant changes or modifications to the plan including, but not limited to, a change in the contact person, or substance inventory. 
2.  At least once every two years, the department shall evaluate whether a significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges, as defined by 40 C.F.R. § 403.8(f)(2)(v). Unless otherwise provided, all significant users shall complete, implement, and submit such a plan within thirty (30) days of notification by the department. 
J.  Notification Requirements. Unless a different notice is provided by this division or applicable law, within one hour of becoming aware of a discharge into the POTW which exceeds or does not conform with federal, state or city of Hazel Park laws, rules, regulations or permit requirements, or which could cause problems to the POTW, or which has the potential to cause the industrial user to implement its plan prepared in accordance with subsection (1) of this section, the industrial user shall telephone the department at its control center and notify the department of the discharge. The notification shall include the name of the caller, the location and time of discharge, the type of wastewater, the estimated concentration of excessive or prohibited pollutants and estimated volume, and the measures taken, or being taken, to abate the discharge into the POTW. Within five calendar days after the discharge, the industrial user shall submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences and when required by the department, the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit may be modified to include additional measures to prevent such future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, cost of treatment, loss, damages or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other environmental impairment or any other damage to person or property. 
K.  Notice to Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board, or other prominent place, advising employees whom to contact in the department in the event of an actual or excessive or prohibited discharge. 
L.  Recovery of Costs. Any user discharging in violation of any of the provisions of this division, which produces a deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the department's POTW, or causes the department to violate its NPDES permit, shall be liable to the department for any expense, loss, damage, penalty or fine incurred by the department because of said violation or discharge. Prior to assessing such costs, the department shall notify the user of its determination that the user's discharge was the proximate cause of such damage, obstruction, impairment, or violation of the city's NPDES permit and the department's intent to assess such costs to the user. Any such notice shall include written documentation which substantiates the determination of proximate cause and a breakdown of cost estimates. Failure to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this division. Such charge shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any penalties or remedies provided under this division, or this code, or other statutes and regulations, or at law or in equity. 
M.  Hazardous Waste Notification. All industrial users, who discharge into the city of Hazel Park collection system, shall notify the department in writing of any discharge of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261. Such notification must comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(p). 
N.  Authorized Representative. The authorized representative, as defined in Section 13.16.030(a)(2) of this code, may designate a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in Section 13.16.030(a)(2)(i) or (ii) where: 
1.  The authorization is made in writing by the individual defined in Section 13.16.030(a)(2)(i) or (ii); 
2.  The authorization specifies either an individual or a position having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility where the industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager, operator of a well or well field superintendent, or a position of equivalent responsibility, or having overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company; and 
3.  The written authorization is submitted to the department. 
O.  Pollution prevention. The department shall encourage and support industrial users to develop and implement pollution prevention programs that are designed to eliminate or reduce pollutant contributions beyond the levels required by this division. The department may require an industrial user to implement pollution prevention initiatives or BMP, as part of an enforcement response, or as necessary to comply with its NPDES permit.

f.  If sampling performed by a permittee indicates a violation, the user shall notify the department within twenty-four (24) hours of the time said user becomes, or should have become, aware of the violation. In addition, the user shall repeat the sampling and analysis, and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the department within thirty (30) days after said user becomes, or should have become, aware of the violation. 
9.  In the event the director determines that an industrial user is discharging substances in quality, quantity or at locations which may cause problems to the POTW, or the receiving stream, the department has the authority to develop and enforce effluent limits applicable to the user. To the extent the department seeks to impose restrictions in a permit which are more restrictive than established in this division, the department shall provide written documentation to explain the greater restriction for protection against pass through, interference, or violation of the NPDES permit; 
10.  Requirement for pollution prevention initiatives; and 
11.  Other requirements reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with this division. 
F.  Permit Duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time period. Except as deemed necessary by the department, or as otherwise provided for under this division, permits shall be issued for a specified period of not more than five years nor less than one year. The existing permit for significant industrial users, who timely submit an application for permit reissuance to the department, shall be automatically extended until a permit is issued as final. 
G.  Permit Modification. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the department during the term of the permit as limitations or pretreatment standards and requirements identified in Section 13.16.210 of this code are amended, or other just cause exists. Just cause for a permit modification includes, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
1.  Material or substantial changes to an industrial user's facility or operation, or changes in the characteristics of the industrial user's effluent. It shall be the industrial user's duty to request an application form and apply for a modification of the permit within thirty (30) calendar days of the change; 
2.  Change(s) in the department's NPDES permit; 
3.  Embodiment of the provisions of a legal settlement or of a court order;

Permittees shall request an application form and apply to the department for a modified permit within ninety (90) days after the promulgation of a new or revised national categorical pretreatment standard to which the industrial user shall be subject. Information submitted pursuant to this subsection shall be confined to that information related to the newly promulgated or amended national categorical pretreatment standard or requirement. However, information previously submitted need not be duplicated, insofar as the previously submitted information continues to be current and applicable. In addition, the department may initiate this action; 
9.  Changes in the monitoring location. (See Section 13.16.420 of this code); 
10.  Typographical errors or omissions in permits; 
11.  The department may modify the permit on its own initiative based on its findings or reasonable belief of the above; or 
12.  The user may request a modification of the permit. When initiated by the department, the industrial user shall be informed of any proposed change in its permit. The department will issue a draft permit and an industrial user has thirty (30) days to file a response to the draft modified permit. Thereafter, the department will issue a final permit and, unless appealed in accordance with the procedures contained in Section 13.16.570 of this code, the permit will become effective twenty (20) days after issuance. 
H.  Permit Custody and Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific person as defined herein for a specific discharge. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a different person, new owner, new industrial user, different premises, or a new or changed operation without notice to and written approval of the department, and providing a copy of the existing permit to the new owner or operator. It shall be the permit holder's duty to notify the department of any such change at least thirty (30) days before the date of the change. Wastewater discharge permits, which do not receive the written approval of the department prior to the change, shall be null and void regardless of reassignment, or transfer, or sale. If it has occurred, the department may revoke a permit. If a change takes place, the department may require the application for a new or modified permit. Any succeeding person shall comply with the terms and conditions of any existing permit which the department allows to be retained. 
I.  Permit Notification Requirements. All industrial users shall promptly notify the department in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous waste for which initial notification under 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(p) has been made, request a permit application form, and apply for a modification of the permit at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the change. Failure of the industrial user to so apply shall be considered a violation of this division.

13.16.420 - Monitoring facilities. 
A.  Significant industrial users shall provide, operate and maintain at their own expense a sampling manhole or special structure to facilitate monitoring, inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of their discharge by the department and the industrial user, and to enable the department to conduct such other monitoring and sampling as required for determining compliance with discharge requirements, limits and standards as provided for in this division. In the event the department determines that the monitoring facility identified in the permit application is inadequate, a new monitoring facility must be identified, or provided, which shall allow for collection of a representative sample of the wastewater discharged from the facility. Unless otherwise determined at the discretion of the department, said facility shall be provided within ninety (90) days of receipt of notification by the department. The industrial user shall provide the department with: 
1.  A drawing showing all sewer connections and sampling manholes by the size, location, elevation, and points or places of discharges into the POTW; 
2.  A flow schematic showing: 
a.  Which connections receive each national categorical process waste stream; 
b.  Which connections receive storm water, sanitary water or cooling water; and 
c.  Which lines handle each combined waste stream. This report shall be certified by a professional engineer. If a significant industrial user fails to install the monitoring facilities within the prescribed time limits, then the department may install such structure or device and the significant user shall reimburse the department for any costs incurred therein. 
B.  The sampling manhole should be situated on the industrial user's premises in a location readily accessible to the department. When such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the industrial user, the department may allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area when there is room and the location will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. It shall be the responsibility of the industrial user to obtain any necessary approvals which may be required from other government agencies for the location and construction of monitoring facilities. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling or monitoring manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility and any permanently installed sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the industrial user. Whether constructed upon public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the department's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications.

B.  Each such inspection or sampling activity shall be commenced and completed at reasonable times, and in a reasonable manner. Upon arrival at the industrial user's premises, the department shall inform the industrial user, or the industrial user's employees, that sampling and/or inspection is commencing, and that the facility's authorized representative has the right to observe the inspection and/or sampling. The department shall neither refrain from, nor be prevented or delayed from, carrying-out its inspection or sampling duties due to the unavailability of the authorized representative of the facility to observe or participate in the inspection or sampling activity. 
C.  While performing work on private property, employees or authorized representatives of the department shall observe all reasonable safety, security and other reasonable rules applicable to the premises as established by the industrial user. Duly authorized employees or representatives of the department shall bear proper credentials and identification, and at the industrial user's option may be accompanied by a duly authorized representative of the industrial user. Duly authorized department representatives shall not be restricted from viewing any of the facility site. Department employees or representatives may take photographs of facilities subject to this division. Which shall be maintained by the department as confidential in accordance with Section 13.16.440 of this code. 
D.  Where an industrial user has security measures in force, the industrial user shall make prompt and necessary arrangements with the security personnel so that, upon presentation of appropriate credentials, personnel from the department will be permitted to enter for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
E.  Significant industrial users shall sample and analyze their discharge in accordance with the provisions of their permit. The department may require such samples to be split with the department for the department's independent analysis. 
F.  Industrial users shall maintain records of all information from monitoring activities required by this division, or by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(n). Industrial users shall maintain the records for no less than three years. This period of record retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the discharge of pollutants by the industrial user, or the operation of the city of Detroit's industrial waste program, or when requested by the department, by the state, or by the EPA. 
G.  Upon the request of the department, industrial users shall furnish information and records relating to discharges into the POTW. Industrial users shall make such records readily accessible to the department at all reasonable times, and allow the department to copy such records. 
H.  In the event the department obtains samples, and analyses are made of such samples, a copy of the results of such analyses shall be promptly furnished upon written request by the industrial user's authorized representative. When requested by the industrial user, the department employee or representative shall leave with the user, a portion of any sample of the user's discharge taken from any sampling point on or adjacent to the premises for the user's independent analysis. In cases of disputes arising over shared samples, the portion taken and analyzed by the department shall be controlling unless proven invalid. 
I.  In addition to any other violation caused by the discharge described herein, in the event a single grab sample of the industrial user's discharge is obtained by the department, and then analyzed in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part 136, and found to contain concentrations of pollutants which are two or more times greater than the numeric limitations as listed in Section 13.16.210(b) of this code, or as contained in the facility's wastewater discharge permit, the industrial user shall implement its slug control plan, and shall provide a written report to the department within fourteen (14) days, which describes the cause of greater concentration and provides a description of the means by which future discharge concentrations will be held to values of less than two times the limitation in the future.

13.16.440 - Confidential information. 
A.  Information and data on an industrial user obtained from written reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs, and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agencies without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the department that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the industrial user. 
    When submitted to the department, all information claimed to be confidential must be clearly marked 'confidential.' When requested by the person furnishing the report, the portions of a report determined by the department to disclose trade secrets or trade secret processes, and which are clearly labeled as confidential, shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to this division, to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, and to the State Disposal System permit and/or the pretreatment programs, provided, however that information shall be treated as confidential by the governmental agency, until such time as the information has been determined to be non-confidential by the governmental agency. Confidential information on industrial users, which the department releases pursuant to a request of another governmental agency, should be handled by the other governmental agency pursuant to its own confidentiality procedures. The department cannot control how another governmental agency handles such confidential information, and assumes no responsibility for the disposition of the information released to the governmental agency. The department will use sufficient care to inform the other governmental agency of the existence of the industrial user's confidentiality claim. 
    The department shall determine whether the information requested to be treated as confidential, in fact, satisfies the requirements of confidential information as defined herein. The decision of the department shall be made in writing. 
    Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
B.  Except as otherwise determined by the department or provided for by applicable law, all information with respect to an industrial user on file with the city shall be made available upon request by such user or the user's authorized representative during normal business hours.

2.  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof; 
3.  The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with this division upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
C.  Bypass. Bypasses are prohibited unless the bypass does not cause a violation of pretreatment standards or requirements, but only if it is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the treatment system. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (C)(1) and (C)(2) of this section. 
1.  Notice of Anticipated Bypass. Industrial users anticipating a bypass shall submit notice to the department at least ten days in advance. 
2.  Notice of Unanticipated Bypass. An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the industrial user becomes or should have become aware of the bypass. A written submission shall be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes or should have become aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. 
3.  Prohibition of Bypass and Enforcement. Bypass is prohibited, and the department may take enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated waste, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
c.  The industrial user properly notified the department as described in subsection (C)(2) of this section. 
4.  Bypass Approval. Where it meets all conditions in subsection (C)(3) of this section, the department may approve an anticipated bypass. 
D.

The department may, as part of an administrative order, also require development of a BMP as a part of the department's enforcement response. Upon approval of the department, these pollution prevention initiative, or BMPs shall be made an enforceable part of the wastewater discharge permit. Industrial users shall provide, at six month intervals, analytical results and certifications in support of its implementation of an approved pollution prevention initiative or BMPs. Upon demonstration of compliance, the industrial user may request to be relieved of this implementation requirement. 
E.  Emergency Suspensions and Orders. The department may order suspension of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge permit where, in the opinion of the department, such suspension is necessary to stop any actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or significant hazard to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, interferes or may interfere with the POTW, or causes or may cause the city of Detroit to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. Any person notified of a suspension of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event the department provides informal notification under this section, written confirmation and an order shall be provided within twenty-four (24) hours. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with any suspension or revocation order, the department shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection or services, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or danger to any individual or the environment. In the event such steps are taken, the director shall notify the industrial user within twenty-four (24) hours in writing of such action and order, and the specific recourse available. In any event, the department shall provide the industrial user with an opportunity for a hearing before the director, or his designated representative, within ten days of such action. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement to the department within fifteen (15) days of the occurrence describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. Upon proof of elimination of the noncomplying discharge, the department shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the sewer or wastewater treatment service. 
F.  Notice of Violation. Except in the case of an actual or threatened discharge as specified in subsection E of this section, whenever the department has reason to believe that any industrial user has violated or is violating this division, the department shall serve a written notice stating the nature of the violation upon such industrial user. Where applicable, the department shall pursue appropriate escalating enforcement action as defined within its approved enforcement response plan. The failure of the department to issue a notice of violation shall not preclude the department from escalating its enforcement response. 
G.  Administrative Actions. Whenever the department has reasonable grounds to believe that a user is violating, or has violated, a provision of its wastewater discharge permit, or a pretreatment standard or requirement or any prohibition of this division, the department, may initiate appropriate administrative enforcement action, except in the case of emergency or flagrant violation, in order to compel the industrial user to eliminate or to remedy such violation as soon as possible. 
1.  a. Conferences. The department may order any person, who violates this division, to attend a conference wherein the department may endeavor to cause the user to eliminate or remedy the violation by establishing an enforceable compliance schedule. The notice of violation shall be served at least ten days before the scheduled conference and shall set forth the date, time, and place thereof. The conference shall be conducted by a representative of the department. The industrial user shall present a plan and schedule for achieving compliance with this division. Nothing contained herein shall require the department to accept or agree to any proposed plan or schedule, or to prevent the department from proceeding with a show cause hearing as set forth in subsection (G)(2) of this section.

All grease interceptors shall be properly installed and maintained in working order, and shall be kept free from obstructions, leaks and defects, and shall be capable of performing the function for which such devices are designed, as specified herein. All grease interceptors shall be maintained in a safe, sanitary and functional condition. 
4.  Requirement for Testing. The owner and the operator of existing and new establishments with a grease interceptor shall each be responsible to secure the testing of and provide an independent certification that the grease interceptor is functioning as intended. For this purpose, samples of wastewater which have passed through the grease interceptor (and not through any other filter) shall be taken by an independent environmental engineer licensed to practice in the state of Michigan, who shall test and provide a certified report to the city on whether the grease interceptor is functioning in conformance with the standards of the city ordinance code. Such testing and certification shall be undertaken bimonthly, and the certification, which shall include the date the sample was taken, the date of testing, and the test results expressed in terms relating to the standards required herein, and shall be provided to the office of the Hazel Park building department on the first day of each even numbered month. The city shall maintain a list of approved environmental engineers for this purpose, and, at any time, the name of a new engineer may be proposed to the city for inclusion on the list, and, following investigation of the credentials of such engineer by the city. All engineers found to have reasonable credentials shall be included on the list. Failure to provide the bimonthly certifications when required shall constitute a violation of this chapter. 
5.  Periodic Clean Out. Each grease interceptor shall be cleaned out and the operator of the establishment shall dispose of the contents in a lawful manner. Such clean out shall be undertaken on a quarterly basis, or on more frequent intervals specified in a written notice provided by the city to the owner and/or operator of the grease interceptor based upon the ownership and/or occupancy records of the city. The intervals specified in the notice shall be formulated based upon the type and size of user, prior inspections, and other relevant information. A certification of the owner and/or operator of the premises, including the date, name of person performing the work, a description of the cleaning undertaken, the amount of solids and grease removed, and an identification of the location of grease disposal shall be provided to the city in writing on the first day of June and December of each year, reflecting all clean out activity in the immediately preceding two quarters. Failure to provide such certifications when required shall constitute a violation of this chapter and the owner and/or the operator shall pay to the city its actual costs in obtaining such certifications. 
6.  Posting of Maintenance and Repair Log. In all facilities having a grease interceptor, a maintenance and repair log, showing the date of maintenance and repair, description of maintenance and repair performed, and the identification of the person or persons who performed the maintenance and repairs on each occasion, shall be conspicuously posted on the premises in the immediate vicinity of the grease interceptor facility. Such maintenance log shall be retained by the operator of the establishment for at least one year, and the current and past log records shall be made available to the city inspectors during all reasonable business hours for examination. The failure to maintain such a log shall constitute a violation of this chapter and the owner and/or operator shall pay the city's actual costs in obtaining the log. 
7.  Violations and Penalties. 
a.  Any property owner or operator of an establishment who violates any provision of this chapter shall be responsible for a municipal civil infraction and shall, upon a finding of responsibility, be punished by paying a fine of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).

The city may recover its reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, court reporter's fees, and other expenses related to enforcement activities or litigation against the person or entity found to have violated this chapter. 
8.  Interim and Emergency Measures. Considering that the ordinance codified in this chapter creates new obligations that will require a period of time for property owners and operators of existing establishments to make arrangements for compliance, the following shall apply: 
a.  The requirement to install, maintain and repair grease interceptors on new and existing properties and establishments shall apply upon the effectiveness of this chapter. 
b.  The obligation for testing and posting of maintenance logs, as required under subsections D and F of this section, shall not be enforced against existing establishments for a period of six months from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter; provided, in view of the fact that the requirement for the installation of grease interceptors is not newly introduced by this chapter, and has previously been required under the plumbing code, the six month "grace period" for compliance shall not apply to the obligation for installation of grease interceptors in existing establishments. 
c.  Notwithstanding that enforcement of the testing and maintenance log requirements shall be deferred for a period of six months from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, in the event the city determines, in the reasonable exercise of discretion that the failure to maintain and repair a grease interceptor during such six-month period is likely to result in an obstruction in the city's sanitary sewer system, following notice from the city and an opportunity of the property owner or operator of the establishment to cure the defect within the time stated in the notice, such condition is hereby declared to be a public health nuisance that may jeopardize health and property in the city. In the event of such nuisance, the city shall have the right, but not the obligation, to take action to clear the obstruction, in which event the property owner and the operator of the premises shall be required to reimburse the city for all costs and expenses as set forth below, incurred in connection with such action. Notice that curative action is necessary, as contemplated in this subsection, shall be given to the address on the records of the city treasurer for the property in question, and also delivered to the premises. 
d.  Fees and Reimbursement of Costs. 
1.  In the event of emergency measures, it is the purpose of this section to provide for recovery of costs from the property owner or operator of the establishment responsible for an obstruction in the city's sewer system. 
2.  All costs associated with the repairs made by the city or its agent as a part of an emergency measure, including any expense, loss, damage, penalty, attorney's fees, court costs, and court reporter's fees incurred by the city shall be assessed to the property owner or operator of the establishment responsible for an obstruction in the city's sewer system. In addition to the actual costs for material, equipment and labor, the city shall assess actual documented costs for mobilization against the responsible owner or operator. 
3.  After completion of the repairs made by the city or its agent as part of an emergency measure, the owner or operator of the offending establishment shall fully restore the property, including repair of roads, sidewalks, driveways and anything else requiring restoration. If the restoration is not made within a reasonable period of time, the city shall have the right but not the obligation to restore the property and shall assess all costs associated with the restoration to the owner or operator of the establishment responsible for the obstruction in the city's sewer system.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 12-13, pt. I, adopted Sep. 24, 2013, repealed the former Ch. 15, §§ 15.44.010-15.44.210, and enacted a new chapter as set out herein. The former Ch. 15 pertained to the same subject matter and derived from Ord. 441; Ord. 444; Ord. 452; Ord. 472; Ord. 500; Ord. 696; Ord. 763; Ord. 817; Ord. 838; Ord. 851; Ord. 11-04, § 1 (part), adopted in 2004; and Ord. 01-08, §§ 2-4, adopted in 2008. 

15.44.010 - Purpose. 
    The city of Hazel Park hereby determined that regulation of the location, size, placement and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services and facilities without difficulty and confusion, to promote traffic safety, public health and welfare, and facilitate police and fire protection. The regulations in this chapter are designed to permit legibility of signs and to prevent their over concentration, improper placement and excessive height, bulk and area. 
    With the adoption of this sign chapter, the city of Hazel Park intends to continue to utilize its recognized police powers to assure all signage in the city of Hazel Park commercial, retail, business areas and the like, will conform to existing designs which will enhance the aesthetics and viability of business in an attempt to preserve the economic stability of the city. 
    It is the further purpose to remove signage which is nonconforming and out of date and replace it with current sign design compatible with various development corridors anticipated to enhance and foster a character to the city of Hazel Park that will attract residents and businesses. To that end a "sunset" provision has been adopted to eliminate nonconforming signs by November 1st of 2015. 
    The sign design throughout the city is delineated to be consistent with signage standards contained within this chapter, hence signage may be allowed with limitations in some corridors but not throughout the city. In addition, some areas (i.e. local business district and Eight Mile business district) are designated with certain characteristics, design features and uniform signage, and uses not found in other commercial areas of the city.

A.  Nonconforming regulations established in the land development regulations for nonconforming structures shall not be applicable to signs which exist on the effective date of this chapter where such signs fail to comply with the provisions described in this chapter. The elimination of nonconforming signs is hereby declared to be a public purpose and a public service for the following reasons: 
(1)  These signs constitute a nuisance to the city resulting from their incompatibility due to excessive size, poor location, relationship to existing structures, excessive quantity in a small geographic area, inadequate or inappropriately displayed message and volume; 
(2)  These signs are detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare arising from quantity, location, and bulk, having an adverse or detrimental impact upon police and fire protection, causing confusion for motorists; and blocking signage of adjoining businesses; 
(3)  These signs are incompatible with the adopted zoning regulations governing sign location, size, placement and features which have been deemed adequate for commercial enterprise; 
(4)  Technological advancements in signage have created the opportunity to locate businesses quicker, minimize maintenance, enhance safety and decrease the size requirements; 
(5)  Readability is limited due to the ill-proportioned nature of many older nonconforming signs; whereas existing advanced technology often times allows instantaneous information or format enhancing readability; 
(6)  Age has resulted in the physical deterioration of such signage and thus no longer represents the desired aesthetic conducive to a particular district. 
B.  Nothing in this chapter shall relieve the owner or user of a nonconforming sign, or the owner of property on which the nonconforming sign is located, from the provisions of this chapter regarding safety and maintenance of the sign. 
C.  No existing nonconforming sign or its support structure shall be altered, changed or replaced by another nonconforming sign. 
D.  Ninety (90) days following the cessation of any business or related activity, a nonconforming sign shall lose its legal status and shall be removed and/or brought into compliance. Noncompliance within thirty (30) days after notice shall authorize the building official to initiate removal of the sign structure and assess all costs against the owner of the property. 
E.  On or before November 1, 2015, all signs that are nonconforming to the current provisions of this chapter shall be removed at the expense of the owner or occupant of the property on which the sign is located.

The sign authority in such an instance shall determine whether the application shall be granted for an exception by utilizing the following considerations which must be indicated and factually supported in any decision made on the application. Such standards are: 
(1)  Does the proposed sign represent the business it is intended to identify? 
(2)  Is the sign appropriate to the business identified so as to not cause confusion or mislead the public? 
(3)  Is the sign appearance compatible with the visual character of the surrounding area, e.g., scale and placement to the building, relationship of color to adjacent colors, dissimilarity of shape to other signs in the surrounding area, dissimilarity of lettering to other signs in the surrounding area? 
(4)  Is the sign legible from its intended location? 
(5)  Is the sign intended to be integrated into the character of the building as to the entrance and the architectural features? 
(6)  Can the sign be viewed with comfort by pedestrians? 
(7)  If located on the ground, is the proposed sign outside the clear vision triangle and presents no obstruction to vehicles entering and exiting the site? 
(8)  Does the sign reflect the character of Hazel Park as opposed to emphasizing a national symbol? 
(9)  Does the location of the sign obscure the store interior or its merchandise? 
(10)  Does the proposed sign significantly depart from the applicable provisions of the chapter? 
(11)  If a projecting sign, are guy wires or cables visible, does the proposed location assist the consumers in identifying store location, is the sign located in direct relationship to the store entrance, and is the size and placement compatible with the building façade? 
(12)  If illuminated, is the light source hidden from view, is glare sufficiently shielded, is any electrical raceways exposed, is the lighting compatible with surrounding light sources? 
(13)  Such an appeal may further be granted in those instances in which there has been a demonstrated showing by the applicant that the particular sign sought to be approved is suitable to the community or has some value that comports with the history/development of the community and would not, if a variance were granted, be materially in conflict with the applicable regulations for the district in which the sign is located. 
(14)  The signage proposed as the basis for the appeal does not result in the perpetuation of a sign that no longer conforms to existing sign regulations. 
B.  The city council shall appoint three members to act as the sign authority under the provisions of this chapter. Each member shall serve for a period of three years and shall serve until their successor has been appointed. Each member may be reappointed to serve on the board. The sign authority shall resolve all disputes when a complaint is filed in accordance with this section. Any applicant denied relief hereunder has the right to an appeal to the zoning board of appeals who shall conduct an administrative hearing to establish whether the chapter is being properly interpreted and enforced and make such decisions as to ensure the proper enforcement and interpretation of the chapter.

LANDSCAPING STANDARDS Page 17.12 - 1
CHAPTER 17.12
LANDSCAPING STANDARDS
17.12.010 INTENT
The intent of this chapter is to establish minimum standards for the design, installation, and
maintenance of landscaping along public streets, as buffer areas between uses, on the interior
of sites, within parking lots, and adjacent to buildings. Landscaping is viewed as a critical
element contributing to the aesthetics, development quality, stability of property values and the
overall character of the City of Hazel Park. The standards of this chapter are also intended to
provide incentives to preserve quality mature trees, screen headlights of motor vehicles to
reduce glare, integrate various elements of sites, help ensure compatibility between land uses,
assist in directing safe and efficient traffic flow at driveways and within parking lots, and minimize
negative impacts of stormwater runoff and salt spray.
The standards of this chapter are considered the minimum necessary to achieve the intent. In
several instances, the standards are intentionally flexible to encourage variety and creative
design. Additional landscaping above and beyond these standards is encouraged to improve the
function, appearance and value of properties within the city.
17.12.020 REQUIREMENTS AND TIMING OF LANDSCAPING
A. PLAN REQUIRED. Landscaping shall be included with any site plan or plot plan application.
The location, type, size, and spacing of all plant materials shall be indicated. It shall also
include planting details and specifications clearly describing planting technique, material
installation, planting mixtures, mulch, material depth, seed blends, and other necessary
information.
B. PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE. The City may require as a condition of approval, the
furnishing of a cash deposit, certified check, irrevocable bank letter of credit, or surety bond
to be deposited with the City Clerk. The minimum performance guarantee to be required
shall be deposited at the time of the issuance of the permit. The City shall not require the
deposit before the date on which the City is prepared to issue the permit.
C. INSTALLATION AND INSPECTION. Landscaping or plant materials shall be planted within
6 months from the date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy and shall thereafter be
reasonably maintained with permanent plant materials which may be supplemented with
other plantings.
Landscaping shall be installed in a sound manner according to generally accepted planting
procedures with the quality of plant materials as hereinafter described in this title.
Landscaped areas shall be protected from vehicular encroachment by use of concrete
curbing. Landscaped areas shall be elevated above the pavement to a minimum height of 6
inches to protect plant materials from snow removal operations, salt, and other hazards. If
building or paving construction is completed in an off-planting season, a temporary certificate
of occupancy may be issued only after a performance bond is provided to ensure installation
of required landscaping in the next planting season.
CITY OF HAZEL PARK ZONING ORDINANCE ADOPTED 6/11/02
LANDSCAPING STANDARDS Page 17.12 - 2
An inspection of plant materials shall be conducted by the Building Official within 3 months of
written notification of installation to release any performance guarantee.

deciduous tree or ornamental tree with at least 100 square feet of planting area shall be
used for every 10 parking spaces, in addition to any other landscaping requirements of this
chapter.
B. Landscaping shall be dispersed throughout the parking lot in order to break up large
expanses of pavement and help direct vehicular traffic flow within the lot.
C. All landscaped areas, when adjacent to streets, driveway aisles, or parking areas, shall be
curbed with concrete curb and gutters. The length of these areas shall be 2 feet shorter than
adjacent parking space to improve maneuvering. A parking space overhang of 2 feet may be
used to widen a landscaped area and reduce the length of a parking space by 2 feet less
than required by this title.
17.12.050 PLANT MATERIALS AND MINIMUM SPACING

17.12.080 WAIVER OR MODIFICATION OF STANDARDS FOR EXISTING SITES
Special provision is made for applying the standards of this chapter to developed sites which
existed prior to the adoption of this chapter. Therefore, when an existing site is any activity
requiring site plan review according to Section 17.60.080 of this title, the objective of these
standards is to gradually bring the existing site into compliance with the minimum standards of
this chapter in relation to the extent of expansion or change on a site.
When reviewing plans for an existing building or site which requires site plan review, the
Planning Commission shall require, at they determine necessary, an upgrade in landscaping to
comply with the standards of this chapter to the greatest extent possible. Landscaping along the
street and as a buffer between adjacent uses shall take priority over parking lot and interior
landscaping. Where parking lot landscaping cannot be provided, additional landscaping along
the street or in the buffer areas shall be considered. In determining whether or not an existing
site can comply, the Planning Commission shall consider the following:
A. Existing and proposed building placement.
B. The abutting or adjacent land is developed or planned by the city for other than residential
uses.
C. Building heights and views.
D. No residential district is within 200 feet of the subject site.

WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES Page 17.20 - 1
CHAPTER 17.20
WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES
17.20.010 PURPOSE
It is the general purpose and intent of the city to carry out the will of the United States Congress
by authorizing telecommunication facilities needed to operate wireless telecommunication
systems. However, it is the further purpose and intent of the city to provide for such
authorization in a manner which will retain the integrity of neighborhoods and the character,
property values and aesthetic quality of the community at large. In fashioning and administering
the provisions of this section, attempt has been made to balance these potentially competing
interests.
Recognizing the number of providers authorized to establish and operate wireless
telecommunication services and coverage, it is the further purpose and intent of this section to:
A. Facilitate adequate and efficient provision of sites for wireless telecommunication facilities
and ensure that wireless telecommunication facilities are situated in appropriate locations
and relationships to other land uses, structures and buildings.
B. Establish predetermined zoning districts of the number, shape, and in the location,
considered best for the establishment of wireless telecommunication facilities, subject to
applicable standards and conditions.
C. Recognize that operation of a wireless telecommunication system may require the
establishment of facilities in locations not within the predetermined zoning districts. In such
cases, it has been determined that it is likely that there will be greater adverse impact upon
neighborhoods and areas within the city. Consequently, more stringent standards and
conditions should apply to the review, approval and use of such facilities.
D. Limit inappropriate physical and aesthetic overcrowding of land use activities and avoid
adverse impact upon existing population, transportation systems, and other public services
and facility needs.
E. Minimize the adverse impacts of technological obsolescence of such facilities, including
possible removal of unused and/or unnecessary facilities in a timely manner.
F. Minimize the negative visual impact of wireless telecommunication facilities on
neighborhoods, community landmarks, historic sites and buildings, natural beauty areas and
public rights-of-way. This contemplates the establishment of as few structures as reasonably
feasible, and the use of structures which are designed for compatibility, including the use of
existing structures and the avoidance of lattice tower structures that are unnecessary, taking
into consideration the purposes and intent of this section.
CITY OF HAZEL PARK ZONING ORDINANCE ADOPTED 6/11/02
WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES Page 17.20 - 2
G. The City finds that the presence of numerous tower structures, would decrease the
attractiveness and destroy the character and integrity of the city. This, in turn, would have an
adverse impact upon property values. Therefore, it is necessary to minimize the adverse
impact from the presence of numerous relatively tall tower structures having low
architectural and other aesthetic appeal to most persons, recognizing that the absence of
regulation would result in a material impediment to the maintenance and promotion of
property values, and further recognizing that this economic component is an important part
of the public health, safety and welfare.
17.20.020 COLOCATION
Colocation of attached wireless telecommunication facilities on any existing buildings or
structures, where the existing building or structure is not, at the discretion of the Building
Official, proposed to be either materially altered or materially changed appearance, shall be
permitted.
A. STANDARDS FOR COLOCATION
Colocation shall be deemed to be feasible for purposes of this section where all of the following
are met:
1. The site on which colocation is being considered, taking into consideration reasonable
modification or replacement of a facility, is able to provide structural support.
2. The colocation being considered is technologically reasonable, e.g., the colocation will
not result in unreasonable interference, given appropriate physical and other adjustment
in relation to the structure and antennae.
3. The height of the structure necessary for colocation shall not be increased beyond a
point deemed to be permissible by the city, taking into consideration the standards
contained in Section 17.20.040.
B. REQUIREMENTS FOR COLOCATION
1. All new and modified wireless telecommunication facilities shall be designed and
constructed so as to accommodate colocation.
2. If a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless telecommunication facility shall fail
or refuse to alter a support structure so as to accommodate a proposed and otherwise
feasible colocation, such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a
nonconforming structure and use, and shall not be altered, expanded or extended in any
respect.

CHAPTER 17.24
NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
17.24.010 NONCONFORMANCE REGULATED
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the gradual elimination of nonconforming uses and
structures. The lawful use of land or a structure exactly as the land or structure existed at the
time of enactment of the ordinance may be continued except as otherwise provided herein
although the use or structure does not conform with the ordinance. However, a nonconforming
use shall be subject to, and the owner shall comply with, the regulations of this chapter. A
change in tenancy, ownership or management does not change the status of a nonconforming
use.
17.24.020 NONCONFORMING USES
If lawful use involving individual structures exists at the effective date of adoption of this title that
would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this title, the lawful use may be continued
so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this title in the district in which it is
located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, resumed, or restored, reconstructed,
moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in
the district in which it is located.
B. If any such nonconforming use of a structure ceases for any reason for a period of more than
6 months, such use shall conform to the regulations specified by this title for the district in
which such use is located.
C. A structure devoted to a nonconforming use may be maintained but not structurally altered
so that the life of the structure is extended.
D. If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or if the same is
more restricted classification provided that the Zoning Board of Appeals shall find that the
proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing
nonconforming use. In permitting such changes the Board may require conditions and
safeguards in accord with the purpose and intent of this chapter. Where a nonconforming
use, a structure, land or structure and land in combination is hereafter changed to a more
conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed to a more nonconforming use.
E. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not
thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use.

NONCONFORMING USES AND BUILDINGS Page 17.24 - 2
17.24.030 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES BY CLASS
Generally, nonconforming structures are declared by this title to be incompatible with permitted
structures in the district involved. However, in pursuit of the public interest, a distinction is made
between nonconforming structures that should be eliminated as rapidly as possible and
nonconforming structures that may be given separate treatment.
To this end, there are established 2 classes of nonconforming structures: 1) Class A, those that
could be altered to extend their usefulness and longevity; and 2) Class B, those that are not
desirable and useful and will only be allowed to be continued until they are removed or
voluntarily discontinued.
A. CLASS A NONCONFORMITIES. The following nonconformities shall be classified as Class
A nonconformities and may be enlarged, extended, constructed, resumed, or restored,
reconstructed, moved or structurally altered as provided here in this subsection.
1. Detached single-family residential dwellings that contain a conforming use that are
nonconforming due to side yard setbacks or front yard setbacks may have a second
story addition constructed provided that the addition adheres to the same setbacks as
the existing dwelling.
2. Detached single-family residential dwellings that contain a conforming use that are
nonconforming due to side yard setbacks may have a first floor addition added to them
provided that the addition, complies with all current setback and height requirements.
B. CLASS B NONCONFORMITIES. The following nonconformities shall be classified as Class
B nonconformities:
1. Detached single-family dwellings that contain a conforming use that are nonconforming
due to rear yard setbacks or minimum floor area.
2. Buildings that contain a nonconforming use.
3. Detached single-family dwellings that are on a single lot with another detached singlefamily
dwelling.
4. Conforming structures that contain nonconforming uses.
5. Uses that do not have required off-street parking.
Class B nonconformities shall not be enlarged, extended, constructed, resumed, or restored,
reconstructed, moved or structurally altered. They shall not be changed to another
nonconforming use or rebuilt except in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. They
shall not be repaired if damaged by fire or other casualty to the extent that the cost of
reconstruction or repair exceeds 50 percent of the State Equalized Value (SEV).

NONCONFORMING USES AND BUILDINGS Page 17.24 - 3
17.24.040 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD
In any district in which single family dwelling units are permitted, notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of this subsection, a single family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings may be erected or any lot of record at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this subsection. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district; provided,
however that setbacks and other requirements not involving area or width or both conform to the
regulations for the district in which such lot is located. If 2 or more lots or a combination of lots
or portions of lots with a continuous frontage and single ownership are of record at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this subsection, or at any time thereafter; and if all or part of
the lots do not meet the requirements for lot area or width as established by this chapter, the
lands involved shall be considered an undivided parcel or zoning lot for the purpose of this
chapter, and no portion of such undivided parcel or zoning lot shall be used or occupied which
does not meet lot area or width requirements as established by this chapter, nor shall any
division of the parcel or zoning lot be made which leaves remaining on any lot with area or width
below the requirements stated in this chapter.
17.24.050 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE
If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes
physically unsafe or unlawful due to a lack of repairs and maintenance and is declared by the
Building Official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be
restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is
located.
17.24.060 RECONSTRUCTION OF DAMAGED NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS
AND STRUCTURES
Nothing in this title shall prevent the reconstruction, repair or restoration and the continued use
of any nonconforming building or structure damaged by fire, collapse, explosion, acts of God or
acts of public enemy, subsequent to the effective date of this title, wherein the sum total of the
expense including labor, materials and other charges of such reconstruction does not exceed 50
percent of the State Equalized Value (SEV) of the entire building or structure at the time such
damage occurred; provided, that such restoration and resumption shall take place within 3
months of the time of such damage and that it be completed within one year from time of such
damage; and provided further, that said use shall be identical with nonconforming use permitted
and in effect directly preceding said damage. Where pending insurance claims require an
extension of time, the Building Official may grant a time extension provided that the property
owner submits a certification from the insurance company attesting to the delay. Until such time
as the debris from the fire damage is fully removed, the premises shall be adequately fenced or
screened from access.

NONCONFORMING USES AND BUILDINGS Page 17.24 - 4
17.24.070 MOVING
No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or in part to another location
unless such building or structure and the off-street parking spaces, yard and setbacks, and other
requirements of this title are made to conform to all the regulations of the district in which such
structure is to be located.
17.24.080 NOTIFICATION OF NONCONFORMING STATUS
A. After the adoption of this title, or any amendments thereto, the City shall prepare a record of all
known nonconforming uses existing at the time of such title or amendment. Such record shall
contain the names and addresses of the owners of record as provided in the Citys tax rolls, the
legal description, the nature of use, and a description of the nonconformity. Each owner and
occupant shall be notified by mail of the nonconforming character of the structures and uses
thereof. Such record shall remain on file at the City shall be periodically revised to reflect those
nonconforming uses which have ceased to exist and any new nonconforming uses discovered
by the City.
B. Should the City become aware of a nonconforming use, the owner of said nonconforming use
shall be notified by the City in writing of the provisions of this title and that his property
constitutes a nonconforming use.
C. Should the City become aware that the nonconforming use of a structure has ceased for a
period of more than 6 months, the City shall notify the owner of the structure that future uses
shall conform to the regulations specified by this title for the district in which such use is located.
17.24.090 PLANS ALREADY FILED
In any case where plans and specifications for a building or structure have been filed, which
would conform with the zoning regulations effective at the date of such filing but not with the
regulations of this title, and where a building permit for such building or structure has been
issued and construction work started at the effective date of this title, such work may proceed
provided it is completed within one year of said date.

OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS Page 17.28 - 1
CHAPTER 17.28
OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS
17.28.010 PURPOSE
In all zoning districts, space shall be provided as specified in this chapter for the parking and
storage of self-propelled motor vehicles for the use of occupants, employees and patrons of
buildings hereafter erected, altered or extended after the effective date of this chapter.
17.28.020 UNITS OF MEASUREMENT
A. PARKING SPACE CALCULATIONS. When determining parking requirements, any fraction
equal to or greater than one-half shall go to the next higher number.
B. BENCH SEATING. Where patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews or other similar
seating facilities, each 24 inches of such seating facilities shall be counted as one seat for
the purpose of determining requirements for off-street parking facilities under this chapter.
C. EMPLOYEE CALCULATIONS. Where the number of spaces required is based on the
number of employees, calculations shall be based upon the maximum number of
employees likely to be on the premises during the peak shift.
17.28.030 SHARED PARKING / PARKING WAIVERS
A. COLLECTIVE OR JOINT USE OF PARKING AREAS
The joint use of parking facilities by 2 or more uses is permitted whenever such use is
practicable and satisfactory to each of the uses intended to be served, and when all
requirements for location, design and construction can be satisfied. A copy of any
agreement between joint users shall be filed with the application for a business license or
site plan approval, whichever is filed first. The agreement shall include a guarantee for
continued joint use, a joint Site Maintenance Agreement, and shall be recorded at Oakland
County. The City Attorney shall review all joint parking agreements.
In computing capacities for any joint use, the off-street parking requirement is the sum of
the individual requirements that will occur at the same time. In computing the required
parking spaces for the total of joint off-street parking, the total spaces required may be
reduced by the Planning Director whenever the facilities served do not operate during the
same hours of the day or night and it can be clearly established that a simultaneous need
for joint use parking will not occur.
B. REDUCTIONS IN EXISTING OFF-STREET PARKING. See Section 17.28.040(B).
C. MUNICIPAL PARKING. Off-street parking may be provided either by individual action or by
a parking program carried out through public action, whether by a special assessment
district or otherwise.

OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS Page 17.28 - 8
B. REDUCTION OF PARKING REQUIREMENTS. The Planning Commission may reduce
parking requirements based upon a finding that there will be a lower demand for parking
due to one (1) of the following factors:
1. Shared parking by multiple uses with peak parking demands during different times of
the day, days of the week, or parts of the year.
2. Expectation of walk-in business due to sidewalk connections to adjacent residential
neighborhoods or employment centers. Site design shall incorporate pedestrian
connections to the site that provide safe and convenient access to the building entrance.
3. Availability of other forms of transit. The Planning Commission may require that the site
design incorporate transit stops, pedestrian connections to transit stops, or enhanced
bicycle parking facilities.
4. Special provision is made for applying the standards of this chapter to developed sites
which existed prior to the adoption of this chapter. In determining whether or not a site
can comply, the Planning Commission shall consider reducing parking requirements
based upon the following:
a. The proposed use of the site;
b. The existing parking and building(s) at the site; and
c. Whether the requirements for parking, as determined by the Planning
Commission, are unduly burdensome.
17.28.050 PARKING DIMENSIONS
A. STANDARD. A basic residential or commercial parking space shall be an accessible
rectangle having a width of 9 feet and a length of 20 feet. See 17.28.080 J for layout
requirements.
B. COMPACT. Compact car spaces shall be an accessible rectangle of having a width of 8
feet and a length of 16 feet. Compact car spaces shall account for no more than 30 percent
of the total parking requirement and be clearly signed for small cars only. See 17.28.080 J
for layout requirements.
C. ADJACENT TO WALLS AND OTHER STRUCTURES. When a parking space is located
adjacent to a fixed object, such as a wall, fence, or support post, which interferes with the
opening of any vehicle door, the width of the space shall be increased by one foot. Such
parking spaces shall be located on the premises they are intended to serve.

17.36.050 RESIDENTIAL DESIGN STANDARDS
In order to preserve the substantial investment of property owners in single-family
neighborhoods, any single-family home, erected in a residential zoning district shall not be
grossly dissimilar to the exterior design and appearance of existing single-family homes in the
surrounding area. The term grossly dissimilar as used in this section, means an immediately
obvious difference apparent to professionals in the building trade, neighbors and potential
residents. The standards herein are intended to prevent grossly dissimilar dwellings which would
adversely affect the value of dwellings in the surrounding area; adversely affect the desirability of
an area to existing or prospective homeowners; impair the stability of the environment; prevent
the most appropriate use of real estate; and lessen the opportunity to realize the development
pattern envisioned in the Master Plan.
A. ROOF PITCH. The pitch of the main roof shall have a minimum vertical rise of one foot for
each 4 feet of horizontal run. The roof shall be finished with a type of shingle or other
material that is commonly used in standard on-site residential construction.
B. EXTERIOR MATERIALS. The exterior siding of any single family residential house shall
consist of materials that are generally acceptable for site-built housing, provided that the
reflection from such exterior surface shall be no greater than from white semi-gloss exterior
enamel, and provided further that any such exterior is comparable in composition,
appearance, and durability to the exterior siding commonly used in standard residential
construction in the City of Hazel Park.
C. STORAGE AREA. Each single-family residential house shall contain a storage area equal to
10 percent of the square footage of the dwelling or 100 square feet, whichever is less. This
storage area shall consist of a basement, attic (where the ceiling height is 7 feet or more),
garage, or in a separate detached accessory structure that complies with the standards of
this title regarding accessory buildings and structures.
D. EXCEPTIONS. The standards of this section shall not apply to a manufactured dwelling
located in a licensed mobile home park except to the extent required by state or federal law
or otherwise specifically required in this title and pertaining to such parks. Manufactured
dwellings that do not conform to the standards of this section shall not be used for dwelling
purposes within the city unless located within a mobile home park or a mobile home
subdivision district for such uses, or unless used as a temporary residence as otherwise
provided in this title.
17.36.060 SITE PLAN REVIEW
Site plan review requirements are as provided in Section 17.60.080, Site Plan Review. Site plan
review shall not be required for the construction of single family detached dwellings.

zoning district shall not be grossly dissimilar to the exterior design and appearance of existing
detached single-family homes in the surrounding area. The term grossly dissimilar as used in
this section, means an immediately obvious difference apparent to professionals in the building
trade, neighbors and potential residents. The standards herein are intended to prevent grossly
dissimilar dwellings which would adversely affect the value of dwellings in the surrounding area;
adversely affect the desirability of an area to existing or prospective homeowners; impair the

Sec. 15.44.010 - Purpose.
The City of Hazel Park hereby determined that regulation of the location, size, placement and certain features
of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services and facilities without difficulty and confusion,
to promote traffic safety, public health and welfare, and facilitate police and fire protection. The regulations in this
chapter are designed to permit legibility of signs and to prevent their over concentration, improper placement and
excessive height, bulk and area.
With the adoption of this sign chapter, the City of Hazel Park intends to continue to utilize its recognized
police powers to assure all signage in the City of Hazel Park commercial, retail, business areas and the like, will
conform to existing designs which will enhance the aesthetics and viability of business in an attempt to preserve
the economic stability of the City.
It is the further purpose to remove signage which is nonconforming and out of date and replace it with current
sign design compatible with various development corridors anticipated to enhance and foster a character to the
City of Hazel Park that will attract residents and businesses. To that end a "sunset" provision has been adopted to
eliminate nonconforming signs by November 1st of 2015.
The sign design throughout the City is delineated to be consistent with signage standards contained within
this chapter, hence signage may be allowed with limitations in some corridors but not throughout the City. In
addition, some areas (i.e. Local Business District and Eight Mile Business District) are designated with certain
characteristics, design features and uniform signage, and uses not found in other commercial areas of the City.

(a) Nor more than one pole or monuments sign, billboard or otherwise shall be permitted on any property.
(b) Billboards shall be a free standing sign that is not larger than 672 square feet and not higher than 35 feet.
Back to back signs are permissible as well as side by side billboards and "V" type billboards. However,

billboards. All billboards shall not project over public property and shall be located a minimum of 500 feet

adjacent residential zones. All permit applications for billboards must be accompanied by a landscaping
plan which is subject to the approval of the building inspector. A renewal permit in an amount established
by the City Council shall be required annually for billboards. A maintenance bond in an amount
established by the City Council shall be required. In the instances that a billboard is vacated, the cost of

Sec. 15.44.040 - Nonconforming signs
(a) Nonconforming regulations established in the land development regulations for nonconforming structures
shall not be applicable to signs which exist on the effective date of this chapter where such signs fail to
comply with the provisions described in this chapter. The elimination of nonconforming signs is hereby
declared to be a public purpose and a public service for the following reasons:
(1) These signs constitute a nuisance to the City resulting from their incompatibility due to excessive size,
poor location, relationship to existing structures, excessive quantity in a small geographic area,
inadequate or inappropriately displayed message and volume;
(2) These signs are detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare arising from quantity, location, and
bulk having an adverse or detrimental impact upon police and fire protection, causing confusion for
motorists; and blocking signage of adjoining businesses;
(3) These signs are incompatible with the adopted zoning regulations governing sign location, size,
placement and features which have been deemed adequate for commercial enterprise;
(4) Technological advancements in signage have created the opportunity to locate businesses quicker,
minimize maintenance, enhance safety and decrease the size requirements;
(5) Readability is limited due to the ill-proportioned nature of many older nonconforming signs; whereas
existing advanced technology often times allows instantaneous information or format enhancing
readability;
(6) Age has resulted in the physical deterioration of such signage and thus no longer represents the desired
aesthetic conducive to a particular district.
(b) Nothing in this chapter shall relieve the owner or user of a nonconforming sign, or the owner of property on
which the nonconforming sign is located, from the provisions of this chapter regarding safety and
maintenance of the sign.
(c) No existing nonconforming sign or its support structure shall be altered, changed or replaced by another
nonconforming sign.
(d) Ninety days following the cessation of any business or related activity, a nonconforming sign shall lose its
legal status and shall be removed and/or brought into compliance. Noncompliance within 30 days after notice
shall authorize the Building Official to initiate removal of the sign structure and access all costs against the
owner of the property.
(f) On or before November 1, 2015, all signs that are nonconforming to the current provisions of this chapter 15
shall be removed at the expense of the owner or occupant of the property on which the sign is located.
Page 8
(g) The failure to remove such signs after notice to do so shall authorize the City to issue the appropriate citation
or take necessary action to remove such signage at the expense of the property owner or lessee.
Sec. 15.44.050 - Applicability of the state construction code
Except as otherwise indicated in this chapter, the regulations of the State Construction Code as adopted by
the City shall apply to signs. Where the provisions of this chapter are more restrictive in respect to location,
setback, use, size or height of signs, the limitations of this chapter shall take precedence over the regulations of
the State Construction Code.
Sec. 15.44.060  Permit required

changed, a sign requiring a permit upon any property within the City without first obtaining a sign permit.

Sec. 15.44.120 - Sign bonuses
In certain unique circumstances, in addition to any signs permitted by this chapter, permits for the following
special signs or sign bonuses may be approved by the Planning Director and/or Building Official in accordance
with the provisions established below:
(1) Rear façade identification signs. In instances where three or more frontages of a commercial structure in
a commercial or industrial zoning district directly visible to a dedicated right-of-way, service drive, or
circulation lane, a bonus wall sign to identify the rear façade of the structure may be permitted. To
qualify for the rear façade identification sign bonus, the site must:
a. Be directly bordered on at least three sides by dedicated circulation routes intended primarily for
consumer traffic; rear alleys and loading and unloading access drives do not qualify.
b. The drive aisles may not be located exclusively on the same site as the structure to which the
bonus would be applied, though it may be shared between two or more separate and distinct sites.
c. The wall sign bonus must not exceed ten square feet in area distributed over one or two wall signs.
d. If two signs are proposed, they must be located on separate façades.
e. To qualify for the rear façade identification sign bonus, no other wall signage may be present on
the rear façades having the bonus signage.
f. The primary permitted wall signage must be located on the façade facing the major thoroughfare or
other primary roadway serving the site, or for corner lots, the two frontages facing such
thoroughfares or roadways.
g. Rear façade identification signs may not face a residentially zoned or used property.
(2) Wall sign area bonus. In commercial districts only, in the event that a ground sign otherwise permitted
by the chapter cannot be located in compliance with the location requirements of the chapter due to
existing natural or manmade features, proximity to an existing sign or otherwise, additional wall sign
area may be awarded above the permitted maximum wall sign area as determined by section
15.44.110. This bonus may only be applied when the applicant, in the course of seeking a sign permit,
has satisfactorily demonstrated that the development of an otherwise permitted ground sign is not
possible in compliance with other provisions of this chapter or if no location for the sign which allows the
sign to serve its intended purpose due to existing natural or manmade features. The wall sign area
bonus shall not be over 24 additional square feet beyond that permitted by section 15.44.090. Further,
when a ground sign is not applicable and the applicant demonstrates that one wall sign is not enough to
identify the business, the applicant may be granted an additional wall sign. The combined wall signs
shall not exceed the square footage bonus set forth in this section for one sign.
(3) Corner lot bonus.
a. Wall signs. Corner lots shall be provided 150 percent of the otherwise permitted total wall sign
area.

identifying the business. The sign must have a minimum sign face of two square feet. Otherwise, the
sign(s) must conform to the rules and regulations set forth in this chapter.

maintained by the city, county, state, or federal governments, shall be located in, project into, or overhang a
public right-of-way or dedicated public easement, unless otherwise authorized in this article.
(c) Sign heights. The highest point of any sign shall not exceed 35 feet above the ground or grade level. All
signs which project over a public or private road or walkway, directional signs, or a sign on a canopy, shall
have under clearance from the lowest point of the sign to the ground or grade level of not less than eight
feet.
(d) Traffic interference. No advertising device shall be erected or maintained which simulates or imitates in size,
color, lettering, or design any traffic sign or signal or other word, phrase, symbol, or character in such
manner as to interfere with, mislead, confuse or create a visual impediment or safety hazard to pedestrian or
vehicular traffic.
(e) Clear corner vision. No sign above a height of 30 inches shall be located within, project into, or overhang the
triangular area formed at the intersection of any two street right-of-way lines, existing or proposed, by a
straight line drawn between such right-of-way lines at a distance along each line of 25 feet from their point of
intersection, unless visual under clearance can be ensured on the plans.
(f) Proximity to electrical conductors. No sign shall be erected so that any part, including cables, guys, etc., will
be within ten feet of any electrical conductor, electric light pole, streetlamp, traffic light, or other public utility
pole or standard.
(g) Illumination. No sign shall be illuminated by other than approved devices, and in no case shall any open
spark or flame be used for display purposes unless specifically approved by the building. All illuminated
signs shall be so arranged or shielded so as not to interfere with the vision of persons on adjacent
thoroughfares and properties. In no event shall light from an illuminated sign shine on adjacent property
which is used for residential purposes. An illuminated sign must adhere to the design standards set forth in
section 15.44.150.
(h) Fire escapes. No signs of any kind shall be attached to or placed upon a building in such a manner as to
obstruct any fire escape.

more than 18 inches, and shall not project above or beyond the highest point of the roof or parapet.
(j) Freestanding signs. With respect to freestanding signs, components (supporting structures, backs, etc.) not
bearing a message shall be constructed of materials that blend with the surrounding environment or shall be
painted a neutral color to blend with the surrounding environment.

25 feet from any public right-of-way unless attached to a building or construction fence and shall be removed
upon completion of construction. No more than one construction sign is permitted per public right-of-way
frontage and placement shall be a minimum of 300 feet apart as measured along the right-of-way line.
(l) Liability insurance. If the vertical distance of a sign above the street is greater than the horizontal distance
from the sign to the street right-of-way line and is so located as to be able to fall or be pushed onto or impact
public property in any manner, then the owner of such sign shall keep in force a public liability insurance
policy in the amount of $100,000.00 for injury to one person and $300,000.00 for injury to more than one
person and property damage insurance in the amount of $25,000.00 for damage to property. In lieu of an
insurance policy as required in this subsection, an owner may present satisfactory proof to the City Attorney
that such owner is financially capable of self-insurance in the amounts described in this subsection.
Sec. 15.44.210  Substitution Clause
The owner of any sign which is otherwise allowed by this sign ordinance may substitute non-commercial copy
in lieu of any other commercial or non-commercial copy. This substitution of copy may be made without any
additional approval or permitting. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of
commercial speech over non-commercial speech, or favoring of any particular non-commercial message over any
other non-commercial message. This provision prevails over any more specific provision to the contrary.
Sec. 15.44.220 - Construction and maintenance requirements
(a) Materials and design. All signs shall be designed, constructed and maintained in conformity with the
provisions for materials, loads, and stresses of the state construction code and requirements of this chapter.
(b) Erector's imprint. Signs which require a permit under this chapter must carry the identification and address of
the sign erector, electrical voltage (when applicable), and date of erection in clearly legible letters whether for
the initial erection or rehanging of a sign. In case of rehanging or re-erection of any sign, the new erector
must place his identification, address and the date on the sign.
(c) Fastenings. All signs must be erected in such a manner and with such materials to remain safe and secure
during the period of use and all bolts, cables, and other parts of such signs shall be kept painted and free
from corrosion. Any defect due to the fault of the erector shall be repaired by the erector.
(d) Freestanding signs. Freestanding signs shall be securely fastened to the ground or to some other substantial
supportive structure so that there is no danger that either the sign or the supportive structure may be moved
by the wind or other forces and cause injury to persons or property.
(e) Sanitation and landscaping. Property surrounding any freestanding sign shall be kept clean, sanitary and
free from obnoxious and offensive substances, weeds, debris, rubbish, and flammable material. All plant
materials and other landscaping surrounding a freestanding sign shall be maintained on a regular basis,
including pruning, mowing, watering, fertilizing and replacement of dead and diseased materials.
(f) Maintenance. All signs and all their components, including, without limitation, supports, braces and anchors,
shall be kept in a state of good repair. Peeling or missing paint, holes, broken, cracked, bent, warped, rotted,
discolored, sagging, out-of-plumb, worn, rusted or missing material parts shall be repaired within ten days of
written notification of the building department.

$100.00 and more than $500.00 for each day the violation exists. If the violation involves the removal an
