Department. The applicant shall pay a fee established by the Council. No such background
check using the State Criminal Justice Information Systems Network (CJIS) and no information
obtained from the CJIS shall be disseminated unless the landlord presents an Informed
Consent/Waiver form signed by the prospective residents. The Informed Consent/Waiver form
must meet the requirements of Minn. Stat. Section 13.05, Subd. 4(d).

Minnesota and/or out of state criminal history/background checks on those persons applying for
positions as Block Captains in neighborhood watch programs, as volunteers in the McGruff
programs, personnel employed by schools and day care centers, staff employed by rental
property owners, and for positions in similar programs for which the Chief of Police determines
the check is appropriate. Applicants for these positions shall provide such information as the
Police Chief deems necessary to complete the check. No such check shall be conducted using
the State Criminal Justice Network and no information obtained from the check shall be
disseminated unless the applicant presents an Informed Consent/Waiver form signed by the

(Added Ord. 867 – 1987)
Brainerd City Code 320.01
Section 320 – Administrative Citations
Section 320.01 Purpose. The City Council determines that there is a need for alternative
methods of enforcing the City Codes. While criminal fines and penalties have been the most
frequent enforcement mechanism, there are certain negative consequences for both the City and
the accused. The delay inherent in that system does not ensure prompt resolution. Citizens
resent being labeled as criminals for violations of administrative regulations. The higher burden
of proof and the potential of incarceration do not appear appropriate for most administrative
violations. The criminal process does not always regard City Code violations as being important.
Accordingly, the City Council finds the use of administrative citations and the imposition of civil
penalties is a legitimate and necessary alternative method of enforcement. This method of
enforcement is in addition to any other legal remedy that may be pursued for City Code
violations.
Section 320.03 Alternative Methods of Enforcement. This administrative enforcement
procedure seeks to gain compliance with certain provisions of the City Code prior to any formal
criminal or civil court action. The administrative hearing process provided for in this Section
shall be in addition to any other legal or equitable remedy available to the City for City code
violations, except that if a determination is made by the hearing officer pursuant to the hearing
process detailed in Section 320.19 that a violation did not occur, the City may not then proceed
with criminal prosecution of the same act or conduct.
Section 320.05 Authority to Issue Order to Correct Letters and Administrative Citations.
The following City employees and agents are authorized to issue compliance letters and
administrative citations for violations of the City Codes:
1) Licensed peace officers, the Crime Prevention Specialist, and Community Service
Officers of the Brainerd Police Department;
2) City Building Official;
3) Building Inspectors;
4) Housing Inspector;
5) Animal Control Officer;
6) City Engineer;
7) City Planner;
8) Fire Chief, or Fire Inspector of the Brainerd Fire Department
Section 320.07 Administrative Offenses; Schedules of Fines and Fees.
Subd. 1 A violation of any provision of the City Code is an administrative offense which
may be subject to an administrative citation and civil penalties pursuant to this ordinance. Each
day a violation exists constitutes a separate offense.
Brainerd City Code 320.07 Subd. 2
Subd. 2 An administrative offense may be subject to a civil penalty not exceeding
$2,000.
Subd. 3 The City Council shall adopt by resolution a schedule of recommended fines for
offenses initiated by administrative citation. The City Council is not bound by that schedule
when a matter is appealed for administrative review.
Subd. 4 The City Council may adopt a schedule of fees to be paid to administrative
hearing officers.
Subd. 5 The City Council shall adopt written procedures for administering the
administrative citation program.
Section 320.09 Order to Correct; Administrative Citations. Upon the reasonable belief
that an administrative offense has occurred, the City officials listed in Section 320.05 shall serve
on the violator an order to correct the violation. If compliance is not achieved within the
timeline prescribed in the order to correct the violation, the official is authorized to issue an
administrative citation. An administrative citation shall be presented in person or by first class
mail to the person responsible for the violation. Service shall be deemed complete upon
depositing the citation in the U.S. Mail, properly addressed to last known address of the person
to be served and postage prepaid. The citation shall state the following: date, time and nature of
the offense, citing the relevant portion of the City Code that was allegedly violated, the amount
of the scheduled civil fine, and the manner for paying the fine, a statement that the City Code
violation and the amount of the administrative civil penalty may be contested to be heard before
an independent hearing officer by notifying the City Administrator or designated representative
in writing within 10 days of the date of the citation, and a statement that failure to pay the
administrative civil penalty may result in it being assessed against the property as provided in
Minnesota Statutes Chapter 429.
Section 320.11 Exceptions to Issuance of Order to Correct Letter. For violations of the
following sections, the City shall not be required to issue a compliance letter and may proceed
directly to the issuance of an administrative citation as provided in Section 320.09.
1) Repeat Offender. If the same owner commits a subsequent violation within 12
months after a compliance letter has been issued for the same or similar offense.
2) License Violations. For any license violations, including not having a license.
3) Traffic or Parking Violations. For traffic or parking violations issued under Sections
1300, 1305, 1310 and 1315 including obstruction of fire hydrants or fire lanes.
4) Animal Violations. For any violations of City Code Section 900.03 (Running at
Large) or City Code 900.21 (Dangerous Dogs).
5) Noise Violations. For any violation of City Code Section 2014 (Noise Related
Issues).
Brainerd City Code 320.13
Section 320.13 Reasonable Extensions. Following service of the compliance letter, the
City shall attempt to work with the owner to resolve the violation, including but not limited to
responding to reasonable extensions for compliance.
Section 320.15 Payment of Penalty and Correction of Violation. If the owner pays the
administrative civil penalty and corrects the City Code violation, no further action will be taken
against the owner or the owner’s real property for that same violation. If payment is made but
correction is not accomplished, a subsequent administrative citation may be issued, criminal
proceedings may be initiated, or any other proceedings or remedies available in order to enforce
correction of the violation. If no payment is made and no correction of the violation is made, the
City may assess the administrative civil penalty against the property owner pursuant to
Minnesota Statutes Chapter 429, issue a subsequent administrative citation and commence a new
administrative process, initiate criminal proceedings, or initiate other enforcement action
authorized by law, or a combination hereof.
Section 320.17 Request for Hearing. An owner or occupant may contest the
administrative citation and the amount of the fine by requesting a hearing, in writing, within 10
days of the date of the citation, to the City Administrator or designated representative.
Section 320.19 Administrative Hearing Procedures.
Subd 1. Hearing Officers. The City Council will periodically approve a list of lawyers,
from which the City Administrator will select a Hearing Officer to hear and determine a matter
for which the hearing is requested. The person who has requested the hearing has the right to
request, no later than 15 days before the date of the hearing, that the assigned Hearing Officer be
removed from the case. One such request for each case will be granted by the City
Administrator. A subsequent request must be directed to the assigned Hearing Officer who will
decide whether the Hearing Officer can fairly and objectively review the case. If such a finding
is made, the Hearing Officer shall remove himself or herself from the case, and the City
Administrator shall assign another Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer is not a judicial officer,
but is a public officer as defined by Minnesota Statutes, Section 609.415. The Hearing Officer
shall not be a current or former employee of the City of Brainerd.
Subd 2. Notice of Hearing. Notice of the hearing must be served in person or by first
class mail to the person responsible for the violation no less than 20 days in advance of the
scheduled hearing, unless a shorter time is accepted by both parties. Service shall be deemed
complete upon depositing the Notice of Hearing in the U.S. Mail, properly addressed to last
known address of the person to be served and postage prepaid.
Subd 3. Payment for Cost of Hearing. The cost of the hearing shall be borne solely by
the non-prevailing party. The City shall provide an estimate of the cost of the hearing at the time
of the request for hearing. The City Council has the authority to reduce the non-prevailing
party’s costs where that party can demonstrate indigency by clear and convincing evidence.
Brainerd City Code 320.19 Subd. 3 cont
Proof of indigency can be demonstrated by the party’s receipt of means tested governmental
benefits or a demonstrated lack of assets or current income. Such proof shall be presented to the
City Council for determination subsequent to the hearing. However, the Hearing Officer at the
time of the hearing shall make specific findings as to whether or not the party is indigent with
said findings presented to the City Council. In all cases, where the party requesting the hearing
is unable to attend and fails to request a continuance of the hearing at least 48 hours in advance
of the scheduled hearing, all costs incurred by the City attributable to the hearing shall be
charged to the requesting party.
Subd 4. Hearing Procedures. At the hearing, the parties shall have the opportunity to
present testimony and question any witnesses, but strict rules of evidence shall not apply. The
Hearing Officer shall record the hearing and receive testimony and exhibits and the full record of
the hearing shall be kept. The Hearing Officer shall receive and give weight to evidence,
including hearsay evidence, which possesses probative value commonly accepted by reasonable
and prudent people in the conduct of their affairs.
Subd 5. Authority of Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer has the authority to
determine that a violation did or did not occur, to dismiss a citation or impose the scheduled fine
or to reduce, stay or waive a scheduled fine either unconditionally or upon compliance with
appropriate conditions. When imposing a penalty for a violation, the hearing officer may
consider any or all of the following:
1) The duration of the violation;
2) The frequency or recurrence of the violation;
3) The seriousness of the violation;
4) The history of the violation;
5) The violator’s conduct after issuance of the notice of hearing;
6) The good faith effort of the violator to comply;
7) The economic impact of the penalty on the violator;
8) The impact of the violation upon the community;
9) Any other factors appropriate to a just result.
Subd 6. Fines for Continuing Violations. The Hearing Officer may exercise discretion to
impose a fine for more than one day of a continuing violation but only on a finding that the
violation caused a serious threat of harm to the public health, safety, or welfare, or the accused
intentionally and unreasonably refused to comply with the Code requirement. The Hearing
Officer’s decision and supporting reasons for continuing violations must be in writing.
Subd 7. Decision of the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer shall issue a decision in
writing to both parties within 10 days of the hearing. Any fines or penalties imposed must be
paid no later than 30 days of the date of the Hearing Officer’s order. If the fine is not paid, the
City may assess the civil penalty against the owner’s property pursuant to Minnesota Statutes
Chapter 429. If the Hearing Officer determines that no violation occurred, the City may not
proceed with criminal prosecution for the same act or conduct. The decision of the Hearing
Officer is final and may only be appealed to the Minnesota Court of Appeals by petitioning for a
writ of certiorari pursuant to Minnesota Statute Section 606.01.
Brainerd City Code 320.21
Section 320.21 Payment of fines. Prior to any assessment for unpaid fines, the City shall
seek payment of the fines by notifying the owner of the property in writing of the fine imposed.
Section 320.23 Assessment Procedure. Unpaid fines including an administrative charge
of $25.00 plus interest of the total balance will be assessed pursuant to Minnesota Statutes,
Chapter 429, against the property of the owner charged with the violation. For uncorrected or
continued violations, the City will correct the violation and assess the charges for doing so.

425.10 Title. These regulations shall be known as the Rental Housing Maintenance Code
of the City of Brainerd.
425.20 Scope. The provisions of this Code shall apply to all rental housing structures and
all existing premises and constitute minimum requirements and standards for premises,

from the elements, life safety, safety from fire and other hazards, and for safe and sanitary
maintenance; the responsibility of owners, operators and occupants; the occupancy of existing
structures and premises, and for administration, enforcement and penalties.
425.30 Findings. The Council finds there exists in the City numerous rental housing
properties that are substandard in one or more important features of structure, equipment,
maintenance, or occupancy. Such conditions adversely affect public health and safety and lead
to the continuation, extension, and aggravation of blight. Adequate protection of public health,
safety and welfare therefore requires the establishment and enforcement of minimum property
maintenance standards.
425.35 Intent It is not the intention of the City to intrude upon the fair and contractual
relationship between landlord and tenant. The City shall not intervene as an advocate of either
party, or act as an arbiter, nor be receptive to complaints from tenant or landlord, which are not
specifically and clearly relevant to the provisions of this Ordinance.

(o) Any violation as listed in Section 425.2020
(Amended Ord. 1320 – 2008, Ord. 1368 – 2010)
425.1920 Substandard Dwelling. A rental dwelling structure shall be considered
substandard if:
(a) The dwelling unit scores twenty-five (25) or more points; or
(b) Any major violation within the dwelling remains uncorrected. Any single
violation scoring six (6) or more points is considered a major violation.
For purposes of the point calculation in this section, any combination of four (4) rooming units
or shared bath units shall constitute one (1) dwelling unit. Points for a violation in a common
area of the structure outside a dwelling unit will not be cumulative on a unit-by-unit basis.
However, twenty-five (25) or more points in the common areas of a structure, including, but not
limited to, the entryways, corridors, community rooms, exterior walls and roof, will constitute a
substandard structure.
The Housing Inspector shall cause to be prepared and shall keep on file for public inspection an
accurate, complete, and detailed description of each violation used in the point calculation
procedure set forth herein. The Inspecting Officer shall assign points according to the severity of
each code violation on a scale from one up to the maximum points possible for such violation.
Except when otherwise provided by state law, conditions in the design or structure of a building,
such as, but not limited to, the size and dimension of rooms and windows and the electrical and
plumbing systems, that were legal under existing codes when built shall not be violations as long
as they are maintained in good repair. A violation shall receive maximum points when a
required item is completely absent, completely fails to perform its function, or is imminently
hazardous to the health or safety of the occupants.
Brainerd City Code 425.1920 continued
Each Code violation shall have a maximum number of points to be assigned based on the relative
life-safety hazard created by the code violation. The table of maximum violation points will be
established by the Building Official. The Housing Inspector will use the designated Housing
Inspection Form for the purpose of determining the existence of substandard dwellings.
425.1925 Reinspection Fee.
(a) There shall be no fee charged for an initial inspection to determine the
existence of a Rental Housing Maintenance Code violation or for the first
reinspection to determine compliance with the Code violation. A reinspection
fee, set by City Council resolution, shall be charged for each subsequent
reinspection that is conducted for compliance with an order, as determined by
the Housing Inspector or the Housing Inspector’s designee.
(b) The reinspection fee prescribed above shall be billed directly to the owner or
contact person/agent of the property. Reinspection fees shall be increased by
fifty (50) percent when not paid within thirty (30) days after initial billing, to
cover administrative costs. Failure to pay such fees shall be grounds for
denial, revocation, suspension, or non-renewal of a rental dwelling license.
This subsection shall not be considered the exclusive method of collecting
reinspection fees and shall not preclude collection by other lawful methods.
(c) Every notice of violation and order to correct Rental Housing Maintenance
Code violations shall contain a clear and conspicuous explanation of the
policy in this Section requiring fees for reinspections.
(d) The Housing Inspector may waive a reinspection fee in case of error, mistake,
injustice, or other good cause.
425.1930 Condemned and Boarded Buildings. When a building is condemned as hazardous
or unfit for human habitation due to defects in its structure or its electrical, plumbing, or
mechanical systems, or boarded under Minnesota Statutes, Section 463.251, requiring a Code
compliance inspection prior to re-occupancy, the rental dwelling license shall be revoked on the
effective date of the condemnation or boarding. The dwelling shall be eligible to hold a rental
dwelling license upon reinspection and correction of any violations that caused the building to be
condemned.
425.1935 Housing Inspector’s Determination of Noncompliance Notice.
(a) If the Housing Inspector determines that a building or dwelling unit fails to
meet the licensing standards set forth in Section 425.1910, or Section
425.1920, he or she shall mail a notice to the owner or the owner's agent. The
notice shall specify the reasons why the building or unit fails to meet the
licensing standards in Section 425.1910 or Section 425.1920 and shall include

has ten (10) days to correct the defects, after which the City Council will take
action to deny, refuse to renew, revoke, or suspend the license.
(c) If the rental dwelling fails to meet the standards set forth in Section 425.1920,
the notice shall indicate that the license holder or applicant has up to thirty
(30) days to correct the defects causing the building to be substandard, after
which the City Council will take action to deny, refuse to renew, revoke, or
suspend the license. The Housing Inspector may for good cause authorize
additional time to correct defects causing a building to be substandard. If the
defects create an imminent hazard to health or safety, the Housing Inspector
may proceed immediately for denial, non-renewal, revocation, or suspension
under Section 425.1940, or may shorten the deadline for compliance to less
than thirty (30) days.
(d) Whenever a notice of noncompliance is issued under this section, the housing
inspector shall also cause a notice to tenants to be prominently posted on the
building. The notice shall indicate that a license proceeding has been
commenced against the owner because the building has been found to be in
violation of the Rental Housing Maintenance Code; that after a stated period
of time allowed to bring the building into compliance, the city council may
proceed to deny, revoke, or suspend the rental dwelling license for the
building; that if the City Council denies, revokes, or suspends the license,
tenants may be required to vacate the building; that further information can be
obtained from the City of Brainerd Building Department.
(e) The Housing Inspector shall maintain copies of the notice of noncompliance
and send copies of the noncompliance notice to tenants at the time of posting
of the notice on the building.

the Housing Inspector has initiated an action to deny, revoke, suspend, or not renew a license
pursuant to section 425.2020, the Housing Inspector shall mail the owner a notice of denial, nonrenewal,
revocation, or suspension of the license. The notice shall state:
(a) That the Housing Inspector has determined that the building fails to comply
with the licensing standards for rental dwellings in Section 425.1910 and
Section 425.1920, that the licensee has failed to take appropriate action
following conduct by tenants and/or their guests on the licensed premises
under Section 425.2020, or that the licensee has failed to submit a written
management plan that satisfies the requirements set forth in 425.2020(d).

notice shall describe how an appeal may be filed under Section 425.1960.
(e) That after denial, non-renewal, revocation or suspension, the dwelling or the
affected dwelling units therein must be vacated, and shall not be reoccupied
until all violations are corrected and a license is granted by the City Council,
(except where an extension of time has been granted by the housing inspector
due to weather). Further, no license will be re-issued by the City Council until
an approved plan to control conduct on premises has been presented and
accepted by the City Council if the denial, non-renewal, revocation or
suspension was under Section 425.2020.
(f) The Housing Inspector shall cause a notice to tenants to be mailed or
delivered to each licensed dwelling unit and prominently posted on the
building. The notice shall indicate that the rental dwelling license for the
building has been denied, non-renewed, revoked, or suspended, whichever is
applicable; that the action will become final on a specific date unless the
building owner appeals and requests a hearing; that tenants may be required to
vacate the building when the action becomes final; that further information
can be obtained from the City of Brainerd Building Department.

(Added Ord. 1289 – 2006)
Brainerd City Code 445.01
Section 445 – Vacant Dwellings and Buildings
445.01 Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to regulate vacant and hazardous
dwellings and buildings in order to enhance the livability and preserve the tax base and property
values of buildings within the City by assuring that vacant buildings that are capable of
rehabilitation are adequately secured to prevent further dilapidation and those buildings that are
not capable of rehabilitation are promptly demolished.
445.03 Findings. The City Council finds, determines and declares that buildings which
remain vacant and unoccupied for an unreasonable period of time become an attractive nuisance
to children, a harborage for rodents, an invitation to derelicts, vagrants and criminals as a
temporary abode, and an increased fire hazard; that the owners of such buildings may permit the
buildings to become dilapidated since the buildings are often economically obsolete and the
owners of such buildings are unwilling to expend the necessary funds to secure the buildings;
that such buildings contribute to the growth of blight within the City, depress market values of
surrounding properties; require additional government services; constitutes an unreasonable use
and condition to the annoyance, discomfort and repose of a considerable number of the public,
and thus may constitute a nuisance condition. Adequate protection of the public health, safety
and welfare, therefore, requires the establishment and enforcement of the means by which such
nuisance conditions may be abated.
445.05 Securing Vacant Buildings. Subdivision 1. In general, if any building becomes
vacant or unoccupied and is deemed hazardous due to the fact that the building is open to
trespass and has not been secured and the building could be made safe by securing the building,
the Building Official may order the building secured and shall cause notice of the order to be
served upon the owner of the premises. Such notice may be served personally or by mail. Service
by mail is completed upon mailing a copy of the order to the owner, by first class mail, at the last
known address. If the owner fails to comply with the order within fourteen (14) days after the
order is served, the Building Official shall cause the building to be boarded up or otherwise
properly secured. Whenever a building is boarded up pursuant to the authority of this Section,
the building official may cause all openings to the building to be boarded and secured.
Subd. 2. Emergencies. When it is determined by the Building Official, the Chief of
Police, or the Fire Chief that an emergency exists with respect to the health or safety of persons
in the community, and immediate boarding and securing of a building is required, and where
danger will exist to children, transients or others in the absence of an immediate boarding or
securing of the building, the Building Official, or the Chief of Police, or the Fire Chief may
waive all requirements herein and immediately board or otherwise secure the building, provided
that:
(1) The conditions showing the existence of an emergency are documented by
the Building Official, Chief of Police, or Fire Chief or their designees.
Brainerd City Code 445.05 Subd. 2 (2)
(2) Notice is mailed immediately by the department invoking this Section to
the address of the owner and taxpayer, and, if recorded on the Assessor’s
rolls, the address of the mortgage holder, of the date of the boarding or
otherwise securing and the reasons therefore.
Subd. 3. After a vacant or unoccupied building has been boarded or otherwise secured
under this Section, should the owner fail to maintain the building in a secured condition until
such time as it has been repaired and occupied, the Building Official shall re-secure any openings
into the building whenever it becomes open to trespass, without further notice to the owner.
445.07 Collection of Costs. All costs incurred by the City for boarding or otherwise
securing a building under this Section, including, but not limited to the actual costs for boarding,
inspecting, posting, administration and monitoring the building shall be the responsibility of the
owner. Payment of the costs incurred by the City shall be due within thirty (30) days of such
notification. Upon default of payment after the thirty (30) days, the costs shall be levied and
collected as a special assessment against the property.

does not exceed the standards in Minnesota Rule7080.2150, Subp. 3(K).
455.35 Differences in Standards.
a) List of Different Adopted Standards.
1) In no land use district shall a building permit, shoreline alteration permit,
minor subdivision, plat, conditional use permit or variance be issued
without a current Certificate of Compliance or Certificate of Installation
that has not expired according to Section 37.26(C) of this ordinance.
2) At least one cleanout at or above finished grade shall be installed between
the structure and the septic tank with additional clean outs at intervals not
more than 100 feet.
3) Class I sizing is required on all new construction. New construction will
be defined as placement of a new structure or replacement structure that is
served by pressurized water.
4) Minimum septic tank sizing shall be 1,500 gallons. This can be
accomplished through a compartmentalized tank, multiple tanks in series,
or a single existing 1500 gallon tank with the use of an effluent filter for
the last baffle. The filter must be of such a design that when the filter is
removed from the filter housing, the flow of water leaving the tank is not
allowed. The first tank or compartment shall be no less than 1,000 gallons
in size and applies to new and replacement SSTS. Any additional septic
tanks shall be a minimum of 1,000 gallons. All other tank sizing shall
follow Minnesota Rule 7080.1930 with 1,500 gallon tank sizing replacing
1,000 gallon tank sizing for 3 bedrooms or less according to Table V.
5) Pump tank sizing shall follow Minnesota Rule 7080.2100.
6) Soil pits shall be required. The soil pit shall and be excavated to a depth
that will allow the verification of redoximorphic features and the three feet
of vertical separation as required. Location of soil pits shall be adjacent to
the lowest trench or next to the down slope side of an elevated treatment
area. The pit shall not impact the hydraulic performance of the ISTS. A
certificate of installation will not be issued until the soils are verified.
Soils may be verified by a licensed and certified inspector. The inspector
may not share the same license as the person who designed or installed the
system. The soil profile must be submitted to the county inspector or its
designee on the county approved form at or before the time of the
installation inspection. If the soil profile is not provided by the installation
Brainerd City Code 455.35
inspection, county staff will verify the soils via a soils pit during the
installation inspection.
7) All dwellings or buildings that contain plumbing fixtures shall meet the
required setbacks to the septic tank and soil absorption area. Accessory
structures, including but not limited to, decks, screen decks, porches,
sheds, garages and pole buildings shall not be required to meet said
setbacks provided that the tank(s) can be maintained properly and that the
structure does not negatively impact the function of the system.
455.37 Compliance Criteria for Existing SSTS. For an SSTS built before April 1, 1996,
and outside of areas designated as “SWF” – Systems in shoreland areas, wellhead protection
areas, or systems serving food, beverage, or lodging establishments – there must be at least two
feet of vertical separation between the bottom of the dispersal system and seasonal saturation or
bedrock.
455.39 Holding Tanks. Holding tanks may be allowed for the following applications: as
replacements for existing failing SSTS and SSTS that pose an imminent threat to public health or
safety, on lots with limitations that will not allow for the installation of a Type 1 SSTS or for
uses that are seasonal or intermittent in nature and will not use more than 150 gallons of water
per day.
455.41 Variance Requests. A property owner may request a variance from the standards
as specified in this ordinance pursuant to Article 8 of this Ordinance.
455.43 State Agency Variance Requests. Variances that pertain to the standards and

permit from the County is not required for minor repairs or replacements of
system components that do not alter the original function of the system;
change the treatment capacity of the system; change the location of the
system; or otherwise change the original system design, layout, or function.
Examples are, but not limited to, pumps, baffles, and effluent filters.
b) Activities Requiring a Land Use Permit from the County. A land use permit
from the County shall be obtained by the property owner or an agent of the
property owner from the County prior to the installation, construction,
replacement, modification, alteration, or capacity expansion including the use
of advanced treatment components of a SSTS. It is unlawful for any person to
construct, install, modify or replace a SSTS without the appropriate permit
from the Department including repair or replacement of components that will
alter the original function of the system, change the treatment capacity of the
Brainerd City Code 455.45
system, change the location of the system, or otherwise change the original
system’s design, layout, or function. The issuing of any permit, variance, or
conditional use under the provisions of this ordinance shall not absolve the
applicant of responsibility to obtain any other required permit.
c) Permit Requirements. Land Use Permit applications from the County shall be
made on forms provided by the Department and signed by the applicant or
applicant’s agent, and must include the following information and
documentation:

Use Permit for the replacement of SSTS failing to protect groundwater is valid
for 10 months. A Land Use Permit from the County for the replacement of
SSTS that are imminent threats to public health is valid for 10 months.
Satisfactory completion of construction shall be determined by as-built
drawings and a signed certification that the construction and installation of the
system was completed in reasonable conformance with the approved design
documents by a qualified employee of the Department or a licensed inspection
business, which is authorized by the Department and independent of the
owner and the SSTS installer.
g) Transferability. A Land Use Permit from the County may be transferred to a
new owner provided there are no proposed changes to the SSTS design.
h) Suspension or Revocation. The Department may suspend or revoke a Land
Use Permit from the County issued under this section for any false statements,
misrepresentations of facts on which the Land Use Permit was issued, or
unauthorized changes to the system design that alter the original function of
the system, change the treatment capacity of the system, change the location
of the system, or otherwise change the original system design, layout, or
function. A notice of suspension or revocation and the reasons for the
suspension or revocation shall be conveyed in writing to the permit holder. If
suspended or revoked, installation or modification of a treatment system may

Brainerd City Code 455.45
i) SSTS Assessment Requirements. For those SSTS without a management plan
or operating permit according to the provisions of this Article, the following
provisions apply:
1) The owner of an SSTS or the owner's agent shall regularly, but in no case
less frequently than every three years, assess whether sewage tanks leak
below the designed operating depth and whether sewage tank tops, riser
joints, and riser connections leak through visual evidence of major defects
and measure or remove the accumulations of scum, grease, and other
floating materials at the top of each septic tank and compartment, along
with the sludge, which consists of the solids denser than water.
2) All solids and liquids must be removed by pumping from all tanks or
compartments in which the top of the sludge layer is less than 12 inches
from the bottom of the outlet baffle or transfer hole or whenever the
bottom of the scum layer is less than three inches above the bottom of the
outlet baffle or transfer hole. Total sludge and scum volume must not be
greater than 25 percent of the tank's liquid capacity. Removal of
accumulated sludge, scum, and liquids from septic tanks and pump tanks
must be through the maintenance hole. The removal of solids from any
location other than the maintenance hole is not a compliant method of
solids removal from a sewage tank, and this method does not fulfill the
solids removal requirement of this part or a management plan. Liquid and
solids removal from clean-out pipes is allowed for holding tanks.
455.47 Operating Permit.
a) An Operating Permit shall be required for the following SSTS:
1) SSTS with high strength waste effluent standards that exceed Minnesota
Rule 7080.2150, Subp. 3(K);
2) Holding Tanks;
3) SSTS serving three or more connections;
4) Type 4 and Type 5 SSTS;
5) SSTS that exceed a daily flow of 2,500 gallons per day; or,
6) MSTS designed under Minnesota Rules Chapter 7081.
b) Operating Permits shall be a signed agreement between the Department and
the property owner and shall include monitoring, performance, mitigation, and
reporting requirements.
c) A valid Operating Permit shall be considered a certificate of compliance if
that system is in compliance with the requirements of the Operating Permit.
d) Owners of holding tanks shall provide the Department upon request a copy of
a valid monitoring and disposal contract executed between the owner and a
licensed maintenance business, which guarantees the removal of the holding

d) Steep Slopes. Before issuing a permit for the construction of roads,
driveways, structures, or other improvements on steep slopes, the slope must
be evaluated for possible soil erosion impacts and development visibility from
public waters. If necessary, the City shall impose conditions to prevent
erosion, preserve existing vegetative screening of structures, assuming
summer, leaf on vegetation. No excavation shall be made between the
building line and the water.
Brainerd City Code 515.03 Subd. 4 (4) (e)
e) Stairways, Lifts, and Landings.
i. Stairway and Lift Width. Stairways and lifts shall not exceed four feet
(4') in width on residential lots. Wider stairways may be used for
resort properties, public open space, recreational properties, and
Planned Unit Developments.
ii. Landing Area. Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must
not exceed thirty-two square feet in area.
iii. Construction Requirements. Stairways, lifts and landings may be
either constructed above the ground on posts or pilings, or placed into

insures control of soil erosion.
iv. Visibility Minimized. Stairways, lifts, and landings must be located to
minimize visibility from the public water, assuming summer leaf-on
condition.
v. Canopies or Roofs. Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways,
lifts, or landings.
vi. Facilities such as ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for physically
handicapped persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore
areas, provided that dimensional and performance standards are
complied with.
f) Decks. Decks not meeting the minimum structure setback requirement
existing on January 1, 1981, may be added to, provided the following criteria
are met:
i. The deck encroachment toward the ordinary high water level does not
exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the existing shoreline setback from the
ordinary high water level or does not encroach closer than thirty feet
(30'), whichever is more restrictive; and
ii. The deck is constructed primarily of untreated wood and is not roofed
or screened.
g) Commercial and Industrial Uses.
i. No new commercial, business or industrial uses shall be permitted
within any Mississippi Headwaters Zoning District, except for home
occupations permitted by conditional use permit, and congregate living
or foster care homes permitted by law.
Brainerd City Code 525.03 Subd. 4 (g) (ii)
ii. Non conforming commercial, business or industrial uses in existence
prior to their incorporation into any Mississippi Headwaters Zoning
District may be continued. No such use shall be expanded, changed,
enlarged or altered in a way which increases its non conformity, except
by conditional use permit. In granting the conditional use permit, the
City Council shall consider whether any detrimental impacts to water
quality and the environment can be mitigated. In considering
mitigation, the Council shall consider such factors as the direction of
gutters to storm sewers, limitation of direct drainage into the
Mississippi River, side yard plantings, reduction of tree removal,
correction of a failing individual sewage treatment system, decrease in
impervious area on site; shoreline maintenance pursuant to a plan
approved by the Department of Natural Resources or plantings
approved by the Department of Natural Resources to approve fish or
wildlife habitat.
h) Municipal Services City Code Provisions. All lands within any Mississippi
Headwaters Zoning District shall be subject to the City Code provisions
relating to the public water service and public sewerage service and shall be
serviced by public water service and public sewerage service as soon as
reasonably practical.
i) Docks. Docks may be built in compliance with Minnesota Department of
Natural Resources’ regulations.
Subd. 5. Natural Landscape Protection Plan.
1) Requirement. If necessary to protect water quality and prevent shoreline erosion and
agreed to by the property owner, and the Crow Wing County Soil and Water
Conservation District Office staff, a Natural Landscape Protection Plan shall be
completed and reviewed, consistent with the provisions of this Section.
2) The purpose of a Natural Landscape Protection Plan is to:
a) Retain or recreate original hydrologic conditions by minimizing use of
pavements and impervious surfaces and retaining original runoff volume and
velocities;
b) Confine development and construction activities to the least critical areas by
avoiding critical areas such as long, steep slopes, erodible soils, and fragile
vegetation;
c) Fit development to terrain;
Brainerd City Code 515.03 Subd. 5 (2) (d)
d) Preserve and utilize the natural drainage system;
e) Maintain a minimum of fifty foot (50') chemically untreated vegetative buffer
zone at the water's edge, as required in this Section;
f) Alteration of vegetation and topography should be limited to prevention of
erosion into public waters, fixation of nutrients, stabilization of shorelines,
preservation of historic, archeological or cultural values, prevention of bank
slumping, protection of fish and wildlife habitat and conservation of natural
resources; and
g) The landscape plan should be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential,
and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and
protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment
on site.
3) In achieving its purpose, the Natural Landscape Protection Plan shall address the
following issues:
a) Topography. A topographic map showing the existing contour elevations at
intervals of ten feet (10') is the basis of the Natural Landscape Protection Plan.
It is important to note slope steepness and slope length on this map. The
longer and the steeper the slope, the greater the erosion potential;
b) Drainage Patterns. Locate and clearly mark all existing drainage swales and
patterns on the topographic map. Consider where water will concentrate on
the property. Natural drainage areas are overland flows, depressions, swales,
and natural water courses. The natural drainage should be used to convey
runoff on and off the site, but increase runoff should be limited so erosion
does not occur.
c) Soils. Determine and show major soil types on the topographic map. Plot
directly on the map at the same scale for ease of interpretation. Soil types
should be evaluated for potential for flood hazard, natural drainage, dept to
seasonal water table, permeability, shrink swell potential, texture and
erodibility;
d) Ground Cover. Show the existing vegetation on the topographic map.
Features such as tree clusters, grassy areas, and unique vegetation should be
shown on the map. Any denuded or exposed soil areas should also be shown
on the topographic map. If at all possible, existing vegetation should be
maintained to minimize erosion. If existing vegetation cannot be maintained,
then construction should be staged, (one site completed before the second is
Brainerd City Code 525.03 Subd. 5 (3) (d) continued
begun), to minimize erosion. Alternatives are temporary seeding, mulching,
or temporary structure controls, such as settling basins, silt fences, or bale
dams. A vegetative buffer of natural grasses, shrubs and trees should be
maintained for at least twenty five feet (25') at the water's edge. This buffer
zone helps protect water quality, provide habitat for wildlife and maintains the
natural aesthetics of the shoreline; and
e) Adjacent Areas. Delineate areas adjacent to the site on the topographic map.
Such features as streams, roads, houses, or other buildings and wooded areas
should be shown. Streams which will receive runoff from the site should be
noted. Consider the potential for increased runoff during the construction and
where the runoff will go.
Subd. 6. Accessory Uses Within Mississippi Headwaters Corridor. All accessory uses
must meet or exceed structure setback standards. The term: "accessory uses" as used herein does
not include stairways, lifts, and docks. Each residential lot may have one water oriented
accessory use if all of the following standards are met:
1) The structure or facility must not exceed ten feet (10') in height, exclusive of safety
rails. The structure or facility cannot occupy an area greater than two hundred and
fifty (250) square feet, or, if used solely for watercraft storage, including storage of
related boating and water oriented sporting equipment, may occupy an area up to four
hundred (400) square feet, provided the maximum width of the structure is twenty
feet (20') as measured parallel to the configuration of the shoreline. Detached decks
must not exceed eight feet (8') above grade at any point.
2) The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high water mark shall not be
less than the setback of the primary building, except by conditional use permit.
3) The structure or facility must be treated to reduce visibility as viewed from public
waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography, increased setbacks, color,
or other means.
4) The roof may be used as a deck with safety rails, but must not be enclosed or used as
a storage area.
5) The accessory use must not be designed or used for human habitation and must not
contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities.
Subd. 7. Stormwater Management Plans in Mississippi Headwaters Corridor.
1) Consideration. Proper stormwater management must be considered in all reviews,
approvals, and permits related to this Section. A Stormwater Management Plan shall
be submitted with any application.
Brainerd City Code 525.03 Subd. 7 (2)
2) Review Provisions. The following provisions shall be considered in reviewing proper
stormwater management:
a) Natural Features to be Used. Existing natural drainage ways, wetlands, and
vegetated soils must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain stormwater
runoff before discharge to public waters.
b) Constructed Facilities May Be Used. When development density, topographic
features, and soil and vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately
handle stormwater runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types
of constructed facilities such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices,
dikes, waterways, and ponds may be used. Preference must be given to
designs using surface drainage, vegetation and infiltration rather than buried
pipes and man made materials and facilities.
c) Minimize Disturbance. Development must be planned and conducted in a
manner that will minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities,
erosion potential, and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must
be stabilized and protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used
to retain sediment on site.
d) New Development or Expanded Development. New development must meet
the following standards:
i. Impervious surface coverage of the lot must not exceed twenty-five
percent (25%) of total area;
ii. Facilities constructed for stormwater management must be consistent
with the field office technical guide of the Crow Wing County Soil and
Water Conservation District;
iii. Stormwater outfalls to the Mississippi River must provide for filtering
or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface debris before
discharge; and
iv. A Natural Landscape Protection Site Plan must be prepared to guide
construction and lot development in accordance with this Section.
Subd. 8. Shoreland Alteration Within the Mississippi Headwater Corridor.
1) Purpose. Alterations of vegetation and topography will be regulated to prevent
erosion to public waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic
values, prevent bank slumping, preserve a corridor for movement of wildlife, protect
fish and wildlife habitat, conserve cultural resources, and to preserve the scenic and
aesthetic character of the shoreland within the Mississippi Headwaters Corridor.
Brainerd City Code 525.03 Subd. 8 (2)
2) Vegetative Management Provisions.
a) Intensive Vegetation Clearing. Intensive vegetation clearing within the
setback and Bluff Impact Zones and on steep slopes is not allowed.
b) Limited Clearing. In setback areas and Bluff Impact Zones and on steep
slopes, limited clearing of trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning, and trimming
of trees is allowed to provide a view to the water from the principal dwelling
site and to accommodate the placement of stairways, landings, and access
paths, provide that:
i. The screening of structures, vehicles, or other facilities as viewed from
the water, assuming summer, leaf on conditions, is maintained;
ii. Shading of water surfaces is maintained; and
iii. The above provisions are not applicable to the removal of trees, limbs,
or branches that are dead, diseased, or pose safety hazards.
c) Shoreland alteration should avoid negative impacts, such as use of steep
slopes; increased soil erosion; development visibility; preservation of existing
vegetative screening from the Mississippi River, assuming summer leaf-on
conditions, avoidance of wetlands; avoidance of excavation between the
building line and the Mississippi River, avoidance of intensive vegetative
clearing within the setback; shading of water surfaces should be maintained or
enhances; limitation of impermeable material to no more than twenty five
percent (25%) of the building site; management of long-lived species along
the river front shall be directed toward promotion of large sized trees by using
rotations based on biological age rather than economic age; cuttings shall be
conducted in compliance with a natural landscape protection plan and best
management practices.
Subd. 9. Grading, Filling, Alterations in the Bed of Public Water Within the Mississippi
Headwaters Corridor.
1) Permit Required. Any grading or filling work done within the Mississippi Headwaters
Corridor Districts, controlled by this Section, shall require a permit and shall comply
with the following:
a) Grading and filling of the natural topography which is not accessory to a
permitted or conditional use maybe permitted if consistent with the Natural
Landscape Protection Plan;
Brainerd City Code 525.03 Subd. 9 (1) (b)
b) Grading and filling of the natural topography which is accessory to a
permitted or conditional use shall not be conducted without a grading and
filling permit. A grading and filling permit may be issued only if the
following conditions of Part 2, (i.e., "Standards") of this subdivision are met.
Grading and filling shall be performed in a manner which minimizes earth
moving, erosion, storm water run-off, tree clearing, and the destruction of
natural amenities. Excavation, on lots abutting the Mississippi River shall not
be permitted, between the building line and the ordinary high water mark.
2) Standards. Grading and filling of the natural topography shall also meet the
following standards:
a) The smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for as short a time as feasible;
b) Temporary ground cover, such as mulch, is used until a permanent ground
cover, such as sod, is planted;
c) Methods to prevent erosion and to trap sediment are employed;
d) Fill is stabilized to accepted engineering standards;
e) Fill or excavated material is not placed in a manner that creates an unstable
slope;
f) Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes is reviewed by a
licensed engineer for continued slope stability and in no case may create
finished slopes of thirty percent (30%) or greater;
g) Fill or excavated materials are not placed in Bluff Impact Zones;
h) Disturbed areas are restored in the same building season.
3) Altering Current or Cross Section of Public Waters. Excavation of material from,
filling in construction of any permanent structures or navigational obstructions, or any
work that will change or diminish the course, current, or cross section of the
Mississippi River is prohibited unless authorized by a permit from the Commissioner
of Natural Resources or the Army Corps of Engineers.
4) Drainage or Filling of Wetlands. Drainage or filling in of wetlands is not allowed
within the Mississippi Headwaters Corridor under this Section except by conditional
use permit, and upon notification to and approval by the Soil and Water Conservation
District.

design and construction techniques and farming practices are used in
accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. Where specific information is
not available, steep slopes are lands having average slopes over 12 percent, as
measured over horizontal distances of 50 feet or more that are not bluffs.
Brainerd City Code 530.03 Subd. 7 (kk)
kk) Structure. "Structure" means any building or appurtenance, including decks,
except aerial or underground utility lines, such as sewer, electric, telephone,
telegraph, gas lines, towers, poles, and other supporting facilities.
ll) Subdivision. "Subdivision" means land that is divided for the purpose of sale,
rent, or lease, including planned unit developments.
mm) Surface water-oriented commercial use. "Surface water-oriented
commercial use" means the use of land for commercial purposes, where access
to and use of a surface water feature is an integral part of the normal
conductance of business. Marinas, resorts, and restaurants with transient
docking facilities are examples of such use.
nn) Toe of the bluff. "Toe of the bluff" means the lower point of a 50-foot segment
with an average slope exceeding 18 percent.
oo) Top of the bluff. "Top of the bluff" means the higher point of a 50-foot
segment with an average slope exceeding 18 percent.
pp) Variance. "Variance" means the same as that term is defined or described in
Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 394 (for counties) or Chapter 462 (for
municipalities).
qq)Water-oriented accessory structure or facility. "Water-oriented accessory
structure or facility" means a small, above ground building or other
improvement, except stairways, fences, docks, and retaining walls, which,
because of the relationship of its use to a surface water feature, reasonably
needs to be located closer to public waters than the normal structure setback.
Examples of such structures and facilities include boathouses, gazebos, screen
houses, fish houses, pump houses, and detached decks.
rr) Wetland. "Wetland" means a surface water feature classified as a wetland in
the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Circular No. 39 (1971 edition).
530.05 Administration. Subdivision 1. Permits Required.
a) A permit is required for the construction of buildings or building additions (and
including such related activities as construction of decks and signs), the
installation and/or alteration of sewage treatment systems, and those grading
and filling activities not exempted by Section 530.09, Subd. 3 of this Ordinance.
Application for a permit shall be made to the Zoning Administrator and or
Building Official on the forms provided. The application shall include the
necessary information so that the Zoning Administrator can determine the site's
suitability (ie. Such as slopes, soils, fragile vegetation, topography, and etc.) for
the intended use and that a compliant sewage treatment system will be
provided.
Brainerd City Code 530.05 Subd. 1 (b)
b) A permit authorizing an addition to an existing structure shall stipulate that an
identified nonconforming sewage treatment system, as defined by 530.09 Subd.
8, shall be reconstructed or replaced in accordance with the provisions of this
Ordinance.
Subd. 2. Certificate of Occupancy. The Building Official shall issue a Certificate of
Occupancy for each activity requiring a permit as specified in Section 530.05, Subd. 1 of this
Ordinance. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that authorized by permit shall
be deemed a violation of this Ordinance and shall be punishable as provided in Section 530.03,
Subd. 3 of this Ordinance.
Subd. 3. Variances.
a) Variances may only be granted in accordance with Minnesota Statutes, Chapter
462, as applicable. A variance may not circumvent the general purposes and
intent of this ordinance. No variance may be granted that would allow any use
that is prohibited in the zoning district in which the subject property is located.
Conditions may be imposed in the granting of a variance to ensure compliance
and to protect adjacent properties and the public interest. In considering a
variance request, the Planning Commission must also consider whether the
property owner has reasonable use of the land without the variance, whether the
property is used seasonally or year-round, whether the variance is being
requested solely on the basis of economic considerations, and the characteristics
of development on adjacent properties.
b) The Planning Commission shall hear and decide requests for variances in
accordance with public health, safety, wellbeing, and the rules that it has
adopted for the conduct of business. When a variance is approved after the
Department of Natural Resources has formally recommended denial in the
hearing record, the notification of the approved variance required in Section
530.05, Subd. 4 b), below shall also include the Planning Commission’s
summary of the public record/testimony and the findings of facts and
conclusions which supported the issuance of the variance.
c) For existing developments, the application for variance must clearly
demonstrate whether a conforming sewage treatment system is present for the
intended use of the property. The variance, if issued, must require
reconstruction of a nonconforming sewage treatment system.
Brainerd City Code 530.05 Subd. 4
Subd. 4. Notifications to the Department of Natural Resources.
a) Copies of all notices of any public hearings to consider variances, amendments,
or conditional uses under local shoreland management controls must be sent to
the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designated representative and
postmarked at least ten days before the hearings. Notices of hearings to
consider proposed subdivisions/plats must include copies of the
subdivision/plat.
b) A copy of approved amendments and subdivisions/plats, and final decisions
granting variances or conditional uses under local shoreland management
controls must be sent to the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designated
representative and postmarked within ten days of final action.

3) Use and Upgrading of Inconsistent Land Use Districts.
a) The land use districts adopted in Ordinance Number 812,
Section 515.37 – 515.39, as they apply to shoreland areas, and
their delineated boundaries on the Official Zoning Map, are not
consistent with the land use district designation criteria specified
in Section 530.07 herein. These inconsistent land use district
designations may continue until revisions are proposed to
change either the land use district designation within an existing
land use district boundary shown on the Official Zoning Map or
to modify the boundary of an existing land use district shown on
the Official Zoning Map.
b) When a revision is proposed to an inconsistent land use district
provision, the following additional criteria and procedures along
with a Conditional Use Permit application shall apply:
1) For Lakes. When a revision to a land use district
designation on a lake is considered, the land use district
boundaries and use provisions therein for all the
shoreland areas within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance
on said lake must be revised to make them substantially
compatible with the framework in Sections 530.07 of
this Ordinance.
Brainerd City Code 530.07 Subd. 3 (b) (3) (b) (2)
2) For Rivers and Streams. When a revision to a land use
district designation on a river or stream is proposed, the
land use district boundaries and the use provisions
therein for all shoreland on both sides of the river or
stream within the same classification within the
jurisdiction of this Ordinance must be revised to make
them substantially compatible with the framework in
Sections 530.07 of this Ordinance. If the same river
classification is contiguous for more than a five-mile
segment, only the shoreland for a distance of 2.5 miles
upstream and downstream, or to the class boundary if
closer, need be evaluated and revised.
c) When an interpretation question arises about whether a specific
land use fits within a given "use" category the interpretation
shall be made by the Board of Adjustment. When a question
arises as to whether a land use district's boundaries are properly
delineated on the Official Zoning Map, this decision shall be
made by the City Council.
d) When a revision is proposed to an inconsistent land use district
provision by an individual party or landowner, this individual
party or landowner will only be responsible to provide the
supporting and/or substantiating information for the specific
parcel in question. The City Council will direct the Zoning
Administrator to provide such additional information for this
water body as is necessary to satisfy Items A and B above.
e) The City Council must make a detailed finding of fact and
conclusion when taking final action that this revision, and the
upgrading of any inconsistent land use district designations on
said water body, are consistent with the enumerated criteria and
use provisions of Section 530.07, Subd. 2.
Brainerd City Code 530.09

Quad* 500 250 250
d) Additional Special Provisions
1) Residential subdivisions with dwelling unit densities exceeding those in
the tables in Sections 530.13 (Subdivision and Platting) can only be
allowed if designed and approved as residential planned unit
developments under Section 530.15 of this Ordinance. Only land above
the ordinary high water level of public waters can be used to meet lot
area standards, and lot width standards must be met at both the ordinary
high water level and at the building line. The sewer lot area dimensions
in Section 530.09 can only be used if publicly owned sewer system
service is available to the property.
2) Subdivisions of duplexes, triplexes, and quads on Natural Environment
Lakes must also meet the following standards:
a) Each building must be set back at least 200 feet from the
ordinary high water level;
Brainerd City Code 530.09 Subd. 1 (d) (2) (b)
b) Each building must have common sewage treatment and water
systems in one location and serve all dwelling units in the
building;
c) Watercraft docking facilities for each lot must be centralized in
one location and serve all dwelling units in the building; and
d) No more than 25 percent of a lake’s shoreline can be in duplex,
triplex, or quad developments.
3) One guest cottage may be allowed on lots meeting or exceeding the
duplex lot area and width dimensions and zoning as presented in Section
530.09, provided the following standards are met:
a) For lots exceeding the minimum lot dimensions of duplex lots,
the guest cottage must be located within the smallest
duplex-sized lot that could be created including the principal
dwelling unit;
b) A guest cottage must not cover more than 700 square feet of
land surface and must not exceed 15 feet in height; and
c) A guest cottage must be located or designed to reduce its
visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands
by vegetation, topography, increased setbacks or color,
assuming summer leaf-on conditions.
4) Controlled Access Lots (access to public waters or recreation areas for
use by owners of non riparian lots within subdivisions) are prohibited.
Subd. 2. Placement, Design, and Height of Structures.
a) Placement of Structures on Lots. When more than one setback applies to a site,
structures and facilities must be located to meet all setbacks. Where structures
exist on the adjoining lots on both sides of a proposed building site, structure
setbacks may be altered with a variance to conform to the adjoining setbacks
from the ordinary high water level, provided the proposed building site is not
located in a shore impact zone or in a bluff impact zone. Structures shall be
located as follows.
1) Structure and On-site Sewage System Setbacks (in feet) from Ordinary
High Water Level*.

Unplatted Cemetery; 50
Right-of-way line of federal, state, 50
or county highway; and
Right-of-way line of town road, 50
public street, or other roads or
streets not classified
3) Bluff Impact Zones. Structures and accessory facilities, except
stairways and landings, must not be placed within bluff impact zones.
4) Uses Without Water-oriented Needs. Uses without water-oriented
needs must be located on lots or parcels without public waters frontage,
or, if located on lots or parcels with public waters frontage, must either
be set back double the normal ordinary high water level setback or be
substantially screened from view from the water by vegetation or
topography, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
Brainerd City Code 530.09 Subd. 2 (b)
b) Design Criteria for Structures.
1) High Water Elevations. Structures must be placed in accordance with
any floodplain regulations applicable to the site. Where these controls
do not exist, the elevation to which the lowest floor, including basement,
is placed or flood-proofed must be determined as follows:
a) for lakes, by placing the lowest floor at a level at least three feet
above the highest known water level, or three feet above the
ordinary high water level, whichever is higher;
b) for rivers and streams, by placing the lowest floor at least three
feet above the flood of record, if data are available. If data are
not available, by placing the lowest floor at least three feet above
the ordinary high water level, or by conducting a technical
evaluation to determine effects of proposed construction upon
flood stages and flood flows and to establish a flood protection
elevation. Under all three approaches, technical evaluations
must be done by a qualified engineer or hydrologist consistent
with parts 6120.5000 to 6120.6200 governing the management
of flood plain areas. If more than one approach is used, the
highest flood protection elevation determined must be used for
placing structures and other facilities; and
c) water-oriented accessory structures are prohibited.
2) Stairways, Lifts, and Landings. Stairways and lifts are the preferred
alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access up and
down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts must
meet the following design requirements:
a) stairways and lifts must not exceed four feet in width on
residential lots. Wider stairways may be used for commercial
properties, public open-space recreational properties, and
planned unit developments;
b) landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must not
exceed 32 square feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square
feet may be used for commercial properties, public open-space
recreational properties, and planned unit developments;
c) stairways, lifts, and landings may be either constructed above
the ground on posts or pilings, or placed into the ground,
provided they are designed and built in a manner that ensures
control of soil erosion;
Brainerd City Code 530.09 Subd. 2 (b) (2) (d)
d) stairways, lifts, and landings must be located in the most visually
inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the
public water assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever
practical; and
e) facilities such as ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for physically
handicapped persons are also allowed for achieving access to
shore areas, provided that the dimensional and performance
standards of items 1 to 5 are complied with in addition to the
requirements of Minnesota Regulations, Chapter 1340.
3) Significant Historic Sites. No structure may be placed on a significant
historic site in a manner that affects the values of the site unless
adequate information about the site has been removed and documented
in a public repository.
4) Steep and long gradual Slopes. The City Engineer must evaluate
possible soil erosion impacts and development visibility from public
waters before issuing a permit for construction of sewage treatment
systems, roads, driveways, structures, or other improvements on steep
slopes. When determined necessary, conditions must be attached to
issued permits to prevent erosion and to preserve existing vegetation
screening of structures, vehicles, and other facilities as viewed from
the surface of public waters, assuming summer leaf-on vegetation.
c) Height of Structures. All structures in residential districts, except churches and
nonresidential agricultural structures, must not exceed 25 feet in height.
Subd. 3. Shoreland Alterations. Alterations of vegetation and topography will be regulated
to prevent erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic
values, prevent bank slumping, and protect fish and wildlife habitat.
a) Vegetation Alterations.
1) Vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of structures and
sewage treatment systems and the construction of roads and parking
areas regulated by Section 530.09 of this Ordinance are exempt from the
vegetation alteration standards that follow:
2) Removal or alteration of vegetation, except for agricultural and forest
management uses as regulated in Sections 530.09, respectfully, is
allowed subject to the following standards:
Brainerd City Code 530.09 Subd. 3 (a) (2) (a)
a) Intensive vegetation clearing within the shore and bluff impact
zones and on steep and long gradual slopes is not allowed.
Intensive vegetation clearing for forest land conversion to
another use outside of these areas is allowable as a conditional
use if an erosion control and sedimentation plan is developed
and approved by the soil and water conservation district in
which the property is located.
b) In shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes, limited
clearing of trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning, and trimming
of trees is allowed to provide a view to the water from the
principal dwelling site and to accommodate the placement of
stairways and landings, picnic areas, access paths, livestock
watering areas, and beach and watercraft access areas, provided
that:
1) the screening of structures, vehicles, or other facilities as
viewed from the water, assuming summer, leaf-on
conditions, is not substantially reduced;
2) along rivers, existing shading of water surfaces is
preserved; and
3) the above provisions are not applicable to the removal of
trees, limbs, or branches that are dead, diseased, or pose
safety hazards.
b) Topographic Alterations/Grading and Filling.
1) Grading and filling and excavations necessary for the construction of
structures, sewage treatment systems, and driveways under validly
issued construction permits for these facilities do not require the
issuance of a separate grading and filling permit. However, the grading
and filling standards in this Section must be incorporated into the
issuance of permits for construction of structures, sewage treatment
systems, and driveways.
2) Public roads and parking areas are regulated by Section 530.09 of this
Ordinance.
3) Notwithstanding, a grading and filling permit will be required for:
a) The movement of any material on steep slopes or within shore or
bluff impact zones: and
Brainerd City Code 530.09 Subd. 3 (b) (3) (b)
b) the movement of more than 50 cubic yards of material outside of
steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones.
4) The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to during
the issuance of construction permits, grading and filling permits,
conditional use permits, variances and subdivision approvals:
a) Grading or filling in any type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 wetland must
be evaluated to determine how extensively the proposed activity
would affect the following functional qualities of the wetland*:
1) Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention;
2) Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce flood
damage;
3) Fish and wildlife habitat;
4) Recreational use;
5) Shoreline or bank stabilization; and
6) Noteworthiness, including special qualities such as
historic significance, critical habitat for endangered
plants and animals, or others.
* This evaluation must also include a determination of whether the
wetland alteration being proposed requires permits, reviews, or
approvals by other local, state, or federal agencies such as a
watershed district, the Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources, or the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The
applicant will be so advised.
b) Alterations must be designed and conducted in a manner that
ensures only the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for
the shortest time possible;
c) Mulches or similar materials must be used, where necessary, for
temporary bare soil coverage, and a permanent vegetation cover
must be established as soon as possible;
d) Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments before
they reach any surface water feature must be used;
Brainerd City Code 530.09 Subd. 3 (b) (4) (e)

standards consistent with the field office technical guides of the
local soil and water conservation districts and the United States
Soil Conservation Service;
f) Fill or excavated material must not be placed in a manner that
creates an unstable slope;
g) Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes must be
reviewed by qualified professionals for continued slope stability
and must not create finished slopes of 30 percent or greater;
h) Fill or excavated material must not be placed in bluff impact
zones;
i) Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of public
waters must first be authorized by the commissioner under
Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G;
j) Alterations of topography must only be allowed if they are
accessory to permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely
affect adjacent or nearby properties; and
k) Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading of
the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the
finished slope does not exceed three feet horizontal to one foot
vertical, the landward extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the
ordinary high water level, and the height of the riprap above the
ordinary high water level does not exceed three feet.
5) Connections to public waters. Excavations where the intended purpose
is connection to a public water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons, and
harbors, must be controlled by local shoreland controls. Permission for
excavations may be given only after the commissioner has approved the
proposed connection to public waters.
Subd. 4. Placement and Design of Roads, Driveways, and Parking Areas.
a) Public and private roads and parking areas must be designed to take advantage
of natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening from view
from public waters. Documentation must be provided by a qualified individual
that all roads and parking areas are designed and constructed to minimize and
control erosion to public waters consistent with the field office technical guides
of the local soil and water conservation district, or other applicable technical
materials.
Brainerd City Code 530.09 Subd. 4 (b)
b) Roads, driveways, and parking areas must meet structure setbacks and must not
be placed within bluff and shore impact zones, when other reasonable and
feasible placement alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist, they may be
placed within these areas, and must be designed to minimize adverse impacts.
c) Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads, and access-related
parking areas may be placed within shore impact zones provided the vegetative
screening and erosion control conditions of this subpart are met. For private
facilities, the grading and filling provisions of Section 530.09 of this ordinance
must be met.
Subd. 5. Stormwater Management. The following general and specific standards shall
apply:
a) General Standards.
1) When possible, existing natural drainage ways, wetlands, and vegetated
soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain storm water
runoff before discharge to public waters.
2) Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion
potential, and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must
be stabilized and protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods
used to retain sediment on the site.
3) When development density, topographic features, and soil and
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle storm
water runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types of
constructed facilities such as diversions, settling basins, skimming
devices, dikes, waterways, and ponds may be used. Preference must be
given to designs using surface drainage, vegetation, and infiltration
rather than buried pipes and man-made materials and facilities.
b) Specific Standards.
1) Impervious surface coverage of lots must not exceed 25 percent of the
lot area nor 0% of the Shore Impact zone.
2) When constructed facilities are used for storm water management,
documentation must be provided by a qualified individual that they are
designed and installed consistent with the field office technical guide of
the local soil and water conservation districts.
Brainerd City Code 530.09 Subd. 5. (b) (3)
3) New constructed storm water outfalls to public waters must provide
for filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface
debris before discharge.

1) Surface water-oriented commercial uses and industrial, public, or
semipublic uses with similar needs to have access to and use of public
waters may be located on parcels or lots with frontage on public
waters. Those uses with water-oriented needs must meet the following
standards:
a) in addition to meeting impervious coverage limits, setbacks, and
other zoning standards in this Ordinance, the uses must be
designed to incorporate topographic and vegetative screening of
parking areas and structures;
b) uses that require short-term watercraft mooring for patrons must
centralize these facilities and design them to avoid obstructions
of navigation and to be the minimum size necessary to meet the
need; and
c) uses that depend on patrons arriving by watercraft may use signs
and lighting to convey needed information to the public, subject
to the following general standards and all other Brainerd sign
standards:
1) no advertising signs or supporting facilities for signs
may be placed in or upon public waters. Signs conveying
information or safety messages may be placed in or on
public waters by a public authority or under a permit
issued by the County Sheriff;
2) signs may be placed, when necessary, within the shore
impact zone if they are designed and sized to be the
minimum necessary to convey needed information.
They must only convey the location and name of the
establishment and the general types of goods or services
available. The signs must not contain other detailed
information such as product brands and prices, must not
Brainerd City Code 530.09 Subd. 6 (a) (1) (c) (2) continued
be located higher than ten feet above the ground, and
must not exceed 32 square feet in size unless it is zoned
residential and it shall comply with Zoning Ordinance
section 515.47. If illuminated by artificial lights, the
lights must be shielded or directed to prevent
illumination out across public waters; and
3) other outside lighting may be located within the shore
impact zone or over public waters if it is used primarily
to illuminate potential safety hazards and is shielded or
otherwise directed to prevent direct illumination out
across public waters. This does not preclude use of
navigational lights. Section 515.63 of the Brainerd
Zoning Ordinance also applies.
2) Uses without water-oriented needs must be located on lots or parcels
without public waters frontage, or, if located on lots or parcels with
public waters frontage, must either be set back double the normal
ordinary high water level setback or be substantially screened from view
from the water by vegetation or topography, assuming summer, leaf-on
conditions.
b) Agriculture Use Standards.
1) General cultivation farming, grazing, nurseries, horticulture, truck
farming, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting are permitted uses if
steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones are maintained in
permanent vegetation or operated under an approved conservation plan
(Resource Management Systems) consistent with the field office
technical guides of the local soil and water conservation districts or the
United States Soil Conservation Service, as provided by a qualified
individual or agency. The shore impact zone for parcels with
permitted agricultural land uses is equal to a line parallel to and 50 feet
from the ordinary high water level.
2) Animal feedlots are not allowed within the Shoreland Management
areas.
c) Forest Management Standards.
1) The harvesting of timber and associated reforestation must be
conducted consistent with the provisions of the Minnesota Non-point

d) Extractive Use Standards.
1) Site Development and Restoration Plan. An extractive use site
development and restoration plan must be developed, approved, and
followed over the course of operation of the site. The plan must address
dust, noise, possible pollutant discharges, hours and duration of
operation, and anticipated vegetation and topographic alterations. It
must also identify actions to be taken during operation to mitigate
adverse environmental impacts, particularly erosion, and must clearly
explain how the site will be rehabilitated after extractive activities end.
2) Setbacks for Processing Machinery. Processing machinery must be
located consistent with setback standards for structures from ordinary
high water levels of public waters and from bluffs.
e) Mining of Metallic Minerals. Mining of metallic minerals, as defined in
Minnesota Statutes, sections 93.44 to 93.51, shall be a conditional use provided
the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, sections 93.44 to 93.51, are satisfied.
Subd. 7. Conditional Uses. Conditional uses allowable within shoreland areas shall be
subject to the review and approval procedures, and criteria and conditions for review of conditional
uses established community-wide. The following additional evaluation criteria and conditions
apply within shoreland areas:
a) Evaluation criteria. A thorough evaluation of the water body and the
topographic, vegetation, and soils conditions on the site must be made to
ensure:
1) the prevention of soil erosion or other possible pollution of public
waters, both during and after construction;
2) the visibility of structures and other facilities as viewed from public
waters is limited;
3) the site is adequate for water supply and on-site sewage treatment; and
4) the types, uses, and numbers of watercraft that the project will
generate are compatible in relation to the suitability of public waters to
safely accommodate these watercraft.
Brainerd City Code 530.09 Subd. 7 (b)
b) Conditions attached to conditional use permits. The City Council, upon
consideration of the criteria listed above and the purposes of this ordinance,
shall attach such conditions to the issuance of the conditional use permit as it
deems necessary to fulfill the purposes of this Ordinance. Such conditions may
include, but are not limited to, the following:
1) increased setbacks from the ordinary high water level;
2) limitations on the natural vegetation to be removed or the requirement
that additional vegetation be planted; and
3) special provisions for the location, design, and use of structures,
sewage treatment systems, watercraft launching and docking areas,
and vehicle parking areas.
Subd. 8. Water Supply and Sewage Treatment.
a) Water Supply. Any public or private supply of water for domestic purposes
must meet or exceed standards for water quality of the Minnesota Department
of Health and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.
b) Sewage treatment. Any premises used for human occupancy must be provided
with an adequate method of sewage treatment, as follows:
1) Publicly-owned sewer systems must be used where available.
2) All private sewage treatment systems must meet or exceed the
Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's standards for individual sewage
treatment systems contained in the document titled, "Individual
Sewage Treatment Systems Standards, Chapter 7080", a copy of which
is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
ordinance.
3) On-site sewage treatment systems must be set back from the ordinary
high water level in accordance with the setbacks contained in Section
530.09, Subd. 2 of this Ordinance.
4) All proposed sites for individual sewage treatment systems shall be
evaluated in accordance with the criteria in sub-items 1-4 herein. If
the determination of a site's suitability cannot be made with publicly
available, existing information, it shall then be the responsibility of the
applicant to provide sufficient soil borings and percolation tests from
on-site field investigations.
Brainerd City Code 530.11
530.11 Nonconfomities. All legally established nonconformities as of January 1, 2002 and
a legal use before the adoption of any applicable shoreland ordinance controls may continue, but
they will be managed according to applicable state statutes and other regulations of this community
for the subjects of alterations and additions, repair after damage, discontinuance of use, and
intensification of use; except that the following standards will also apply in shoreland areas.
Subd. 1. Construction on Nonconforming Lots of Record.
a) Lots of record in the office of the County Recorder on January 1, 2002 and
conforming before any applicable controls that do not meet the requirements of
Section 530.09 of this Ordinance may be allowed as building sites without
variances from lot size requirements provided the use is permitted in the zoning
district, the lot has been in separate ownership from abutting lands at all times
since it became substandard, was created compliant with official controls in
effect at the time, sewage treatment and setback requirements of this Ordinance
are met, and all lot widths must be at least 75% of width standards.
b) A variance from setback requirements must be obtained before any use, sewage
treatment system, or building permit is issued for a lot. In evaluating the
variance, the board of adjustment shall consider sewage treatment and water
supply capabilities or constraints of the lot and shall deny the variance if
adequate facilities cannot be provided.
c) If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under the same ownership, any
individual lot does not meet the requirements of Section 530.09 of this
ordinance the lot must not be considered as a separate parcel of land for the
purposes of sale or development. The lot must be combined with one or more
contiguous lots so they equal one or more parcels of land, each meeting the
requirements of Section 530.09 of this ordinance as much as possible.
Subd. 2. Additions/Expansions to Nonconforming Structures.
a) All additions or expansions to the outside dimensions of an existing
nonconforming structure must meet the setback, height, and other
requirements of Section 530.09 of this Ordinance.
1) Such addition or expansion shall not cause the ground covered on the
effective date of this Ordinance to be increased by more than 50%,
measured in square feet;
2) Such addition or expansion shall not cause the non-conformity existing
at the time of such addition or expansion to increase in relation to any
lot line or parcel boundary, ordinary high water level, treatment
system, or other limiting factor in this Ordinance;
Brainerd City Code 530.11 Subd. 2 (a) (3)
3) Save for those applicable to such structure, all setback and other
requirements of this Ordinance shall be met upon completion of such
addition or expansion;
4) Accurate site plans, showing actual measured dimensions, are filed
with the Planning and Zoning Administrator before such addition or
expansion is built;
5) A conforming sewage treatment system must exist or be installed on
site to serve all livable dwellings on the lot or parcel upon which such
structure is built; and
6) Such structure is not a water-oriented accessory structure, screen
house, gazebo, or any structure located in a bluff or shore impact zone.
7) In any event it is lawful to reconstruct the roof of a structure existing
on the effective date of this ordinance, as necessary to prevent leakage,
without a variance, provided that the livable area of such structure, as
measured in square feet as of the time of such work, shall not thereby
be increased.
b) Deck additions may be allowed without a variance to a structure not meeting
the required setback from the ordinary high water level if all of the following
criteria and standards are met:
1) The structure existed on the date the structure setbacks were
established;
2) A thorough evaluation of the property and structure reveals no
reasonable location for a deck meeting or exceeding the existing
ordinary high water level setback of the structure;
3) The deck encroachment toward the ordinary high water level does not
exceed 15 percent of the existing setback of the structure from the
ordinary high water level or does not encroach closer than 30 feet,
whichever is more restrictive; and
4) The deck is constructed primarily of wood, and is not roofed or
screened.
Brainerd City Code 530.11 Subd. 2 (c)
c) Lots of record in the office of the County Recorder on January 1, 2002 and
conforming before any applicable controls that do not meet the requirements
of Section 530.09 of this Ordinance may be allowed to construct additions/
expansion to nonconforming structures without variances from lot size
requirements provided the use is permitted in the zoning district, the lot has
been in separate ownership from abutting lands at all times since it became
substandard, was created compliant with official controls in effect at the time,
and sewage treatment and setback requirements of this Ordinance and the
requirements of Section 530.11 Subdivision 2(a) are met.
Subd. 3. Nonconforming Sewage Treatment Systems.
a) A sewage treatment system not meeting the requirements of Section 530.09 of
this Ordinance must be upgraded, at a minimum, at any time a permit or
variance of any type is required for any improvement on, or use of, the
property. For the purposes of this provision, a sewage treatment system shall
not be considered nonconforming if the only deficiency is the sewage
treatment system's improper setback from the ordinary high water level.
b) The City of Brainerd will require upgrading or replacement of any
nonconforming system identified by within a reasonable period of time which
will not exceed 1 years. Sewage systems installed according to all applicable
local shoreland management standards adopted under Minnesota Statutes,
section 105.485, in effect at the time of installation may be considered as
conforming unless they are determined to be failing, except that systems using
cesspools, leaching pits, seepage pits, or other deep disposal methods, or
systems with less soil treatment area separation above groundwater than
required by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's Chapter 7080 for
design of on-site sewage treatment systems, shall be considered
nonconforming. If City utilities are available the property will be required to
connect to City utilities within 1-year if the sewer system is non-conforming.
530.13 Subdvision/Platting Provisions.
a) Land Suitability. Each lot created through subdivision, including planned unit
developments authorized under Section 530.15 of this Ordinance, must be
suitable in its natural state for the proposed use with minimal alteration.
Suitability analysis by the local unit of government shall consider
susceptibility to flooding, existence of wetlands, soil and rock formations with
severe limitations for development, severe erosion potential, steep
topography, inadequate water supply or sewage treatment capabilities, near
shore aquatic conditions unsuitable for water based recreation, important fish
and wildlife habitat, presence of significant historic sites, or any other feature
of the natural land likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of
future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community.
Brainerd City Code 530.13 (b)
b) Consistency with Other Controls. Subdivisions must conform to all official
controls of this community. A subdivision will not be approved where a later
variance from one or more standards in official controls would be needed to
use the lots for their intended purpose. In areas not served by publicly owned
sewer and water systems, a subdivision will not be approved unless domestic
water supply is available and a sewage treatment system consistent with
Sections 530.09 can be provided for every lot. Each lot shall meet the
minimum lot size and dimensional requirements of Section 530.09, including
at least a minimum contiguous lawn area, that is free of limiting factors
sufficient for the construction of two standard soil treatment systems. Lots
that would require use of holding tanks must not be approved.
c) Information Requirements. Sufficient information must be submitted by the
applicant for the community to make a determination of land suitability. The
information shall include at least the following:
1) topographic contours at ten foot intervals or less from United States
Geological Survey maps or more accurate sources, showing limiting
site characteristics;
2) the surface water features required in Minnesota Statutes, Section
505.02, Subdivision 1, to be shown on plats, obtained from United
States Geological Survey quadrangle topographic maps or more
accurate sources;
3) adequate soils information to determine suitability for building and onsite
sewage treatment capabilities for every lot from the most current
existing sources or from field investigations such as soil borings,
percolation tests, or other methods;
4) information regarding adequacy of domestic water supply; extent of
anticipated vegetation and topographic alterations; near shore aquatic
conditions, including depths, types of bottom sediments, and aquatic
vegetation; and proposed methods for controlling storm water runoff
and erosion, both during and after construction activities;
5) location of 100 year flood plain areas and floodway districts from
existing adopted maps or data; and
6) line or contour representing the ordinary high water level, the "toe"
and the "top" of bluffs, and the minimum building setback distances
from the top of the bluff and the lake or stream.
Brainerd City Code 530.13 (d)
d) Dedications. When a land or easement dedication is a condition of
subdivision approval, the approval must provide easements over natural
drainage or ponding areas for management of storm water and significant
wetlands.
e) Platting. All subdivisions shall comply with Brainerd City Code 500.09 and
Minnesota State Statute 505. No permit for construction of buildings or
sewage treatment systems shall be issued for lots created after these official
controls were enacted unless the lot was approved as part of a formal
subdivision.
530.15 Planned Unit Developments (PUD). Subdivision 1. Shoreland Planned Unit
Development. Planned Unit Development (“PUD”) requires the assistance of professional
planning and usually involves the approval of multiple agencies or other governmental bodies.
Where circumstances are favorable, PUDs provide more latitude in land use than normal
development to allow for planning, clustering facilities, consolidating green spaces, and internal
recreation amenities. While densities higher than normal are often allowed, they must be
justified by the preservation and consolidation of green space, increased screening and
landscaping, increased recreational amenities, and other significant improvements and design
features beneficial to the residents, neighbors, and the general public. The land use districts in
which PUDs are an allowable use are identified in the land use district descriptions in Section
530.07 of this Ordinance and the official Zoning Map. The requirements for Commercial PUDs
and Residential PUDs are the same under this Shoreland Ordinance.
a) Mixed use PUD where appropriate, may be allowed, provided the use not
normally allowed in the zoning district does not exceed 45% of the building
floor area.
b) Review Criteria. The City of Brainerd shall require a conditional use permit
for all Planned Unit Developments. Approval of the permit cannot occur until
the environmental review process (EAW/EIS), if required, is complete. In
addition to the criteria for the granting of a conditional use permit, the City
must consider the following criteria in the examination of a parcel for
suitability as a PUD:
1) Existing recreational use of the surface waters and likely increases in
use associated with planned unit developments; and
2) Physical and aesthetic impacts of increased density; and
3) Suitability of lands for the planned unit development approach; and
4) Level of current development in the areas; and
Brainerd City Code 530.15 Subd. 1 (b) (5)
5) Amounts and types of ownership of undeveloped lands; and
6) Size of the parcel and amount, if any, of shoreline. A resort in
existence prior to the existence of any applicable Shoreland
Management Standards and January 1, 2002, but under-sized, shall
also be considered for subdivision, but shall not be allowed to increase
units.
c) General Requirements.
1) New multifamily buildings, four units or larger, shall be designed by
an architect, shall be compatible in color, character and mass with
surrounding land use.
2) New multifamily buildings shall have one-hour fire rated party floors
and party walls.
3) All Planned Unit Developments shall be connected to municipal sewer
and water. If it is determined that the extension of municipal sewer
and water is not feasible, the City Council may allow the use of a
conforming central sewage disposal system in compliance with MPCA
7080 regulations.
4) A winterized central water system shall be required.
5) Centralized waterfront facilities are required that do not use more than
20% of the shoreline. The number of slips allowed in a multiple dock
system will be limited to one slip per unit actually allowed in the first
tier.
6) The PUD parcel must directly abut on a public road maintained by the
City.
7) Covenants and incorporating documents providing for a homeowners’
association shall be submitted to the City prior to final approval of the
PUD.
8) Vegetation removal shall be limited to select cutting. Select cutting
means removal of dead, diseased or damaged trees or shrubs, or
removal of trees for placement of structures and drives, and further
removal of only individual trees to uniformly thin up to 25% of a stand
on a lot or parcel of land up to 40 acres. Up to 50% of the under-story
may be removed.
Brainerd City Code 530.15 Subd. 1 (c) (9)
9) Internal private access roads on common property shall be allowed, if
a permanent private maintenance agreement is approved by the City.
10) Maintenance of all commonly owned facilities shall be by the home
owner’s association.
11) Storage areas for recreational equipment (boats, personal watercraft,
etc.) shall be required for PUDs.
12) Subdivision may be allowed by plat or condominium plat.
13) Recreation facilities shall be provided as required by the Planning
Commission.
14) Screening and landscaping shall be provided as required by the
Planning Commission. At a minimum, any PUD within the Shoreland
district shall provide screening and plantings to reduce visibility of any
structures from the public waters.
15) Unless otherwise provided in this Section, all Shoreland PUDs shall
have a minimum of five (5) acres in project area and a minimum of
400 feet of lot width at the OHW and building setback line. PUDs
shall be limited to a maximum of five (5) tiers. No less than five units
or sites shall be required to utilize the PUD process.
d) Density Evaluation and Minimum Requirements for Shoreland PUDs.
Shoreland dwelling unit or site density evaluation. Proposed new or
expansions to existing planned unit developments must be evaluated using the
following procedures and standards.
1) The project parcel must be divided into tiers by locating one or more
lines approximately parallel to a line that identifies the ordinary high
water level at the following intervals, proceeding landward:
Shoreland Tier Dimensions
Unsewered
(Feet)
Sewered
(Feet)
General development lakes – first tier 200 200
General development lakes – second
and additional tiers 267 267
Recreational Development lakes 267 267
Natural Environment Lakes 400 320
All Rivers 300 300
Brainerd City Code 530.15 Subd. 1 (d) continued
The suitable area within each tier is next calculated by excluding all
wetlands, bluffs, or land below the ordinary high water level of public
waters. This area is then subjected to the planned unit development
density evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable number of dwelling
units or sites.
2) Shoreland PUD Density Evaluation Steps. To determine the allowable
density of dwelling units or sites, the suitable area within each tier is
divided by the single family residential lot size standard for lakes (see
Section 530.09), which shall then be used to yield a base density of
dwelling units or sites for each tier.
The City may allow some dwelling unit or site density increases for
planned unit developments above the densities determined in the
evaluation if all dimensional standards for the zoning district are met
or exceeded. No density increases will be allowed unless the setback
is increased to 150’ for GD and RD lakes and 225’ for NE lakes.
Maximum density increases may only be allowed if all design criteria
in Subsection E below are also met or exceeded. Increases in dwelling
unit or site densities must not exceed the maximums in the following
table. Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any
other tier farther from the shoreland water body or water course, but
must not be transferred to any other tier closer.
3) Determine whether the project is eligible for any additional density
increases. To be eligible, projects must meet some of the design
standards in the chart below and exceed one or more of them. The
City shall decide how much, if any, increase in density to allow for
each tier, but must not exceed the maximum allowable density
increases listed in the following table:
Shoreland Density Increases are determined by the following
Performance Standards Chart:
Performance Standard Base Density Increased
by up to
Increase Setback by 25%
or
Increase Setback by 50 %
or
No Structures in Tier 1 (Or increase setback to 150’ for
GD & RD, 225’ for NE)
15%
or
25%
or
35%
Impervious Coverage Reduced to 20% Project-wide
or
Impervious Coverage Reduced to 15% Project –wide
10%
or
25%
Remove All Non-Conforming Structures 10%
Approved Shoreland Restoration Plan 10%
Brainerd City Code 530.15 Subd. 1 (d) continued
Notes:
1) Density increases are maximums and are not guaranteed, unless
approved by the Planning Commission.
2) Density increases in the above table are cumulative.
3) Density increases in Tier 1 cannot exceed 50%.
Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any other tier
farther from the shoreland, lake or river, but must not be transferred to
any other tier closer. No density increases will be allowed unless the
setbacks for all structures are increased by at least 25% from the
OHW.
e) PUD Design Criteria.
1) All planned unit developments must contain at least five dwelling units
or sites.
2) Green Space Requirements. In lieu of traditional platting and lot size
requirements, Green Space must be provided, including at least 50% of
the total project area. The area must be owned by the Homeowners
Association and provide adequate recreational opportunities for
residents of the PUD. Green space shall not include dwelling units or
sites, road right-of-way, or land covered by road surfaces, parking
areas, or structures or developed areas. Green space must include
areas with physical characteristics unsuitable for development in its
natural state, and areas containing significant historic sites or unplatted
cemeteries. Green space may include outdoor recreational facilities
for use by owners of the dwelling units or sites, or the public. Green
space must not include commercial facilities or uses, but may contain
water-oriented facilities and private golf courses, trails, tennis
facilities, and similar uses. Green space may include subsurface

700.13 Pretreatment Requirements. Subdivision 1. General Pretreatment Requirements.
Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this Section and
shall achieve compliance with all national categorical pretreatment standards within the time
limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
Superintendent for review, and shall be acceptable to the Superintendent before construction of
the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to
the Superintendent under the provisions of this Section. Any subsequent changes in the
pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the
Superintendent prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
Subd. 2. Records. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall
be made available by the Superintendent to Officials of the EPA or MPCA upon request.
Subd. 3. User Reports. Any user subject to a national categorical pretreatment standard,
after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of commencement of a
new discharge to the wastewater disposal system, shall submit to the Superintendent during the
months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or
by the Superintendent, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the
effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a
record of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow
reported in Subsection 700.15, Subdivision 2 or 700.21 of this Section. The Superintendent may
agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. Refer also to the
self-monitoring reports required in Subsection 700.21.
Subd. 4. Trap and Separator Installations. Oil, grease, sand, and flammable waste traps
shall be installed for the proper discharge of wastewater containing excessive amounts of oil,
grease, sand, or flammable liquids when required by the Minnesota Plumbing Code, Minnesota
Rules Chapter 4715, or where the Superintendent determines such traps are necessary. All
separators and traps shall be designed and installed to meet the minimum required specifications
provided in Minnesota Rules 4715. Notwithstanding the provisions of Minnesota Rules 4715,
the Superintendent may require traps and separators of sufficient size and capacity to meet the
requirements of these rules. The distance between the inlet and outlet of the separator or trap
must be sufficient to allow gravity separation of pretreatment solids. To prevent overloading,
flow control baffles and any necessary inlet flow control fitting shall be provided. Each
separator or trap shall be installed to be readily accessible for removal of cover, servicing, and
maintenance. If installed substantially below grade, safe access shall be provided. Separators
Brainerd City Code 700.13 Subd. 4 continued
and traps shall be maintained in efficient operating condition by periodic removal of any
accumulated pretreatment solids. Floating materials shall be removed when the accumulation is
within two inches of the outlet. Settled solids shall be removed when the solids reach 75 percent
of the trap or separator capacity.

wastewater disposal system if the discharge would result in the industry being classified as a
significant industrial user. No industrial user requiring a permit shall discharge into public
sewers until the industrial user has been issued a permit. Issuance of an industrial discharge
permit shall not relieve the industrial user from any obligation to obtain any hazardous waste
license required by other authorities or to comply with any other Local, State, or Federal
requirements regarding waste disposal.
Subd. 2. Permit Application. Users required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit
shall complete and file with the Superintendent, an application in the form prescribed by the
Superintendent, and accompanied by the applicable fee set by the BPUC. Proposed new users
shall apply at least 180 days prior to connecting or discharging to the wastewater disposal
system. In support of the application, the user shall submit, in units and terms appropriate for
evaluation, the following information:

standards, and (for an existing discharge) a statement regarding whether or not
the pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance and additional pretreatment is
required for the user to meet applicable pretreatment standards. If additional
operation and maintenance and pretreatment will be required, a proposed
schedule by which the changes will be completed shall be submitted. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. The schedule shall
contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement
and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of
additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable
pretreatment standard. No increment shall exceed nine months in length, and

700.21 Industrial Wastewater Monitoring and Reporting. Subdivision 1. General
Requirements. Permittees, and non-permitted industrial users specified by the Superintendent,
shall monitor industrial waste discharges into public sewers. Such monitoring shall accurately
characterize the discharge and shall be performed in accordance with all applicable provisions of
these rules and any permit issued thereunder. Such monitoring information shall be submitted to
the Superintendent in a self-monitoring report. At a minimum, a summary report shall be
prepared quarterly and submitted to the Superintendent.
Subd. 2. Monitoring Point. Each permittee shall have an approved monitoring point
provided at the permittee's expense. Liquid waste haulers and specific industrial users, may be
exempted by permit from portions of this Section. An approved monitoring point shall meet the
following criteria:
a) The wastewater flow is visible and accessible for inspection and monitoring
purposes;
b) Adequate safeguards are in place to protect BPUC personnel form accident or
injury;
c) The wastewater flow has appropriate velocity and is well mixed to yield
representative samples;
d) The wastewater flow at the monitoring point conveys all of the permittee’s
industrial waste.
e) the monitoring point is large enough or space is provided nearby to allow for
monitoring equipment placement; and
f) the total wastewater flow of the permitted facility, if exceeding 25,000 gallons
per day, can be measured using an open channel or other acceptable
measuring device.
All permittees shall have an approved monitoring point within 12 months of
the effective date of this Section. Design plans for constructing a monitoring
point shall be submitted to the Superintendent for approval 60 calendar days
prior to any constructions necessary to meet the criteria specified in this
Section. All new installations shall be in accordance with provisions of the
Minnesota Plumbing Code.
Brainerd City Code 700.21 Subd. 2 continued
Each permittee is responsible for all maintenance on the approved monitoring
point, including routine cleaning.
Subd. 3. Representative Sampling. Representative samples stall be collected by
permittees at an approved monitoring point. Sampling shall be conducted on a normal operating
day and in accordance with standard monitoring techniques described herein. The samples shall
accurately characterize the discharge, taking into account batch discharges, daily production
variations, downtime, cleanup, and other operating conditions. Each permittee shall accurately
determine wastewater flow volumes during periods of sample collection. Flow proportional
compositing may be required. Samples shall be collected in a well-mixed region of the
wastewater. In order to avoid collecting nonrepresentative amounts of sediment or floating
material, the intake of the sampling device shall be place appropriately. When using an
automatic sampler, the intake line velocity shall be sufficient to ensure representative sampling
of suspended solids. T he minimum intake velocity should be two feet per second the minimum
automatic sampler intake line inside diameter shall be one-fourth inch. When, feasible, the
automatic sampler intake shall be downstream of the primary flow device.
Subd. 4. Grab and Composite Samples. Samples shall be collected as specified in the
permit or as determined by the Superintendent. Grab and/or composite samples may be required.
A series of at least four grab samples is required when analyzing wastewater fm pH, grease and
oil, cyanide, volatile organics, total phenols, and sulfides. For other parameters, grab samples
may be required when the wastewater flow is not continuous or when necessary to determine the
instantaneous wastewater characteristics. Grab samples can be taken manually or automatically.
Composite samples are formed by combing discrete samples collected either manually or by an
automatic sampler. Each discrete sample shall have a minimum volume of at least 100
milliliters. Discrete samples can be composited using any of the following methods: (1) equal
time intervals and equal volume samples; (2) equal time intervals and unequal volume samples;
or (3) unequal time intervals and equal volume samples. Flow proportional composite sampling
is the designated method for sample collection for industrial permit holders. Equal time/equal
volume composition may only be utilized if the hourly waste flow volumes are nearly constant
during the sampling period.
Subd. 5. Sample Handling Procedures. All samples shall be contained, preserved and
held in accordance with Code of Federal Regulations, Part 136. The sample temperature shall be
maintained at 4° Celsius, if necessary, from the time of collection until sample analysis is
performed. When applicable, additional preservation shall be performed upon sample collection.
Subd. 6. Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants. All measurements, tests, and
analysis of the characteristics of the industrial wastewaters shall be determined in accordance
with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater",
published by the American Public Health Association. The permittee or the contracted
monitoring service and/or commercial analytical laboratory shall document analytical procedures
including, but not limited to, the quality control and, if applicable, chain of custody procedures
Brainerd City Code 700.21 Subd. 6 continued
conducted on each sample. The Superintendent may require that any sample analysis data
submitted to fulfill requirements of these rules or any permit issued thereunder be obtained from
a laboratory appropriately certified by the Minnesota Department of Health.
Subd. 7. Wastewater Flow Measuring. Wastewater volumes discharged by permittees to
public sewers shall be accurately determined during sampling periods using metered water
supply or wastewater flow measuring devices or both. Metered water supply may be used to
determine reporting period discharge volumes if the Superintendent determine that operating day
losses can be accounted for. Operating day losses include, but are not limited to, lawn
sprinkling, loss to product, or evaporation. Water meters used for wastewater discharge volume
determinations shall be maintained in good operating condition. The Superintendent may require
outside calibration of such meters. In the event that the Superintendent determines that operating
day losses cannot be accounting for, or that the hourly water meter volumes do not correlate with
the monitoring point hourly volumes, continuous flow measuring of industrial waste discharges
to public sewers shall be required. All continuous flow measuring installations shall meet the
following requirements:
a) Primary flow devices including, but not limited to, weirs and flumes, shall be
installed such that proper hydraulic conditions exist. Factors used to
determine the type, size, and location of a primary flow device include:
1) Flow rate and velocity;
2) Pipe configuration and slope;
3) Turbulence;
4) Presence of nearby tributary flows;
5) Solids concentration; and
6) Other factors.
The primary flow device shall accommodate the maximum expected flow.
The primary flow device shall be properly leveled and sealed.
b) The flow level sensing device shall be installed at a proper distance upstream
of the primary flow device and in a location where excessive turbulence is not
created.
c) All continuous flow measuring installations shall include a continuous
recording device.
d) All continuous flow measuring installations shall be maintained in good
operating condition. Records of all maintenance conducted on flow
measuring installations shall be kept. Maintenance includes, but is not limited
to, the removal of sediment from upstream and downstream of the primary
device, and the calibration of the flow meter.

Subd. 2. Basis of Charge. The sewer rental to be so charged against any property within
the city of the general municipal user category shall be based upon the quantity of water used at
each lot, parcel of land, building, or premises as the water is measured by the water meter or
meters there in use. Industrial or other users which discharge flows with concentration in BOD,
SS, or other components that affect the treatment process and costs shall be charged a sewer
rental which appropriately covers such additional costs.
Subd. 3. Discharge of Non-City Water into System. In the event any lot, parcel of land,
building, or premises discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into
the sanitary sewer system of the City either directly or indirectly, is supplied in whole or in part
with water not obtained from the City, the owner or occupant of such property shall cause to be
installed, necessary metering equipment as approved by the Superintendent to measure the
quantity of water pumped or used and the sewer rental charge shall be based on the quantity of
water so measured Whenever the owner, lessee, or occupant fails to install such metering
equipment, or where it is not practicable to measure the water consumed on any premises by a
meter or meters, the Superintendent shall cause to be determined in such manner and by such
methods as may be practicable, considered conditions and attendant circumstances in each case,
the estimated volume of water from private sources which discharge into the sanitary sewer
system, and such estimate shall be used in lieu of the meter volume of water from private sources
to determine the sewage rental charge thereon and therefore.
Subd. 4. Unit Costs. The BPUC shall annually determine and fix the unit costs for use of
the sewer system on the basis of flow (including Infiltration/Inflow) BOD, SS and any other
pollutant, taking into consideration the cost of treatment of such sewage, and may increase or
decrease such unit cost as often and in such amounts as may reasonably be required to
accomplish the purpose of this Section.
Subd. 5. Billings. The Superintendent shall compute the amount due for sewer user
charges and render a statement thereof, at periodic intervals, as directed by the BPUC to the
owner or occupant of any premises using the facilities. All amounts due thereunder shall be
payable at the office of the secretary of the BPUC of the City or other designated locations.
Brainerd City Code 700.27 Subd. 6
Subd. 6. Audits. The BPUC shall once each year provide an internal audit report that
will address specific areas of concern including the need to generate sufficient revenue through
user charges to cover total O & M costs, the necessity of maintaining a proportionate system of
user charges pursuant to 40 CFR 35 935 13 (b) and the need to review the replacement account
to determine its proper level of funding.
Subd. 7. Service Outside City: Charges. Property outside the City Limits which is
served by and uses the sanitary sewer system shall pay the same amount of sewer rental as
prescribed in the above unit costs for properly inside the City Limits. Additional costs may be
applied for providing such service to properties outside the City Limits if such extra costs are
specifically related to serving those properties. Charges for sewer service to property outside the
City Limits, which is served by a collection system maintained by another governmental
subdivision shall be the subject of agreements between the City and such other governmental
subdivision, such agreement to be approved by the BPUC and the City Council.
Subd. 8. Water Bills: Sewer Service Charges. The amounts due to the BPUC for sewer
rental charge will be computed in accordance with the provisions of this Section and statements
will be rendered at the same time and on the same bill with the City water statement. If a
property supplies its own water, a bill will be rendered for sewer services only.
Subd. 9. Certification of Unpaid Charges. Nothing in this Section shall be held or
construed as in any way stopping or interfering with the City's right to levy as taxes against any
premises affected, any delinquent or past-due sewer rental charges. Each and every sewer rental
charge levied by and pursuant to this Section is hereby made a lien upon the lot, land, or
premises served, and all such charges which are on October 15 of each year past-due and
delinquent, shall be certified to the County Auditor as taxes on the real estate in the manner
provided by law.
Subd. 10. Civil Action. Any charges levied by and pursuant to this Section, not paid and
becoming delinquent may be recovered from the occupant of the premises served in a civil action
by the City in any court of competent jurisdiction, if the City elects to do so.
Subd. 11. Deposit of Funds. The monies received from the rates and charges herein
established shall be deposited in the sewage disposal fund of the BPUC and in accordance with
any bond resolution or amendment directing their payment.
Subd. 12. Allocation of Costs. The cost to be recovered pursuant to this Section and the
unit cost to be fixed by the BPUC shall be determined and allocated in each of the following
categories:
a) Category "A". Operation and Maintenance of City's Wastewater Collection,
Conveyance, and Treatment Facilities. This category includes the cost of
administration, operation, maintenance and replacement for the City's
Brainerd City Code 700.27 Subd. 12 (a) continued
wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment facilities, including sludge
disposal costs, and including an amount for replacement costs of equipment
and real property which shall be segregated in a separate fund. Replacement
costs are expenditures for obtaining and installing equipment, accessories, or
appurtenances which are necessary during the useful life of the treatment
works to maintain the capacity and performance for which such works were
designed and constructed.
b) Category "B". Industrial Pretreatment Charge. An industrial pretreatment
charge is imposed upon all industrial units subject to national or local
industrial pretreatment requirements. The industrial pretreatment charge shall
be the amount necessary to recover administrative costs associated with
permitting and monitoring the discharge of industrial wastewater into the
City's wastewater disposal system. The BPUC may adopt charges and fees in
this category which may include:
1) Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the City’s
pretreatment program;
2) Fee for monitoring, inspections, and surveillance procedures;
3) Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction;
4) Fees for reviewing permit applications;
5) Fees for filing appeals;
6) Other fees as the BPUC may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein.
c) Category "C". Connection Charge. A connection charge is imposed upon all
users in an amount necessary to recover administrative and sewer billing
costs. The connection charge shall be levied on each user on an equal basis
and shall be a charge imposed in addition to the Category `A' and Category
`B' charges. Allocation of costs to be recovered by the connection charge
shall be determined by the BPUC and may include those costs attributable to
wastewater collection and treatment but not directly related to unit charges for
flow, BOD, and SS.
Subd. 13. Industrial Users Charge. The Category "A" industrial user charges for
administration, operation, maintenance, and replacement of the wastewater collection
conveyance, and treatment facilities shall be determined as follows:
Brainerd City Code 700.27 Subd. 13 (a)
a) Unit costs for flow, BOD, and SS shall be calculated by apportioning each
category cost to flow, BOD, and SS, and then dividing each cost so
apportioned by the total estimated flow, BOD, and SS to be received at the
wastewater treatment plant in that year.
b) Industrial user charges shall be the sum of the procedures obtained by
multiplying the unit costs as determined above by the user's actual flow, BOD,
and SS during the billing period. However, in no case shall the charge be less
than that determined by applying the prevailing domestic flow rate charge to
the user's actual flow. In addition to the charges provided for herein, the
BPUC may impose a surcharge on any industrial user pursuant to the
requirements herein before or based on some other pollutant loading factor
which requires special treatment at the wastewater treatment plant.
c) Industrial sewer service charges will include user charges and may also
include the annual interest and principal costs necessary to retire any bonds
issued to pay for construction with such debt retirement costs to be determined
and allocated in same manner as described for annual operating costs herein
before.
(Amended Ord. 837 – 1985, Ord. 1046 – 1998)
Subd. 14. Measurements of Strength and Volume. When required by the
Superintendent, each industrial user shall install suitable measuring, sampling, and analyzing
devices in compliance with the sewer use code, as required hereinbefore. The Superintendent
shall not require installation of such devices where the industrial user has concentrations of
BOD, and suspended solids no greater than the concentrations of such constituents in the general
municipal flow and a satisfactory method and access exist for sampling and determining the total
daily sewage flow. In such cases, the charges to those industrial users shall be based on the flow
rate as determined and on BOD, and SS loads equal to the average load of the general municipal
flow. Each industrial user required by the Superintendent to install and maintain sewerage
monitoring facilities shall submit to the Superintendent a monthly report of daily flow, BOD, and
SS, on a form approved by the Superintendent. This report shall be used for billing purposes and
shall be submitted prior to the 15th day of the subsequent month. The Superintendent shall have
the right to periodically or continuously inspect the monitoring facilities, to measure, sample, and
analyze the user's flow and to analyze the samples obtained by the industrial user. In the event of
any discrepancy between the flows or loads determined by the Superintendent and the industrial
user, the values determined by the Superintendent shall be used for billing purposes. All
measurements, tests, and analysis of the characteristics of sewage concentration shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Waste Water", published by the American Public Health Association and shall be
determined at the control manhole provided or upon suitable samples taken at said manhole. In
the event that no special manhole is available, the control manhole shall be considered to be the
nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. A 24-hour composite sample of the sewage shall be taken by the Superintendent at
least once each year on those customers being assessed a surcharge for the purpose of verifying
sample results.
Brainerd City Code 700.27 Subd. 15
Subd. 15. Charges for Non-Industrial Users. The Category "A" charge for general users
for this Section shall be determined as follows: unit costs for flow, BOD, SS shall be calculated
by apportioning the total annual cost of Category A to Flow, BOD, and SS. The general users
charge shall be the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the unit costs as determined
above by the flow, BOD, and SS loadings of 1000 gallons of domestic wastes. The charges to
domestic users shall be the product of the unit cost obtained in accordance with paragraph one
above and the quantity of water used by such user as measured by the City water meter on the
premises. The charges to commercial users with BOD and SS concentrations equal to or less
than domestic wastes shall be the product of the unit cost obtained in accordance with paragraph
one above and the quantity of water used by such user as measured by the City water meter on
the premises. The charges to institutional users with BOD and SS concentrations equal to or less
than domestic wastes shall be the product of the unit cost obtained in accordance with paragraph
one above and the quantity of water used by such user as measured by the City water meter on
the premises. The charges to governmental users with BOD and SS concentrations equal to or
less than domestic wastes shall be the product of the unit cost obtained as described above and
the quantity of water used by such user as measured by the water meter on the premises. In the
event a general municipal user is not supplied with City water or the water so used is not
measured, the user charge shall be fixed and determined by the Superintendent in such methods
as it may find just, equitable, and practicable. In the event sewer service is disconnected by the
City during any quarter for any reason, the sewer service charge shall be reduced proportionately
in the same manner that water service rates are reduced. If a substantial portion of the water
utilized by any user is not discharged into the sewer system, the volume of such water shall be
deducted in computing the sewer use charge provided a separate meter is installed to measure
such volume. The user desiring to install such separate meter shall make application and
payment for the meter to the Superintendent and engage, at its own expense, a plumber to effect
the necessary piping changes and install the couplings so the meter can be set. Non-industrial
sewer service charges will include user charges and may also include the annual interest and
principal cost necessary to retire any bonds issued to pay for construction with such debt
retirement costs to be determined and allocated in the same manner described for annual
operating costs hereinbefore.
(Amended Ord. 837 – 1985, Ord. 1046 – 1998)
Subd. 16. Control Structure. When required by the Superintendent the owner of any
property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
structure, together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to
facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes. The structures and equipment
when required shall be constructed at the owner's expense in accordance with plans approved by
the Superintendent and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all
times. Refer to Subdivision 2 of 700.21 for specific requirements for a control structure
(monitoring point).
Brainerd City Code 700.27 Subd. 17
Subd. 17. Measurement, Tests, Standard. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the
characteristics of water and wastes to which reference is made in this Section shall be determined
in accordance with 40 CFR 136 (Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of
Pollutants): the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater, and shall be determined at the control structure provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control structure in the event that no special stricture has been required, the control
structure shall be construed to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer from the
point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine
the existence of hazards of life, limb and property. (The particular analyses involved will
determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate, or whether a
grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from 24hour composite of ail outfalls whereas pHs are determined from
periodic grab samples.)
Subd. 18. Other Test. The Superintendent may conduct such tests as are necessary to
enforce this regulation, and employees of the BPUC may enter upon any property for the purpose
of taking samples, obtaining information or conducting surveys or investigations relating to such
enforcement. Entry shall be made during operating hours unless circumstances require
otherwise. In all cases where tests are conducted by the Superintendent for the purposes of
checking to determine if a previously found violation of this Section has been corrected, the cost
of such tests shall be charged to the user or added to the user's sewer charges. In those cases
where the Superintendent determines that the nature or volume of a particular user's sewage
required more frequent than normal testing, the Superintendent may charge such user for the
tests, after giving the user ten days written notice of its intention to do so, and the cost thereof
shall be added to the user's sewer charge. In any case where industrial wastes are discharged to a
public sewer, the Superintendent may require the user at its own expense to test the discharge on
a regular basis and to report the test results to the Superintendent within a reasonable time. All
such tests shall be as ordered by the Superintendent and shall be conducted by qualified
personnel in accordance with the standards set out in this Section. Refer to Subsection 700.21
for the specific requirements for sampling and testing for industries with discharge permits.

enforcement of this ordinance:
Subd. 1. "Impervious Surface" is any surface which does not provide vertical drainage of
water, including, but not limited to, roofs, buildings, concrete, bituminous surfaces, surface
concrete pavers, and Class V gravel. Impervious surface will be measured using the City of
Brainerd’s Geographical Information System (GIS) and the latest aerial photography available.
Subd. 2. “Equivalent Residential Lot” is a residential lot which is defined as a one sixth
of an acre lot with fifty (50%) percent impervious by acre or 0.083 acres of impervious surface.
Subd. 3. “Single Family Residential Rate” is the rate at which a single family home is
charge. This rate is used for parcels that have single family homes on only. This rate is set by
council resolution.
Subd. 4. “Duplex Family Fee Rate” is the rate at which duplex residential units are
charged. This rate shall apply to single family homes that are split into two units. The rate shall
be half of the Single Family Residential Rate.
Sbud. 5. “Commercial Fee Rate” is the rate at which parcels, other than single family or
duplexes, are charge for storm water. The rate is calculated as fee per impervious acre, which is
equal to the Single Family Residential Fee per Equivalent Residential Lot’s impervious surface
area.
715.03 Storm Water Utility Fees. Subdivision 1. Purpose and Establishment. A
municipal storm sewer drainage system utility for the City of Brainerd is hereby established. The
municipal storm sewer utility shall be operated pursuant to Minnesota Statutes Section 444.075.
Revenues derived from the municipal storm sewer utility shall be dedicated to the construction,
maintenance, operation, establishment and repair of the existing municipal storm sewer drainage
system and additions thereto.
Subd. 2. Storm Water Drainage Fees.
a) All single family residential properties will be charged a flat rate regardless of
size of parcel. This rate shall be the Single Family Residential Fee which is set
by Council resolution.
b) Duplex units shall be charged half the rate of the Single Family Residential
Fee
Brainerd City Code 715.03 Subd. 2 (c)
c) All parcels other than lots with single family homes and duplexes shall be
charged a Commercial Fee Rate based on the amount of impervious surface
on the parcel. The Commercial Fee rate is calculated based on the Single
Family Residential Fee and the Equivalent Residential Lot definitions
(residential fee X each 0.083 acres of impervious surface).
d) The City shall reduce the fee charged if the landowner shows that some or all
of the storm water runoff generated by the parcel does not enter the storm
water drainage system maintained by the City of Brainerd. The fee shall be
reduced by the percentage of water diverted into other drainage systems,
detention facilities or retention facilities, but in no case shall be reduced to
less than 50% the calculated fee.
e) Each developed parcel shall be charged a minimum fee equivalent to the
Single Family Residential Rate.
Subd. 3. Billing.
a) Payment. Storm water fees shall be charge to each parcels utility bills that are
sent by Brainerd Public Utilities. The utility fee shall be due and payable at
the same time and upon the same terms as other city utility bills. If a use is not
currently served by Brainerd Public Utilities, an annual bill shall be sent to the
property owner in the month of June and shall be due within thirty (30) days
of mailing for the initial billing. Unpaid bills will be assessed to the property.
Subd. 4. Appeals.
a) Appeal. If a property owner or person responsible for paying the utility fee
believes that a particular utility fee is incorrect, such person may request that
the fee be recomputed by the City Engineer’s office. If said person still
believes the city is in error, they may request a hearing in front of the City
Council at the next regularly scheduled meeting.

Brainerd City Code 725.01
Section 725 – Stormwater Management
725.01 Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to promote, preserve and enhance the
natural resources within the City of Brainerd and protect them from adverse effects occasioned
by poorly sited development or incompatible activities by regulating land disturbing or
development activities that would have an adverse and potentially irreversible impact on water
quality and unique and fragile environmentally sensitive land; by minimizing conflicts and
encouraging compatibility between land disturbing or development activities proposed for such
areas, thereby achieving a balance between urban growth and development activities proposed
for such areas; by preventing periodic local flooding by designing areas for ponding and
retention of storm water.
Coordination with Crow Wing County and the State of Minnesota. The City recognizes that
Crow Wing County and the State of Minnesota have regulations affecting stormwater control
and management and that both the County and State have a responsibility to ensure that their
respective regulations and procedures are followed. The City will seek in every instance to
coordinate with County or State regulations and procedures so as not to create unnecessary
burden to the applicant.
725.02 Scope. Every applicant for a building permit, not exempted by the following
exemptions, or subdivision approval, or permit to allow land-disturbing activities, must submit a
Storm Water Management Plan to the City. No building permit, subdivision approval or permit
to allow land disturbing or development activities shall be issued until approval of the Storm
Water Management Plan or waiver of the approval requirement has been obtained in
conformance with the provisions of this Section.
Plan Approval. All plans shall be subject to approval by the City. The City shall consider issues
of land usage, overall drainage for the City and existing storm water facilities in approving any
drainage plan. The City may reject any proposed plans if they do not meet the overall purpose of
this Section.
Exemptions:
a) Any permit or approval by the City of Brainerd prior to the effective date of
this Section;
b) Installation of fences, sign, telephone and electric poles and other kinds of
posts or poles;
c) Waiver of plat, re plat, platting of developed lot or single lot division;
d) Construction of single family home or duplex;
Brainerd City Code 725.02 (e)
e) An addition to an existing building that does not require a conditional use
permit;
f) Construction of a detached accessory building that does not require a
conditional use permit
g) Emergency work to protect life, limb or property; or;
h) Improvements involving the enlargement of a building less than ten percent
(10%) of the total floor area of the existing building or five thousand (5,000)
square feet, whichever is less, even if a conditional use permit is required.
i) Land disturbing activities conducted by the City affecting less than one (1)
acres.
Waiver. The City Council may waive any requirement of this Section upon making a finding
that compliance will impose an unnecessary hardship or the project does not have any significant
alterations of existing storm water conditions, and the waiver of such requirements will not
adversely affect the standards and requirements of this Section. The City Council may require as
a condition of the waiver such dedication or construction or agreement to dedicate or construct as
may be necessary to adequately meet said standards and requirements. The City Council may
require as a condition of the waiver that the applicant make an in kind or monetary contribution
to the development and maintenance of community storm water management activities as
designated by the City Council.
725.03 Definitions. These definitions apply to this Ordinance. Unless specifically
defined below, the words or phrases used in this Ordinance shall have the same meaning as they
have in common usage. When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense
include the future tense, words in the plural number include the singular number, and words in
the singular number include the plural number. The words “shall” and “must” are always
mandatory and not merely directive.
a) Applicant. Any person or group that applies for a building permit, subdivision
approval, or a permit to allow land disturbing activities. Applicant also means
that person's agents, employees, and others acting under this person's or
group’s direction. The term “applicant” also refers to the permit holder or
holders and the permit holder’s agents, employees, and others acting under
this person's or group’s direction.
b) Best Management Practices (BMPs) Erosion and sediment control and water
quality management practices that are the most effective and practicable
means of controlling, preventing, and minimizing the degradation of surface
Brainerd City Code 725.03 (b) continued
water, including construction-phasing, minimizing the length of time soil
areas are exposed, prohibitions, and other management practices published by
state or designated area-wide planning agencies. (Examples of BMP’s can be
found in the current versions of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s
publications, “Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas”, and ”State of
Minnesota Stormwater Manual”)
c) Buffer. A protective vegetated zone located adjacent to a natural resource,
such as a water of the state, that is subject to direct or indirect human
alteration. Such a buffer strip is an integral part of protecting an aquatic
ecosystem through trapping sheet erosion, filtering pollutants, reducing
channel erosion and providing adjacent habitat. The buffer strip begins at the
“ordinary high water mark” for wetlands and the top of the bank of the
channel for rivers and streams. This start point corresponds to the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources’ definition of a “shoreline” in Minnesota
Rules 6115.0030. Acceptable buffer vegetation includes preserving existing
predevelopment vegetation and/or planting locally distributed native
Minnesota trees, shrubs and grassy vegetation. Alteration of buffers is strictly
limited. Buffer areas are designated with permanent markers.
d) Common Plan of Development or Sale. A contiguous area where multiple
separate and distinct land disturbing activities may be taking place at different
times, or on different schedules, but under one proposed plan. This item is
broadly defined to include design, permit application, advertisement or
physical demarcation indicating that land disturbing activities may occur.
e) Developer. Any person, group, firm, corporation, sole proprietorship,
partnership, state agency, or political subdivision thereof engaged in a land
disturbance activity.
f) Development. Any land disturbance activity that changes the site’s runoff
characteristics in conjunction with residential, commercial, industrial or
institutional construction or alteration.
g) Discharge. The release, conveyance, channeling, runoff, or drainage, of storm
water, including snowmelt, from a construction site.
h) Energy Dissipation. This refers to methods employed at pipe outlets to
prevent erosion. Examples include, but are not limited to; aprons, riprap,
splash pads, and gabions that are designed to prevent erosion.
i) Erosion. Any process that wears away the surface of the land by the action of
water, wind, ice, or gravity. Erosion can be accelerated by the activities of
people and nature.
j) Erosion Control. Refers to methods employed to prevent erosion. Examples
include soil stabilization practices, horizontal slope grading, temporary or
permanent cover, and construction phasing.
Brainerd City Code 725.03 (k)
k) Erosion and Sediment Practice Specifications or Practice. The management
procedures, techniques, and methods to control soil erosion and sedimentation
as officially adopted by the State, County, or Local watershed group,
whichever is more stringent.
l) Exposed Soil Areas. All areas of the construction site where the vegetation
(trees, shrubs, brush, grasses, etc.) or impervious surface has been removed,
thus rendering the soil more prone to erosion. This includes topsoil stockpile
areas, borrow areas and disposal areas within the construction site. It does not
include temporary stockpiles or surcharge areas of clean sand, gravel, concrete
or bituminous, which have less stringent protection. Once soil is exposed, it is
considered “exposed soil,” until it meets the definition of “final stabilization.”
m) Filter Strips. A vegetated section of land designed to treat runoff as overland
sheet flow. They may be designed in any natural vegetated form from a
grassy meadow to a small forest. Their dense vegetated cover facilitates
pollutant removal and infiltration.
n) Final Stabilization. Means that all soil disturbing activities at the site have
been completed, and that a uniform (evenly distributed, e.g., without large
bare areas) perennial vegetative cover with a density of seventy-five (75)
percent of the cover for unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent
structures has been established, or equivalent permanent stabilization
measures have been employed. Simply sowing grass seed is not considered
final stabilization.
o) Hydric Soils. Soils that are saturated, flooded, or ponded long enough during
the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part.
p) Hydrophytic Vegetation. Macrophytic (large enough to be observed by the
naked eye) plant life growing in water, soil or on a substrate that is at least
periodically deficient in oxygen as a result of excessive water content.
q) Impervious Surface. A constructed hard surface that either prevents or retards
the entry of water into the soil, and causes water to run off the surface in
greater quantities and at an increased rate of flow than existed prior to
development. Examples include rooftops, sidewalks, patios, driveways,
parking lots, storage areas, and concrete, asphalt, or gravel roads. Areas
normally considered pervious may be considered impervious if they have been
compacted from vehicle traffic or other means.
Brainerd City Code 725.03 (r)
r) Land Disturbance Activity. Any land change that may result in soil erosion
from water or wind and the movement of sediments into or upon waters or
lands within this government’s jurisdiction, including construction, clearing
and grubbing, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land. Within the
context of this rule, land disturbance activity does not mean:
1) Minor land disturbance activities such as home gardens and an
individual’s home landscaping, repairs, and maintenance work, unless
such activity exceeds one acre in exposed soil.
2) Additions or modifications to existing single family structures which
result in creating under one acre of exposed soil or impervious surface
and/or are part of a larger common development plan.
3) Construction, installation, and maintenance of fences, signs, posts,
poles, and electric, telephone, cable television, utility lines or
individual service connections to these utilities, which result in
creating under one acre of exposed soil or impervious surface.
4) Tilling, planting, or harvesting of agricultural, horticultural, or
silvicultural (forestry) crops.
5) Emergency work to protect life, limb, or property and emergency
repairs, unless the land disturbing activity would have otherwise
required an approved erosion and sediment control plan, except for the
emergency. If such a plan would have been required, then the
disturbed land area shall be shaped and stabilized in accordance with
the City’s requirements as soon as possible.
s) Native Vegetation. The presettlement (Already existing in Minnesota at the
time of statehood in 1858) group of plant species native to the local region
that were not introduced as a result of European settlement or subsequent
human introduction.
t) Ordinary High Water Mark. The definition in Minnesota Statute 103G.005,
Subdivision 14 says that the ". . .Ordinary high water level . . .” means the
boundary of water basins, watercourses, public waters, and public waters
wetlands, and:
1) the ordinary high water level is an elevation delineating the highest
water level that has been maintained for a sufficient period of time to
leave evidence upon the landscape, commonly the point where the
natural vegetation changes from predominantly aquatic to
predominantly terrestrial;
Brainerd City Code 725.03 (t) (2)
2) for watercourses, the ordinary high water level is the elevation of the
top of the bank of the channel; and
3) for reservoirs and flowages, the ordinary high water level is the
operating elevation of the normal summer pool. The term “ordinary
high water mark” is further defined in Minnesota Rule 6120.2500,
Subpart 11. Ordinary high water marks are determined by the
Minnesota Department of Natural Resources’ area hydrologist.
u) Outstanding Resource Value Waters (ORVW). Minnesota Rule 7050.0180,
subpart defines ORVW’s as, “…waters within the Boundary Waters Canoe
Area Wilderness, Voyageur's National Park, and Department of Natural
Resources designated scientific and natural areas, wild, scenic, and
recreational river segments, Lake Superior, those portions of the Mississippi
River from Lake Itasca to the southerly boundary of Morrison County that are
included in the Mississippi Headwaters Board comprehensive plan dated
February 12, 1981, and other waters of the state with high water quality,
wilderness characteristics, unique scientific or ecological significance,
exceptional recreational value, or other special qualities which warrant
stringent protection from pollution.”
v) Paved Surface. A constructed hard, smooth surface made of asphalt, concrete
or other pavement material. Examples include, but are not limited to, roads,
sidewalks, driveways and parking lots.
w) Permanent Cover. Means “final stabilization.” Examples include grass,
gravel, asphalt, and concrete. See also the definition of “final stabilization.”
x) Permit. Within the context of this rule a “permit” is a written warrant or
license granted for construction, subdivision approval, or to allow land
disturbing activities.
y) Phased Project or Development. Clearing a parcel of land in distinct phases,
with at least fifty percent (50%) of the project’s preceding phase meeting the
definition of “final stabilization” and the remainder proceeding toward
completion, before beginning the next phase of clearing.
z) Runoff Coefficient. The fraction of total precipitation that is not infiltrated
into or otherwise retained by the soil, concrete, asphalt or other surface upon
which it falls, that will appear at the conveyance as runoff. This coefficient is
usually estimated for an event or on an average annual basis.
Brainerd City Code 725.03 (aa)
aa) Sediment. The product of an erosion process; solid material both mineral and
organic, that is in suspension, is being transported, or has been moved by
water, wind, or ice, and has come to rest on the earth's surface either above or
below water level.
bb) Sedimentation. The process or action of depositing sediment.
cc) Sediment Control. The methods employed to prevent sediment from leaving
the development site. Examples of sediment control practices are silt fences,

sedimentation basins.
dd) Significant Redevelopment. Alterations of a property that changes the
“footprint” of a site or building in such a way that results in the disturbance of
over one (1) acre of land. This term is not intended to include activities,
which would not be expected to cause adverse storm water quality impacts
and offer no new opportunity for storm water controls, such as exterior
remodeling.
ee) Soil. The unconsolidated mineral and organic material on the immediate
surface of the earth. For the purposes of this document temporary stockpiles
of clean sand, gravel, aggregate, concrete or bituminous materials (which have
less stringent protection) are not considered “soil” stockpiles.
ff) Stabilized. The exposed ground surface after it has been covered by sod,
erosion control blanket, riprap, pavement or other material that prevents
erosion. Simply sowing grass seed is not considered stabilization.
gg) Steep Slope. Any slope steeper than twelve (12) percent (Twelve (12) feet of
rise for every one hundred (100) feet horizontal run).
hh) Storm Water. Under Minnesota Rule 7077.0105, Subpart 41b storm water,
“means precipitation runoff, storm water runoff, snow melt runoff, and any
other surface runoff and drainage.” (According to the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) under 40 CFR 122.26 [b][13], “Storm water means storm
water runoff, snow melt runoff and surface and drainage.”). Storm water does
not include construction site dewatering.
ii) Storm Water Management Plan A joint storm water and erosion and sediment
control plan that is a document containing the requirements of section 725.04,
that when implemented will decrease soil erosion on a parcel of land and offsite
nonpoint pollution. It involves both temporary and permanent controls.
Brainerd City Code 725.03 (jj)
jj) Structure. Anything manufactured, constructed or erected which is normally
attached to or positioned on land, including portable structures, earthen
structures, roads, parking lots, and paved storage areas.
kk) Subdivision. Any tract of land divided into building lots for private, public,
commercial, industrial, etc. development. Minnesota Rule 6120.2500, Subpart
17 defines subdivision as, ”. . . land that is divided for the purpose of sale,
rent, or lease, including planned unit development.”
ll) Temporary Protection. Short-term methods employed to prevent erosion.
Examples of such protection are straw, mulch, erosion control blankets, wood
chips, and erosion netting.
mm) Vegetated or Grassy Swale. A vegetated earthen channel that conveys
storm water, while treating the storm water by biofiltration. Such swales
remove pollutants by both filtration and infiltration.
nn) Very Steep Slope. Any slope steeper than one foot of rise for each three feet
of horizontal run (Thirty-three (33) percent slope).
oo) Waters of the State. As defined in Minnesota Statutes Section 115.01,

water, surface or underground, natural or artificial, public or private, which
are contained within, flow through, or border upon the state or any portion
thereof.”
pp) Wet Detention Facility. A permanent man-made structure, containing a
permanent pool of water, used for the temporary storage of runoff.
qq) Wet Retention Facility. The same as a wet detention facility.
rr) Wetlands. As defined in Minnesota Rules 7050.0130, Subpart F, “. . .
‘wetlands’ are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or
groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under
normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted
for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps,
marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Constructed wetlands designed for
wastewater treatment are not waters of the state. Wetlands must have the
following attributes:
1) A predominance of hydric soils;
Brainerd City Code 725.03 (rr) (2)
2) Inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency
and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic
vegetation typically adapted for life in a saturated soil condition; and
3) Under normal circumstances support a prevalence of such vegetation.
725.04 Storm Water Management Plan.
Subd. 1. Every applicant for a building permit, subdivision approval, or a permit to allow
land disturbing activities must submit a storm water management plan to the City Engineer. No
building permit, subdivision approval (preliminary or final), or permit to allow land disturbing
activities shall be issued until the City approves this plan. At a minimum these pollution
abatement control practices must conform to those in the current version of the Minnesota
Pollution Control Agency’s publication),”State of Minnesota Stormwater Manual.
Subd. 2. General Policy on Storm Water Runoff Rates. Release rates from storm water
treatment basins shall not increase over the predevelopment twenty-four (24) hour two (2) year,
ten (10) year and one hundred (100) year peak storm discharge rates, based on the last ten (10)
years of how that land was used. Also accelerated channel erosion must not occur as a result of
the proposed activity. For discharges to wetlands or basins with no outlets, volume discharged
shall not be larger than pre-developed volume runoff.
Subd. 3. The Storm Water Management Plan and the Grading Plan. The storm water
management plan’s measures, the limit of disturbed surface and the location of buffer areas shall
be marked on the approved grading plan, and identified with flags, stakes, signs etc. on the
development site before work begins.
Subd. 4. Inspections of the Storm Water Management Plan’s Measures. At a minimum,
the developer or the developer’s designated representative shall inspect the plan’s measures for
compliance with this Ordinance weekly, and within twenty-four (24) hours after every storm or
snow melt event large enough to result in runoff from the site (approximately 0.25 inches or
more in twenty-four (24) hours). At a minimum, these inspections shall be done during active
construction. The City, or its designated representative, may make such inspections as it deems
necessary to ensure compliance with the Plan’s Measures. The developer, or the developer’s
designated representative, shall notify the City when all required permanent stormwater controls
have been installed and are ready for inspection (all disturbed areas have been stabilized). The

minimize erosion. Slopes which will not be vegetated within one (1) year of
construction shall be provided with additional slope stabilizing measures until
the problem is corrected.
i) Properties and waterways downstream from development sites shall be
protected from erosion due to increases in the volume, velocity and peak flow
rate of storm water runoff.
j) All on-site storm water conveyance channels shall be designed and
constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow from a 100-year
frequency storm without eroding.
k) Rip-rap shall be placed at culvert outfalls in accordance with applicable
MnDOT standard specifications.
l) All storm sewer inlets which are made operable during construction shall be
protected so that sediment laden water will not enter the conveyance system
without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove sediment.
m) Wherever construction vehicle access routes intersect paved public roads,
provisions, such as rock construction entrances, shall be made to minimize the
transport of sediment by runoff or vehicle tracking onto the paved surfaces.
n) All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be properly
disposed of within thirty (30) days after final site stabilization is achieved or
after the temporary measures are no longer needed, unless otherwise
authorized by the City Engineer.
o) All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices shall be
maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their
intended functions.
Brainerd City Code 725.04 Subd. 6 (p)
p) All permanent drainage easements shall be indicated and recorded as required
by the City Engineer and shall ensure adequate access for maintenance
purposes.
q) A landscaping plan for any stormwater ponds and the surrounding area shall
be prepared to indicate how aquatic and terrestrial areas will be stabilized and
established with vegetation and how these areas will be maintained. The plan
shall be prepared by a qualified professional and shall conform as much as
possible or feasible with the recommendations contained in the “Minnesota
Stormwater Manual” as revised from time to time.
Subd. 7. Minimum Storm Water Management Measures and Related Inspections. These
minimum control measures are required where bare soil is exposed:
a) All grading plans must be reviewed by the City for the effectiveness of
erosion control measures in the context of site topography and drainage.
b) All plans must meet the requirements of Brainerd City Code Section 430 –
Erosion and Sediment Control.
c) Diversion of channeled runoff around disturbed areas, if practical, or the
protection of the channel.
d) The scheduling of the site’s activities to lessen their impact on erosion and
sediment creation, so as to minimize the amount of exposed soil.
e) Control runoff as follows (Either 1 and 2 or 1 and 3):
1) Unless precluded by moderate or heavy snow cover (mulching can still
occur if a light snow cover is present.), stabilize all exposed inactive
disturbed soil areas within two hundred (200) feet of any water of the
state, or within two hundred (200) feet of any conveyance (curb,
gutter, storm sewer inlet, drainage ditch, etc.) with sod, seed or weed
free mulch. This must be done, if the applicant will not work the area
for seven (7) days on slopes greater than three (3) feet horizontal to
one (1) foot vertical (3:1), fourteen (14) days on slopes ranging from
3:1 to 10:1 and twenty-one (21) days for slopes flatter than 10:1.
2) For disturbed areas greater than five (5) acres construct temporary or
permanent sedimentation basins. Sedimentation basins must have a
minimum surface area equal of at least 1% of the area draining to
basin, and be constructed in accordance with accepted design
specifications including access for operations and maintenance. Basin
discharge rates must also be controlled to prevent erosion in the
discharge channel.
Brainerd City Code 725.04 Subd. 7 (e) (3)
3) For disturbed areas less than five (5) acres sedimentation basins are
encouraged, but not required, unless required by the City Engineer.
The applicant shall install erosion and sediment controls at locations
directed by the City. Minimum requirements include silt fences, rock
check dams, or other equivalent control measures along slopes. Silt
fences are required along channel edges to reduce the amount of
sediment reaching the channel. Silt fences, rock check dams, etc. must
be regularly inspected and maintained.
f) Water Quality Treatment Related to Impervious Surface Area. Where a
project's ultimate development replaces surface vegetation with one (1) or
more acres of cumulative impervious surface, and all runoff has not been
accounted for in a local unit of government's existing storm water
management plan or practice, the runoff must be treated in accordance with
MPCA NPDES permit standards prior to discharging to waters of the state.
g) Inspection and Maintenance. All storm water management facilities must be
designed to minimize the need of maintenance, to provide easy vehicle
(typically ten (10) feet or wider) and personnel access for maintenance
purposes and be structurally sound. These facilities must have a plan of
operation and maintenance that ensures continued effective removal of the
pollutants carried in storm water runoff and identifies the responsible party for
performing any maintenance requirements.
h) Inspections may be performed by the City on a regular basis to ensure that
erosion and sediment control measures are properly installed and maintained.
In all cases the inspectors will attempt to work with the applicant and/or
builder to maintain proper erosion and sediment control at all sites.
i) In cases where cooperation is withheld, construction stop orders may be
issued by the City, until all erosion and sediment control measures meet
specifications.
j) All infiltration areas must be inspected to ensure that sediment from ongoing
construction activities is not reaching infiltration areas, and that these areas
are also being protected from soil compaction from the movement of
construction equipment.
Subd. 8. Permanent Storm Water Management Controls. The purpose of this Section is
to prevent or reduce, to the most practicable extent, the effect or impacts of storm water runoff
and to provide for the protection of public waters and natural and artificial water storage and
retention areas within the City. Further, this Section clarifies the performance standards as they
pertain to standards and specifications for conservation practices and storm water planning
activities.
Brainerd City Code 725.04 Subd. 8 continued
Performance Standards. Property storm water management practices shall be followed within
the City as described in this Section.
1) General Standards.
a) Soil laden runoff shall be treated before it is allowed to enter any water body.
b) Storm Water Rate Control. All storm water management facilities shall be
designed as necessary to manage increased runoff so that the 2-year, 10-year
and 100-year 24 hour storm peak discharge rates from the property boundary
do not exceed pre-development conditions and so that accelerated channel
erosion on and off-site will not occur as a result of the proposed land
disturbing or development activity. If a regional pond has been designated for
this area the peak discharge rates may or may not apply.
c) The minimum design capacity of all drainage systems shall accommodate the
runoff from a ten (10) year 24 hour storm event. All drainage systems and
facilities shall be designed to withstand the runoff from the critical one
hundred (100) year 24 hour storm event or accumulative antecedent
conditions without damage to the system or facility, downstream areas and
without significant risk to human health and safety.
d) The applicant or their successors shall be responsible for the installation and
maintenance of any temporary or permanent measures identified in the storm
water management plan. At the time of completion of the development, those
structures, measures and systems constituting the storm water runoff facility
may be permanently maintained by the City after official acceptance by the
City Council, by a legally organized homeowner's association, by a watershed
district after official acceptance by the district or by other means acceptable to
the City.
e) Storm Water Volume Control. total suspended solids (TSS) and total
phosphorus (TP) control. For protection of downstream water bodies and
properties that have limited outlet or where there is no outlet and to limit the
amount of stormwater pollutant runoff concentration, there shall be no net
increase from pre-project conditions in discharge volume, total suspended
solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) in new developments and a net
reduction in discharge volume, total suspended solids (TSS) and total
phosphorus (TP) in re-developments. This can be achieved through any
combinations of BMP’s, with the highest preference given to green
infrastructure (e.g. infiltration, evapotranspiration, reuse/harvesting,
conservation design, urban forestry, green roofs, etc.).
f) Prevention of Downstream Nuisance and Damage. When conditions do not
permit post-development runoff volumes to safely pass downstream
properties, the applicant shall provide a storm water pond to control the post
development rates so downstream properties or water resources are not
adversely affected.
g) Storm water management facilities must be designed, installed and maintained
consistent with the most current Best Management Practices.
h) All storm water management facilities shall be designed to minimize the need
for maintenance, to provide access for maintenance purposes and to be
structurally sound. All storm water management facilities shall have a plan of
operation, maintenance and clean-out that assures continued effective removal
of sediment carried in storm water runoff. It shall be the responsibility of the
applicant to obtain any necessary easements or other property interests to
allow access to the storm water management facilities for inspection and
maintenance purposes.
2) Specific Standards for Storm Water Conveyance and Rate Control Facilities.
a) All calculations submitted to the City for review as part of a storm water
management plan shall include calculations which clearly show the effects of
the development on the peak rate of discharge, the time of concentration,
channel velocities and other potential drainage impacts to water and soil
resources both on and off the development site. The City Engineer may
require additional information, calculations or data needed to complete the
review of a storm water management plan.
b) The calculations submitted for review shall be based upon standard
hydrological and hydraulic analysis methods that are acceptable to the City
Engineer. Calculations that are based upon unproven methodologies or apply
proven methodologies incorrectly shall be determined by the City to be
unacceptable and shall be returned to the applicant for correction and be
resubmitted.
c) Precipitation events for the Rational method shall be for the two (2), ten (10)
and one hundred (100) year twenty-four (24) hour frequency storm events
using the U.S. Weather Bureau Technical Paper No. 40 rainfall intensity
duration curves for a Type II rainfall distribution.
d) Drainage Areas. Storm water management plans shall show existing and
proposed drainage areas used for storm water analysis, including off-site
portions of sub watersheds that are partly located on the property for which
the plan is being prepared. Where drainage areas include runoff from off-site
areas, those areas may be shown and measured from maps at larger scales
(e.g. United States Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps). In all drainage
areas, the direction of flow for each area and the travel path used for
determining the time of Concentration shall be shown.
Brainerd City Code 725.04 Subd. 8 (2) (e)
e) Runoff Curve Numbers (RCN). Storm water management plans shall include
a detailed breakdown of existing and proposed runoff curve numbers.
f) Soil Types. Storm water management plans shall identify the boundaries of
the soil types present on-site and their hydrologic classification and acreage.

new impervious area created in each sub watershed and shall include the
assumptions and calculations used for determining impervious areas, such as
house pad, driveway and outbuildings.
h) Runoff Calculations. The applicant shall provide calculations for the two (2),
ten (10) and one hundred (100) year peak discharge rates for each sub
watershed comparing pre-development conditions and proposed postdevelopment
conditions.
i) Storm water management plans shall identify the location of conveyance
systems and clearly identify all dimensions, cross sections and outlet
elevations.
j) Storm water management plans shall include the locations of all property
lines, lot lines, section lines and adjacent plats.
k) Storm water management plans shall contain information which clearly
identifies all elevations and grades for streets, ditches, ponds, wetlands, lakes,

e) Designs for wet detention basins shall include, but not be limited to,
calculations for estimated inflow and outflow, permanent and temporary
storage volumes, mean depth, outlet design, downstream stabilization,
emergency spillways, basin profiles and basin cross sections.
f) Stormwater ponds will be located in a permanent easement. The easement
will contain the 100-year post-development elevation, plus an additional 10
feet at a 10:1 slope or flatter. Access to the pond will also be in a permanent
easement.
4) Specific Standards for Infiltration Ponds
a) To prevent clogging of the infiltration system, a pretreatment device such as a
vegetated filter strip, small sedimentation basin, or water quality inlet shall be
used to settle particulates prior to discharging into the infiltration pond.
b) Infiltration ponds shall be capable of infiltrating all runoff in forty eight (48)
hours or less. Additional flows that cannot be infiltrated should be routed to
bypass the system.
c) Appropriate on site testing shall be conducted to ensure a minimum of 3 feet
of separation from seasonally saturated soils (or bedrock) and the bottom of
the infiltration system.
d) Infiltration volume and facility sizes shall be calculated using the appropriate
hydrologic soil group calculation and saturation infiltration rate from the table
below. Documented site specific infiltration or hydraulic conductivity
measurements may be used in place of the values in the following table, if
approved by the City Engineer.

cannot be met at the original construction activity, the provision will be
addressed by mitigation with the following minimum requirements being met:
Mitigation project areas are selected in the following order of preference:
1) Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water that receives
runoff from the original construction activity.
2) Locations within the same Minnesota Department of Natural Resource
(DNR) catchment area as the original construction activity.
3) Location in the next adjacent DNR catchment area up-stream.

BMPs or retrofit of existing structural stormwater BMPs, or the use of a
properly designed regional structural stormwater BMP.
c) Routine maintenance of structural stormwater BMPs already required cannot
be used as mitigation required by this part.
d) Mitigation projects shall be completed within 24 months after the start of the
original construction activity.
e) Determine and document who will be responsible for the long term
maintenance on all mitigation projects in this section.
f) If payment to the City of Brainerd is received in Lieu of the owner/operator of
the construction activity meeting the conditions for post-construction
stormwater management, the City of Brainerd will apply the payment received
to a public stormwater project, and all projects will be in compliance with this
part
Subd. 9. Minimum Protection for Natural Wetlands.

approval by the City Engineer. In reviewing such an application, the City Engineer may require
additional reports and data.
Subd. 2. Record Retention. The City shall retain the written records of such
modifications for at least three (3) years.
725.07 Notification of Failure of the Storm Water Management Plan. The City shall
notify the applicant, when the City is going to act on the permit for failure to comply with the
storm water management plan.
Subd. 2. Notification by the City. The initial contact will be to the party or parties listed
on the application and/or the storm water management plan as contacts. Forty-eight (48) hours
after notification by the City or seventy-two (72) hours after the failure of erosion control
measures, whichever is less, the City at its discretion, may begin corrective work. Such
notification should be in writing, but if it is verbal, a written notification should follow as quickly
as practical. If after making a good faith effort to notify the responsible party or parties, the City

Brainerd City Code 920.01
Section 920 – Level III Predatory Offenders
920.01 Findings and Intent. Repeat predatory offenders pose a serious threat to public
safety. Individuals designated by the Department of Corrections as Level III offenders typically
have a significant criminal history and have a high risk of re-offense. Most predatory offenders
commit numerous offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted
for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of predatory offender victimization to
society at large, while incalculable, unmistakably steep.
It is the intent of this Section to serve the City’s compelling interest to promote, protect
and improve the health, safety and welfare of Brainerd citizens by mitigating the concentration
of Level III offenders as intended by Minnesota Statute 244.052, by requiring physical
separation between the permanent and/or temporary residences of Level III predatory offenders.
920.02 Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this Section
of the Brainerd City Code, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the following definitions,
except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
1) Designated predatory offender. Any person who has been categorized as a
Level III predatory offender under Minnesota Statutes Section 244.052, a
successor statute, or a similar statute from another state in which that person’s
risk assessment indicates a high risk of re-offense;
2) Permanent residence. A place where a person abides, lodges, or resides for 14
or more consecutive days;
3) Temporary residence. A place where a person abides, lodges, or resides for a
period of 14 or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and
which is not the person’s permanent address, or a place where the person
routinely abides, lodges, or resides for a period of four or more consecutive or
non-consecutive days in any month and which is not the person’s permanent
residence.
920.03 Predatory offenders prohibition; penalties; exceptions.
1) Prohibited location of residence. It is unlawful for any designated Level III
predatory offender to establish a permanent residence or temporary residence
within 1,000 feet of the permanent or temporary residence of any other
designated Level III predatory offender.
Brainerd City Code 920.03 cont.
2) Measurement of distance. For purposes of determining the minimum distance
of separation, the requirement shall be measured by following a straight line
from the outer property line of the permanent residence or temporary
residence to the nearest outer property line of the permanent residence or
temporary residence of any other designated Level III predatory offender.
3) Penalties. A person who violates this Section shall be punished by a fine of an
amount not exceeding that set in accordance with Section 115 of this Code or
confinement for a term not exceeding 90 days, or by both such fine and
confinement. Each day a person maintains a residence in violation of this
Ordinance constitutes a separate violation. Violations shall be reported to the
Minnesota Department of Corrections and/or the Minnesota Department of
Public Safety.
4) Exceptions. A designated predatory offender residing within a prohibited area
as described in Section 920.03(1) does not commit a violation of this Section
if any of the following apply:
A) The person established the permanent residence or temporary
residence and reported and registered the residence pursuant to
Minnesota Statutes Sections 243.166 and 243.167, or a successor
statute, prior to the effective date of this Ordinance.
B) The person was a minor when he/she committed the offense and was
not convicted as an adult;
C) The person is a minor;
D) The residence is also the primary residence of the person’s parents,
grandparents, siblings or spouse;
E) The residence is a property purchased, leased, or contracted for and
licensed by the Minnesota Department of Corrections prior to the
effective date of this Ordinance.
920.04 Severability. The provisions of this Ordinance are severable, and if any provision
of this Ordinance, or application of any provision of this Ordinance due to any circumstance, is
held invalid, the application of such provision to other circumstances, and the remainder of this
Ordinance shall not be affected thereby.
920.05 Effective Date. This Ordinance will take effect and be in force after passage and
official publication.

years purchase or otherwise obtain, possess, and use tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco related
devices, and electronic delivery devices, and such sales, possession, and use are violations of
both State and Federal laws; and because studies have shown that most smokers begin smoking
before they have reached the age of 18 years and that those persons who reach the age of 18
years without having started smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking; and because
smoking has been shown to be the cause of several serious health problems which subsequently
place a financial burden on all levels of government; this ordinance shall be intended to regulate
the sale, possession, and use of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco related devices, and
electronic delivery devices for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect
minors against the serious effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco products,
tobacco related devices, and electronic delivery devices, and to further the official public policy
of the State of Minnesota in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as stated
in Minn. Stat. §144.391.

Section 2007 – Social Host Code
2007.01. Purpose and Findings. The City Council intends to discourage underage possession and
consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends to
hold persons who host events or gatherings criminally responsible where persons under 21 years

overdose or alcohol related traffic collisions.

is/are present, and condone the activity, and in some circumstances provide the
alcohol.
D. Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime, it is
difficult to prove, and an ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage
consumption.

hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs.

515-7-3: Procedure
515-7-4: Lapse of Variance
515-7-5: Performance Security
515-7-1: Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this Section is to provide for deviations
from the literal provisions of this Ordinance in instances where their strict application and
enforcement would cause practical difficulty to the individual property under consideration.
515-7-2: General Provisions and Evaluation Criteria.
Subdivision 1. Board of Appeals and Adjustments. The City Council shall be the Board of
Appeals and the Board of Appeals and Adjustments for this City, and as provided by Minnesota
Statute Section 462.354, Subd. 2 shall have the powers granted under Minnesota Statute Section
462.357, Subd. 6, as they may be amended from time to time.
Subdivision 2. Pursuant to Minnesota Statute Section 462.357, Subd. 6, as it may be amended
from time to time, the City Council, acting as a Board of Appeals and Adjustments, may issue
variances from the provisions of this Zoning Code. A variance is a modification or variation of
the provisions of this Zoning Code as applied to a specific piece of property.
Subdivision 3.
A. Variances shall only be permitted
I. When they are in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the
ordinance and
II. When the variances are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan
B. Variances may be granted when the applicant for the variance establishes that
there are practical difficulties in complying with the Zoning Ordinance.
Subdivision 4. “Practical Difficulties”, as used in connection with the granting of a variance
means that
I. The property owner proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner not
permitted by the Zoning Ordinance;
II. The plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the property not
created by the landowner; and
III. The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality.
_____________________________________________________________________________
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance Administration - Variances
7-2
Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical difficulties. Practical difficulties
include, but are not limited to, inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems.
Subdivision 5. Variances shall be granted for earth sheltered construction as defined in Section
216C.06, Subdivision 14, when in harmony with the Ordinance. The Board of Appeals and
Adjustments may not permit as a variance any use that is not allowed under the Zoning
Ordinance for property in the zone where the affected person’s land is located. The Board may
permit as a variance the temporary use of a one family dwelling as a two family dwelling. The
Board may impose conditions in the granting of variances. A condition must be directly related
to and must bear a rough proportionality to the impact created by the variance.
515-7-3: Procedure.

review.
D. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposal. Notice of the
public hearing shall be published in the official newspaper designated by the City
Council at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Notice of the hearing shall also be
mailed to owners of property located within three hundred fifty (350) feet of the outside
of the land to which the Variance will be applicable. The notice shall include a
description of the land and the proposed Variance. A copy of the application for the
proposed Variance shall be mailed to the Commissioner of Natural Resources and where
applicable the Mississippi Headwaters Board so that the Commissioner and Board will
receive at least ten (10) days notice of the hearing (this only applies to applications in the
Flood Zone).
E. The Planning Commission must act and report its recommendation in a timely manner so
that the City Council can act on the application within sixty (60) days of receipt of a
complete application, unless the review period for the application has been extended
pursuant to Minnesota Statutes 15.99. If it recommends the Variance, the Planning
Commission may impose conditions it considers necessary to protect the public health,
safety and welfare.
F. The City Council, after receipt of the report of the Planning Commission, may grant or
deny the Variance pursuant to criteria herein established. A copy of the City Council’s
_____________________________________________________________________________
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance Administration - Variances

Council, a similar application for a Variance affecting substantially the same property
shall not be considered again by the Planning Commission or City Council for at least six
(6) months from the date of its denial, unless a decision to reconsider such matter is made
by not less than a majority vote of the full City Council.
515-7-4: Lapse of Variance.
A. Unless otherwise specified by the City, if within one (1) year after granting a Variance
the use as allowed by the Variance shall not have been initiated or utilized, then such a
Variance shall become null and void unless a petition for an extension of time in which
to complete or utilize the Variance has been granted by the Zoning Administrator
provided that:
1. The extension is requested in writing and filed with the City at least thirty (30)
days prior to the expiration of the initial Variance request.
2. The request for extension states facts demonstrating that a good faith attempt has
been made to complete or utilize the Variance that has been granted.
3. A maximum of one (1) extension shall be granted.

515-11-4: General Standards for Common Open Space. No open area may be accepted as
common open space under the provisions of this Ordinance unless it meets the following
standards:
A. The location, shape, size, and character of the common open space must be suitable for
the planned development.
B. Common open space must be used for amenity or recreational purposes. The uses
authorized for the common open space must be appropriate to the scale and character of
the planned development, considering the size, density, expected population, topography,
and the number and type of dwellings to be provided.
C. Common open space must be suitably improved for its intended use, but common open
space containing natural features worthy of preservation may be left unimproved. The
buildings, structures and improvements which are permitted in the common open space
must be appropriate to the uses which are authorized for the common open space and
must conserve and enhance the amenities of the common open space having regard to its
topography and unimproved condition.

Brainerd Zoning Ordinance Administration – Planned Unit Developments (PUD)
11-6
Section 515-11-6: Enforcement of Development Schedule/Planned Unit Development
Staging. The construction and provision of all the common open spaces and public and private
recreational facilities that are shown on the final development plan must proceed at the same rate
as development. At least once every six (6) months following the approval of the final
development plan, City staff shall review all of the building permits issued for the planned
development and examine the construction that has taken place on the site. If it is found that the
rate of development is faster than the rate at which common open spaces and public and private
recreational facilities have been constructed and provided, this information shall be forwarded to
the City Council, which may revoke the Conditional Use Permit. If the developer or landowners
fail to complete the open spaces and recreation areas within sixty (60) days after the completion
of the remainder of the project, the City may finish the open space areas and assess the cost back
to the developer or landowner.
Section 515-11-7: Residential Density.
A. In order to encourage the protection of natural resources, to allow limited development in
an area with unusual building characteristics due to subsoil characteristics or to
encourage creative land use, a density transfer system may be allowed whereby lot sizes
smaller than that normally required in a district will be allowed on the developable land
in return for leaving the natural resource areas open from development. The number of
dwelling units proposed for the entire site shall not exceed the total number permitted
under the density indicated in the Comprehensive Plan where the land is located. If the
Planned Unit Development (PUD) is in more than one (1) density area, the number of
allowable dwelling units must be separately calculated for each portion of the Planned
Unit Development (PUD) that is in a separate area, and must then be combined to
determine the number of dwelling units allowable in the entire Planned Unit
Development (PUD).
B. The number of dwelling units which may be constructed within the Planned Unit
Development (PUD) shall be determined by dividing the gross acreage of the project area
by the maximum allowable density as set forth in Section 515-11-6.A of this Ordinance.
Section 515-11-8: Residential Planned Unit Development/Conditional Use Permit
Requirements.
A. It is the intent of this section to establish special requirements for the granting of a
Conditional Use Permit for residential Planned Unit Development (PUD) projects which
are in compliance with the density, permitted and conditional uses allowed in a specific
base district including dwellings, offices and institutional uses of one or more buildings
in relation to an overall design and integrated physical plan.

515-15-4: Non-conforming Buildings and Structures
515-15-5: Non-conforming Lots
515-15-1: Purpose and Intent. It is the purpose of this Section to provide for the regulation
of legal non-conforming lots, buildings, structures and uses and to specify those requirements,
circumstances and conditions under which legal non-conforming lots, buildings, structures, and
uses will be operated and maintained. The Zoning Ordinance establishes separate districts, each
of which is an appropriate area for the location of uses which are permitted in that district. It is
necessary and consistent with the establishment of these districts that non-conforming lots,
buildings, structures, and uses are not allowed to continue without restriction.
515-15-2: General Provisions.
A. Conditional Uses/Interim Uses/Uses By Administrative Permit. Any established use or
building legally existing prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, and which is herein
classified as a conditional use, interim use, or use by administrative permit may be
continued in like fashion and activity and shall automatically be considered as having
received the applicable approval. Any change to such a use, including, but not limited to,
building and/or site alteration, shall require a new permit be processed as provided in this
Ordinance.
B. Moving Nonconforming Buildings. No nonconforming building or structure shall be
moved to another lot or to any other part of the parcel of land upon which the same was
constructed prior to the effective date of this Ordinance unless such movement shall bring
the nonconformance into compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance.
C. Subdivision. No parcel of land or portion thereof shall be subdivided if such action
results in parcels, buildings and structures becoming nonconforming.
D. Any nonconformity, including the lawful use or occupation of land or premises existing at
the time of adoption of an additional control under this Ordinance, may be continued in
the same size and manner, including through repair, replacement, restoration,
maintenance, or improvement, but not including expansion, except as specifically
provided in this Section, unless:

one (1) year. Any subsequent use or occupancy of the land or premises shall be a
conforming use or occupancy.
2. Any nonconforming use is destroyed by fire or other peril to the extent greater
than fifty (50) percent of its market value, and no building permit has been
applied for within one hundred eighty (180) days of when the property is
damaged. In this case, the City of Brainerd may impose reasonable conditions
upon a building permit in order to mitigate any newly created impact on adjacent
property.
515-15-3: Non-Conforming Uses.
A. Changes to Non-Conforming Uses:
1. When a lawful, nonconforming use of any structure, building or parcel of land in
any district has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be
changed to any nonconforming use.
2. A lawful, nonconforming use of a structure, building or parcel of land may be
changed to lessen the nonconformity of the use. Once a nonconforming structure
or parcel of land has been changed, it shall not thereafter be so altered to increase
the nonconformity.
515-15-4: Non-Conforming Buildings and Structures.
A. Proposed Building or Structure. Any proposed building or structure which will, under
this title, become nonconforming but for which a Building Permit has been lawfully
granted prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, may be completed in accordance
with the approved plans, provided construction is started within sixty (60) days of the
issuance of a building permit, is not abandoned for a period of more than one hundred
twenty (120) days, and continues to completion within two (2) years. Such building or
structure shall thereafter be a legally nonconforming building or structure.
515-15-5: Non-Conforming Lots.
A. Vacant or Redeveloped Lots. Except in Floodplain and Flood Fringe districts, legal,
nonconforming lots of record may be developed, provided that:
1. Legally Established Lot. The lot in question was legally established in accordance
with City Code requirements existing at the time of its creation and is a separate,
distinct tax parcel.

15-3
2. Unsewered Lots or Parcels. A lot or parcel of twenty thousand (20,000) square
feet or larger, not having access to municipal sewer, shall be considered buildable
provided public health concerns (potable water and sanitary sewer) can be
adequately addressed.
3. Access. The lot in question has frontage on and will directly access an improved
public street.
4. Setback and Yard Requirements. The setback and yard requirements of the base
zoning district can be achieved while simultaneously resulting in development
which complies with the character and general design of the immediate area and
the objectives of the City's Comprehensive Plan and the provisions of this
Ordinance.
B. Developed Lots. An existing conforming use on a lot of substandard size and/or width
may be expanded or enlarged if such expansion or enlargement meets all other provisions
of this Ordinance.
515-15-6: Reestablishment of Nonconforming Buildings and Structures
A. Any building or structure which at one time had a nonresidential use may be
reestablished with a nonconforming use provided it is found that:
1. The building or structure and land in combination, cannot reasonably be used for
a conforming purpose;
2. The proposed use is compatible with adjacent properties and the area in which it
is located;
3. The proposed use will not be detrimental to the existing character and/or endanger
the public health, safety or general welfare of the area;
4. The proposed use is consistent with the comprehensive plan;
5. Off street parking is provided in accord with Section 22 – Off Street Parking.
6. A public hearing is held in accord with the process described in Section 5 –

SECTION 31
BED AND BREAKFASTS
Section:
515-31-1: Purpose and Intent
515-31-2: Conditional Use
515-31-1: Purpose and Intent. The City Council recognizes that bed and breakfasts are an
asset to the community and help the preservation of historic homes because the expense of
owning and maintaining historic homes has made them less suitable for single family dwellings.
Conversion of historic houses into multifamily uses is usually determined by the neighborhood
where it is located. It is therefore the intention of the City to limit bed and breakfast uses to
those homes where the use would benefit the surrounding area by allowing appropriate adaptive
reuse of historic dwellings.
515-31-2: Conditional Use. Bed and breakfasts are allowed by a Conditional Use Permit in
the R-R, R-E, R-1, R-2 and R-3 zoning districts as regulated in this Section, subject to the
following conditions:
A. At least two (2) off-street parking spaces must be provided on site for the owner and one
(1) parking space for each room of a bed and breakfast unit. The parking spaces must be
signed and the parking plan approved by City staff.
B. The dining facilities must not be open to the public and must be used exclusively by the
registered guests unless allowed as a separate permitted or conditional use.
C. Bed and breakfast uses in residential areas must be located at six hundred (600) feet apart
(approximately two (2) blocks).
D. An identification sign not exceeding twelve (12) square feet may be located on the site.
The sign must match the architectural features of the structure.

A. Findings of the City Council. Studies conducted by the Minnesota Attorney General, the
American Planning Association and cities such as St. Paul, MN; Indianapolis, IN;
Alexandria, MN; Rochester, MN; Phoenix, AZ; Los Angeles, CA; Seattle, WA; have
studied the impacts that adult establishments have in those communities. These studies
have concluded that adult establishments have an adverse impact on the surrounding
neighborhoods. Those impacts include increased crime rates, lower property values,
increased transiency, neighborhood blight and potential health risks. The City Council of
the City of Brainerd makes the following findings regarding the need to regulate adult
establishments. The findings are based upon the experiences of other cities where such
businesses have located, as studied by City staff. Based on these studies and findings, the
City Council concludes:
1. Adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the types set forth above.
2. The adverse impacts caused by adult establishments tend to diminish if adult
establishments are governed by locational requirements, licensing requirements
and health requirements.
3. It is not the intent of the City Council to prohibit adult establishments from having
a reasonable opportunity to locate in the City.
_____________________________________________________________________________
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance Adult Establishments
33-2
4. Minnesota State Statutes, Section 462.357, allows the City to adopt regulations to
promote the public health, safety, morals and general welfare.
5. The public health, safety, morals and general welfare will be promoted by the City
adopting regulations governing adult establishments.
6. Adult establishments can contribute to an increase in criminal activity in the area
in which such businesses are located, taxing City crime prevention programs and
law enforcement services.
7. Adult establishments can be used as fronts for prostitution and other criminal
activity. The experience of other cities indicates that the proper management and
operation of such businesses can, however, minimize this risk, provided the
owners and operators of such facilities are regulated by licensing or other
procedures.
8. Adult establishments can increase the risk of exposure to communicable diseases
including but not limited to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) for
which currently there is no cure. Experiences of other cities indicate that such
businesses can facilitate the spread of communicable diseases by virtue of the
design and use of the premises, thereby endangering not only the patrons of such
establishments but also the general public.
9. Adult establishments can cause or contribute to public health problems by the
presence of live adult entertainment in conjunction with food and/or drink on the
same premises.
10. The risk of criminal activity and/or public health problems can be minimized
through a licensing and regulatory scheme as prescribed herein.
B. It is the purpose of this Ordinance to regulate adult establishments to promote the health,
safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City and to establish reasonable
and uniform regulations to:
1. Prevent additional criminal activity within the City.
2. Prevent deterioration of neighborhoods and its consequent adverse effect on real
estate values of properties within the neighborhood.
3. To locate adult establishments away from residential areas, schools, churches,
libraries, parks, and playgrounds.
4. Prevent concentration of adult establishments within certain areas of the City.

Ordinance Language
SECTION 1.0 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE
1.1 Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minnesota
Statutes Chapter 103F and Chapter [394/462] delegated the responsibility to local
government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the
(City Council/ Board of Commissioners) of (community), Minnesota, does ordain as
follows.
1.2 Purpose:
1.21 This ordinance regulates development in the flood hazard areas of (community).
These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in
loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. It is the purpose of this ordinance to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by minimizing these
losses and disruptions.
1.22 National Flood Insurance Program Compliance. This ordinance is adopted to
comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program
codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59 -78, as amended, so as to
maintain the community’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
1.23 This ordinance is also intended to preserve the natural characteristics and
functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and
stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic
and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic
benefits and enhance community and economic development.
SECTION 2.0 GENERAL PROVISIONS
2.1 Lands to Which Ordinance Applies: This ordinance applies to all lands within the
jurisdiction of (Community) within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or
General Floodplain Districts. The boundaries of the zoning districts are determined by
scaling distances on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, or as modified in accordance with
2.12 below.
2.11 The Floodway, Flood Fringe and General Floodplain Districts are overlay districts
that are superimposed on all existing zoning districts. The standards imposed in
the overlay districts are in addition to any other requirements in this ordinance.
In case of a conflict, the more restrictive standards will apply.
2.12 Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated on the official
floodplain maps and actual field conditions, the flood elevations shall be the
governing factor in locating the regulatory floodplain limits.
2.13 Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be given a
reasonable opportunity to present their case to the (Planning Commission/Board
of Adjustment) and to submit technical evidence.
2.2 Incorporation of Maps by Reference: The following maps together with all attached
material are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of the Official Zoning
Map and this ordinance. The attached material includes the Flood Insurance Study for
______________ County, Minnesota, and Incorporated Areas, dated _____________
and the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels enumerated below, dated _______________,
all prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These materials are on file
in the (list location where maps will be filed – i.e., City Clerk’s office).

Commentary
1.1. is mandatory language. The zoning
enabling statute reference is Chapter 394
for counties and Chapter 462 for cities and
townships.
“Governing body” is the City Council or
County or Township Board.
1.21 & 1.22 is mandatory language
1.23 is optional language referencing the
natural beneficial functions of floodplains.
2.1. The types of floodplain zones present in
a community will vary, depending on
hydrologic conditions and the level of detail
of the applicable maps.
2.11 is optional – if the community has a
zoning ordinance – as most do – it’s helpful
to define these districts as overlay districts.
If not, then delete this statement and other
overlay references.
2.2 is mandatory language. Each
community must adopt the Flood Insurance
Study and specific map panels that
encompass its boundaries. Under
Minnesota Rules 6120.5700, these
materials are considered attachments to
the Zoning Map.
Listing of maps will vary by jurisdiction and
map type.

2.3 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this ordinance to repeal,
abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or other private agreements.
However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this
ordinance prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby
repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
2.4 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: This ordinance does not imply that areas outside
the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This ordinance does not create liability on the part of
(community) or its officers or employees for any flood damages that result from reliance
on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
2.5 Severability: If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this ordinance is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of law, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be
affected and shall remain in full force.
2.6 Definitions: Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance
must be interpreted according to common usage and so as to give this ordinance its
most reasonable application.
2.611 Accessory Use or Structure – a use or structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure.
2.612 Base Flood – the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
2.613 Base Flood Elevation – The elevation of the “regional flood.” The term “base
flood elevation” is used in the flood insurance survey.
2.614 Basement – any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor or
base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of
excavation below ground level.
2.615 Conditional Use – a specific type of structure or land use listed in the official
control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review procedure and
with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the official zoning
controls or building codes and upon a finding that:
(a) Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist.
(b) The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan if
one exists and are compatible with the existing neighborhood.
2.616 Critical Facilities – facilities necessary to a community’s public health and safety,
those that store or produce highly volatile, toxic or water-reactive materials, and
those that house occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life
or injury. Examples of critical facilities include hospitals, correctional facilities,
schools, daycare facilities, nursing homes, fire and police stations, wastewater
Maps, these maps should also be
listed in Section 2.3.
? For counties, the map index may be
used in lieu of listing all the map
panels individually.
Cities may choose to adopt other map
panels to encompass areas that may be
annexed in the future. Counties and
townships may choose to adopt city map
panels to encompass areas that may be
detached from cities. See Sections 2.7 & 2.8
Communities may also adopt preliminary
flood studies and/or other best available
data for regulatory purposes.
2.3 This statement not needed if already
included in zoning ordinance.
2.4 This statement not needed if already
included in zoning ordinance.
2.5 This statement not needed if already
included in zoning ordinance.
These definitions may already exist as part
of zoning ordinance, but check for
consistency. Definitions are mandatory
unless otherwise indicated.
2.612 is an optional definition. This term is
synonymous with the term “regional flood,
which is predominantly used in this
ordinance.
2.615 is an optional definition – check
against zoning ordinance. Some local
ordinances – and the state rules that apply
to floodplains – use the older term “special
use.”
2.616 is an optional definition – see the
(optional) regulation of critical facilities in
Section 4.5
treatment facilities, public electric utilities, water plants, fuel storage facilities,
and waste handling and storage facilities.
2.617 Development – any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving,
excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials.
2.618 Equal Degree of Encroachment – a method of determining the location of
floodway boundaries so that floodplain lands on both sides of a stream are
capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
2.619 Farm Fence – A fence as defined by Minn. Statutes Section 344.02, Subd. 1(a)-(d).
An open type fence of posts and wire is not considered to be a structure under
this ordinance. Fences that have the potential to obstruct flood flows, such as
chain link fences and rigid walls, are regulated as structures under this ordinance.
2.620 Flood – a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage of a
wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
2.621 Flood Frequency – the frequency for which it is expected that a specific flood
stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
2.622 Flood Fringe – the portion of the Special Flood Hazard Area (one percent annual
chance flood) located outside of the floodway. Flood fringe is synonymous with
the term “floodway fringe” used in the Flood Insurance Study for (community),
Minnesota.
2.623 Flood Insurance Rate Map – An official map on which the Federal Insurance
Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available
digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
2.624 Flood Prone Area – any land susceptible to being inundated by water from any
source.
2.625 Floodplain – the beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.
2.626 Floodproofing – a combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments
to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or
elimination of flood damages.
2.627 Floodway – the bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and
those portions of the adjoining floodplain which are reasonably required to carry
or store the regional flood discharge.
2.628 Lowest Floor – the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement).
An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles,
building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not
considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so
as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design
requirements of 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 60.3.
2.629 Manufactured Home – a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
“manufactured home” does not include the term “recreational vehicle.”
2.630 New Construction - Structures, including additions and improvements, and
placement of manufactured homes, for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the effective date of this ordinance.
2.619 is an optional definition – to be used
if this type of farm fence is to be exempted
from permit requirements
2.620. Optional definition
2.621. Optional definition
2.622. For cities mapped as part of countywide
flood insurance study, the county
name should be inserted here.
2.624 is an optional definition – sections 4.2
and 8.15 use the term flood-prone to
encompass vulnerable structures outside of
mapped areas.
2.631 Obstruction – any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence,
stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any
channel, watercourse, or regulatory floodplain which may impede, retard, or
change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or
collecting debris carried by such water.
2.632 One Hundred Year Floodplain – lands inundated by the “Regional Flood” (see
definition).
2.633 Principal Use or Structure – all uses or structures that are not accessory uses or
structures.
2.634 Reach – a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a
stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban
area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings
would most typically constitute a reach.
2.635 Recreational Vehicle – a vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400 square feet
or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be selfpropelled
or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily
not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for
recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the purposes of this ordinance,
the term recreational vehicle is synonymous with the term “travel trailer/travel
vehicle.”
2.636 Regional Flood – a flood which is representative of large floods known to have
occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be
expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 1% chance or
100-year recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term "base
flood" used in a flood insurance study.
2.637 Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE) - an elevation not less than one
foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood
elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from
designation of a floodway.
2.638 Repetitive Loss: Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two separate
occasions during a ten year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of
each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds 25% of the market value
of the structure before the damage occurred.
2.639 Special Flood Hazard Area – a term used for flood insurance purposes
synonymous with “One Hundred Year Floodplain.”
2.640 Start of Construction – includes substantial improvement, and means the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement
or other improvement that occurred before the permit’s expiration date. The
actual start is either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure
on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other

2.637. The one-foot elevation is mandated
by state law, but a higher elevation can
yield increased protection.
2.638. This is an optional, but highly

structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
2.641 Structure - anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories,
sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational vehicles not
meeting the exemption criteria specified in Section 10.22 of this ordinance and
other similar items.
2.642 Substantial Damage - means damage of any origin sustained by a structure where
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
2.643 Substantial Improvement - within any consecutive 365-day period, any
reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair
after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which
equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that
have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
(a) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been
identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions.
(b) Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.” For
the purpose of this ordinance, “historic structure” is as defined in 44 Code of
Federal Regulations, Part 59.1.
2.7 Annexations: The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference into Section
2.2 above may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the corporate boundaries of
the (community) at the time of adoption of this ordinance. If any of these floodplain
land areas are annexed into the (community) after the date of adoption of this
ordinance, the newly annexed floodplain lands will be subject to the provisions of this
ordinance immediately upon the date of annexation.
2.8 Detachments. The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference into Section
2.2 above will include floodplain areas that lie inside the corporate boundaries of
municipalities at the time of adoption of this ordinance. If any of these floodplain land
areas are detached from a municipality and come under the jurisdiction of (community)
after the date of adoption of this ordinance, the newly detached floodplain lands will be
subject to the provisions of this ordinance immediately upon the date of detachment.
SECTION 3.0 ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS
3.1 Districts:
3.11 Floodway District. The Floodway District includes those areas within Zones
AE/AO/AH (that have a floodway delineated) as shown on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map adopted in Section 2.2.
3.12 Flood Fringe District. The Flood Fringe District includes areas within Zones
AE/AO/AH (that have a floodway delineated) on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
adopted in Section 2.2, but located outside of the floodway.
3.13 General Floodplain District. The General Floodplain District includes those areas
within Zone(s) A or Zones AE/AO/AH (that do not have a floodway delineated) as
shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map adopted in Section 2.2.
2.643(b). “Historic structures” as defined in
the CFR generally include sites listed on or
eligible for the National Register of Historic
Places and state- or locally-designated
historic properties.
2.7 applies to cities only. It is optional but
recommended – if not included, any
annexation will trigger an amendment of
the floodplain ordinance.
Section 2.8 applies only to counties or
townships that exercise zoning authority.
Counties may choose to adopt specific map
panels or adopt the countywide map index.
3.11 – 3.13. For lakes, ponds and wetlands,
the floodway is usually administratively
defined as the area at or below the
Ordinary High Water Level. If a community
has floodplain delineations on the FIRM for
lakes, ponds and wetland without
delineated floodways, contact DNR
Floodplain Program staff for specific
language.
Zones AO and AH are areas prone to
flooding due to overland flow or small
ponds, and are not typically found on most
FIRMs.
3.2 Applicability: Where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are delineated on the
floodplain maps, the standards in Sections 5 or 6 will apply, depending on the location of
a property. Locations where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are not delineated on
the floodplain maps are considered to fall within the General Floodplain district. Within
the General Floodplain district, the Floodway District standards in Section 5 apply unless
the floodway boundary is determined, according to the process outlined in Section 7.2.
SECTION 4.0 REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS
4.1 Permit Required. A permit must be obtained from the Zoning Administrator to verify a
development meets the standards outlined in this ordinance prior to conducting the
following activities:
4.11 The erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation, or alteration of any building,
structure, or portion thereof. Normal maintenance and repair also requires a
permit if such work, separately or in conjunction with other planned work,
constitutes a substantial improvement as defined in this ordinance.
4.12 The use or change of use of a building, structure, or land.
4.13 The construction of a dam, on-site septic system, or fence, although a permit is
not required for a farm fence as defined in this ordinance.
4.14 The change or extension of a nonconforming use.
4.15 The repair of a structure that has been damaged by flood, fire, tornado, or any
other source.
4.16 The placement of fill, excavation of materials, or the storage of materials or
equipment within the floodplain.
4.17 Relocation or alteration of a watercourse (including new or replacement culverts
and bridges), unless a public waters work permit has been applied for.
4.18 Any other type of “development” as defined in this ordinance.
4.2 Building Sites. If a proposed building site is in a flood prone area, all new construction
and substantial improvements (including the placement of manufactured homes) must
be:
4.21 Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent floatation, collapse,
or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
4.22 Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
4.23 Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; and
4.24 Constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to
prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding.
4.3 Flood Capacity. In no cases shall floodplain development adversely affect the efficiency
or unduly restrict the capacity of the channels or floodways of any tributaries to the main
stream, drainage ditches, or any other drainage facilities or systems.
4.4 The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive,
or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
4.5 Critical Facilities, as defined in Section 2.616, are prohibited in all floodplain districts.
4.13. The exemption for farm fences is
optional.
4.17. Any change in the course, current or
cross-section of public waters requires a
public waters work permit from the DNR
under MN Stat. 103G.245. See also 5.44.
4.5. Optional, but highly encouraged to
keep critical infrastructure and
concentrations of people out of floodplain
areas.
SECTION 5.0 FLOODWAY DISTRICT (FW)
5.1 Permitted Uses: The following uses, subject to the standards set forth in Section 5.2, are
permitted uses if otherwise allowed in the underlying zoning district or any applicable
overlay district:
5.11 General farming, pasture, grazing, farm fences, outdoor plant nurseries,
horticulture, forestry, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting.
5.12 Industrial-commercial loading areas, parking areas, and airport landing strips.
5.13 Open space uses, including but not limited to private and public golf courses,
tennis courts, driving ranges, archery ranges, picnic grounds, boat launching
ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature preserves, game farms, fish
hatcheries, shooting preserves, hunting and fishing areas, and single or multiple
purpose recreational trails.
5.14 Residential yards, lawns, gardens, parking areas, and play areas.
5.15 Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines and pipelines, provided that
the Department of Natural Resources’ Area Hydrologist is notified at least ten
days prior to issuance of any permit.
5.2 Standards for Floodway Permitted Uses:
5.21 The use must have a low flood damage potential.
5.22 The use must not obstruct flood flows or cause any increase in flood elevations
and must not involve structures, obstructions, or storage of materials or
equipment.
5.23 Any facility that will be used by employees or the general public must be
designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for
evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth
(in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a product of
four upon occurrence of the regional (1% chance) flood.
5.3 Conditional Uses: The following uses may be allowed as conditional uses following the
standards and procedures set forth in Section 11.4 of this ordinance and further subject
to the standards set forth in Section 5.4, if otherwise allowed in the underlying zoning
district or any applicable overlay district.
5.31 Structures accessory to the uses listed in 5.11 – 5.13 above and the uses listed in
5.32 - 5.33 below.
5.32 Extraction, fill and storage of soil, sand, gravel, and other materials.
5.33 Marinas, boat rentals, permanent docks, piers, wharves, and water control
structures.
5.34 Storage yards for equipment, machinery, or materials.
5.35 Construction of fences that obstruct flood flows. Farm fences, as defined in
section 2.619, are permitted uses.
5.36 Travel-ready recreational vehicles meeting the exception standards in Section
10.22.
5.37 Levees or dikes intended to protect agricultural crops for a frequency flood event
equal to or less than the 10-year frequency flood event.
5.4 Standards for Floodway Conditional Uses:
5.0. It is critical that the floodway be
protected so that it can transport and store
the waters of the regional (100-year) flood
without increased flood heights or
velocities or threats to public health and
safety.
Note that communities are not required to
adopt all of the listed uses, but must
provide for some use of the floodway land.
Other similar uses may be included in this
section if they meet the standards in
Section 5.2. Communities may choose to
greatly restrict development in all
floodplain areas by using the DNR’s
“Restrictive Ordinance.”
5.15. Earlier versions of the DNR sample
ordinances listed utility and transportation
uses as conditional uses. In this version,
these uses are permitted if DNR is notified
and certain standards are met
5.2. Higher standards for floodway
protection could include limiting impervious
coverage in the floodway, in order to
facilitate infiltration of rainfall.
5.3. Note that these conditional uses are
optional for the community but, if allowed,
must meet the standards in Sections 5.4.
Communities are encouraged to select only
those conditional uses that are appropriate
for their community.
5.35. Optional statement in 4.35 allows
typical farm fences such as barbed wire
fences that don’t obstruct flood flows as
permitted uses. See also Section 4.13
5.36 is optional. We recommend treating
recreational vehicles as a conditional use so
that road access and warning systems are
carefully reviewed to ensure public safety in
times of flooding.
5.4. Note that flood control projects
intended to remove areas from the
5.41 All Uses. A conditional use must not cause any increase in the regional flood
elevations or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches
affected.
5.42 Fill; Storage of Materials and Equipment:
(a) Fill, dredge spoil, and other similar materials deposited or stored in the
floodplain must be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching,
riprap or other acceptable method. Permanent sand and gravel operations
and similar uses must be covered by a long-term site development plan.
(b) Temporary placement of fill, other materials, or equipment which would
cause an increase to the stage of the 1% percent chance or regional flood may
only be allowed if the (Governing Body) has approved a plan that assures
removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning
time available.
5.43 Accessory Structures. Accessory structures, as identified in Section 5.31, may be
permitted, provided that:
(a) Structures are not intended for human habitation;
(b) Structures will have a low flood damage potential;
(c) Structures will be constructed and placed so as to offer a minimal obstruction
to the flow of flood waters;
(d) Service utilities, such as electrical and heating equipment, within these
structures must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation or properly floodproofed;
(e) Structures must be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed in
accordance with the FP1 or FP2 floodproofing classifications in the State
Building Code. All floodproofed structures must be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement and designed to equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
(f) As an alternative, an accessory structure may be internally/wet floodproofed
to the FP3 or FP4 floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code,
provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment. Designs
for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or meet or exceed the following criteria:
(1) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a
minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the
structure, with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; and
(2) There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the
bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest
adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a
garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for
automatic openings.
5.44 Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross
section of protected wetlands or public waters are subject to the provisions of
Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.245.
5.45 A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway must not cause an
increase to the 1% chance or regional flood. The technical analysis must assume
equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream.
floodway to allow development of single or
multiple structures are not permitted unless
a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) can be
obtained to change the floodway boundary.
Contact DNR Floodplain Program staff for
further information.
5.42(a) must be included if community
chooses to allow deposition or storage of
fill in the floodway
5.42(b) is an optional alternative allowing
temporary storage of fill or other materials
that could increase flood stage, suitable for
the types of locations where adequate
flood warning times will be available to
allow removal of materials.
4.43. If accessory structures are to be
allowed in the floodway, items (a) through
(d) are required.
5.43(f) is optional language allowing for
wet floodproofing of small accessory
structures that constitute a minimal
investment.
5.44 is an optional provision providing
notice that work in public waters requires a
DNR permit.
5.46 Floodway developments must not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the
channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage
system.
SECTION 6.0 FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF)
6.1 Permitted Uses: Permitted uses are those uses of land or structures allowed in the
underlying zoning district(s) that comply with the standards in Sections 6.2. If no preexisting,
underlying zoning districts exist, then any residential or nonresidential structure
or use of a structure or land is a permitted use provided it does not constitute a public
nuisance.
6.2 Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses:
6.211 All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the
lowest floor, as defined, is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
The finished fill elevation for structures must be no lower than one foot below
the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill must extend at the same
elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the structure.
6.212 Accessory Structures. As an alternative to the fill requirements of section 6.211,
structures accessory to the uses identified in Section 6.1 may be permitted to be
internally/wet floodproofed to the FP3 or FP4 floodproofing classifications in the
State Building Code, provided that:
(a) The accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed
576 square feet in size, and is only used for parking and storage.
(b) All portions of floodproofed accessory structures below the Regulatory Flood
Protection Elevation must be: (i) adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement and designed to equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls, (ii) be constructed with materials resistant to flood
damage, and (iii) must have all service utilities be water-tight or elevated to
above the regulatory flood protection elevation
(c) Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or meet or exceed the following criteria:
(1) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a
minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the
structure, with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; and
(2) There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the
bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest
adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a
garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for
automatic openings.
6.213 The cumulative placement of fill or similar material on a parcel must not exceed
1,000 cubic yards, unless the fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in
accordance with Section 6.211 of this ordinance, or if allowed as a conditional
use under Section 6.33 below.
6.214 The storage of any materials or equipment must be elevated on fill to the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
6.215 All service utilities, including ductwork, must be elevated or water-tight to
prevent infiltration of floodwaters.
6.216 All fill must be properly compacted and the slopes must be properly protected by
the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
6.1. If underlying zoning district(s) are
present (as in most communities) the
second sentence can be deleted.
6.211. “Lowest floor” is defined as the
lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area,
including basements, crawl spaces, etc. See
Section 2.628.
6.212(a). A special note that the bulk
standards here slightly exceed those
allowed through 6120.330(Subp 3)(H) of
the Shoreland Rules. Most restrictive
standard applies.
6.212(b). If an accessory structure exceeds
576 square feet, then FEMA will not allow
internal floodproofing, and the structure
must be elevated on fill in accordance to
6.211 or dry floodproofed in accordance
with 6.43.
6.213 is an optional provision. Treating
large volumes of fill as a conditional use
allows communities to require an erosion
control and emergency removal plan for
uses such as sand and gravel mining or
dredge spoil storage.
6.217 All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation
not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation, or must
have a flood warning /emergency evacuation plan acceptable to the (Governing
Body).
6.218 Accessory uses such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at an
elevation lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, any
facilities used by employees or the general public must be designed with a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area is
inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth (in feet) multiplied by the
velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a product of four upon occurrence of
the regional (1% chance) flood.
6.219 Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles must meet the standards of
Section 10 of this ordinance.
6.3 Conditional Uses: The following uses and activities may be allowed as conditional uses,
if allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) or any applicable overlay district, following
the procedures in Section 11.4 of this ordinance.
6.31 Storage of any material or equipment below the regulatory flood protection
elevation.
6.32 The cumulative placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill when the fill is
not being used to elevate a structure in accordance with Section 6.211 of this
ordinance.
6.33 (OPTIONAL) The use of methods to elevate structures above the regulatory
flood protection elevation, including stilts, pilings, parallel walls, or above-grade,
enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages, shall meet the
standards in Section 6.46.
6.4 Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses:
6.41 The standards listed in Sections 6.214 through 6.219 apply to all conditional uses.
6.42 Residential basements, as defined by Section 2.614 of this ordinance, are not
allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation.
6.43 All areas of nonresidential structures, including basements, to be placed below
the regulatory flood protection elevation must be structurally dry floodproofed,
meeting the FP1 or FP2 floodproofing classification in the State Building Code,
which requires making the structure watertight with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components capable of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
6.44 The placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material on
a parcel (other than for the purpose of elevating a structure to the regulatory
flood protection elevation) must comply with an approved
erosion/sedimentation control plan.
(a) The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site
for a flood event at a minimum of the regional (1% chance) flood event.
(b) The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer
or other qualified individual acceptable to the (Governing Body).
(c) The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material
from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
6.217 is optional, but such access
requirements is mandatory for subdivisions,
including manufactured home parks and
recreational vehicle parks/campgrounds.
See also Section 8.12.
6.3. As with conditional uses in the
floodway, conditional uses in the flood
fringe are optional – communities should
determine which of these uses are needed
and appropriate in their floodplain areas.
6.33. The DNR refers to these as
“alternative elevation methods”, meaning
it is an alternative to fill. This is designated
optional because they are burdensome to
administer – typically requiring
nonconversion agreements and detailed
monitoring and inspections. See 6.46.
6.42. Some communities have been given
“basement exceptions”, which allow dryfloodproofing
below the RFPE.
6.44. Optional provisions to be used if
placement of this amount of fill is regulated
as a conditional use.
6.45 Storage of materials and equipment below the regulatory flood protection
elevation must comply with an approved emergency plan providing for removal
of such materials within the time available after a flood warning.
6.46 (OPTIONAL) Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered
above-grade and not a structure’s basement or lowest floor if: 1) the enclosed
area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure; 2) it is designed to
internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and 3) it is used
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The above-noted
alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards:
(a) Design and Certification - The structure’s design and as-built condition must
be certified by a registered professional engineer as being in compliance with
the general design standards of the State Building Code and, specifically, that
all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or
accumulating within these components during times of flooding. Structure
shall be subject to a nonconversion agreement with upon the issuance of any
permit.
(b) Above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages
must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
(1) The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to
be used as a floodproofing technique. There shall be a minimum of two
openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all
openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. The automatic
openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch
for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a
registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net
area would suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with
screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they
permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters without any form of
human intervention; and
(2) That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in
accordance with the FP3 or FP4 classifications in the State Building Code
and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage.
SECTION 7.0 GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT (GF)
7.1 Permitted Uses:
7.11 The uses listed in Section 5.1 of this ordinance, Floodway District Permitted Uses,
are permitted uses.
7.12 All other uses are subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria
specified in Section 7.2 below. Section 5.0 applies if the proposed use is
determined to be in the Floodway District. Section 6.0 applies if the proposed use
is determined to be in the Flood Fringe District.
7.2 Procedures for Determining Floodway and Flood Fringe Boundaries and Regional Flood
Elevations:
7.21 Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the General
Floodplain District, the Zoning Administrator must obtain, review and reasonably
6.46. Standard tied to the optional 6.34.
The DNR refers to these as “alternative
elevation methods”, meaning it is an
alternative to fill. This is designated
optional because they are burdensome to
administer – typically requiring
nonconversion agreements and detailed
monitoring and inspections.
7.1. If the General Floodplain District (the A
zone, or the AE, AO or AH zones without a
defined floodway) is not present within the
community, delete the contents of this
section and retitle it “Reserved for Future
Use” (i.e., in case a future annexation or
map update would add an A zone).
7.2. State and federal rules establish
standards for this determination but do not
specify a procedure to be followed.
(However, the community is required under
44 CFR 60.3(b)(4) to “obtain, review and
reasonably utilize” base flood elevation and
floodway data.) The procedure shown here
is one that DNR suggests that communities
utilize any regional flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other source.
7.22 If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily available, or the
application involves a project exceeding the lesser of five acres or 50 lots, the
applicant must furnish additional information, as needed, to determine the
regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use would fall
within the Floodway or Flood Fringe District. Information must be consistent with
accepted hydrological and hydraulic engineering standards and the standards in
7.23 below.
7.23 The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include the following
components, as applicable:
(a) Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (1% chance) flood.
(b) Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a
hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.
(c) Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood
without increasing flood stages more than one-half (0.5) foot. A lesser stage
increase than 0.5 foot is required if, as a result of the stage increase,
increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on
both sides of the stream within the reach must be assumed in computing
floodway boundaries.
7.24 The Zoning Administrator will review the submitted information and assess the
technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood Fringe
District boundary. The assessment must include the cumulative effects of
previous floodway encroachments. The Zoning Administrator may seek technical
assistance from a designated engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources. Based on this assessment, the
Zoning Administrator may approve or deny the application.
7.25 Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries have been determined,
the Zoning Administrator must process the permit application consistent with the
applicable provisions of Section 5.0 and 6.0 of this ordinance.
SECTION 8.0 SUBDIVISION STANDARDS
8.1 Subdivisions: No land may be subdivided which is unsuitable for reasons of flooding or
inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. Manufactured home
parks and recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds are considered subdivisions under
this ordinance.
8.11 All lots within the floodplain districts must be able to contain a building site
outside of the Floodway District at or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation.
8.12 All subdivisions must have road access both to the subdivision and to the
individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood
protection elevation, unless a flood warning emergency plan for the safe
evacuation of all vehicles and people during the regional (1% chance) flood has
been approved by the (Governing Body). The plan must be prepared by a
registered engineer or other qualified individual, and must demonstrate that
adequate time and personnel exist to carry out the evacuation.
8.13 For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District
boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation
of all access roads must be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings
and platting documents.
follow. DNR Floodplain Program staff can
assist communities in obtaining relevant
data and completing determinations as
they arise.
7.24. Federal rules require that
communities assess the cumulative effects
of floodway encroachments on both sides
of a stream. Contact Floodplain Program
staff for assistance in making this
assessment.
Section 8.0 is mandatory as long as the
community is not built out. These provisions
can be integrated into a city or county
subdivision ordinance, where one exists.
Note that manufactured home and
recreational vehicle parks are treated as
subdivisions.
8.14 In the General Floodplain District, applicants must provide the information
required in Section 7.2 of this ordinance to determine the regional flood
elevation, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries and the regulatory
flood protection elevation for the subdivision site.
8.15 Subdivision proposals must be reviewed to assure that:
(a) All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage
within the flood prone area,
(b) All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage,
and
(c) Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure of flood hazard.
SECTION 9.0 PUBLIC UTILITIES, RAILROADS, ROADS, AND BRIDGES
9.1 Public Utilities: All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer, and water
supply systems to be located in the floodplain must be floodproofed in accordance with
the State Building Code or elevated to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
9.2 Public Transportation Facilities: Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges to be located within
the floodplain must comply with Sections 4.0 and 5.0 of this ordinance. These
transportation facilities must be elevated to the regulatory flood protection elevation
where failure or interruption of these facilities would result in danger to the public
health or safety or where such facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the
area. Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation
where failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the public
health or safety.
9.3 On-site Water Supply and Sewage Treatment Systems: Where public utilities are not
provided: 1) On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the systems and are subject to the provisions in
Minnesota Rules Chapter 4725.4350, as amended; and 2) New or replacement on-site
sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters, they
must not be subject to impairment or contamination during times of flooding, and are
subject to the provisions in Minnesota Rules Chapter 7080.2270, as amended.
SECTION 10.0 MANUFACTURED HOMES AND RECREATIONAL VEHICLES.
10.1 Manufactured Homes: New manufactured home parks and expansions to existing
manufactured home parks are prohibited in any floodplain district. For existing
manufactured home parks or lots of record, the following requirements apply:
10.11 Placement or replacement of manufactured home units is prohibited in the
Floodway District.
10.12 Placement or replacement of manufactured home units in the Flood Fringe
District is subject to the requirements of Section 6 of this ordinance and the
following standards.
(a) New and replacement manufactured homes must be elevated in compliance
with Section 5 of this ordinance and must be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and
lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces.
9.3. MPCA oversees the Rules regulating
septic systems (7080.2270) and wells
(4725.4350), which regulate location and
design in relation to floodplains.
10.1. This subsection is mandatory; the
remainder of Section 10.0 is optional but
recommended if manufactured home parks
are located in any floodplain districts.
(b) New or replacement manufactured homes in existing manufactured home
parks must meet the vehicular access requirements for subdivisions in Section
8.12 of this ordinance.
10.2 Recreational Vehicles: New recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds and expansions
to existing recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds are prohibited in any floodplain
district. Placement of recreational vehicles in existing recreational vehicle parks or
campgrounds in the floodplain must meet the requirements below.
10.21 Recreational vehicles are exempt from the provisions of this ordinance if they are
placed in any of the following areas and meet the criteria listed in Section 10.22:
(a) Individual lots or parcels of record.
(b) Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds.
(c) Existing condominium-type associations.
10.22 Criteria for Exempt Recreational Vehicles:
(a) The vehicle must have a current license required for highway use.
(b) The vehicle must be highway ready, meaning on wheels or the internal
jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
commonly used in campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks.
(c) No permanent structural type additions may be attached to the vehicle.
(d) Accessory structures may be permitted in the Flood Fringe District, provided
that they constitute a minimal investment, do not hinder the removal of the
vehicle should flooding occur, and meet the standards outlined in Sections 4.2
and 6.212.
SECTION 11.0 ADMINISTRATION
11.1 Duties: A Zoning Administrator or other official designated by the (Governing Body) must
administer and enforce this ordinance.
11.2 Permit Application Requirements:
11.21 Application for Permit. Permit applications must be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator on forms provided by the Zoning Administrator. The permit
application must include the following as applicable:
(a) A site plan showing all pertinent dimensions, existing or proposed buildings,
structures, and significant natural features having an influence on the permit.
(b) Location of fill or storage of materials in relation to the stream channel.
(c) Copies of any required municipal, county, state or federal permits or
approvals.
(d) Other relevant information requested by the Zoning Administrator as
necessary to properly evaluate the permit application.
11.22 Certification. The applicant is required to submit certification by a registered
professional engineer, registered architect, or registered land surveyor that the
finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in compliance with the
provisions of this ordinance. Floodproofing measures must be certified by a
registered professional engineer or registered architect. Accessory structures
designed in accordance with Section 6.212 of this ordinance are exempt from
certification, provided sufficient documentation is provided.
11. 23 Certificate of Zoning Compliance for a New, Altered, or Nonconforming Use. No
building, land or structure may be occupied or used in any manner until a
certificate of zoning compliance has been issued by the Zoning Administrator
10.2 has recently been revised to recognize
MN Department of Health rules (Section
4630.0200), which prohibit mobile home
parks and recreational camping areas in
flood-prone areas. Placement or
replacement of manufactured home units
may be allowed in existing manufactured
home parks or on lots of record.
10.21 – 10.22. These exemption criteria are
required if recreational vehicles are allowed
within any floodplain district. If this section
is not used, recreational vehicle placement
must be explicitly prohibited in floodplain
districts – including temporary storage.
10.22 (d). Communities may apply a
monetary limit such as $500 as a threshold
for a “minimal investment,” recognizing
that this threshold will vary from place to
place.
11.0. Many of the standards and
procedures in this section are likely to exist
in other parts of the community’s zoning
ordinance, and may be cross-referenced
rather than repeated here. However, the
community must be able to demonstrate
that these procedures or comparable ones
are in place.
The term “Zoning Administrator” is used
throughout this section for ease of
reference, but in some communities the
City Clerk or other official may fill this role.
11.21. This section may cross-reference any
other permitting requirements in the zoning
ordinance.
stating that the use of the building or land conforms to the requirements of this
ordinance.
11.24 Record of First Floor Elevation. The Zoning Administrator must maintain a record
of the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new structures
and alterations or additions to existing structures in the floodplain. The Zoning
Administrator must also maintain a record of the elevation to which structures
and alterations or additions to structures are floodproofed.
11.25 Notifications for Watercourse Alterations. Before authorizing any alteration or
relocation of a river or stream, the Zoning Administrator must notify adjacent
communities. If the applicant has applied for a permit to work in public waters
pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.245, this will suffice as adequate
notice. A copy of the notification must also be submitted to the Chicago Regional
Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
11.26 Notification to FEMA When Physical Changes Increase or Decrease Base Flood
Elevations. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date
such supporting information becomes available, the Zoning Administrator must
notify the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the changes by submitting a copy
of the relevant technical or scientific data.
11.3 Variances:
11.31 Variance Applications. An application for a variance to the provisions of this
ordinance will be processed and reviewed in accordance with applicable State
Statutes and Section(s) _________________ of the zoning ordinance/code.
11.32 Adherence to State Floodplain Management Standards. A variance must not
allow a use that is not allowed in that district, permit a lower degree of flood
protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area,
or permit standards lower than those required by state law.
11.33 Additional Variance Criteria. The following additional variance criteria of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied:
(a) Variances must not be issued by a community within any designated
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
(b) Variances may only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
(c) Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
11.34 Flood Insurance Notice. The Zoning Administrator must notify the applicant for a
variance that: 1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and 2) Such construction
below the base or regional flood level increases risks to life and property. Such
notification must be maintained with a record of all variance actions.
11.35 General Considerations. The community may consider the following factors in
granting variances and imposing conditions on variances and conditional uses in
floodplains:
11.31 should cross-reference all sections of
the zoning ordinance that regulate
processing and review of variance
applications. 11.3 only contains DNR/FEMA
– mandated regulatory & notification
provisions.
Communities that administer zoning
ordinances (including floodplain
ordinances) must establish a board of
adjustment to hear appeals and variance
requests. In many communities, the city
council, county board, or planning
commission serves as the board of
adjustment.
11.33 (a-c) is language required by FEMA
and must be adopted verbatim. Note
specifically that the reference to
“exceptional hardship” in (b)(ii) must
remain in the ordinance, even though it has
been replaced by the term “practical
difficulties” in state zoning enabling
statutes.
11.34 is required by FEMA.
Section 11.35 is optional guidance for
communities in reviewing variance
applications. The same factors are
recommended for review of conditional use
applications, below.
(a) The potential danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments;
(b) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream to
the injury of others;
(c) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems, if any, and the ability of
these systems to minimize the potential for disease, contamination and
unsanitary conditions;
(d) The susceptibility of any proposed use and its contents to flood damage and
the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(e) The importance of the services to be provided by the proposed use to the
community;
(f) The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location;
(g) The availability of viable alternative locations for the proposed use that are
not subject to flooding;
(h) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
(i) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Land Use Plan
and flood plain management program for the area;
(j) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
(k) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport
of the flood waters expected at the site.
11.36 Submittal of Hearing Notices to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The
(designated body/community official) must submit hearing notices for proposed
variances to the DNR sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten days’ notice
of the hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the
respective DNR area hydrologist.
11.37 Submittal of Final Decisions to the DNR. A copy of all decisions granting
variances must be forwarded to the DNR within ten days of such action. The
notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area
hydrologist.
11.38 Record-Keeping. The Zoning Administrator must maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and must report such variances
in an annual or biennial report to the Administrator of the National Flood
Insurance Program, when requested by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
11.4 Conditional Uses:
11.41 Administrative Review. An application for a conditional use permit under the
provisions of this ordinance will be processed and reviewed in accordance with
Section(s) ______________ of the zoning ordinance/code.
11.42 Factors Used in Decision-Making. In passing upon conditional use applications,
the (Governing Body) must consider all relevant factors specified in other
sections of this ordinance, and those factors identified in Section 10.35 of this
ordinance.
11.43 Conditions Attached to Conditional Use Permits. The (Governing Body) may
attach such conditions to the granting of conditional use permits as it deems
11.41 should cross-reference any
conditional use procedures in the zoning
ordinance, if these exist.
Section 11.42 is optional but recommended
as guidance for decisions on conditional
uses (and variances, as noted above).
11.43 is also optional; conditions are
intended to be specific to the particular site
and proposed use.
necessary to fulfill the purposes of this ordinance. Such conditions may include,
but are not limited to, the following:
(a) Modification of waste treatment and water supply facilities.
(b) Limitations on period of use, occupancy, and operation.
(c) Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
(d) Requirements for construction of channel modifications, compensatory
storage, dikes, levees, and other protective measures.
(e) Floodproofing measures, in accordance with the State Building Code and this
ordinance. The applicant must submit a plan or document certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing measures
are consistent with the regulatory flood protection elevation and associated
flood factors for the particular area.
11.44 Submittal of Hearing Notices to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The
(designated body/community official) must submit hearing notices for proposed
conditional uses to the DNR sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten days’
notice of the hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to
the respective DNR area hydrologist.
11.45 Submittal of Final Decisions to the DNR. A copy of all decisions granting
conditional uses must be forwarded to the DNR within ten days of such action.
The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area
hydrologist.
SECTION 12.0 NONCONFORMITIES
12.1 Continuance of Nonconformities: A use, structure, or occupancy of land which was
lawful before the passage or amendment of this ordinance but which is not in conformity
with the provisions of this ordinance may be continued subject to the following
conditions. Historic structures, as defined in Section 2.643(b) of this ordinance, are
subject to the provisions of Sections 12.11 – 12.16 of this ordinance.
12.11 A nonconforming use, structure, or occupancy must not be expanded, changed,
enlarged, or altered in a way that increases its flood damage potential or degree
of obstruction to flood flows except as provided in 12.12 below. Expansion or
enlargement of uses, structures or occupancies within the Floodway District is
prohibited.
12.12 Any addition or structural alteration to a nonconforming structure or
nonconforming use that would result in increasing its flood damage potential
must be protected to the regulatory flood protection elevation in accordance
with any of the elevation on fill or floodproofing techniques (i.e., FP1 thru FP4
floodproofing classifications) allowable in the State Building Code, except as
further restricted in 12.14 below.
12.13 If any nonconforming use, or any use of a nonconforming structure, is
discontinued for more than one year, any future use of the premises must
conform to this ordinance.
12.14 If any structure experiences a substantial improvement as defined in this
ordinance, then the entire structure must meet the standards of Section 5.0 or
6.0 of this ordinance for new structures, depending upon whether the structure
is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District, respectively. If the current proposal,
including maintenance and repair during the previous 365 days, plus the costs of
any previous alterations and additions since the first Flood Insurance Rate Map
(or add date) exceeds 50 percent of the market value of any nonconforming
12.11. Buildings and structures within the
Floodway District may not be enlarged or
expanded. In some cases, a floodway area
can be filled without causing any rise in
flood stage. In such cases, a Letter of Map
Revision may be obtained that changes the
floodway boundary, placing the area in the
Flood Fringe. Contact Floodplain Program
staff for details.
Section 12.13 reflects an optional provision
in statute (462.357(Subd 1e)(1) and 394.36)
– local government may impose reasonable
conditions on the nonconforming use or
structure. Many communities have adopted
similar provisions in their zoning
ordinances.
12.14. The language presented is
recommended, in order to gradually
eliminate nonconformities over time.
Federal standards require that substantial
improvement is tracked over a one-year
period. The last sentence can be omitted if
community does not wish to track
improvements over the life of a structure.
structure, the entire structure must meet the standards of Section 5.0 or 6.0 of
this ordinance.
12.15 If any nonconformity is substantially damaged, as defined in this ordinance, it
may not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this
ordinance. The applicable provisions for establishing new uses or new structures
in Sections 5.0 or 6.0 will apply depending upon whether the use or structure is
in the Floodway or Flood Fringe, respectively.
12.16 If any nonconforming use or structure experiences a repetitive loss, as defined in
Section 2.638 of this ordinance, it must not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
SECTION 13.0 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES
13.1 Violation Constitutes a Misdemeanor: Violation of the provisions of this ordinance or
failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with grants of variances or conditional uses)
constitute a misdemeanor and will be punishable as defined by law.
13.2 Other Lawful Action: Nothing in this ordinance restricts the (community) from taking
such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. If the
responsible party does not appropriately respond to the Zoning Administrator within the
specified period of time, each additional day that lapses will constitute an additional
violation of this ordinance and will be prosecuted accordingly.
13.3 Enforcement: Violations of the provisions of this ordinance will be investigated and
resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section(s) ________________ of the
zoning ordinance/code. In responding to a suspected ordinance violation, the Zoning
Administrator and (Governing Body) may utilize the full array of enforcement actions
available to it including but not limited to prosecution and fines, injunctions, after-thefact
permits, orders for corrective measures or a request to the National Flood Insurance
Program for denial of flood insurance availability to the guilty party. The (community)
must act in good faith to enforce these official controls and to correct ordinance
violations to the extent possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
SECTION 14.0 AMENDMENTS
14.1 Floodplain Designation – Restrictions on Removal: The floodplain designation on the
Official Zoning Map must not be removed from floodplain areas unless it can be shown
that the designation is in error or that the area has been filled to or above the elevation
of the regulatory flood protection elevation and is contiguous to lands outside the
floodplain. Special exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the Commissioner of the
Department of Natural Resources (DNR) if the Commissioner determines that, through
other measures, lands are adequately protected for the intended use.
14.2 Amendments Require DNR Approval: All amendments to this ordinance must be
submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of the Department of Natural
Resources (DNR) prior to adoption. The Commissioner must approve the amendment
prior to community approval.
14.3 Map Revisions Require Ordinance Amendments. The floodplain district regulations
must be amended to incorporate any revisions by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency to the floodplain maps adopted in Section 2.2 of this ordinance.
EFFECTIVE DATE: This ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and
approval and publication, as required by law and/or charter.
Section 12.15 is specific to floodplain uses
in state and federal statute, as distinct from
the standard provisions for nonconformities
in the Chapters 394 and 462.
Section 12.16 is optional but recommended,
in order to gradually eliminate
nonconformities that are frequently
damaged but not to the “50%” level.
13.3. Cross-reference any sections of the
zoning ordinance that deal with
enforcement procedures. If such provisions
don’t exist, contact Floodplain Program
staff for sample language.

515-76-1: Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and Purpose
A. Statutory Authorization: The Legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in
Minnesota Statutes Chapter 103F and Chapter 462 delegated the responsibility
to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood
losses. Therefore, the City Council of Brainerd, Minnesota, does ordain as
follows:
B. Purpose:
1. This ordinance regulates development in the flood hazard areas of
Brainerd. These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation,
which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare by minimizing these losses and disruptions.
2. National Flood Insurance Program Compliance. This ordinance is adopted
to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance
Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59 -78, as
amended, so as to maintain the community’s eligibility in the National
Flood Insurance Program.
3. This ordinance is also intended to preserve the natural characteristics and
functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and
stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect
aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide
aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic development.
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-2 Floodplain District
515-76-2: General Provisions
A. Lands to Which Ordinance Applies: This ordinance applies to all lands
within the jurisdiction of Brainerd within the boundaries of the Floodway,
Flood Fringe, or General Floodplain Districts. The boundaries of the zoning
districts are determined by scaling distances on the Flood Insurance Rate Map,
or as modified in accordance with 2. shown below.
1. The Floodway, Flood Fringe and General Floodplain Districts are overlay
districts that are superimposed on all existing zoning districts. The
standards imposed in the overlay districts are in addition to any other
requirements in this ordinance. In case of a conflict, the more restrictive
standards will apply.
2. Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated on the
official floodplain maps and actual field conditions, the flood elevations
shall be the governing factor in locating the regulatory floodplain limits.
3. Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be given a
reasonable opportunity to present their case to the Board of Zoning
Appeals and to submit technical evidence.
B. Incorporation of Maps by Reference: The following maps together with all
attached material are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of
the Official Zoning Map and this ordinance. The attached material includes
the Flood Insurance Study for Crow Wing County, Minnesota, and
Incorporated Areas, dated August 15, 2017 and the Flood Insurance Rate Map
panels enumerated below, dated August 15, 2017, all prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. These materials are on file in City Hall.

C. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this ordinance to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or other private
agreements. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this ordinance prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
D. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: This ordinance does not imply that
areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such
districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance does not
create liability on the part of Brainerd or its officers or employees for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-3 Floodplain District
E. Severability: If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this ordinance is
adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of law, the remainder of this
ordinance shall not be affected and shall remain in full force.
F. Definitions: Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this
ordinance must be interpreted according to common usage and so as to give
this ordinance its most reasonable application.
Accessory Use or Structure – a use or structure on the same lot with, and
of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or
structure.
Base Flood – the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
Base Flood Elevation – The elevation of the “regional flood.” The term
“base flood elevation” is used in the flood insurance survey.
Basement – any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its
floor or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of
the depth of excavation below ground level.
Conditional Use – a specific type of structure or land use listed in the
official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review
procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in
the official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that:
(a) Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist.
(b) The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land
use plan if one exists and are compatible with the existing
neighborhood.
Critical Facilities – facilities necessary to a community’s public health
and safety, those that store or produce highly volatile, toxic or waterreactive
materials, and those that house occupants that may be
insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life or injury. Examples of critical
facilities include hospitals, correctional facilities, schools, daycare
facilities, nursing homes, fire and police stations, wastewater treatment
facilities, public electric utilities, water plants, fuel storage facilities, and
waste handling and storage facilities.
Development – any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling,
grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment
or materials.
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-4 Floodplain District
Equal Degree of Encroachment – a method of determining the location
of floodway boundaries so that floodplain lands on both sides of a stream
are capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
Farm Fence – A fence as defined by Minn. Statutes Section 344.02, Subd.
1(a)-(d). An open type fence of posts and wire is not considered to be a
structure under this ordinance. Fences that have the potential to obstruct
flood flows, such as chain link fences and rigid walls, are regulated as
structures under this ordinance.
Flood – a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the
stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry
areas.
Flood Frequency – the frequency for which it is expected that a specific
flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
Flood Fringe – the portion of the Special Flood Hazard Area (one percent
annual chance flood) located outside of the floodway. Flood fringe is
synonymous with the term “floodway fringe” used in the Flood Insurance
Study for Crow Wing County, Minnesota.
Flood Insurance Rate Map – An official map on which the Federal
Insurance Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas and
the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has
been made available digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map
(DFIRM).
Flood Prone Area – any land susceptible to being inundated by water
from any source.
Floodplain – the beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or
watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional
flood.
Floodproofing – a combination of structural provisions, changes, or
adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for
the reduction or elimination of flood damages.
Floodway – the bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse
and those portions of the adjoining floodplain which are reasonably
required to carry or store the regional flood discharge.
Lowest Floor – the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for
parking of vehicles,building access, or storage in an area other than a
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-5 Floodplain District
basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that
such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44 Code of Federal
Regulations, Part 60.3.
Manufactured Home – a structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities.
The term “manufactured home” does not include the term “recreational
vehicle.”
New Construction - Structures, including additions and improvements,
and placement of manufactured homes, for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the effective date of this ordinance.
Obstruction – any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile,
abutment, projection, excavation channel modification, culvert, building,
wire, fence, stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or
projecting into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory floodplain which
may impede, retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in
itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by such water.
One Hundred Year Floodplain – lands inundated by the “Regional
Flood” (see definition).
Principal Use or Structure – all uses or structures that are not accessory
uses or structures.
Reach – a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment
of a stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction. In an
urban area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive
bridge crossings would most typically constitute a reach.
Recreational Vehicle – a vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is
designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck, and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use. For the purposes of this ordinance, the term recreational vehicle is
synonymous with the term “travel trailer/travel vehicle.”
Regional Flood – a flood which is representative of large floods known to
have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of
what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude
of the 1% chance or 100-year recurrence interval. Regional flood is
synonymous with the term "base flood" used in a flood insurance study.
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-6 Floodplain District
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE) - an elevation not less
than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases
in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result
from designation of a floodway.
Repetitive Loss - Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Special Flood Hazard Area – a term used for flood insurance purposes
synonymous with “One Hundred Year Floodplain.”
Start of Construction – includes substantial improvement, and means the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement that occurred before the permit’s
expiration date. The actual start is either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home
on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the
main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
Structure - anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to
the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings,
factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes,
recreational vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in
Section 10.22 of this ordinance and other similar items.
Substantial Damage - means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure where the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement - within any consecutive 365-day period, any
reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair),
repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost
of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure

before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes
structures that have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
(a) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions.
(b) Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.” For the purpose of this ordinance, “historic
structure” is as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part
59.1.
G. Annexations: The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference
into Section 2B above may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the
corporate boundaries of Brainerd at the time of adoption of this ordinance. If
any of these floodplain land areas are annexed into Brainerd after the date of
adoption of this ordinance, the newly annexed floodplain lands will be subject
to the provisions of this ordinance immediately upon the date of annexation.
515-76-3: Establishment of Floodplain Districts
A. Districts:
1. Floodway District. The Floodway District includes those areas within
Zones AE (that have a floodway delineated) as shown on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map adopted in Section 2B. For lakes, wetlands, and other
basins within Zones A or AE that do not have a floodway delineated, the
Floodway District also includes those areas that are at or below the
ordinary high water level as defined in Minnesota Statutes, Section
103G.005, subdivision 14.
2. Flood Fringe District. The Flood Fringe District includes those riverine
areas within Zones AE (that have a floodway delineated) on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map adopted in Section 2.B, but located outside of the
floodway. For lakes, wetlands, and other basins within Zones A or AE that
do not have a floodway delineated, the Flood Fringe District also includes
those areas below the 1% annual chance (100-year) flood elevation but
above the ordinary high water level as defined in Minnesota Statutes,
Section 103G.005, subdivision 14.
3. General Floodplain District. The General Floodplain District includes
those riverine areas within Zone A as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map adopted in Section 2B.
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-8 Floodplain District
B. Applicability: Where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are delineated on
the floodplain maps, the standards in Sections 5 or 6 will apply, depending on
the location of a property. Locations where Floodway and Flood Fringe
districts are not delineated within the riverine areas on the floodplain maps are
considered to fall within the General Floodplain district. Within the General
Floodplain district, the Floodway District standards in Section 515-76-5 apply
unless the floodway boundary is determined, according to the process outlined
in Section 7B.
515-76-4: Requirements for All Floodplain Districts
A. Permit Required. A permit must be obtained from the Zoning Administrator to
verify a development meets the standards outlines in this ordinance prior to
conducting the following activities:
1. The erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation, or alteration of any
building, structure, or portion thereof. Normal maintenance and repair
also requires a permit if such work, separately or in conjunction with other
planned work, constitutes a substantial improvement as defined in this
ordinance.
2. The use or change of use of a building, structure, or land.

B. Building Sites. If a proposed building site is in a flood prone area, all new
construction and substantial improvements (including the placement of
manufactured homes) must be:
1. Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent floatation,
collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-9 Floodplain District
2. Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage;
3. Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; and
4. Constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed
and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within

C. Flood Capacity. In no cases shall floodplain development adversely affect the
efficiency or unduly restrict the capacity of the channels or floodways of any
tributaries to the main stream, drainage ditches, or any other drainage facilities
or systems.
D. The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding,
flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life
is prohibited.
E. Critical Facilities, as defined in Section 2F, are prohibited in all floodplain
districts.

1. The use must have a low flood damage potential.
2. The use must not obstruct flood flows or cause any increase in flood
elevations and must not involve structures, obstructions, or storage of
materials or equipment.
3. Any facility that will be used by employees or the general public must be
designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for
evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the
depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed
a product of four upon occurrence of the regional (1% chance) flood.
C. Conditional Uses: The following uses may be allowed as conditional uses
following the standards and procedures set forth in Section 11D of this
ordinance and further subject to the standards set forth in Section 5D, if
otherwise allowed in the underlying zoning district or any applicable overlay
district

6. Travel-ready recreational vehicles meeting the exception standards in
Section 10B.
7. Levees or dikes intended to protect agricultural crops for a frequency flood
event equal to or less than the 10-year frequency flood event.
D. Standards for Floodway Conditional Uses:
1. All Uses. A conditional use must not cause any increase in the regional
flood elevations or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or
reaches affected.
2. Fill; Storage of Materials and Equipment:
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-11 Floodplain District
(a) Fill, dredge spoil, and other similar materials deposited or stored in
the floodplain must be protected from erosion by vegetative cover,
mulching, riprap or other acceptable method. Permanent sand and
gravel operations and similar uses must be covered by a long-term
site development plan.
(b) Temporary placement of fill, other materials, or equipment which
would cause an increase to the stage of the 1% percent chance or
regional flood may only be allowed if the City of Brainerd has
approved a plan that assures removal of the materials from the
floodway based upon the flood warning time available.
3. Accessory Structures. Accessory structures, as identified in Section 5C,
may be permitted, provided that:
(a) Structures are not intended for human habitation;
(b) Structures will have a low flood damage potential;
(c) Structures will be constructed and placed so as to offer a minimal
obstruction to the flow of flood waters;
(d) Service utilities, such as electrical and heating equipment, within
these structures must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation or properly floodproofed;
(e) Structures must be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed
in accordance with the FP1 or FP2 floodproofing classifications in the
State Building Code. All floodproofed structures must be adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement and
designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
(f) As an alternative, an accessory structure may be internally/wet
floodproofed to the FP3 or FP4 floodproofing classifications in the
State Building Code, provided the accessory structure constitutes a
minimal investment. Designs for meeting this requirement must either
be certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the
following criteria:
(1) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside
walls of the structure, with a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding; and
(2) There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure
and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot
above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-12 Floodplain District
intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy
this requirement for automatic openings.
4. Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or
cross section of protected wetlands or public waters are subject to the
provisions of Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.245.
5. A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway must not cause an
increase to the 1% chance or regional flood. The technical analysis must
assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream.
6. Floodway developments must not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity
of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or
drainage system.
515-76-6: Flood Fringe District (FF)
A. Permitted Uses: Permitted uses are those uses of land or structures allowed
in the underlying zoning district(s) that comply with the standards in Sections
6B. If no pre- existing, underlying zoning districts exist, then any residential
or nonresidential structure or use of a structure or land is a permitted use
provided it does not constitute a public nuisance.
B. Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses:
1. All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so
that the lowest floor, as defined, is at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures must be no
lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and
the fill must extend at the same elevation at least 15 feet beyond the
outside limits of the structure.
2. Accessory Structures. As an alternative to the fill requirements of section
6B, structures accessory to the uses identified in Section 6A may be
permitted to be internally/wet floodproofed to the FP3 or FP4
floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code, provided that:
(a) The accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not
exceed 576 square feet in size, and is only used for parking and
storage.
(b) All portions of floodproofed accessory structures below the
Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation must be: (i) adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement and
designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls, (ii)
be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage, and (iii)
must have all service utilities be water-tight or elevated to above
the regulatory flood protection elevations.
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-13 Floodplain District
(c) Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
criteria:
(1) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there
must be a minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside
walls of the structure, with a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding; and
(2) There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure
and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot
above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human
intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not
satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
3. The cumulative placement of fill or similar material on a parcel must not
exceed 1,000 cubic yards, unless the fill is specifically intended to elevate
a structure in accordance with Section 6B of this ordinance, or if allowed
as a conditional use under Section 6C below.
4. The storage of any materials or equipment must be elevated on fill to the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
5. All service utilities, including ductwork, must be elevated or water-tight to
prevent infiltration of floodwaters.
6. All fill must be properly compacted and the slopes must be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable
method.
7. All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an
elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation, or must have a flood warning /emergency evacuation plan
acceptable to the City of Brainerd.
8. Accessory uses such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at
an elevation lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation.
However, any facilities used by employees or the general public must be
designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for
evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the
depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed
a product of four upon occurrence of the regional (1% chance) flood.
9. Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles must meet the standards of
Section 10 of this ordinance.
C. Conditional Uses: The following uses and activities may be allowed as
conditional uses, if allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) or any
applicable overlay district, following the procedures in Section 11D of this
ordinance.
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-14 Floodplain District
1. Storage of any material or equipment below the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
2. The cumulative placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill when the
fill is not being used to elevate a structure in accordance with Section 6B
of this ordinance.
D. Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses:
1. The standards listed in Sections 6B apply to all conditional uses.
2. Residential basements, as defined by Section 2F of this ordinance, are not
allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation.
3. All areas of nonresidential structures, including basements, to be placed
below the regulatory flood protection elevation must be structurally dry
floodproofed, meeting the FP1 or FP2 floodproofing classification in the
State Building Code, which requires making the structure watertight with
the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effects of buoyancy.
4. The placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar
material on a parcel (other than for the purpose of elevating a structure to
the regulatory flood protection elevation) must comply with an approved
erosion/sedimentation control plan.
(a) The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the
fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the regional (1%
chance) flood event.
(b) The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to
the City of Brainerd.
(c) The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the
material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
5. Storage of materials and equipment below the regulatory flood protection
elevation must comply with an approved emergency plan providing for
removal of such materials within the time available after a flood warning.
515-76-7: General Floodplain District (GF)
A. Permitted Uses:
1. The uses listed in Section 5A of this ordinance, Floodway District
Permitted Uses, are permitted uses.
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-15 Floodplain District
2. All other uses are subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria
specified in Section 7B below. Section 5 applies if the proposed use is
determined to be in the Floodway District. Section 6 applies if the
proposed use is determined to be in the Flood Fringe District.
B. Procedures for Determining Floodway and Flood Fringe Boundaries and
Regional Flood Elevations:
1. Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the
General Floodplain District, the Zoning Administrator must obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any regional flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state, or other source.
2. If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily available, or
the application involves a project exceeding the lesser of five acres or 50
lots, the applicant must furnish additional information, as needed, to
determine the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the
proposed use would fall within the Floodway or Flood Fringe District.
Information must be consistent with accepted hydrological and hydraulic
engineering standards and the standards in 3 below.
3. The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include the
following components, as applicable:
(a) Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (1% chance) flood.
(b) Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank
areas.
(c) Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half (0.5) foot.
A lesser stage increase than 0.5 foot is required if, as a result of the
stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal
degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the
reach must be assumed in computing floodway boundaries.
4. The Zoning Administrator will review the submitted information and
assess the technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or
Flood Fringe District boundary. The assessment must include the
cumulative effects of previous floodway encroachments. The Zoning
Administrator may seek technical assistance from a designated engineer or
other expert person or agency, including the Department of Natural
Resources. Based on this assessment, the Zoning Administrator may
approve or deny the application.
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-16 Floodplain District
5. Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries have been
determined, the Zoning Administrator must process the permit application
consistent with the applicable provisions of Section 5 and 6 of this
ordinance.
515-76-8: Subdivision Standards
A. Subdivisions: No land may be subdivided which is unsuitable for reasons of
flooding or inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities.

individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood
protection elevation, unless a flood warning emergency plan for the safe
evacuation of all vehicles and people during the regional (1% chance)
flood has been approved by the City of Brainerd. The plan must be
prepared by a registered engineer or other qualified individual, and must
demonstrate that adequate time and personnel exist to carry out the
evacuation.
3. For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe
District boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the
required elevation of all access roads must be clearly labeled on all
required subdivision drawings and platting documents.
4. In the General Floodplain District, applicants must provide the
information required in Section 7B of this ordinance to determine the
regional flood elevation, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District
boundaries and the regulatory flood protection elevation for the
subdivision site
5. Subdivision proposals must be reviewed to assure that:
(a) All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage within the flood prone area,
(b) All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and
water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate
flood damage, and
(c) Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure of flood hazard.
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-17 Floodplain District
515-76-9: Public Utilities, Railroads, Roads and Bridges
A. Public Utilities: All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical,
sewer, and water supply systems to be located in the floodplain must be
floodproofed in accordance with the State Building Code or elevated to the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
B. Public Transportation Facilities: Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges to be
located within the floodplain must comply with Sections 4 and 5 of this
ordinance. These transportation facilities must be elevated to the regulatory
flood protection elevation where failure or interruption of these facilities

515-76-11:Administration
A. Duties: A Zoning Administrator or other official designated by the City of
Brainerd must administer and enforce this ordinance.
B. Permit Application Requirements:
1. Application for Permit. Permit applications must be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator on forms provided by the Zoning Administrator.
The permit application must include the following as applicable:
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-19 Floodplain District
(a) A site plan showing all pertinent dimensions, existing or proposed
buildings, structures, and significant natural features having an
influence on the permit.
(b) Location of fill or storage of materials in relation to the stream
channel.
(c) Copies of any required municipal, county, state or federal permits
or approvals.
(d) Other relevant information requested by the Zoning Administrator
as necessary to properly evaluate the permit application.
2. Certification. The applicant is required to submit certification by a
registered professional engineer, registered architect, or registered land
surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished
in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance. Floodproofing
measures must be certified by a registered professional engineer or
registered architect. Accessory structures designed in accordance with
Section 6B of this ordinance are exempt from certification, provided
sufficient documentation is provided.
3. Certificate of Zoning Compliance for a New, Altered, or Nonconforming
Use. No building, land or structure may be occupied or used in any
manner until a certificate of zoning compliance has been issued by the
Zoning Administrator stating that the use of the building or land conforms
to the requirements of this ordinance
4. Record of First Floor Elevation. The Zoning Administrator must maintain
a record of the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
new structures and alterations or additions to existing structures in the
floodplain. The Zoning Administrator must also maintain a record of the
elevation to which structures and alterations or additions to structures are
floodproofed.
5. Notifications for Watercourse Alterations. Before authorizing any
alteration or relocation of a river or stream, the Zoning Administrator must
notify adjacent communities. If the applicant has applied for a permit to
work in public waters pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.245,
this will suffice as adequate notice. A copy of the notification must also be
submitted to the Chicago Regional Office of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).
6. Notification to FEMA When Physical Changes Increase or Decrease Base
Flood Elevations. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months
after the date such supporting information becomes available, the Zoning
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-20 Floodplain District
Administrator must notify the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the
changes by submitting a copy of the relevant technical or scientific data.
C. Variances:
1. Variance Applications. An application for a variance to the provisions of
this ordinance will be processed and reviewed in accordance with
applicable State Statutes and Section(s) 7 of the zoning ordinance/code.
2. Adherence to State Floodplain Management Standards. A variance must
not allow a use that is not allowed in that district, permit a lower degree of
flood protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for the
particular area, or permit standards lower than those required by state law.
3. Additional Variance Criteria. The following additional variance criteria of
the Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied:
(a) Variances must not be issued by a community within any
designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
(b) Variances may only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing
of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to
grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance
will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
(c) Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
4. Flood Insurance Notice. The Zoning Administrator must notify the
applicant for a variance that: 1) The issuance of a variance to construct a
structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage; and 2) Such construction below the base or regional flood level
increases risks to life and property. Such notification must be maintained
with a record of all variance actions.
5. General Considerations. The community may consider the following
factors in granting variances and imposing conditions on variances and
conditional uses in floodplains:
(a) The potential danger to life and property due to increased flood
heights or velocities caused by encroachments;
Brainerd Zoning Ordinance 76-21 Floodplain District
(b) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others;
(c) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems, if any, and the
ability of these systems to minimize the potential for disease,
contamination and unsanitary conditions;
(d) The susceptibility of any proposed use and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(e) The importance of the services to be provided by the proposed use
to the community;
(f) The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location;
(g) The availability of viable alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding;
(h) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
(i) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Land
Use Plan and flood plain management program for the area;
(j) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(k) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters expected at the site.
6. Submittal of Hearing Notices to the Department of Natural Resources
(DNR). The City of Brainerd must submit hearing notices for proposed
variances to the DNR sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten days’
notice of the hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S.

515-76-12: Nonconformities
A. Continuance of Nonconformities: A use, structure, or occupancy of land
which was lawful before the passage or amendment of this ordinance but
which is not in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance may be
continued subject to the following conditions. Historic structures, as defined
in Section 2F (b) of this ordinance, are subject to the provisions of this
ordinance shown below.
1. A nonconforming use, structure, or occupancy must not be expanded,
changed, enlarged, or altered in a way that increases its flood damage
potential or degree of obstruction to flood flows except as provided below.
Expansion or enlargement of uses, structures or occupancies within the
Floodway District is prohibited.
2. Any addition or structural alteration to a nonconforming structure or
nonconforming use that would result in increasing its flood damage
potential must be protected to the regulatory flood protection elevation in
accordance with any of the elevation on fill or floodproofing techniques
(i.e., FP1 thru FP4 floodproofing classifications) allowable in the State
Building Code, except as further restricted shown below.
3. If any nonconforming use, or any use of a nonconforming structure, is
discontinued for more than one year, any future use of the premises must
conform to this ordinance.
4. If any structure experiences a substantial improvement as defined in this
ordinance, then the entire structure must meet the standards of Section 5 or
6 of this ordinance for new structures, depending upon whether the
structure is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District, respectively. If the
current proposal, including maintenance and repair during the previous
365 days, plus the costs of any previous alterations and additions since the
first Flood Insurance Rate Map exceeds 50 percent of the market value of
any nonconforming structure, the entire structure must meet the standards
of Section 5 or 6 of this ordinance.
5. If any nonconformity is substantially damaged, as defined in this ordinance,

of variances or conditional uses) constitute a misdemeanor and will be
punishable as defined by law.
B. Other Lawful Action: Nothing in this ordinance restricts the City of Brainerd
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the
Zoning Administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day
that lapses will constitute an additional violation of this ordinance and will be
prosecuted accordingly.
C. Enforcement: Violations of the provisions of this ordinance will be
investigated and resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section(s) 3 of
the zoning ordinance/code. In responding to a suspected ordinance violation,
the Zoning Administrator and City of Brainerd may utilize the full array of

and fines, injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or
a request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood

and regulations designed for the protection of health, safety and general welfare of this community,
deem it necessary to provide regulations for platting and subdividing of property within the City
which will prevent, as far as possible:
A. The uses of land which are not feasible.
B. The location of streets where such location does not fit the overall pattern of the City.
C. The general design of the proposed building lots in any platted area which might prevent
compliance with the Building Code, Zoning Ordinance, or other regulations of the City in the
future.

plan.
Does hereby order that all subdivisions hereafter planned within the limits of the City shall, in all
respects, fully comply with the regulations hereinafter set forth.

Comprehensive Plan, there shall be no direct vehicular access from individual urban single
family or two-family lots to such streets and roads. In the platting of small tracts of land
fronting on limited access highways, arterial, or major collector streets where there is no
other alternative, a temporary entrance may be granted, subject to terms and conditions
defined by the City Council and applicable County or State agencies. As neighboring land
becomes subdivided and more preferable access arrangements become possible, such
temporary access permits shall become void. In such cases where direct lot access to major
collector or arterial streets is allowed, special traffic safety measures including, but not
limited to, provisions for on-site vehicle turn around shall be required. In cases where a
proposed plat is adjacent to the County or State highway, the plat shall be subject to County
and/or State approval.
J. Lots fronting on an arterial or major collector street. New commercial, industrial, and
multiple family lots fronting on an arterial or major collector street shall be designed to
minimize the number of direct access points through the following methods listed in
preferential order. If the highest preference is not possible, the next preference shall be
utilized until an access method is possible.
Brainerd Subdivision Ordinance Administrative Subdivisions

1. Access from a local street.
2. Frontage road serving multiple properties.
3. Frontage driveway or connected parking lot, with cross easements serving multiple
properties.
4. Shared driveways.
5. One driveway access, no closer than two hundred (200) feet to another driveway
and that meets the City’s minimum spacing standards from a street intersection. All
driveways shall be reviewed for consistency with the policies of the Brainerd
Comprehensive Plan.
K. Setback Lines. Setback or building lines shall be shown on all lots intended for residential
use and shall not be less than the setback required by the Brainerd Zoning Ordinance, as may
be amended.
L. Water Courses. Water courses may be contained within abutting lots. Water courses shall
be protected by easement that will include a buffer strip extending outward from the
delineated wetland boundary or the water course ordinary high water level as defined by
Section 500-1-12 of this Ordinance. Lots with easements protecting water courses shall
have sufficient dimensions and contiguous area outside the water course easement to meet
or exceed the minimum lot area and width specified in the zoning chapter for the district in
which the lots are located.
M. Grading for Drainage. Lots shall be graded so as to provide drainage away from building
locations and shall conform to the approved final grading plan. Storm water drainage from
an improved subdivision or lot shall not be directed at an adjoining property at a rate above a
predevelopment condition except where drainage is directed to a designed drainage
easement.
N. Features. In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be shown for all natural features,
such as tree growth, water courses, historic places or similar conditions which, if preserved,
will add attractiveness and stability to the proposed development.
O. Frontage on Two Streets. Double frontage, or lots with frontage on two (2) parallel streets
shall not be permitted except where lots back on major collector or arterial streets, County or
State highways, or where topographic or other conditions render subdividing otherwise
unreasonable. Double fronting lots that have a yard abutting a collector or arterial street
shall have a twenty (20) foot wide landscaped buffer yard abutting said collector or arterial
street. The yard shall be planted with landscape material that meets the minimum
requirements listed in Section 20 of the Brainerd Zoning Ordinance.

P. Irregular Shaped Lots. On single family residential lots determined to be irregular in shape
(e.g., triangular), the developer shall demonstrate to the City an ability to properly place
principal buildings and accessory structures upon the site which are compatible in size and
character to the surrounding area.
Q. Lot Remnants/Outlots. All remnants of lots below minimum lot size left over after
subdividing a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots rather than allowed to remain as
unusable parcels. Outlots may be platted within a subdivision to delineate future
development phases or commonly owned open spaces. The outlot shall be sized in a
manner to accommodate its intended use. An outlot shall be platted into a lot and block prior
to issuance of a building permit. No building permits shall be issued for an outlot except for
open air structures allowed as a recreational component in an open space area.
R. Extraterritorial Design Standards. In areas lying outside the City but within the
jurisdiction of this section, the following additional minimum subdivision standards shall be
required. The size of lots shall be determined by on-site soil percolation tests conducted by a
recognized soil testing service utilizing sound engineering practices, but in no case shall a lot
contain less than fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet in area nor less than one hundred
(100) feet in width measured between the side lot lines at a setback distance of thirty (30) feet

shall conform to the comprehensive development plan and to this section, and shall be
considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to reasonable circulation of traffic,
to topographical conditions, to drainage patterns, to public convenience and safety and in
their appropriate relationship to the proposed uses of the land and to be served by such
streets.
B. Streets, Continuous. Except for cul-de-sacs, streets shall connect with streets already
dedicated in adjoining or adjacent subdivisions, or provide for future connections to
adjoining unsubdivided tracts, or shall be a reasonable projection of streets in the nearest
subdivided tracts. The arrangement of major collector and arterial streets shall be considered
in their relation to the reasonable circulation of traffic, to topographic conditions, to runoff of
storm water, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the
proposed uses of the area to be served in compliance with the Brainerd Comprehensive Plan.
C. Street Plans for Future Subdivisions. Where the plat application includes only part of the
tract owned or intended for development by the subdivider, or abuts an undeveloped tract, a
Brainerd Subdivision Ordinance Administrative Subdivisions
7-5
build out plan (ghost plat) illustrating a proposed future street system for the unsubdivided
tract, prepared and submitted by the subdivider, may be required by the City.
D. Provisions for Resubdivision of Large Lots and Parcels. When a tract is subdivided into
larger than normal building lots or parcels, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to
permit the logical location and openings of future streets and appropriate resubdivision, with
provision for adequate utility connections for such resubdivision.
E. Local Streets and Dead End Streets. Local streets should be so planned as to discourage
their use by non-local traffic. Dead end streets are prohibited, but cul-de-sacs shall be
permitted where topography or other physical conditions justify their use. Cul-de-sacs shall
not be longer than five hundred (500) feet, including a terminal turn around which shall be
provided at the closed end, with a right-of-way radius of not less than sixty (60) feet. A
forty-five (45) foot street radius will be required on all cul-de-sacs.
F. Temporary Cul-de-Sac. In those instances where a street is terminated pending future
extension in conjunction with future subdivision and the street segment is more than two
hundred (200) feet between the dead-end and the nearest intersection, a temporary turn
around facility shall be provided at the closed end, in conformance with cul-de-sac
requirements. This temporary cul-de-sac must be placed inside a temporary roadway
easement if it is located outside street right-of-way. Financial guarantee will be required for
removal or restoration as determined by the City Engineer.
G. Subdivisions Abutting Major Rights-of-Way. Wherever the proposed subdivision
contains or is adjacent to the right-of-way of a U.S. or State highway, County road, local
major collector, or local arterial street, provision may be made for a service street
approximately parallel and adjacent to the boundary of such right-of-way; provided that due
consideration is given to proper circulation design, setbacks from an intersection on the
major rights-of-way, or for a street at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land
between such street and right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due
consideration of the minimum distance required for approach connections to future grade
separations, or for lot depths.
H. Compliance with the Brainerd Comprehensive Plan. All subdivisions incorporating
streets which are identified in the City Comprehensive Plan, as amended, shall comply with
the minimum right-of-way, surface width, and design standards as outlined in this
Ordinance, and must be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer.

by the Council to promote public safety and convenience when special conditions require it.
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing street of inadequate width, sufficient
additional width shall be provided to meet the standards of this Ordinance.
L. Half Streets. Half streets shall be prohibited except where it will be practical to require the
dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided, in which case the
dedication of a half street may be permitted. The probable length of time elapsing before
dedication of the remainder shall be considered in this decision. No permanent street
improvement shall be permitted within a half street right-of-way. All lots having frontage or
access solely from a half street are prohibited from being eligible for building permits.
Brainerd Subdivision Ordinance Administrative Subdivisions

M. Alley Location Requirements. Either a public or private alley shall be provided in a block
where commercially zoned property abuts a major or local thoroughfare.
N. Marginal Access Streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or planned
major thoroughfare or a railroad right-of-way, the Council may require a street approximately
parallel to and on either side of such right-of-way for adequate protection of residential
properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. Such marginal access streets
shall be located at such a distance from the major thoroughfare or railroad right-of-way as to
allow for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential
districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in the appropriate districts. Such distances
shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements for approach grades and future
grade separations.
O. Curb Radius. The minimum curb radii for thoroughfares, collector streets, local streets, and
alleys shall be as follows:

with Minnesota Department of Transportation State Aid standards.
R. Street Intersections. Insofar as practical, streets shall intersect at right angles. In no case
shall the angle formed by the intersection of two (2) streets be less than seventy-five (75)
degrees. Intersections having more than four (4) corners shall be prohibited if not controlled
by a roundabout. Adequate land for future intersection construction needs shall be
dedicated.
S. Tangents. A tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet shall be introduced between reverse
curves on arterial and collector streets. The tangent lengths may be longer if a transition
between super-elevated section is required.
T. Deflections. When connection street lines deflect from each other at one point by more
than ten (10) degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to ensure a
sight distance of not less than five hundred (500) feet for arterials, three hundred (300) feet
for collectors, and one hundred (100) feet for all other streets. The City Council may allow
greater or lesser sight distances.
Brainerd Subdivision Ordinance Administrative Subdivisions

U. Street Intersection Offsets (Jogs). Street intersection jogs with centerline offsets of less
than one hundred fifty (150) feet shall be prohibited.
V. Centerline Curvature. The minimum horizontal curvature of collector and arterial streets
shall be in accordance with the MnDOT Highway Design Manual for the type of street and
design speed.
W. Streets in Flood Hazard Area. No street shall be approved if its final surface is at a lower
elevation than two (2) feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. The City
Council shall require profiles and elevations of finished streets for areas subject to flooding.
Fill may be used for streets, provided such fill does not unduly increase flood heights and
provided any such fill would not result in a stage increase violating the requirements of the
Brainerd Floodplain Ordinance, as may be amended.
X. Reserve Strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited.
Y. Private Streets. Private Streets, except in the case of planned unit developments, shall be
prohibited and no public improvements shall be approved for any private street. All private
streets within an approved PUD shall meet the construction design standards for City streets.

shall submit a NPDES permit application and a Stormwater Pollution Prevention
Plan (SWPPP) to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA).
500-7-10: Protected Areas.
Where land proposed for subdivision is deemed environmentally sensitive by the City, due to the
existence of wetlands, drainageways, watercourses, floodable areas or steep slopes, the design of
said subdivision shall clearly reflect all necessary measures of protection to insure against adverse
environmental impact.
Based upon the necessity to control and maintain certain sensitive areas, the City shall determine
whether said protection will be accomplished through lot enlargement and redesign or dedication of
those sensitive areas in the form of outlots.
Brainerd Subdivision Ordinance Administrative Subdivisions
7-13
In general, measures of protection shall include design solutions which allow for construction and
grading involving a minimum of alteration to sensitive areas. Where these areas are to be
incorporated into lots within the proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to
demonstrate that the proposed design will not require construction on slopes over thirty (30)
percent, or result in significant alteration to the wetlands, floodplains, or natural drainage systems,
such that adverse impacts cannot be contained within the plat boundary.
500-7-11: Signs.
A. Signs. As part of preliminary plat application, the subdivider shall identify all signs
associated with the proposed plat including, but not limited to, neighborhood identification
signs, street signs, traffic control signs, wetland demarcation signs, or other signs related to

SECTION 8
PUBLIC LAND DEDICATION
500-8-1: Property Dedication.
A. A portion of any subdivision shall dedicate to the City a reasonable portion of the proposed
subdivision for public streets, roads, utility easements, water facilities, storm water drainage
and holding areas or ponds and other similar utilities and improvements.
B. As a prerequisite to any subdivision approval and at the sole determination by the City,
applicants and/or developers shall dedicate land for parks, playgrounds, public open spaces
and/or trails and/or shall make a cash contribution to the City’s park dedication fund
roughly related to the anticipated effect of the subdivision on the park system. The
requirement may also be met with a combination of land and cash if approved by the City
Council.
C. All subdivisions of land within the corporate limits of the City of Brainerd hereafter
submitted for approval shall fully comply in all respects with the regulations set forth herein.
Plans for all commercial and industrial developments shall be presented in the same manner
as a subdivision. Plans for planned unit developments for housing, commercial, industrial or
other uses or for any combination of uses designed for sale or rental purposes shall be
presented in the same manner as subdivisions for the review by the Planning Commission
and the approval of the City Council.
D. Land shall be reasonably suitable for its intended use and shall be at a location convenient to
the people to be served. Factors used in evaluating the adequacy of proposed park and
recreation areas shall include size, shape, topography, geology, hydrology, tree cover, access
and location, and future park needs pursuant to the Comprehensive Park Plan. Wetlands,
ponding areas, and drainage ways shall not be eligible for park dedication credit. Park land
to be dedicated shall be above the ordinary high water level. Grades exceeding twelve (12)
percent or areas unsuitable for park development shall not be considered for dedication.
Land with trash, junk, pollutants and/or unwanted structures is not acceptable.
E. The applicant shall confer with City Staff and the Park Board at the time the preliminary plat
is under consideration, to secure a recommendation as to the location of any property that
should be dedicated to the public, such as parks, playgrounds or other public property. The
preliminary plat shall show the location and dimensions of all areas to be dedicated in this
manner. Such contribution requirement recommendation(s) will be sent to the Planning
Commission for review and comment and subsequently to the City Council for their
approval.
F. When a proposed park, playground, recreation area or other public ground has been indicated
in the City’s official map or Comprehensive Park Plan and is located in whole or in part
within a proposed plat, it shall be dedicated to the appropriate governmental unit. If the
Brainerd Subdivision Ordinance Administrative Subdivisions
8-2
applicant elects not to dedicate an area in excess of the land required hereunder for such
proposed public site, the City may consider acquiring the excess land through purchase or
condemnation.
G. The City, upon consideration of the particular type of development, may require that a lesser
parcel of land should be dedicated due to particular features of the development. In such
cases, a cash contribution shall be required above the land dedication to ensure that
compensation is received for the full amount of the impact on the City’s park and trail
system.
H. In all new residential, commercial and industrial subdivisions, seven (7) percent of the area
subdivided shall be dedicated for public park land. This seven (7) percent shall be
calculated on the gross area of the subdivision. The land dedicated for public recreation
shall be in addition to property dedicated for streets, alleys, trails, easements, or other public
ways. No areas may be dedicated for public use until such areas have been approved by the
City Council as suitable and necessary for the health, safety, convenience and general
welfare of the City.
500-8-2: Land and Fee Contribution.
A. The City may elect at its sole discretion to receive a combination of cash, land, and/or
development of the land for park use. Combined park land and cash dedications shall be
calculated based upon the following:
1. Yield Plan. At the time of subdivision, a yield plan will be prepared demonstrating
the total number of units/lots possible within the development without a park. This
figure is then multiplied by the per unit or per lot park dedication charge (established
by City Council ordinance). The result of this calculation is equal to the total cash
value of the park dedication for the residential project. The formula is outlined as
follows:
a. Buildable Acres (less wetlands, right-of-way, natural waterbodies etc.,) x
Average Density = Number of Units or Lots.
b. Number of Units or Lots x Residential Unit Cash Charge = Total Cash
Contribution for the Subdivision.
2. Land Value Determination. The value of the land dedication is determined based
upon the following formula:
a. Total Land Dedication Acres x Land Value = Total Land Value
3. Dedication Requirement. To determine the combined land and cash dedication
requirement, the following formula should be used:
Brainerd Subdivision Ordinance Administrative Subdivisions
8-3
a. Total Cash Contribution for Subdivision – Land Value for Park Land =
Balance of Cash Contribution.
B. Planned Unit Developments with mixed land uses shall make cash and/or land contributions
in accordance with this Section based upon the percentage of land devoted to the various
uses.
500-8-3: Fee in Lieu of Land Dedication.
A. The City may elect, at its sole discretion, to require a payment of park dedication fee in lieu
of a land dedication.
B. The City Council shall require that the subdivider contribute an amount in cash as the park
dedication fee according to the following fee schedule as specified in Section 1015 Permit
and Fees of the City Code:
1. If any of the fees are determined by any Court to be invalid for any reason
whatsoever, the park dedication fee shall be the fair market value of the land to be
subdivided. For the purposes of this section, “fair market value” means a price that a
willing buyer would pay and a willing seller would accept for the property at the
time of acceptance of the final plat including, but not limited to, zoning, public and
subdivider improvements or other factors as determined by the County Assessor but
excluding any buildings or structures located thereon.
C. Park Dedication Fees shall be deposited in the Park Dedication Fund and be used solely
for the development of, and improvements to, existing or future parks, and will not be used
for maintenance, repair and other “daily” expenses. The Park Board shall make a
recommendation to the City Council as to the location of any sites or improvements to be
funded with such park dedication fees in said Park Capital Fund.
D. This Section shall apply to all new development, redevelopment, lot combination/redivisions
meant to facilitate development, and expansion of residential or commercial/
industrial/business use. It shall not apply to lot combination/redivisions which do not
increase the number of single family residential lots or units, conversion of apartments to
condominiums, or internal leasehold improvements.
E. Park fee contributions are to be calculated and paid at time of final plat. Cash dedications
shall be included in the development agreement and paid prior to the City’s signature of and
release of the final plat. For subdivisions that do not require a development agreement, the
cash dedication shall be paid before the City releases the signed approval of the subdivision
for recording.
Brainerd Subdivision Ordinance Administrative Subdivisions

500-8-4: Park Dedication Appeals.
If the applicant or developer does not believe that the estimates contained in this Section fairly and
accurately represent the effect of the subdivision on the park system of the City, the applicant or
developer may request that the City prepare an in-depth study of the effect of the subdivision on the
park system and an estimate of that effect in money and/or land. All costs of such study shall be
paid by the developer or applicant. If the developer requests the preparation of such a study, no
application for the development shall be deemed complete until the study has been completed and a
