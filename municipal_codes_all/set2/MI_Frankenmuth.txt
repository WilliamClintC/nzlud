CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS
1.71. Definitions. In the interpretation of this Chapter the following definitions shall apply:
(1) The term "cost" shall refer to the cost of any public improvement and shall include the cost of surveys, plans,
land, rights-of-way, spreading of rolls, notices, advertising, financing, construction, and legal fees and all other
costs incident to the making of such improvement, the special assessments therefor and the financing thereof.
(2) The term "public improvement" shall mean any improvement upon public property, right-of-way or easement
which results in special benefit to the real property in the vicinity of such improvement.
1.72. Special Assessments. The entire cost or any part thereof of all public improvements may be defrayed by
special assessment upon the lands especially benefited by the improvement in the manner hereinafter provided.
1.73. Initiation of Public Improvements. Proceedings for making public improvements may be initiated by
resolution of the Council or by a petition of a majority of the owners of the land liable to be assessed in any
proposed special assessment district. All public improvements shall be made at the discretion of the Council and no
petition shall be mandatory upon the Council.
1.74. Form of Petitions. All petitions for public improvements shall be on printed forms supplied by the City and
shall include an affidavit by one or more of the circulators that the signatures appearing thereon are genuine and
each signer declares himself to be the owner of the interest in the land indicated. All such petitions shall be filed
with the City Clerk who shall record the filing date thereon and refer them to the City Manager for investigation.
The City Clerk shall report the receipt of all such petitions to the City Council at the next regular meeting following
receipt of any such petition.
1.75. Investigation. All petitions for public improvements shall be investigated by the City Manager to determine
whether a sufficient number of valid signatures have been obtained and, if such investigation discloses a deficiency,
the said petition shall be returned to the circulator with notice of the fact. Where any lot or parcel of land is owned
by more than one person, each person having an interest must join in the petition. A petition containing the
required number of valid signatures shall be acted upon by the Council either to accept, defer, or reject such
petition.
1.76. Request for Report. Upon acceptance of a special assessment project petition, the Council shall refer the
same to the City Manager directing him to make a survey and report concerning the need for, desirable extent of,
and probable cost of such proposed public improvement. The Manager shall recommend what proportion of the
cost should be paid by special assessment upon the property especially benefited and what proportion, if any,
should be paid by the City at large. The Council shall not order the making of any special assessment improvement
prior to the filing of the report of the City Manager and until after a public hearing has been held for the hearing of
objections to the making of such special assessment improvements.
1.77. Filing of Report and Notice of Hearing. If the Council determines to proceed with the public improvement it
shall approve the report of the City Manager as filed or as modified by the Council, and shall order the same filed
with the City Clerk for public examination; it shall fix a time and place for a hearing on objections to the proposed
improvement or to the inclusion of any property within the proposed district, at which hearing all persons owning
property within the proposed special assessment district may be heard. No hearing on the improvement shall be
required if a petition for such public improvement is signed by all of the property owners to be assessed for the
improvement. The Clerk shall cause notice of the time and place of such hearing to be published once in a
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan General Code
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 3 of Title I 3-2
newspaper published and circulated within the City not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of said hearing.
Such notice shall describe the proposed special assessment district, the nature of the improvement, and shall also
state that the Manager's report and estimate of costs is on file with the City Clerk. A like ten (10) day notice shall
also be sent by mail as prescribed in Public Act 162 of 1962, State of Michigan. The hearing required by this
section may be held at any regular, adjourned or special meeting of the Council.
1.78. Objections and Modifications. The Council, after hearing objections, may at or after said public hearing,
modify the said proposed improvement or district in any respect which they shall deem in the best interests of the
City at large; provided, that in the event the amount of work is increased or the boundaries of the district enlarged,
then another hearing shall be held pursuant to notice required by section 1.77.
1.79. Determination to Make Improvements. After completion of the hearing on the improvement, the Council
may, by resolution, determine to make the improvement and to defray the whole or any part of the cost of the
improvement by special assessment upon the property especially benefited in proportion to the benefits thereto. By
such resolution the Council shall determine the necessity for the improvement; approve the plans and specifications
for the improvement; determine the estimated cost thereof; determine what proportion of such cost shall be paid by
special assessment upon the property especially benefited and what part, if any, shall be a general obligation of the
City; designate the district or land and premises upon which the special assessment shall be levied; and direct the
Assessor to prepare a special assessment roll in accordance with the Council's determination. In the event that
neither the proceeds of the special assessment nor the proceeds of bonds payable from the special assessment are
required to defray the expense of the public improvement, the Council may order the City Manager to proceed with
the work either by contract or with City forces. If, prior to the adoption of the resolution authorizing the making of
the public improvement, written objections thereto have been filed by the owners of property in the district, which,
according to estimates, will be required to bear more than fifty percent (50%) of the cost thereof, or by a majority of
the owners of property to be assessed, no resolution determining to proceed with the improvement shall be adopted
except by the affirmative vote of five (5) members of the Council.
When any public improvement is constructed on or near the City limits, that portion of such improvement which
would be specially assessed to land outside of the City limits shall be paid for by the City at large.
1.80. Special Assessment Roll. The City Assessor shall prepare a special assessment roll of all lots or parcels of
land within the special assessment district benefited by the proposed improvement, as finally determined by the
Council, and assess to each lot or parcel of land, the amount benefited thereby.
1.81. Notice of Hearing on Roll. When the said special assessment roll shall have been reported to the Council,
they shall order the same filed in the office of the City Clerk for public examination and shall fix the time and place
to review the roll, and direct the Clerk to give notice of a public hearing thereon. Such notice shall be given by one

Chapter 3 of Title I 3-3
1.83. Lien. All special assessments contained in any special assessment roll, including any part thereof to be paid
in installments shall from the date of confirmation of such roll constitute a lien upon the respective lots or parcels of
land assessed and until paid shall be a charge against the respective owners of the several lots and parcels of land
and a debt to the City from the persons to whom they are assessed. Such liens shall be of the same character and
effect as the lien created by the City Charter for City taxes and shall include accrued interest and fees.
1.84. Collection of Roll. After the Council has confirmed the roll, the Treasurer shall notify by mail each property
owner on the assessment roll that said roll has been confirmed and filed, stating the amount assessed. Failure to
receive notice shall not invalidate any special assessment nor excuse the payment of interest or collection fees, or
both. Each property owner shall have ninety (90) days from the date of confirmation of the roll to pay said
assessment in full or any part thereof in a sum not less than the first installment thereof as set by the Council,
without interest, fees or penalty. Following said ninety (90) days, the property owner may pay all of this
assessment at any time, but shall be required to pay interest thereon as fixed by the Council. If a special assessment
or the first installment thereof remains unpaid as of the last day of February following the date of confirmation of
the roll, there shall be added interest at the rate set by the Council beginning ninety (90) days from the date of
confirmation of the roll to the first day of July following the said last day of February and said assessment shall be
spread upon the then current tax roll for the collection of taxes in the City and collected in the same manner and
subject to the same fees and penalties as taxes. The second and remaining installments shall be spread upon the
succeeding City tax rolls, together with interest beginning ninety (90) days from date of confirmation of the roll,
until all installments are paid.
1.85. Assessment for Abating Hazards and Nuisances. In the event it shall become necessary to abate a hazard or
nuisance as described in section 3.2(1) of the City Charter, the Council shall determine what amount or part of such
expense shall be charged, and designate the property upon which the same shall be levied as a special assessment.
The Council shall require that the persons chargeable therewith be notified by the City Clerk either by first class
mail, or if the owner or his address is unknown, by posting notice upon the premises affected. Such notice shall
state the basis for the assessment, the cost thereof, and shall give a reasonable time, which shall not be less than
thirty (30) days, in which payment shall be made. In all cases where payment is not made within the time limit, the
same shall be reported by the Clerk to the Council, which shall direct the Assessor to spread such amounts against
the descriptions of property chargeable therewith on the next general tax roll for the collection of taxes in the City.
1.86. Additional Procedures. In any case where the provisions of this Chapter may prove to be insufficient to carry
into full effect the making of any special assessment, the Council shall provide, in the resolution authorizing the
improvement, the additional steps or procedures required. The City Council may determine that any public
improvement is for the benefit of the City at large and the costs thereof shall be paid by the City at large. In the
event that the abutting property owners at any future time wish to make use of such improvement, an additional tapin
charge shall be made which is equal to the then current special assessment cost of the public improvement which
would be charged as provided in this Chapter. The charge shall be against the property to be served and the owner
thereof, and shall be a lien thereon, and shall be collected as provided in section 1.84.
1.87. Contested Assessments. No suit or action of any kind shall be instituted for the purpose of contesting or
enjoining the collection of any special assessments unless:
(1) within thirty (30) days after the confirmation of the special assessment roll, written notice is given to the
Council of intention to file such suit or action, stating the grounds on which it is claimed such assessment is
illegal, and
(2) such suit or action shall be commenced within ninety (90) days after the confirmation of the roll.
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan General Code

Chapter 3 of Title I 3-4
1.88. Reassessment for Benefits. Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the Council, be invalid
by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge
such assessment to be illegal, the Council shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or whether any
part of the assessments have been paid or not, have power to cause a new assessment to be made for the same
purpose for which the former assessment was made. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection
thereof shall be conducted in the same manner as provided for an original assessment and, whenever any sum or
part thereof, levied upon any property in the assessment so set aside, has been paid and not refunded, the payment
so made shall be applied upon the reassessment. If the payments exceed the amount of the reassessment, refunds
shall be made.
1.89. Combination of Projects. The Council may combine several districts into one (1) project for the purpose of
effecting savings in the cost.
1.90. Additional Special Assessments. Additional pro rata assessments may be made when any special assessment
roll proves insufficient to pay for the improvement for which it was levied and the expenses incidental thereto, or to
pay the principal and interest on bonds issued in anticipation of such special assessment. Provided, however, that
any additional pro rata assessment shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the assessment as originally confirmed,
unless a meeting of the Council be held to review such additional assessment, for which meeting notices shall be
published as provided in the case of review of the original special assessment roll.
1.91. Lands Divided After Assessment. Should any lots or parcels of land be divided after a special assessment
thereon has been confirmed but before the total of the special assessments have been paid, then the City Manager
may apportion the uncollected amounts upon the several lots and lands so divided, and may instruct the Assessor to
enter the several amounts upon the tax roll. This apportionment, when the tax roll shall have been received and
confirmed, shall be final and conclusive on all parties.
Whenever and wherever property is annexed to the City and abutting an existing public improvement, there shall be
levied against such property newly annexed to the City an improvement charge to provide that property's fair share
of the cost of improvements which benefit such property, which costs were financed by special assessment and for
which the City at large was charged, as provided in section 1.79, or for which costs the City became otherwise
obligated. The City Council shall by resolution determine the amount of the charge to cover the property's fair
share of such improvement, and said resolution determining the charge to be levied after annexation and for a thenexisting
improvement shall be promptly recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Saginaw County,
Michigan.
The improvement charge shall become payable at a time fixed by Council resolution and the Council may permit
installment payments as provided for in section 1.84.
Said improvement charges, including any part thereof deferred as to payment, shall from the date of the Council
resolution establishing the charge, constitute a lien upon the respective lots or parcels of land annexed and, until
paid shall be charged against the respective owners of the several lots and parcels of land. Such lien shall be of the
same character and effect as the lien created for City taxes and shall include accrued interest and penalties. When
any such improvement charge or any installment thereof, whenever divided into installments, shall have been due
and unpaid for a period of more than ninety (90) days, the same shall be spread upon the then current tax roll for the
collection of taxes in the City and collected in the same manner and subject to the same fees and penalties as taxes.
1.92. Charter Provisions. The provisions of Chapter 10 of the City Charter which are not set forth or made
effective by this Chapter are hereby adopted and made a part of this Chapter as though set forth verbatim herein.

Chapter 3 of Title I 3-5
1.93. Deferred Assessments. When an improvement is made which the Council determines does not specially
benefit residential properties which are located in a special assessment district, the Council may provide in the
resolution adopted pursuant to Section 1.82 hereof that the assessment confirmed against any such residential
property be deferred until such time as the use of such property is changed so that in the judgment of the Council
the benefit of the improvement shall then accrue to said property. The Assessor shall report such change of use to
the Council which upon determining benefit shall direct the Assessor to collect the special assessment in
accordance with its instructions.

date of application or at the discretion of the Superintendent of Water.
(7) Charges. Outside registers will be assessed an additional twenty-five cents ($0.25) per month meter charge,

2.27. Rules and Regulations for Water Meters.
(1) In the event a meter shall fail to register properly the Water Works Superintendent is empowered to estimate
the quantity of water used on the basis of former consumption and bill accordingly.
(2) If any consumer shall desire to have his water meter tested he shall deposit with the Superintendent a fee as
determined by the City Council. The Superintendent shall thereupon cause the meter to be tested, provided that
the customer is willing to witness the test.
(3) A water meter shall be considered accurate if, when subjected by the Superintendent to a standard test, its
register indicates not to exceed two percent (2%) more or two percent (2%) less than the actual quantity of water
passing through it. If its register indicates to exceed two percent (2%) more than such actual quantity of water
passing through it, it shall be considered "fast" to that extent. If its register indicates to exceed two percent (2%)
less than actual quantity of water passing through it, it shall be considered "slow" to that extent.
(4) If a meter has been tested at the request of a consumer and shall have been determined to register "fast" the
City shall credit the consumer with a sum equal to the percentage "fast" multiplied by the amount of all bills
incurred by said consumer, within the three (3) months prior to the test, and if a meter so tested is determined to
register "slow" the Superintendent is hereby empowered to collect from the consumer a sum equal to the
percentage "slow" multiplied by the amount of all the bills incurred by the consumer for the prior three (3)
months. When the Superintendent makes a test of a water meter at his own instigation, it shall be done without
cost to the consumer, other than his paying the amount due the City of water used by him as above provided, if
the water is found to be "slow".
(5) A record of the date when each meter was furnished to a consumer, its number, cost and location shall be kept
in the office of the Water Works Superintendent. There shall also be kept in the office of the Superintendent an
accurate record of the amount each consumer is credited on account of his meter, and, if a test is made, a record of
the date and result thereof.
2.28. Miscellaneous Provisions.
(1) No water main, connection or extension shall be covered until inspected and approved by the Water Works
Superintendent or his employees who shall be notified when such construction is ready for inspection.
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan General Code
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 22 of Title II 22-5
(2) No person shall refuse to admit or hinder any authorized agent of the City to enter premises owned or
occupied by him for the purpose of reading a water meter or inspecting a water meter or any pipe in connection
with the Water Distribution System.
(3) Each consumer shall keep his own service pipe, stopcocks and other apparatus in good repair and protected
from frost at his own expense and shall prevent all unnecessary waste of water and no claim shall be made against
the City by reason of the freezing or breaking of any service pipes, stopcocks or other apparatus, and the
consumer shall provide a safe place for all meters, which place shall reasonably protect said meters from damage,
jarring, freezing, excessive heat or other outside interference of every kind whatever.
(4) In case any person shall for the space of thirty (30) days after any water fill has become due and payable
refuse or neglect to pay the same, the Superintendent is authorized to cause the water to be shut off, and it shall
not be turned on again until all arrearages in water charges are paid in full together with a turn-on charge to cover
expense of shutting off and turning on the water. All past due water bills may be collected from the consumer by
suit at law or assessed against the premises where the water was used and to the owner thereof, in accordance with
Chapter 24 of this Code.
(5) Responsibility for Leaks. The City will assume no responsibility for excessive water bills occasioned by a
leak in a water service.
(6) Multiple Services. In the event one (1) water connection and one (1) or more meters serve a multiple family

user written notice of the violation. Within five (5) days of the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions,

notify the Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Superintendent within 30 days after
becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the Superintendent monitors at the user's
facility at least once a month, or if the Superintendent samples between the user's initial sampling and when the
user receives the results of this sampling.
2.110. Harmful Contributions.
(1) The City may suspend the wastewater treatment service when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of
the City, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, causes interference to the POTW
or causes the City to violate any condition of its NPDES Permit.

wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; (b) fails to report significant changes in wastewater
constituents or characteristics; (c) refuses reasonable access to the user's premises by representatives of the City for
the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or (d) violates the conditions of this Chapter, or any final judicial order
entered with respect thereto.
Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City shall
take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The City shall reinstate the wastewater
treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement
submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any
future occurrence shall be submitted to the City within fifteen (15) days of the date of occurrence.
2.111. Consent Orders. The Superintendent may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance,

the event of failure of owners to comply with such provisions, the City shall have the authority to remove such trees

TITLE V - ZONING AND PLANNING
CHAPTER 51 ZONING
PREAMBLE
Pursuant to the authority conferred by 2006 PA 110 of the State of Michigan, and acts amendatory thereto, in such
case, made and provided and for the purpose of promoting and protecting the public health, safety, peace, morals,
comfort, convenience, and general welfare of the inhabitants of the City of Frankenmuth by protecting and
conserving the character and social and economic stability of the residential, commercial, industrial and other use
areas; by securing the most appropriate use of land; preventing over-crowding of land and undue congestion of
population; providing adequate light, air, and reasonable access; and facilitating adequate and economical provision

ARTICLE 1. SHORT TITLE AND PURPOSE
5.1. Title and Purpose. This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the City of Frankenmuth Zoning Ordinance.
In addition to those items referred to in the preamble above, part of the purpose of this Chapter is to make the entire
City of Frankenmuth attractive to residents and visitors. Frankenmuth has been a premier tourist attraction in the
State of Michigan for several years. A large part of that success is the result of the special attractiveness of all
facilities including residential, commercial and industrial. Frankenmuth's Bavarian-Franconian Heritage has been
developed into a successful image which is known on a national and international basis. That image can only be
maintained through careful planning and action on the part of City residents, businesses, and the City government.
Efforts to draw attention to a specific location with garish features such as flashing lights, large or gaudy signs, large
balloons, and loud noise will be detrimental to this purpose.

operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances

that these adverse effects will not contribute to blighting or downgrade the surrounding neighborhood. These
special regulations are itemized in this Sub-Section (9).

to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of adult entertainment activities within the City.
The provisions of this Sub-Section (9) have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction
on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this Sub-Section (9) to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually
oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan Zoning & Planning Code

sexually oriented material to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this Sub-Section (9) to
condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

ARTICLE 16. GENERAL PROVISIONS
5.141. Conflicting Regulations. Wherever any provision of this Chapter imposes more stringent requirements,
regulations, restrictions or limitations than are imposed or required by the provisions of any other law or Ordinance,
then the provisions of this Chapter shall govern. Whenever the provisions of any other law or Ordinance impose
more stringent requirements than are imposed or required by this Chapter, then the provisions of such law or
Ordinance shall govern.
(a) When fences, obscuring walls or fences, and/or landscaping buffers are required as specified in this Chapter,
and such regulations are in conflict, the Planning Commission shall make the final determination on said specified
requirement.
(Ordinance No. 2016-07, 07-12-2016)
5.142. Scope.
(1) No building or structure, or part thereof, shall hereafter be erected, constructed or altered and maintained, and
no new use or change shall be made or maintained of any building, structure or land, or part thereof, except in
conformity with the provisions of this Chapter.
(2) Uses for enterprises or purposes in any district that are contrary to federal, state or local laws or ordinances are
prohibited.
(Ordinance No. 2012-02, 05-01-2012)
5.143. Nonconforming Lots, Nonconforming Uses of Land, Nonconforming Structures, and Nonconforming Uses of
Structures and Premises.
(1) Intent. Within the districts established by this Chapter or amendments that may later be adopted there exist lots,
structures, and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this Chapter was passed or amended, but
which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Chapter or future amendment.
It is the intent of this Chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to
encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by this Chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts involved. It is further the intent of this Chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded
or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan Zoning & Planning Code
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 51 of Title V 51-51
A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land
shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this Chapter by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would
be prohibited generally in the district involved.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or
designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption of amendment of this Chapter and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on.
Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and
fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of an existing building has been
substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved.
(2) Nonconforming Lots. In any district in which single family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of this Chapter, a single family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be
erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter.
This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are
generally applicable in the district; provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or
width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance to
yard requirements shall be obtained through approval of the Board of Appeals.
(3) Nonconforming Uses of Land. Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter, lawful
use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this Chapter as enacted or amended, such
use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(a) No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than
was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter.
(b) No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel
occupied by such use as the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter.
(4) Nonconforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this Chapter that could not be built under the terms of this Chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage,
height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(a) No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity.
(b) Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 per cent of its replacement cost
at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Chapter.
(c) Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the
regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
(5) Nonconforming Uses of Structures and Land. If a lawful use of a structure, or of structure and land in
combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter, that would not be allowed in
the district under the terms of this Chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan Zoning & Planning Code
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 51 of Title V 51-52
(a) No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Chapter in the district in which it is located shall
be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
(b) Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged
or designed for such use, and which existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this Chapter, but no such
use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
(c) If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be
changed to another nonconforming use, provided that the Board of Appeals, either by general rule or making
findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or of a higher classification of
use to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Appeals may
require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the purpose and intent of this Chapter.
(d) Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a
permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and
the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
(e) When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or ceases
to exist for six (6) consecutive months or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year period, the structure,
or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations
of the district in which it is located. Structures occupied by seasonal uses shall be excepted from this provision.
(f) Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of
the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
(6) Repairs and Maintenance. On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be
done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of
nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding fifty (50) per cent of the market value of
the building, provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of
this Chapter shall not be increased.
Nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any
building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order
of such official.
(7) Uses Under Exception Provisions Not Nonconforming Uses. Any use for which a general exception or special
approval is permitted as provided in this Chapter shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall without
further action be deemed a conforming use in such district.
(8) Change of Tenancy or Ownership. There may be a change of tenancy, ownership or management of any
existing nonconforming uses of land, structures and premises provided there is no change in the nature or character
of such nonconforming uses.

in a residential district, an accessory building shall not be closer than eight (8) feet to the common lot line.
F. Such buildings shall not exceed ten (10) feet in height nor shall any wall exceed sixteen (16) feet in length.
G. Decorative features such as extended overhang/porch areas shall not be construed as additional square footage
if they do not exceed 24 inches.

K. Planning Commission review and approval shall be consistent with Site Plan Review procedures listed under
Article 20 of this Chapter.
(3) General Provisions.
(A) A building shall be considered as an accessory building if it does not share a common wall and roof with a

(B) Buildings that are 150 square feet or less are exempt from Planning Commission Site Plan Review
requirements, contingent upon there being only one such building on the parcel. For any additional building(s)
on commercial and industrial zoned parcels, Planning Commission approval is required.
(C) When an accessory building or use, in any residential, office or business district is intended for other than the
storage of items not normally used or associated with said residential, office or business use, permission to store
such item(s) must first receive approval from the Planning Commission.
(D) Where the nature of an accessory building requires a structural appearance inharmonious to that of the
principal building, the Planning Commission shall require that it be sufficiently screened from view from streets
and adjacent lots by an opaque fence, landscaping or hedge of five (5) feet in height.
(E) All permanent outdoor lighting located on accessory buildings in all use districts shall be shielded to reduce
glare and shall be so arranged as to reflect away from all adjacent parcels and rights-of-way.

(2) A minimum lot size of one acre is required.
(3) Appropriate screening is required in order to minimize the visibility of a furnace from any public street

(Ordinance No. 1991-3, Sec. 1, 02-05-1991; Ordinance No. 2009-01, 01-13-2009; Ordinance No. 2011-05, 07-12-
2011; Ordinance No. 2012-06; 11-13-2012)
5.145. Parking Requirements. There shall be provided in all districts at the time of erection or enlargement of any
main building structure, automobile off-street parking space with adequate access to all spaces. The number of offstreet
parking spaces, in conjunction with all land or building uses, shall be provided prior to issuance of a certificate
of occupancy as hereinafter prescribed. Should a particular use and/or occupancy change so as to require additional
parking spaces, the new occupancy shall not occur until the increase parking requirements are first met.
(1) Off-street parking for other than residential use shall be either on the same lot or within five hundred (500) feet
of the building it is intended to serve, measured from the nearest point of the building to the nearest point of the
off-street parking lot, and which is unobstructed by physical or natural barriers which would limit or restrict
pedestrian traffic from the parking lot to the building served. However, a minimum of ten per cent (10%) of total
parking required for such non-residential use shall be upon the same lot with the business building or otherwise
upon open space immediately adjacent to the structure housing the particular use. Ownership shall be shown of all
lots or parcels intended for use as parking by the applicant.
(2) Residential off-street parking spaces shall consist of a parking strip, driveway, garage, or combination thereof,
and shall be located on the premises they are intended to serve, and subject to the provisions of section 5.144. In no
case shall parking upon parkway or outlawn be permitted or considered as residential off-street parking; nor shall
any person park a vehicle in a residential driveway so as to block a public sidewalk for longer than sixty (60)
minutes. In no event shall anyone park a vehicle in a residential driveway with any portion of said vehicle
projecting into the roadway.
(3) Any area once designated as required off-street parking shall not be changed to any other use unless and until
equal facilities are provided elsewhere.
(4) Off-street parking existing at the effective date of this Chapter in connection with the operation of an existing
building or use shall not be reduced to an amount less than hereinafter required for a similar new building or use.
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan Zoning & Planning Code
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 51 of Title V 51-56
(5) Two or more buildings or uses may collectively provide the required off-street parking, in which case the
required number of parking spaces shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the several individual uses
computed separately.
(6) Dual Use & Leased Parking.
(a) Dual Use. In instances where the operating hours for buildings do not overlap, the Board of Appeals may
grant an exception so as to allow dual use of off-street parking.
(b) Leased Spaces. Leased spaces may be used to meet the requirements for off-street parking so long as the term
of the lease is for no less than five (5) years. All leases shall be recorded with the Register of Deeds and a copy
thereof filed with the City Clerk. In the event the parking lease expires or terminates for any reason, the use of the
lessee's building shall be reduced so as to conform with the then available off-street parking. Failure to reduce use
shall result in the revocation of the certificate of occupancy, in addition, to other penalties provided herein for
violation of this ordinance.
(7) The storage of merchandise, motor vehicles for sale, or the repair of vehicles is prohibited within residential
districts. In all other districts the storage of merchandise within or upon areas which are required as parking space
to conform to this section, or otherwise designated for parking, is likewise prohibited.
(a) Inoperative or Dismantled Cars, Trucks or Buses. The storage of dismantled, wrecked and/or unlicensed
vehicles within any district is expressly prohibited unless contained within an enclosed structure or provided said
storage does not exceed one (1) week.
(8) For those uses not specifically mentioned, the requirements of off-street parking facilities shall be in accord
with the most restrictive use, which is similar in type, as found in the most recent version of the “Off-Street
Parking Requirements” report as published by the American Planning Association (APA), or any similar successor
publication from the APA, subject to review and approval by the Planning Commission.
(9) Residential lots shall not be utilized for storage of boats, boat trailers, trailer coaches, travel trailers, utility
trailers, self-propelled mobile homes or display units, trucks including pickup trucks greater than one (1) ton
capacity, power driven cycles, snowmobiles or other recreation vehicles, automobiles, and commercial vehicles,
unless such storage is provided in the principal building, or in an accessory building or garage as regulated in the
district in which it is located. Provided, however, that the following exceptions may be made:
(a) Automobiles and pickup trucks of one (1) ton capacity or smaller may be parked on driveways only, without
further timing restrictions.
(b) All other vehicles combined referred to in this subsection may be parked on driveways only for no more than
a maximum of seven (7) continuous days or twenty-one (21) cumulative days per calendar year.
This exception (b) is limited to one (1) vehicle per lot at any given point in time.
In circumstances wherein the above stated conditions would create a hardship, exceptions may be made by the
Zoning Board of Appeals after proper notice and hearing by the Board.
(10) It shall be unlawful for any person to park any commercial vehicle such as a truck, semi-trailer, or tractor
truck, having a rated capacity of twenty-six thousand and one (26,001) pounds gross vehicle weight (GVW) or
more, anywhere, in any residential zone, as designated on the zoning map of the city, except for the purposes of
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan Zoning & Planning Code
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 51 of Title V 51-57
loading or unloading, or during the course of construction. This prohibition shall apply not only to public streets,
but also to private property, driveways, and parking areas.
(11) B-1, B-2, B-3, CT-PUD, CL-PUD, Office and Parking Zoning Districts shall not be utilized for the storage of
recreational vehicles, watercraft or boats, (whether mounted on trailers or unmounted), campers, trailers, or used or
unsightly machinery or equipment, except under the following circumstances:
(a) All such items that are being used in the course of a permitted construction project are permitted.
(b) All such items that are stored in a completely enclosed building are permitted.
(c) All such items that are in an area which is sight screened from the public street and abutting property owners
by a sight screening fence or sight obscuring landscaping of at least five (5) feet in height are permitted. In no
case shall such sight screened storage area be located within the front yard setback of any lot.
(d) Outside, temporary storage of such items not located within a sight screened area is limited to no more than a
maximum seven (7) continuous days or twenty-one (21) cumulative days per calendar year.
(e) A special use permit has been granted by the Planning Commission because the outside storage of such items
is incidental to the principal use permitted in the respective zoning district.
(12) The storage of recreational vehicles, watercraft or boats, campers, and trailers, whether licensed or unlicensed,
shall not be permitted on any public street or public right-of-way.
(13) The minimum number of off-street parking spaces required in Section 5.146 below may be reduced whenever
parking lot landscaping (as defined in Section 5.148 [Off-Street Parking Lot Landscaping Requirements] below) is
required and installed based on the following formula: For parking lots with a minimum of 70 parking spaces, and
a minimum of 630 square feet of landscaping, each full 90 square feet of landscaped area included as part of the
parking lot design required in Section 5.148 will allow the owner to reduce the required number of off-street
parking spaces by one space.
(14) Each employer listed below in Section 5.146 shall provide parking sufficient to accommodate the parking
needs of his own employees, in addition to complying with the parking requirements scheduled below for the use
of his customers and business invitees.
(a) In order to calculate the number of spaces required for employees, each employer listed below shall determine
the average number of employees, including managers, who will be working in the shift with the highest number
of employees during the busiest four (4) month period of the year. That number will equal the number of required
spaces for employees that must be provided in addition to the number of spaces required below.
(b) This requirement for employee spaces shall not apply to those use categories described below which refer to
number of employees because the number of minimum parking spaces required for those categories is already
based on number of employees.

surrounded by parking lot spaces or maneuvering lanes.
(2) For all new off-street parking lots with seventy (70) or more parking spaces, there shall be provided landscaped
planting areas. These areas shall be no less than six (6) feet in any single dimension and no less than a total of
ninety (90) square feet. The plantings in these areas shall be evenly dispersed throughout according to a landscape
plan approved by the City Planning Commission. Such landscape plan shall include a minimum of one (1) tree for
each ten (10) parking spaces and various plant materials that conform with Section 5.152 [Fence and Green Belt
Regulations and Maintenance] of this Code.
(3) The total amount of landscaped planting areas (beginning with a minimum of 630 square feet) shall be based on
a formula whereby ninety (90) square feet of landscaping shall be provided for each ten (10) parking spaces as
indicated in the following schedule:
Required Parking Lot Landscaping Number of Spaces
None 1 - 69
630 square feet 70 - 79

Chapter 51 of Title V 51-63
5.149. Off-Street Loading and Unloading. On the same premises with every building, structure or part thereof,
involving the receipt or distribution of vehicles or materials or merchandise, there shall be provided and maintained
on the lot adequate space for standing, loading, and unloading in order to avoid undue interference with public use of
dedicated streets or alleys. Such space shall be provided as follows:
All businesses in B-2, B-3 and O Districts shall provide a minimum of one (1) loading space. All spaces shall be laid
out in the dimension of at least ten by sixty (10' x 60') feet, or six hundred (600) square feet in area, with a clearance
of at least fourteen (14) feet in height. Loading dock approaches shall be provided with a pavement having an
asphaltic or Portland cement binder so as to provide a permanent, durable and dustless surface. All spaces in I
District shall be provided in the following ratio of spaces to usable floor area:
GROSS FLOOR AREA (IN SQUARE FEET) LOADING & UNLOADING SPACES REQUIRED
IN TERMS OF SQUARE FEET OR USABLE
FLOOR AREA

square feet in excess of 500,001.
5.150. Uses not Otherwise Included Within a Specific Use District. Because of the uses hereinafter referred to
possess unique characteristics making it impractical to include them in a specific use district classification, they shall
be permitted by the Board of Appeals under the conditions specified, and after public hearing. In every case, the uses
hereinafter referred to shall be specifically prohibited from any RE, RA-1, RA-2, RA-3, RCD or RCM Districts.
These uses require special consideration since they service an area larger than the City and require sizable land areas,
creating problems of control with reference to abutting use districts. Reference to those uses falling specifically
within the intent of this section is as follows:
(1) Outdoor Theaters. Because outdoor theaters possess the unique characteristic of being used only after darkness
and since they develop a concentration of vehicular traffic in terms of ingress and egress from their parking area,
they shall be permitted in B-3 Districts only when the site in question abuts an I District. Outdoor theaters shall
further be subject to the following conditions:
(a) The proposed internal design shall receive approval from the Building Inspector and the City Engineer as to
adequacy of drainage, lighting and other technical aspects.
(b) Points of ingress and egress shall be available to the outdoor theater from abutting major thoroughfares (120
foot right-of-way or greater), and shall not be available from any residential street.
(c) All vehicles, waiting or standing to enter the facility, shall be provided off-street waiting space. No vehicle
shall be permitted to wait or stand within a dedicated right-of-way.
(d) In the absence of state regulations or statutes, any such theater in this City shall provide toilet
accommodations comparable to those required for public restaurants.
(2) Television and Radio Towers. Radio and television towers and their attendant facilities shall be permitted in I
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan Zoning & Planning Code
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Districts, provided said use shall be located centrally on a parcel having a dimension of not less than one and onehalf
(1 1/2) times the height of the tower measured from the base of said tower to all points on each property line.
(3) Mobile Home Parks Adjacent to I or R Districts. Mobile home courts or parks shall be permitted adjacent to
any use district herein except RE, RA-1 and RA-2, and only adjacent to RA-3 upon one (1) of the four (4) sides of
the MHR District. Whenever said MHR District abuts with an I District or any residential district, there shall be
erected a twenty (20) foot green belt screening the view of said adjacent districts.
(4) Mobile Home Dwelling Prohibited. No mobile home shall be occupied as a dwelling except for those mobile
homes located in an approved mobile home park development or those mobile homes occupied under the
temporary dwelling provision outlined within this Chapter.
(5) Use of Structure for Temporary Dwelling. No structure shall be used for dwelling purposes that does not meet
the minimum standards as defined in this Chapter and the City Building Code. No temporary structure, whether of
a fixed or portable construction, shall be erected or moved onto a lot and used for dwelling purposes unless
authorized by the issuance by the Board of Appeals of a temporary permit as provided in this Chapter.
(6) Golf Courses and Country Clubs.
(a) Authorization. In recognition of the basic open space and recreation character of golf courses and country
clubs and a compatibility within agricultural and residential areas, these uses may be permitted within
Agricultural and Residential, as well as the Flood Plain Districts by issuance of a special use permit pursuant to
district allowance and all standards herein specified.
(b) Uses. The following uses may be authorized in those districts as noted in ARTICLE 3, provided the
applicable requirements are complied with.
1. Golf courses
2. Country clubs
Accessory uses for a permitted use shall be construed to include restaurant and other eating or drinking
establishments and such retail sales directly connected with the conduct of the principal use.
(c) Uses Specifically Prohibited. Driving ranges and miniature golf courses are specifically prohibited.
(d) Site Location Principles. The following principles shall be used in evaluating the proposed location of a
permitted use under this item 6.
1. Allowed use should be located to be immediately accessible from a principal or minor arterial or collector
street as classified by the adopted major street plan.
2. Site location should be allowed which enhances the natural environment and amenities for community life.
(e) Development Requirements. The following standards shall be applicable as basic requirements for the use of
land or for the erection, reconstruction, or alteration of permitted structures.
1. Minimum site shall be fifty (50) acres or more and access shall be so designed as to provide all ingress and
egress directly onto or from a collector.
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan Zoning & Planning Code

conform to the following standards of use, occupancy, and operation, which standards are hereby established as the
minimum requirements to be maintained within said areas:
(1) Smoke. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to permit the emission of any smoke from any
source whatever to a density greater than the density prescribed by the rules of the Michigan Air Pollution Control

less than eight (8) feet high. The decorative side of the wall shall be located so that it is facing toward the adjacent
properties.
(3) Glare and Radioactive Materials. Glare from any process (such as or similar to arc welding or acetylene torch
cutting) which emits harmful ultraviolet rays shall be performed in such a manner as not to be seen from any point
beyond the property line, and as not to create a public nuisance or hazard along lot lines. Radioactive materials and
wastes, and including electromagnetic radiation such as x-ray machine operation, shall not be emitted to exceed
quantities established as safe by the U.S. Bureau of Standards when measured at the property line.
(4) Fire and Explosive Hazards.
(a) In the I Districts the storage, utilization or manufacture of materials or products ranging from incombustible to

5.152. Fence and Green Belt Regulations and Maintenance. Wherever in this Chapter a fence or wall is required, the
decorative side of the fence or wall shall be located so that it is facing toward the adjacent properties.

5.153. General Landscaping Requirements.
(1) Scope of Application. These requirements shall apply to all uses for which site plan review is required under
Article 20 of this Chapter. No site plan shall be given final approval unless said site plan shows landscaping
consistent with the provisions of this Section. If the landscaping is not completed at the time of occupancy, the
owner shall file a letter with the Zoning Administrator stating that the landscaping will be completed within six (6)
months after a certificate of occupancy has been issued.
In cases where an existing building is to be structurally altered or enlarged, all of the standards set forth herein
shall be met. Exceptions: The requirement for an existing building may be waived if no more than forty percent
(40%) of the completed building’s gross floor area is altered.
The requirements of this Section 5.153 [General Landscaping Requirements] may be waived based on a
determination by the Planning Commission.
(2) Landscape Plan Required. A separate landscape plan shall be required to be submitted as part of a Site Plan
review. The landscape plan shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:
(a) Not less than seven percent (7%) of the site area shall be landscaped.
NOTE: This 7% calculation does not include landscaping required for parking lots as described in Section
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan Zoning & Planning Code
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 51 of Title V 51-68
5.148 [Off-Street Parking Area Landscaping Requirements], and it does not include landscaping in any street
right-of-way area.)
NOTE: The 7% calculation will include live flower boxes which are building mounted, and credit will be given
for four (4) times the square footage of the top surface area of the flower boxes.
NOTE: Detention basin areas whose primary purpose is for storm water drainage detention cannot be counted
as part of the 7% calculation. However, bio-filtration or rain garden areas may qualify if approved by the
Planning Commission to be included as part of the 7% calculation.
(b) The plan shall be prepared by a person familiar with the principles of landscape design and locally adapted
plant materials.
(c) A plan drawn to a readable scale.

(3) Review of Landscape Plan by Planning Commission. The Planning Commission, upon receipt of a written
report and recommendation from the Zoning Administrator, shall review said landscape plan relative to:
(a) The spacing, placement and location of plant materials relative to the length, width and general configuration
of the required landscape elements so as to insure that the intended landscaping effect will be achieved.
(b) The choice and selection of plant materials so as to insure that the root system will not interfere with public
utilities and that fruit and other debris will not constitute a nuisance within the public right-of-way or to abutting
property owners. (NOTE: Minor substitutions of plant material may be allowed in instances where the original
selections are not available. Significant changes will require resubmission of the plan to the Planning
Commission.)
(c) The proposed relationship between deciduous and evergreen plant materials so as to insure that the intended
landscaping effect, including maximum obscuring effect where appropriate, will be maintained throughout the
various seasonal periods.
(d) The size of plant materials (both starting and mature) to insure adequate maturity and optimum screening
and/or shading effect of proposed plant materials.
(4) Landscape Design Standards.
(a) Quality: All plant material and grasses shall be of generally acceptable varieties and species, free of harmful
insects, diseases and perennial weeds.

5.154. Traffic Impact Studies.
(1) Intent: City of Frankenmuth officials recognize that land use decisions can have a significant impact on traffic
operations and safety. Therefore, the City requires traffic impact studies in certain cases to identify the anticipated
traffic impacts to assist in decision making. An intent of this section is to provide specific direction for the
preparation of traffic impact studies where such studies are required by this Chapter. The requirements of this
section are also intended to help City officials determine the appropriateness of certain uses at proposed locations
in terms of traffic impacts and the adequacy of proposed access design. Traffic impact studies may also be used by
the applicant to justify additional access points.
(2) Applicability: A traffic impact study shall be required when a proposed development would be expected to
generate over seventy-five (75) directional trips during the peak hour of the traffic generator or the peak hour on
the adjacent streets, or over seven hundred fifty (750) trips in an average day. This requirement applies to new
phases or changes to a development where a traffic study is more than two (2) years old and roadway conditions
have changed significantly (volumes increasing more than 2 percent annually) or a change in use or expansion at
an existing site. The cost of said traffic studies shall be borne by the developer.
(3) Submittal Procedures: The traffic impact study shall be submitted with the site plan or other submittal material.
The applicant must discuss or meet with the Zoning Administrator or the Planning Commission to determine if a
study is needed, what type of study is needed and specific items to be addressed. The City shall submit a copy of
the traffic impact study to the applicable road agency (Michigan Department of Transportation, Saginaw County
Road Commission or City of Frankenmuth Department of Public Works) to give them the opportunity to provide
input prior to the City taking action on the request.
(4) Qualifications of Preparer: The person responsible for the preparation of the study shall have a degree or
specific professional training in the preparation of traffic impact studies. The preparer shall have at least three (3)
years of recent experience in the preparation of traffic impact studies, provide evidence of ongoing experience and
familiarity with the Highway Capacity Manual and other traffic operation evaluation techniques, be an associate
(or higher) member of one or more professional transportation-related organizations and be either a registered
professional engineer (PE) or a planner with AICP (American Institute of Certified Planners) or PCP (Professional
Community Planner) certification. Any study involving roadway or traffic signal design work shall be prepared by
or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer (PE) with specific training in traffic engineering.
(5) Traffic Impact Study Contents: The extent of information to be provided depends upon the expected trip
generation of the proposed project. The information provided in the traffic impact study shall be in accordance with
the items below.
(a) Description of the site, surroundings and study area: Illustrations and a narrative should describe the
characteristics of the site and adjacent roadway system (functional classification, lanes, speed limits, etc.). This
description should include surrounding land uses, expected development in the vicinity which could influence
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan Zoning & Planning Code
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 51 of Title V 51-70
future traffic conditions, special site features and a description of any committed roadway improvements. The
study should define and justify the study area selected for analysis.
(b) Description of the requested zoning or use. If the proposed development requires a rezoning, the traffic impact
study shall describe potential permitted uses within the requested zoning district. When the request is for a
specific use, factors which relate to traffic generation should be provided such as the number and types of
dwelling units, the gross and usable floor area, the number of employees and shift change factors. Intended
phasing or future expansion should also be noted.
(c) Description of existing peak-hour traffic volumes (and daily volumes if applicable) at intersections and on
streets adjacent to the site. Existing level of service analysis shall be provided for intersections in the vicinity
which are expected to experience an increase in traffic of at least five percent (5%) due to the proposed project.
Existing traffic counts shall not be over two (2) years old from the date of report submittal.
(d) Roadway characteristics shall be described and illustrated, as appropriate. Features to be addressed include
existing right-of-way, lane configurations, geometrics, signal timing, traffic control devices, posted speed limits,
average running speeds, sight distance information, existing driveways and potential turning movement conflicts
in the vicinity of the site.
(e) Projects must analyze background traffic, i.e., the expected increase in traffic volumes related to approved
projects and historic annual percentage increases.
(f) Forecasted trip generation of the proposed use for the a.m. peak hour (if applicable), the p.m. peak hour and an
average weekday are required. A weekend forecast may also be required for certain commercial uses. The
forecasts shall be based on one standard deviation above the average rate outlined in the most recent edition of
Trip Generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). The applicant may use other
commonly accepted sources of data or supplement the standard data with data from at least three (3) similar
projects in Michigan. For rezoning requests, the study should contrast the traffic impacts of typical uses permitted
in the requested zoning district with uses permitted in the current zoning district. The determination of typical
uses shall be made by the Zoning Administrator. Any trip reduction for pass-by trips, transit, ridesharing, other
modes, internal capture rates, etc., shall be based both on ITE findings and documented survey results acceptable
to the City of Frankenmuth. The City may accept in whole or in part the trip reduction rates used. For projects
intended to be developed in phases, the trip generation by phase shall be described.
(g) The projected traffic generated shall be distributed (in-bound versus out-bound, left turn versus right turn)
onto the existing street network to project turning movements at site access points and nearby intersections where
required. Project peak hour turning movement volumes shall be illustrated in the report. A description of the
application of standard engineering procedures for determining the distribution should also be attached (trip
distribution model, market studies, counts at existing driveways, etc.).
(h) Level of service or “capacity” analysis at the proposed access points shall be completed using the procedures
outlined in the most recent edition of the Highway Capacity Manual published by the Transportation Research
Board. For projects requiring a Traffic Impact Statement or Regional Traffic Analysis, before and after capacity
analyses shall also be performed for all street intersections where the expected traffic generated by the proposed
project will comprise at least five percent (5%) of the existing intersection capacity, and/or for roadway sections
and intersections experiencing congestion or a relatively high crash rate, as determined by the community or
applicable road agency. The City may require gap studies for unsignalized intersections where applicable.
(i) The report shall include a map and description of the location and design of proposed access (driveways or
new street intersections).

Chapter 51 of Title V 51-71
(j) Mitigation/Alternatives: The study shall outline mitigation measures and demonstrate any changes to the level
of service achieved by these measures. Any alternatives or suggested phasing of improvements should be
described. The mitigation measures may include items such as roadway widening, need for bypass lanes or
deceleration tapers/lanes, changes to signalization, use of access management techniques or a reduction in the
proposed intensity of use. Documentation shall be provided from the applicable road agency regarding the
proposed mitigation measures. The responsibility and timing of roadway improvements shall be described.
Proposal improvements requiring applicable road agency approval (new signals, roadway improvements, etc.)
require a submittal of correspondence from the applicable road agency outlining their agreement.
(6) Modification of Study Requirements: The requirement for a traffic impact study, or the study elements listed in
Item 5 above, may be modified by the City Planning Commission. Reasons for the modification shall be
documented by the applicant and may include the following factors:
(a) Roadway improvements are already scheduled which are expected to mitigate any impacts associated with the
proposed project.
(b) The existing level of service is not expected to be significantly impacted by the proposed project due to
specific conditions at the subject location.
(c) A similar traffic study was previously prepared for the site and is still considered applicable.
(7) Review of Traffic Impact Study: The City of Frankenmuth reserves the right to obtain a professional review of
the traffic impact study, and the developer shall pay for the cost of the review if required.
(Ordinance No. 2005-03, 10-04-2005)
5.155. Retail Development Design Standards.
(1) All Retail Developments shall be designed in order, as near as practicable, to emulate small town centers, such
that retail buildings will be located around a central public area, with landscaping, open space and other features
encouraging walking rather than auto traffic.
(2) All Retail Developments shall, at a minimum, include the following:
(a) The buildings shall be designed in a way that will reduce the massive scale, uniformity and impersonal
appearance and will provide visual interest consistent with the community's identity, character, and scale.
(b) If a building facade exceeds sixty (60) feet in length, it shall be broken down into smaller elements by jogging
the wall in or out a minimum of four (4) feet for at least ten (10) feet in length, or by adding an element such as a
porch, recessed entry, bay window, projecting trellis or similar substantial architectural feature at intervals so that
no continuous wall plane is more than sixty (60) feet in length.
(c) The portion of the building within public view shall incorporate human scale elements such as windows,
arcades, lower roof overhangs, awnings or architectural features.
(d) The roof design shall provide variations in roof lines and heights to add interest to each building. Parapet
walls shall be architecturally treated to avoid a plain monotonous style.
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan Zoning & Planning Code
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 51 of Title V 51-72
(e) Entryways shall be designed to orient customers and add aesthetically pleasing character to buildings by
providing inviting customer entrances that are protected from the weather. Each entrance shall be clearly defined
and highly visible.
(f) Special design features such as towers, arcades, porticos, accent lighting, planter walls, seating areas,
fountains and other architectural features that define circulation paths and outdoor spaces shall anchor pedestrian
ways. Examples are outdoor plazas, patios, courtyards and window shopping areas.
(g) All site lighting shall be full cut-off fixtures and downward facing and no direct light shall bleed onto adjacent
properties. The applicant must provide a lighting report which provides information on how site lighting will be
accomplished to minimize impacts on adjacent properties and roadways.
(h) Mechanical equipment shall be screened to mitigate noise and views in all directions. If roof mounted, the
screen shall be designed to conform architecturally to the design of the building either with varying roof planes or
with parapet walls. A wood fence or similar treatment is not acceptable.

5.156. Respect Existing Topography and Natural Vegetation.
(1) All development within 500 feet of an inland lake or stream, or which proposes to expose more than an acre of
soil shall obtain a Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Permit before undertaking land clearing, top soil
removal, tree cutting or development unless the activity is exempt under the Natural Resources and Environmental
Protection Act, as it is with agricultural activities.
(2) All land development for which a Zoning Permit is required shall attempt to incorporate Low Impact
Development solutions before employing more aggressive engineering solutions, including but not limited to the
following:
(a) All development applications shall demonstrate respect for existing topography and utilize it to the advantage
of the proposed development, without resorting to massive excavation and drastic alteration except where lot
characteristics and the characteristics of abutting land make such limited topographic change unreasonable. Steep
slopes should be avoided for alteration or new building construction to prevent soil erosion and unnecessary risk
of new buildings cracking or slumping.
(b) Existing vegetation that is healthy and suitable for landscaping objectives and which would reduce soil
erosion and sedimentation, should remain undisturbed as new development occurs to the extent that is reasonable
under the circumstances.
(3) The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the requirements of subsection (2) above have been met
after consulting with the Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Official.

5.182. [Section deleted.] (Ordinance No. 2006-10, 11-08-2006)
5.183. [Section deleted.] (Ordinance No. 1987-4, Sec. 1, 05-05-1987; Ordinance No. 1988-1, Sec. 3, 02-02-1988,
Ordinance No. 2006-10, 11-08-2006)
5.184. Limitations on Issuance of Building Permits. The City of Frankenmuth has a population in 1987 of
approximately four thousand (4,000) people. A close examination of the recently completed Master Plan indicates
that this figure could rapidly triple within the next ten (10) years if permitted residential densities in undeveloped
land along the peripheries of the City should materialize, if the anticipated use of the Planned Unit Development
occurs too frequently, and if probable annexations take place in the imminent future.
The rather considerable input from citizens - some solicited, most volunteered - conforms to the conclusions also
reached by the City Council, that the City of Frankenmuth would probably destroy its own best potential if it grew
too rapidly. The main considerations prompting such a conclusion are:
(1) The fiscal ability (or inability) of the City to properly extend utilities, facilities, improvements to such expanded
areas commensurate with rational municipal service costs;
(2) The obvious perversion or distortion of the environment heretofore successfully and historically developed over
the past one hundred forty (140) years to the present desirable social and economic level;
(3) Assuring preservation of the green belt and rural environment so essential to the character of the combined
community of township and city.
It is an obvious fact that village size and Bavarian-Franconian architectural features enhance the "dorf" or village
image which attracts the continued interest of the tourist and increases the economic stability of the community. It
follows also that the historical integrity which forms the basis of this City's attraction and reputation would also be
less visible and authentic if a doubling or tripling of the population were permitted in too short a period.
Because of its heritage, as well as its unique crafts and services, Frankenmuth brings tourists into Eastern Michigan
and Saginaw County.
Frankenmuth is a historical as well as a rural island surrounded by urban centers that are destined in time, and with
lack of appropriate heed, to ultimately overtake, engulf and compromise the positive and desirable characteristics
which so favorably distinguish this community from most others within its region and state.
Therefore, in the effort to preserve and maintain the quality of life so carefully nurtured by all of its citizens, as
well as its community leaders and government officials, it is deemed necessary to herewith decree and ordain that
from the date of enactment of this Chapter until such time as it may be amended or rescinded, the population of the
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan Zoning & Planning Code
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 51 of Title V 51-96
City of Frankenmuth shall be controlled by the administrative procedures afforded within this Chapter, as well as
by other appropriate resolutions and regulations. Accordingly, the City Manager, (or his delegated representative)
is herewith ordered to limit within any building year (which shall run from October 1 to the subsequent September
30):
(a) The granting of permits for the construction of single-family residences to no more than three per cent (3%) of
the total number of living units (single-family, two-family, multiple-family, estate multiple-family) then existing
within the City of Frankenmuth;
(b) The granting of permits for the construction of duplex or two-family units to no more than one per cent (1%)
of the total number of living units (single-family, two-family, multiple-family, estate multiple-family) then
existing within the City of Frankenmuth;
(c) The granting of permits for the construction of multiple-unit housing to no more than one per cent (1%) of the
total number of living units (single-family, two-family, multiple-family, estate multiple-family) then existing
within the City of Frankenmuth;
(d) The granting of permits for the construction of estate multiple-unit housing to no more than one per cent (1%)
of the total number of living units (single-family, two-family, multiple-family, estate multiple-family) then
existing within the City of Frankenmuth.
In calculating the above mentioned percentages, institutional or non-profit projects shall not be included therein.
The privilege of building dwelling units within the percentages and terms of either paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d)
above presumes the presence of land so zoned to accommodate the aforementioned uses, but places no obligation
upon the City to guarantee that land for said purposes shall be so available at any given time.
If the number of permits issued or applied for within a year shall exceed the aforestated annual percentages in any
of the said use categories, such additional permits may be issued by the City Council, but only following a public
hearing wherein the merits of granting such additional permits may be considered. If granted, the percentage, or
number of permits, in excess of such annual quota shall be deducted from the quota that would be applicable
upon the ensuing year. If building within either category shall fall short of the above-assigned percentages, the
number of permits not used in a given year may be credited to and accordingly enlarge the permissible percentage
for the following year. The prospective or retrospective compensating procedures above mentioned may not be
applicable beyond a two-year period.
Whenever any property owner or builder shall apply for more than forty per cent (40%) of the eligible building
permits available under categories (a), (b), (c) or (d) above, the permission for permits beyond the said forty
percent (40%) shall be granted only following a public hearing and determination by the City Council.
Notice of such public meeting shall be published in a newspaper of local circulation at least ten (10) days before
said hearing and shall be further served upon all interested persons by certified mail, including all commercial
builders who may have been engaged in building within the City during the eighteen (18) months prior to
publication.
In furtherance of the spirit of this section, the City will vigorously resist any attempt to rezone the multiplefamily
use any vacant enclaves within areas that are established by the Planning Commission as single-family
areas, except where the developer can show:
(1) Exceptional amenities for the area to be redeveloped; and

Chapter 51 of Title V 51-111
be issued for business buildings in B-2 and B-3 zones existing at the effective date of this Chapter which change
occupancy and which do not provide sufficient parking as required under Article 16, provided there is no decrease
in the number of spaces existing at the effective date of this Chapter.

occupancy for a portion of a building or structure in process of erection or alteration, provided that such temporary

portion of the building, structure, or premises is in conformity with the provisions of this Chapter.

Administrator, and copies shall be furnished upon request to any person having a proprietary or tenancy interest in
the property involved.

(8) Application for Certificates. Application for certificates of occupancy shall be made in writing to the Building
Inspector on forms furnished by the Department, and such certificates shall be issued within ten (10) days after

accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.
If such certificate is refused for cause, the applicant therefor shall be notified of such refusal and cause thereof,
within the aforesaid ten (10) day period.
(9) Bonding Requirement. When any structure or project, whether publicly or privately developed, would in the
opinion of the City Council, jeopardize, prejudice or reflect adversely upon either the welfare of the community or
the appearance of any portion or neighborhood thereof, in the event that such project would be abandoned in an
incomplete state, the Council may, in its discretion, require such builder or developer to post a performance bond,
or an unconditional letter of credit in a form approved by the City Council, prior to the issuance of a building
permit, guaranteeing the adequate consummation of the structure or project.
(10) Unpaid Assessment. If property be sold, exchanged or otherwise alienated with any special assessment
charges remaining unpaid thereon, said special assessment must be paid in full at the time the title change is
consummated or immediately thereafter, before the Building Inspector may issue a Certificate of Occupancy
pertaining to said parcel or property.

Chapter 51 of Title V 51-116
ARTICLE 23. RESIDENTIAL: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (R-PUD)
5.240.1. Purpose. Rapid and intensive urbanization over the past decade has produced a need for an economical
single-family living unit that is adaptable to urban density but that retains many of the attractive features of the
suburban home. Among the housing concepts emerging to meet this need are townhouses, row houses, garden
apartments and similar types of housing units with common property areas; clustered types of subdivisions in which
housing units are arranged in cluster forms, with clusters separated from each other by common open spaces; and
housing units developed with related recreational space, such as golf courses, swimming pools, private parks,
community centers and other recreational facilities.
It is the purpose of this Article to encourage more imaginative and livable housing environments within this
residential district, through a planned reduction, or averaging, of individual requirements for the residential district,
providing the overall density requirements for the district remain. Such averaging or reduction of requirements shall
only be permitted when a land owner, or group of owners acting jointly, can plan and develop a tract of land as one
(1) complex land-use unit, rather than an aggregation of individual buildings located on separate, unrelated lots.
The provisions of this Article provide enabling authority and standards for the submission, review and approval of
applications for residential planned unit developments. It is the intent of this Article to authorize the use of planned
unit development regulations for the purpose of: encouraging the use of land in accordance with its character and
adaptability; conserving natural resources and natural features and energy; encouraging innovation in land use
planning; providing enhanced housing, traffic circulation and recreational opportunities for the people of the City
and Township; and bringing about a greater compatibility in design and use between neighboring properties. The
provisions of this Article are not intended as a device for ignoring the Zoning Ordinance or the planning upon which
it is based. To that end, provisions of this Article are intended to result in land use development substantially
consistent with other residential districts, with modifications and departures from generally applicable requirements
made in accordance with standards provided in this Article to ensure appropriate, fair and consistent decision
making.
5.240.2. Regulations.
(1) A residential planned unit development application may be approved subject to review and approval as
provided for in Article 26.
(2) A greenbelt shall be maintained around the City. Residential Planned Unit Developments shall be restricted
insofar as the use of belt roads as follows:
(a) Access to belt roads (Roedel, Dehmel and Block) shall be limited to dedicated streets at intervals
approximately one-quarter (1/4) mile apart;
(b) Municipal utilities shall be established pursuant to the Urban Limits Intergovernmental Agreement between
the City of Frankenmuth and the Township of Frankenmuth;
(c) Structures adjacent to belt roads shall not front/face the belt road.
(d) Departures from compliance with these regulations may be granted at the discretion of the Planning
Commission(s) as part of the approval of a planned unit development.
(3) Development shall be further limited as follows:
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan Zoning & Planning Code
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

(a) The development shall be adjacent/contiguous to areas where municipal utilities are in place sufficient to meet
the necessary capacity for the proposed development.
(b) The development shall be a minimum of six (6) acres.
(c) The residential density within the development shall not be less than two (2) units per acre. The development
shall not exceed a density of three and one-half (3.5) residential units per acre. For the purpose of determining the
minimum and maximum density as set out above, gross acreage shall include all areas to be used for residential
purposes, including off-street parking, and all open space devoted exclusively for residential use or for natural
resource preservation.
(d) At the discretion of the Planning Commission(s) adjacent property may be added to a previously approved
unfinished R-PUD development contingent on the following requirements:
(i) Unfinished R-PUD development means one or more streets in the development have not yet been accepted
into the City street system by the City Council.
(ii) The combined acreage of the original R-PUD development and the adjacent area proposed for inclusion
must comply with the ten percent (10%) open space requirement described in Section 5.240.4 of this Chapter.
(iii) Unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission(s), the residential density within the adjacent area
proposed for inclusion must comply with the density requirements stated above as if the adjacent area were a
stand alone development.
(e) Public streets shall conform to the requirements of Section 5.298 of the City of Frankenmuth Code.
(f) Private streets shall be:
(i) Dead-end streets of not more than three hundred (300) feet in length and shall not intersect or abut a second
street; or
(ii) U-shaped streets of not more than six hundred (600) feet in length returning to the same public street.
(4) The development shall have utility capacities to meet total planning needs not only for the subject development
but for the zoning area or areas in which the subject development is located; excess capacity which may be
required by City planning needs of nonsubject sites shall be the subject of municipal participation, at the
municipality's discretion.
(5) The application/applicant for a planned unit development must demonstrate as a condition to be entitled to
planned unit development that:
(a) The grant of a planned unit development will result in a recognizable and substantial benefit to the ultimate
users of the project and to the community where such benefit would otherwise be unfeasible or unlikely to be
achieved.
(b) The proposed type and density shall not result in an unreasonable increase in the use of public services,
facilities and utilities, and shall not place an unreasonable burden upon the subject and/or surrounding land,
and/or property owners and occupants, and/or the natural environment.
(c) The proposed development shall not have a materially adverse impact upon the Frankenmuth Community
Master Plan, and shall be consistent with the intent and spirit of this Article.
(d) The proposed development shall not result in an unreasonably negative economic impact on the surrounding
properties.

ARTICLE 28. P-1 - VEHICULAR PARKING DISTRICT
5.245.1. Preamble. The P-1 - Vehicular Parking District is intended for off-street parking only. The district is useful
in situations where the property should be so restricted in order to provide a buffer area between residential and nonresidential
uses. This district is not intended to be used for construction of parking garages or parking structures.
(Ordinance No. 1993-1, Sec. 2, 01-12-1993)
5.245.2. Principal Uses Permitted. Vehicular parking spaces to be provided as required in Article 16, "General
Provisions."
(Ordinance No. 1993-1, Sec. 2, 01-12-1993)
5.245.3. Conditions of Use.
(a) Such parking area shall be used solely for the parking of private passenger vehicles for periods of less than
one (1) day.
(b) All parking lots proposed to be located in P-1 Vehicular Parking Districts shall be subject to the provisions
stipulated in Article 20, "Site Plan Review."
(c) All buildings, including parking garages and parking structures, are prohibited in these districts.
(Ordinance No. 1993-1, Sec. 2, 01-12-1993)
ARTICLE 29. COMMERCIAL: LOCAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
OVERLAY ZONE (CL-PUDOZ)
5.246.1. Findings of Fact and Concerns.
(1) Frankenmuth has traditionally fostered small and locally owned business enterprises and entrepreneurship
providing local employment opportunities and revenue expansion. Frankenmuth also is identified by numerous
one-of-a-kind businesses in small scale storefronts, which reflect the Community's ethnic and lifestyle
characteristics, building scale, architectural style and historical development.
(2) Because of its unique character, Frankenmuth is renowned throughout Michigan and the Mid-West, and is one
of the most popular tourist destinations in Michigan, thereby contributing to the economic benefits of the
Frankenmuth Community's visitor trade.
(3) The unique character of Frankenmuth would be threatened by proposed large scale uses that are incompatible in
size and scale with the historic old world character of Frankenmuth and would irreversibly alter its character.
These uses would also adversely impact the existing small scale businesses located in Frankenmuth.
(4) Consistent with the City of Frankenmuth and Frankenmuth Township Joint Growth Management Plan, new
commercial development should be encouraged in the so called “town center” settings, where small shops are
gathered about a central area, with landscaped center features, where walking is encouraged rather than auto traffic,
and strip mall developments with large unattractive parking fields are discouraged. Such town center developments
are more consistent with the character and tourism goals of Frankenmuth. They promote efficient use of land,
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan Zoning & Planning Code
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 51 of Title V 51-134
promote a safe and comfortable pedestrian scale environment, preserve and enhance the night sky for the
enjoyment of a pristine nighttime environment, and encourage excellence in urban design, improvement in the
overall Frankenmuth appearance and preserve the wholeness of Frankenmuth's economic base.
(5) Frankenmuth area residents have expressed concerns that current zoning controls are inadequate to: (a) control
the size and scale of commercial uses and (b) protect against adverse changes to the unique physical characteristics
of the Community, including building and architectural styles.
5.246.2. Commercial Local Planned Unit Development Overlay Zone.
(1) There is hereby established a Commercial Local Planned Unit Development Overlay Zone (CL-PUDOZ)
encompassing all CL-PUD (Commercial Local Planned Unit Development) zoning districts in the City of
Frankenmuth . The CL-PUDOZ is established in furtherance of the Frankenmuth Joint Growth Management Plan
and the purposes and goals set forth therein.
(2) The CL-PUDOZ does not replace or negate the zoning district designation of the underlying CL-PUD zoning
district established in this Chapter but rather is intended to establish limitations, standards and regulations for
properties located within the CL-PUDOZ, in addition to those established in the applicable district. In the event of
any inconsistency between the provisions set forth in this Article and the provisions set forth in the underlying CLPUD
zoning district, the more restrictive provisions shall supersede and control or, if not determinable which
provision is more restrictive, the provisions of this CL-PUDOZ shall supersede and control.
5.246.3. Limitation on Size of Individual Retail Building Developments.
(1) For purposes of this Article 29, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
(a) “Building” shall mean any building operated in whole or in part for retail sales and/or services. For purposes
of this section, all buildings within two hundred (200) feet of one another, measured from the outside of the
closest adjacent walls, which: (i) are operated by the same or related company or individuals, or (ii) are operated
under the same or similar trade names, or (iii) share checkstands, storage areas or distribution facilities, shall
constitute a single “building” and the square footage of each building shall be combined.
(b) The measurement of “square feet” shall include all of the area within a building or buildings, measured from
the outside of exterior walls and the middle of party walls shared with another unrelated building. Square footage
measurements shall also include all mezzanines, entryways and all floors, and outside areas, if such areas are
used for the purpose of sales and are covered or enclosed.
(2) For all properties in the CL-PUDOZ the floor area of a retail building, whether located in a single building,
combination of buildings, single tenant space and/or combination of tenant spaces, shall not exceed sixty-five
thousand (65,000) square feet. This space limitation shall apply to the combined area of all building levels, both
above and below grade.
5.246.4. Retail Development Standards.
(1) The intent of the preceding Sections 5.246.2 and 5.246.3 is to insure that all retail development is of a quality
that enhances the character of the Frankenmuth Community, and does not overwhelm its surroundings, and
protects and contributes to the health, safety and welfare of the Community. Unregulated retail development can
result in substantial impacts to the Community, such as, but not limited to, noise, traffic, community character,
environment and the local economy.
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan Zoning & Planning Code
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 51 of Title V 51-135
(2) All Retail Developments in the CL-PUDOZ shall be designed in order, as near as practicable, to emulate small
town centers, such that retail buildings will be located around a central public area, with landscaping, open space
and other features encouraging walking rather than auto traffic.
(3) All Retail Developments in the CL-PUDOZ shall, at a minimum, include the following:
(a) The buildings shall be designed in a way that will reduce the massive scale, uniformity and impersonal
appearance and will provide visual interest consistent with the community's identity, character, and scale.
(b) If a building facade exceeds sixty (60) feet in length, it shall be broken down into smaller elements by jogging
the wall in or out a minimum of four (4) feet for at least ten (10) feet in length, or by adding an element such as a
porch, recessed entry, bay window, projecting trellis or similar substantial architectural feature at intervals so that
no continuous wall plane is more than sixty (60) feet in length.
(c) The portion of the building within public view shall incorporate human scale elements such as windows,
arcades, lower roof overhangs, awnings or architectural features.
(d) The roof design shall provide variations in roof lines and heights to add interest to each building. Parapet
walls shall be architecturally treated to avoid a plain monotonous style.
(e) Entryways shall be designed to orient customers and add aesthetically pleasing character to buildings by
providing inviting customer entrances that are protected from the weather. Each entrance shall be clearly defined
and highly visible.
(f) Special design features such as towers, arcades, porticos, accent lighting, planter walls, seating areas,
fountains and other architectural features that define circulation paths and outdoor spaces shall anchor pedestrian
ways. Examples are outdoor plazas, patios, courtyards and window shopping areas.
(g) All site lighting shall be full cut-off fixtures and downward facing and no direct light shall bleed onto adjacent
properties. The applicant must provide a lighting report which provides information on how site lighting will be
accomplished to minimize impacts on adjacent properties and roadways.
(h) Mechanical equipment shall be screened to mitigate noise and views in all directions. If roof mounted, the
screen shall be designed to conform architecturally to the design of the building either with varying roof planes or
with parapet walls. A wood fence or similar treatment is not acceptable.
(Ordinance No. 2005-10, 12-06-2005)
ARTICLE 30. RESIDENTIAL-COMMERCIAL: MIXED USE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
DISTRICT (MU-PUD)
5.250.1. Purpose. The Residential-Commercial Mixed Use Planned Unit Development District (MU-PUD) is

licensed hereunder for the balance of the current license year.

approval before a license is transferred, sold, or purchased. A licensee or any other person shall not lease,

person to whom such license or permit is granted from the necessity of securing individual licenses or permits for
each such trade, profession, business or privilege.
7.3. State Licensed Businesses. The fact that a license or permit has been granted to any person by the State of
Michigan to engage in the operation, conduct or carrying on of any trade, profession, service, business or privilege

permit is required by this Code.

Chapter 100 of Title VIII 100-1
CHAPTER 100. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
ARTICLE 1. FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
8.61. Findings of Fact.
(1) The flood hazard areas of the City of Frankenmuth are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of
life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect
the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special food hazards which
increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ordinance No. 1982-5, 08-03-1982)
8.62. Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and general
welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
(1) To protect human life and health;
(2) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the
expense of the general public;
(4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and
sewer lines; streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
(6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood
hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;
(7) To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and
(8) To insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.
(Ordinance No. 1982-5, 08-03-1982)
8.63. Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this Chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
(1) Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion
hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood
damage at the time of initial construction;

accommodate or channel flood waters;
(4) Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and,
(5) Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which
may increase flood hazards in other areas.

(5) Assessable costs associated with a motor vehicle accident or motor vehicle fire and any liabilities resulting
therefrom;
(6) Assessable costs associated with excessive requests for emergency assistance and any liabilities resulting
therefrom;
(7) Assessable costs incurred to extinguish or fight a fire at any residential structure, and demolition costs if the
residential structure must be demolished to protect the public safety following the fire and any liabilities
resulting therefrom where the fire was caused by illegal conduct or reckless behavior; and
(8) Assessable costs associated with a false alarm and any liabilities resulting therefrom.
(b) Each responsible party shall reimburse the City for the assessable costs specified in any statement provided by
the City to the responsible party within 30 days of the City sending such statement by first class mail to the
responsible party’s last known address. Any amounts unpaid after such date shall bear a late payment fee equal to
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan General Code
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 127 of Title IX 127-4
one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or fraction thereof. If a responsible party shall appeal assessable costs
pursuant to section 3 hereof, such costs, if upheld, in whole or in part, shall be due and payable as described in
that section. Late payment fees shall also apply.
(c) Any assessable costs which become known to the City following the transmittal of a statement to the
responsible party pursuant to this Chapter shall be billed in the same manner on a subsequent statement to the
responsible party.
(d) The City Treasurer (or his/her designee) shall certify to the City Manager (or his/her designee) the total
assessable costs incurred by the City (or by a third party independent contractor or municipality providing
services or representing the City). The City Manager (or his/her designee) shall then decide whether to assess any
or all of the costs against any or all of the responsible parties. In deciding whether to assess the costs against any
or all of the responsible parties, the City Manager (or his/her designee) shall consider the following factors:
(1) The total assessable costs incurred by the City;
(2) The risks to the City, its residents, their property, or any other people or property which result from the
situation which caused the City to incur assessable costs;
(3) Any injuries or damage to people or property which resulted from a situation which caused the City to incur
assessable costs;
(4) Whether the situation which caused the City to incur assessable costs necessitated an evacuation;
(5) Whether the situation which caused the City to incur assessable costs resulted in any damage to the
environment.
(e) The City Manager (or his/her designee) may, after consideration of the factors listed in section 2(d), allocate
the costs among and between the responsible parties. Any costs not allocated among or between responsible
parties shall be a joint and several liability of each responsible party assessed costs pursuant to section 2(d),
regardless of whether that responsible party has any other legal liability apart from this Chapter, and regardless of
whether such person or entity is at fault.
(f) The City may charge any costs assessed pursuant to this Chapter to the insurer of any responsible party. The
submission of an invoice for the assessed costs to an insurer does not in any way limit or extinguish the liability of
a responsible party for the costs assessed pursuant to this Chapter until such time as the assessed costs are paid in
full.
(g) If the City Manager (or his/her designee) or the City Council decides not to assess all or part of its costs
against any responsible party, such decision shall not in any way extinguish or limit a responsible person’s
liability to other parties for any costs or damages of any kind arising from the incident or release.
9.212. Notice and Right to Appear Provisions.
(a) Any responsible party who receives a statement of costs from the City assessed pursuant to this Chapter shall
be given the opportunity to appear before the City Council to request a waiver or modification of the assessed
costs. Any responsible party who desires to appear before the City Council shall file a written request with the
City Clerk within 14 calendar days of the date of the statement of assessed costs. The responsible party shall be
placed on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled or special City Council meeting which is at least 14 calendar
days after the date on which the responsible party files with the City Clerk a request to appear. Any filed request
to appear shall specifically identify and explain all reasons why the responsible party believes the costs assessed
pursuant to this Chapter should be modified or waived. Any reason, basis or argument for a modification or
waiver of the assessed costs not set forth in the written request to appear shall be deemed waived by the
responsible party. Failure to file a written request to appear within 14 days of the date of the statement of
assessed costs shall constitute a waiver of the responsible party’s right to appear before the City Council and the
City of Frankenmuth, Michigan General Code
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 127 of Title IX 127-5
responsible party’s agreement to pay the assessed costs, which payment must be made within 30 days of the date
of the statement sent to the responsible party.
(b) At the City Council meeting, any responsible party who has filed a timely written request to appear shall have
the opportunity to address the City Council regarding the written request that the City Council modify or waive
the assessed costs. The responsible party shall be limited, in addressing the City Council, to those reasons and
bases set forth in that responsible party’s written request to appear. The City Manager shall have the opportunity
to address the City Council to explain the process by which the assessed costs were determined and allocated.
The City Council, after hearing from the responsible party and the City Manager, shall review the assessed costs
and make a final determination regarding the costs assessed to the responsible party. The City Council shall pass
a motion or resolution detailing its final determination regarding the assessed costs. The City Clerk shall then
send an updated statement of assessed costs to the responsible party, by first class United States Mail, with
postage prepaid, to the last known address of the responsible party. The assessed costs shall be due and payable
30 days from the date of that statement. If the responsible party fails to pay the assessed costs within those 30
days, the City shall have available to it all remedies available under section 4, below.
9.213. Failure to pay; Procedure to Recover.
(a) Assessable costs assessed against a responsible party not paid when due, including late payment fees, shall
constitute a lien upon the real property of the responsible party in the City to which the assessed costs were
related. Such lien shall be of the same character and effect as the lien created by City Charter for City real
property taxes and shall include accrued interest and penalties. The City Treasurer shall prior to March 1 of each
year, certify to the City Assessor the fact that such assessable costs are delinquent and unpaid. The City Assessor
shall then enter the delinquent amount on the next general ad valorem tax roll as a charge against the affected
property, and the lien thereon shall be enforced in the same manner as provided and allowed by law for delinquent
and unpaid real property taxes.
(b) In addition to the remedy set forth in section 4(a), the City shall be entitled to pursue any other remedy or may
institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction as permitted by law to collect
assessable costs from a responsible party.
(c) The recovery of assessable costs pursuant hereto does not limit the liability of a responsible party under
applicable local, state or federal law.

Chapter 130 of Title IX 130-1
CHAPTER 130. LIMITATION ON RETAIL BUSINESS HOURS OF OPERATION
9.250. Findings of Fact. The City Council finds that 24 Hour Businesses pose special demands on the law
enforcement resources of the City. The City has limited police resources available during the early morning hours
of the day. 24 Hour Businesses threaten public safety by increasing the likelihood that during the early morning
hours calls for police assistance could easily exhaust the limited police resources which the City has available.
Those resources are fully deployed for the needs of the City and, by contract, for the needs of Frankenmuth
Township. Also, 24 Hour Businesses pose a threat to the public welfare because they generate more assaults, more
illegal drug and alcohol related incidents, and more “two person” police calls than do other businesses.
9.251. Definitions. When used in this Chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
(1) Retail business. A for-profit business establishment with employees physically on the premises which
principally sells commodities on its premises, such as, but not limited to, groceries, meats, dairy products, baked
goods or other foods, drugs, dry goods and notions, hardware, furniture, appliances, clothing and fuel for
motorized vehicles.
(2) 24 Hour Business. Any Retail business that is open to the public at any time for 24 consecutive hours.
9.252. Regulations. No Retail business may be open to the public between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.
Exception: For-profit business establishments that principally sell alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption,
including businesses with Class C, A-Hotel, B-Hotel, Tavern and Club Liquor Licenses, may continue to be open to
the public in accordance with State of Michigan Liquor Control Commission regulations.
(Ordinance 2010-02, 12-07-2010)
9.253. Provisions Pertaining to Currently Operating 24 Hour Businesses.
(1) The provisions of this Chapter 130 shall not apply to any Retail business which was being operated as a 24
Hour Business for a period of at least six consecutive months prior to the date of the enactment of this Chapter
130 (November 1, 2005).
(2) If any 24 Hour Business which is already in operation on the date of the enactment of this Chapter 130
(November 1, 2005) voluntarily ceases its business operations for a period of six consecutive months, then the
provisions of Section 9.252 of this Chapter 130 shall apply to that 24 Hour Business.

CHAPTER 131. OUTSIDE BURNING
9.260. Permissible Outside Burning.
A. Bonfires. No person or organization shall burn a bonfire without first obtaining a permit to do so from the
Fire Chief of the Frankenmuth Fire Department. Permits for bonfires shall be granted only for a celebration of a

4. The Fire Chief of the Frankenmuth Fire Department or his designated representative is authorized to require
that campfires be immediately discontinued if such fires are determined to constitute a hazardous condition.
C. Campfires In Licensed Campgrounds. Such campfires will be permitted when built in fire pits/rings
specifically constructed for that purpose and designed to prevent the escape of fire from the fire pit/ring area.
Supervision by fire safety instructors and notification to the Frankenmuth Fire Department is not required. Items
3 and 4 in Paragraph B above do apply to these campfires.
9.261. Violation; Municipal Civil Infraction. A person who violates any provision of this Chapter is responsible
for a municipal civil infraction, subject to payment of a civil fine of not less than $100.00 nor more than $500.00,
plus costs and other sanctions, for each violation. Repeat offenses shall be subject to increased fines as provided by
Section 1.12(3)(b) of this Code. The Fire Chief or his/her designee is hereby designated as the authorized City
official to issue municipal civil infraction citations (directing alleged violators to appear in court) or municipal civil
infraction violation notices (directing alleged violators to appear at the City of Frankenmuth Municipal Ordinance
Violations Bureau) for violations under this Chapter as provided by this Code.
