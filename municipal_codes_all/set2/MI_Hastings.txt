PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City 
of Hastings, Michigan. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1970 Code, as supplemented through 
Ordinance Number 279, enacted October 10, 1994, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city 
council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end 
thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time 
with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the 
reader can locate any section of the 1970 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance 
included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various 
sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of 
the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law 
citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many 
state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The 
figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of 
the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first 
section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same 
time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For 
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions 
may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter 
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the 
subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may 
be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical 
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed 
under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and 
still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the 
particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Chantal Parker, Supervising Editor, and John 
Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the 
other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the 
project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Howard Penrod, City Manager, Jeffrey Mansfield, Director of Public 
Services, and Stephanie Fekkes, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress 
of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a 
Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which 
will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

The City of Hastings ordains: 
    Section 1. The Code entitled "Code of Ordinances, City of Hastings, Michigan," published by 
Municipal Code Corporation, consisting of Chapters 1 through 90, each inclusive, is adopted. 
    Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before October 27, 1997, 
and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
    Section 3. The repeal provided for in Section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance 
or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
    Section 4. The following code was adopted by reference and incorporated in Code of the City of 
Hastings, Michigan. One copy of this code is on file in the city clerk's office: 
The Uniform Traffic Code for Cities, Townships and Villages, promulgated by the director of state 
police and published in the 1979 edition of the Michigan Administrative Code and amendments as 
published in the Quarterly Supplement No. 5 to the 1979 edition of the Michigan Administrative 
Code, in accordance with Act No. 62 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1956 (MCL 257.951 et seq.,

    Section 5. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any 
provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be 
punished by a fine not more than $500.00 or imprisonment for 90 days, or both. Each act of violation and 
each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty 
provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of 
any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to 
the penalty prescribed above, the city may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, 
injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
    Section 6. A person who violates any provision of the Code designated a municipal civil infraction is 
subject to a civil fine as provided in section 1-13 of the Code adopted by this ordinance. Repeat offenses 
shall be subject to such increased fines as provided in section 1-13 of the Code adopted by this 
ordinance. 
    Section 7. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in the form as to indicate the intention 
of the City Commission to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the 
Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
    Section 8. Ordinances adopted after October 27, 1997, that amend or refer to ordinances that have 
been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code. 
    Section 9. This ordinance shall become effective upon its adoption and publication as provided by 
City Charter.

the budget or the tax levy therefor. Should the Council fail to adopt a budget by the thirtieth day of 
June in any year, the budget proposal of the City Manager shall constitute a de facto budget for the 
City, until such time as the Council shall adopt a budget and an appropriation for all expenditures 
thereunder shall exist as though made by the Council.

no money shall be drawn from the treasury of the City, except in accordance with the budget in effect 
and the appropriation for such purpose, nor shall any obligation for the expenditure of money be 
incurred without an appropriation covering all payments which will be due under such obligation 
during the fiscal year. The Council, upon the written recommendation of the City Manager, may 
appropriate unappropriated funds or transfer any unencumbered appropriated balance, or any 
portion thereof, from any budget item or account, department, or agency to another. When any 
expenditure is to be made for a purpose to be financed by the proceeds of a bond issue or from 
special assessments, the Council shall make an appropriation of the proceeds of such bond issue or 
special assessment therefor.

less than anticipated, the Council may, by resolution, reduce appropriations, except amounts 
required for debt and interest charges, to such a degree as may be necessary to keep expenditures 
within the revenues of the City. Nothing herein shall imply, however, that the City is authorized to 
incur a deficit during any fiscal year. 
(d) ?Within thirty (30) days following the end of each fiscal year, the Clerk/Treasurer shall file with the 
Council a schedule of all encumbrances upon the budget appropriations existing at the end of the 
fiscal year, with recommendations thereon, and the Council shall provide for the payment of such

enlarge, and for the purchase of equipment of any type needed for the operation or services of the 
City.

resolution or, from time to time during the fiscal year, from available funds, from whatever source 
derived, which are not required for other appropriations or obligations of the City. Such accounts

part thereof. However, all accounts and existing balances therein shall remain subject to annual 
appropriations as contemplated by the Uniform Budgeting and Accounting Act [Act No. 2 of the 
Public Acts of Michigan of 1968 (MCL 141.421 et seq., MSA 5.3228(21) et seq.)].

Council to any other special account or to the general fund of the City.

(a) hereof, shall be expended only for the purpose provided in the ordinance establishing any such

any unencumbered operating appropriation balance, or any portion thereof, from one city operating 
fund or account to another, upon the written recommendation of the City Manager and the approval 
of the Council. The balance in any budget appropriation, except such as may be appropriated for the

revert to the general fund and shall be subject to the allocations made in the budget of the next fiscal 
year.

Clerk/Treasurer.

by the City Manager, pursuant to warrants therefor signed by the City Manager after the approval of 
such expenditures by the Council. Each such check shall specify the fund and the account from

Council with a monthly report detailing the status of all such deposits or other investments.

the Council with supporting data concerning the authority for or basis of such claim and the budget fund 
or account against which it is to be charged, if allowed.

property, by reason of the negligence of the City, its officers or employees, or by reason of any 
defective highway, public work, public service improvement, or facility of the City, or by reason of any

of any of the reasons or circumstances aforesaid, unless brought within the period limited by law nor 
unless the claim was first presented to the City Manager in writing and under oath, setting forth 
particularly the nature and extent of such injury and the amount of damages claimed. The City 
Manager shall refer the claim to the Council, and the Council shall be given an opportunity to act 
thereon, either by allowing or refusing to allow the claim, or by otherwise settling the claim. 
(c) ?It shall be a sufficient bar and answer in any court to any action or proceeding for the collection of 
any demand or claim against the City, under this Section, that the notice of injury and the verified 
proof of claim, as in this Section required, were not presented and filed within the time and in the 
manner as herein provided.

Sec. 10-32. - Purpose. 
    In the development and execution of this article, it is recognized that there are some uses that, 
because of their very nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when one 
or more of them are located in near proximity to a residence, dwelling place, day care facility, church, 
school or public park or when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby 
having a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. Regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that the 
adverse effects of such uses will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding 
neighborhood. The provisions of this article are intended to prevent deterioration or blighting of 
surrounding neighborhoods. In regulating adult businesses, it is the purpose of this article to promote the 
health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform 
regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of adult businesses within the city.

state, or another state within the United States, or the federal government, and who practices 
within the established limits of his or her license, and who administers a massage in the normal 
course of his or her duties; provided, however, that such barber, manicurist, beautician or 
cosmetologist shall perform a massage only upon the face, hands, feet, or neck of another 
person, and is performing the practice of massage for beautifying or cosmetic purposes only; or 
(4) ?Myomassaologists who meet the following criteria: 
a. ?Proof of graduation from a school of massage licensed by the State of Michigan or current 
licensure by another state with equivalent standards of 500 class hours of education from a 
state licensed school in the United States; and

(1) ?The parcel upon which the use is intended is located outside a 200-foot radius of any parcel 
upon which a protected use is located unless the only protected use within such 200-foot radius 
is a public park and the city council adopts a resolution waiving this requirement for such public 
park, in which case the planning commission may waive this requirement; and 
(2) ?The use is not located within a 200-foot radius of one other such use except that such 
restriction may be waived by the planning commission if all of the following findings are made:

results in information being withheld. If the cable operator requests confidentiality and the request is 
denied, where the cable operator is proposing a rate increase, it may withdraw the proposal, in which

request. It may grant, deny or condition a request. The requesting party or the cable operator may

reasonably related to the noncommercial use of such product, service, trademark or brand 
name on the program. 
(d) ?Any user providing access programming shall be required to advise the city whether the user's 
programs involve the use of copyrighted material or material subject to other ownership or royalty

(g) ?All users of access time assume complete responsibility for the content of the programming 
provided. Any disputes that arise concerning the programming shall be resolved between the user, 
the complaining party and where applicable, the franchise granting authority. The city undertakes no 
responsibility to the user or any other party for any liabilities that may arise as a consequence of 
presentation of access programming, and users shall indemnify and hold the city harmless for all 
liability of any kind whatsoever including costs of legal defense arising from the presentation of 
programming provided by the user. Users are cautioned, therefore, to be aware of applicable state 
and federal laws.

is a time conflict and equipment/studio is not available. 
(c) ?If a user fails to use the equipment reserved without 24-hour notice of cancellation, that user may be 
prohibited from use of that facility and/or equipment for a period of 30 days. Users showing up 30 
minutes late for use of reserved equipment without notification effectively relinquish their reservation, 
which may then be available to other users. Users may also be prohibited from use of that equipment 
for a period of 30 days. Repeated offenses may result in indefinite suspension. 
(d) ?Users will sign the facility request form agreeing to be financially responsible for damage or loss of 
equipment during the period it is reserved in their name. Lost equipment must be replaced with 
equivalent equipment within seven days. Failure to comply within this time period will result in 
suspension from use of all facilities until the lost item has been replaced. The user will not be 
responsible for normal wear and tear of equipment. 
(e) ?Portable equipment will be checked out and in by the cable access committee or its designated 
agent. Equipment will be thoroughly examined both at checkout and return to determine the 
condition of the equipment at that time. Users should allow time in their production planning for this 
procedure.

Sec. 46-40. - Density relations. 
    For the purpose of this article, subdivisions shall be classified as complete utility, partial utility, 
potential utility, or private service subdivisions. To ensure the economical and sound extension of utility 
services, to avoid premature concentrations of population and for reasons of health and sanitation, the 
minimum required area of each lot shall increase as the availability of public services decreases. In areas 
beyond the city limits, the zoning districts and regulations therefor shall apply except where greater 
restrictions are imposed by township or county regulations. This article may impose greater lot sizes than 
required by the zoning ordinance, chapter 90 of this Code, but shall not decrease the minimum of the 
zoning ordinance. Minor subdivisions in all zones need only conform to or exceed the minimums set in 
the zoning ordinance except when located upon a major or collector street wherein the provisions of 
section 46-191(2) shall apply. 
(1) ?Complete utility subdivision. A complete utility subdivision shall be located only in a primary or 
industrial service area. At least 50 percent of all lots in a major subdivision shall exceed the 
minimum lot width and lot area designated by the zoning ordinance by at least six percent. 
Another 25 percent of all lots shall exceed the minimum lot width and area by at least 12 
percent. Corner lots shall be at least 12 percent larger than the minimum zoning requirements. 
(2) ?Partial or potential utility subdivision in a primary service area. A partial or potential utility 
subdivision in a primary service area shall only be permitted where the city cannot physically 
provide public water or public sanitary sewers at the time of platting. A partial or potential utility 
subdivision is prohibited in a primary service area where utilities are reasonably available or 
where the city arranges to make them reasonably available. The following density controls shall 
apply where such full utilities are not supplied: 
a. ?The plat may conform to the provisions of subsection (1) of this section provided the owner 
formally agrees to sell only every other lot in the plat until all utilities are installed; or 
b. ?Where one such utility is installed, the owner may sell all lots without restriction provided all 
lots exceed the zoning lot width and area requirements by at least 25 percent; or 
c. ?Where no such utilities are installed, the owner may sell all lots without restriction provided 
all lots exceed the zoning lot width and area by at least 50 percent. 
(3) ?Partial or potential utility subdivision in a secondary service area. A potential utility subdivision 
located in a secondary service area is prohibited where a public water system or public sanitary 
sewer system is reasonably available or where the city arranges to make them reasonably 
available. In a partial utility subdivision the minimum lot area shall be 15,000 square feet, 
provided that 50 percent of all lots shall be six percent greater than the minimum and 25 percent 
of all lots shall be 12 percent greater than the minimum. In a potential utility subdivision the 
minimum lot width shall be 125 feet, and the minimum lot area shall be 18,700 square feet. 
(4) ?Private service subdivision. The minimum width of lots at the building line in a private service 
subdivision shall be 150 feet, and the minimum lot area shall be 44,000 square feet.

variances on traffic conditions, public health and safety in the vicinity. 
(c) ?No variance shall be granted unless the board finds that all of the following conditions exist: 
(1) ?There are special circumstances or conditions affecting said property such that the strict 
application of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of 
his land. 
(2) ?The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of 
the applicant.

Sec. 46-143. - Review. 
    There are four stages of approval for a preliminary plat: preliminary approval by the planning 
commission; tentative approval by the council; tentative approval by responsible county and state 
agencies; and final approval by the council. 
(1) ?Preliminary approval. With the applicant in attendance, the commission shall consider the 
preliminary plat and the recommendations of the director, assessor and planner, and shall 
require any such changes or modifications to be made to the plat as are necessary to comply 
with the provisions of this article and shall return the plat to the subdivider for compliance. If the 
preliminary plat as originally submitted, or as changed or modified as required by the 
commission, meets the requirements and intent of this article, the commission shall give it 
preliminary approval. 
(2) ?Tentative approval. The preliminary plat shall then be referred to the council for tentative 
approval. The applicant shall submit plans of sewer, water, storm drains, streets, street profiles, 
and other required improvements for approval by the director. Failure to submit such plans in a 
complete state, satisfactory to the director or council, shall be cause for disapproval or for 
nullification of the application unless further action can still be taken within the aforesaid 90-day 
time limit. Upon approval of such plans the council may grant tentative approval of the plat. 
Upon tentative approval the city clerk/treasurer shall affix his signature to the plat with the 
notation that it has received tentative approval. The plat shall then be returned to the subdivider 
for compliance with final approval requirements. 
(3) ?Tentative guarantees. Tentative approval by the council shall give the applicant the following 
rights for a one-year period from the date of approval: 
a. ?That the general terms and conditions under which the tentative approval was granted will

Sec. 46-144. - Final approval. 
    Upon receipt of approval from the agencies involved, referred to in section 46-143, the council may 
grant final approval of the preliminary plat. If changes have been recommended by any agency, the plat 
shall be reviewed by the commission with the applicant in attendance. The plat shall be changed by the 
applicant to conform to the requirement or any variation thereto deemed proper by the commission prior 
to final approval by the council. Where such changes result in changes to the final plans for 
improvements, amended plans shall be prepared and submitted to the director for approval by the 
council. 
(1) ?Final guarantees. Final approval for the preliminary plat by the city shall give the applicant the 
following rights for a two-year period from the date of approval: 
a. ?That the general terms and conditions under which the final approval was granted will not 
be changed by the city. 
b. ?That the applicant may submit on or before the expiration date the whole or parts of the 
preliminary plat as a final plat in accordance with the land division act. 
(2) ?Improvements. Following final approval of the preliminary plat and final improvement plans, the 
subdivider may proceed in making arrangements with the city for the installation of streets, 
utilities and other improvements required in section 46-217 et seq. of this article and by the 
plans approved by the city. The subdivider's share of the cost of such improvements shall be 
borne in one of the following ways: 
a. ?By installation thereof in accordance with city specifications and inspection procedures. 
b. ?By payment therefor at the time such improvements are to be installed by the city or its 
agent. 
c. ?By payment at a later date in a lump sum, in installments, or by assessments, as may be 
agreed upon, in which case payment shall be assured either by the posting by the 
subdivider of a surety bond in favor of the city and acceptable by it sufficient in amount to 
cover the subdivider's share of the cost of the improvements or by suitable contract 
between the subdivider and the city to insure performance of any obligations of the 
proprietor to make required improvements. 
(3) ?Improvement inspections. No improvements shall be installed, covered up or connected to 
existing systems prior to the site inspection and approval of all locations and installations by the 
director or by appropriate county, state or utility company inspectors. 
(4) ?Improvement sureties, performance guarantees, agreements and fees. Prior to the installation 
of any improvements, streets or utilities, the subdivider shall submit and have approved all 
required sureties, performance bonds, maintenance guarantees or other agreements required 
by this article or by the regulations of the city. The council shall determine appropriate 
inspection fees to defray the costs of site inspections, which fees shall be paid to the city

Chapter 51 - MEDICAL MARIHUANA 


ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 


Sec. 51-1. - Purpose. 
    The voters of the state of Michigan adopted the Medical Marihuana Act, being Public Act 2008, 
Initiated Law 1, MCL 333.26421 et seq., which became effective on December 4, 2008. That statute fails 
to regulate many aspects associated with the possession and use of medical marihuana. 
    The City Council finds that: 
(1) ?There are negative impacts associated with the use and dispensing of marihuana (including 
medical marihuana) which can include burglaries, robberies, violence, increased vandalism, 
illegal sales of marihuana, and use of marihuana by minors and other persons without medical 
need; to best facilitate the provision of public safety services, regulating such activities and 
being advised as to their location is in the public interest; and 
(2) ?The unregulated cultivation, distribution or processing of medical marihuana may adversely 
impact areas adjacent to such medical marihuana activities including increased incidents of 
public violence and undermining City efforts to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of the 
residents and property owners of the City and the public at large; and, 
(3) ?Cultivating and processing medical marihuana in a single-family dwelling unit will often require 
enhanced electrical and other services. To ensure that such services are provided in a safe 
manner consistent with legal requirements, compliance with building, fire and similar codes for 
such activities is necessary.

an adjourned date thereof, and shall consider any objections thereto. The council may correct the roll as 
to any assessment or description of any lot or parcel of land or other errors appearing therein. Any 
changes made in such roll shall be noted in the council's minutes of its proceedings. After such hearing 
and review, the council may confirm by resolution such special assessment roll with such correction as it

Sec. 70-85. - Special assessments to constitute lien from date of confirmation of roll.

parcels of land assessed and until paid shall be a charge against the respective owners of the 
several lots or parcels of land and a debt to the city from the persons to whom they are assessed. 
Such lien shall be of the same character and effect as the lien created by the Charter for city taxes 
and shall include accrued interest and penalties. No judgment or decree nor any act of the council 
vacating a special assessment shall destroy or impair the lien of the city upon the premises 
assessed for such amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against the same, or as 
by a regular mode of proceeding might be lawfully assessed thereon. 
(b) ?All special assessments, although constituting a lien upon confirmation of the special assessment 
roll, shall not become due and payable until completion of the work or in annual installments not to 
exceed ten in number as the council may determine at the time of confirmation, and if in annual 
installments the council shall determine the first installment to be due on completion of the project, or

payments may be made thereon. He may mail statements of the special assessments to the respective 
owners, as indicated by the records of the assessor, of the several lots and parcels of land assessed, 
stating the amount of the assessment and the manner in which it may be paid; however, failure to make 
any such statement shall not invalidate the assessment or entitle the owner to an extension of time within 
which to pay the assessment.

Sec. 70-87. - Time within which assessment may be paid without interest or penalty; installment

the end of the 60-day period, the city clerk/treasurer shall transmit such roll to the assessor with all 
payments upon assessments noted thereon. The assessor shall then divide any remaining balance of 
each assessment until such number of equal installments as shall have been fixed by the council (not

assessor shall reduce the number of installments so that each installment shall be above or as near to

confirmation of the roll to July 1 of the year in which such tax roll was made. Any fraction of the month 
shall be considered a full month. Thereafter, one installment shall be spread upon each annual tax roll, 
together with one year's interest upon all unpaid installments. When any annual installment shall have 
been prepaid, there shall be spread upon the tax roll for such year less the interest upon all unpaid 
installments. 
(Code 1970, § 13.123) 


Sec. 70-89. - Collection of installment payments. 
    After each installment has been placed on the tax rolls, it shall be collected by the city clerk/treasurer

Any person desiring to pay such installment in advance shall first secure the proper statement from the 
assessor to permit the city clerk/treasurer to compute the amount to be paid. The city clerk/treasurer shall 
report to the assessor all advance payments on installments so that the assessor shall have such 
information before spreading installments on the next city tax roll.

Sec. 70-91. - Certification of total cost of improvement. 
    Upon completion of an improvement and the payment of the cost, the city manager shall certify to 
the council the total cost of the improvement together with the amount of the original roll for the 
improvement. 
(Code 1970, § 13.126) 


Sec. 70-92. - Insufficiency of assessment. 
    Should the assessment in any special assessment roll, including the amount assigned to the city at 
large, prove insufficient for any reason to pay the cost of the improvement for which they were made, the 
council shall make additional assessments against the city and the several lots and parcels of land in the 
same ratio as the original assessments to supply the deficiency; but the total amount assessed shall not 
exceed the value of benefits received by any lot or parcel of land. Should the assessments levied prove 
larger than necessary by five percent or less, the council may place the excess in the city treasury. 
Should the excess be more than five percent, the same shall be refunded pro rata according to 
assessments. In either case, the council may provide by resolution that the amount of any such excess 
may be allowed as a credit upon the last installment where such installment still remains unpaid at the 
time the final cost of the improvement is determined. 
(Code 1970, § 13.127) 


Sec. 70-93. - Invalid or defective assessments; reassessment. 
    Whenever the council shall deem any special assessment invalid or defective for any reason 
whatever, or if any court of competent jurisdiction shall have adjudged such assessment to be illegal for 
any reason whatsoever, in whole or in part, the council shall have power to cause a new assessment to 
be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was made, whether the improvement or 
any part has been completed or not, or whether any part of the assessment has been collected or not. All 
proceeds on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be made in the same manner as 
provided for in the original assessment, except it shall not be necessary for the council to again determine 
the necessity of the improvement or to hold a hearing thereon. If any portion of the original assessment 
shall have been collected and not refunded, it shall be applied upon the reassessment and the 
reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied. If more than the amount reassessed shall have 
been collected, the balance shall be refunded to the person making such payment. 
(Code 1970, § 13.129) 


Sec. 70-94. - Collection of delinquent assessments. 
    In addition to any other remedies and without impairing the lien therefor, any delinquent special 
assessment, together with interest and penalties, may be collected in an action in assumpsit in the name 
of the city against the person assessed in any court having jurisdiction of the amount. If in any such action 
it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities or informalities the assessment has not been properly 
made against the defendant or upon the premises sought to be changed, the court may, nevertheless, on 
satisfactory proof that expense has been incurred by the city that is a proper charge against defendant or 
the premises in question, render judgment for the amount properly chargeable against such defendant or 
upon such premises.

is a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 90 days or a fine of not more than 
$100.00, or both, and will result in the issuance of a 24-hour out-of-service order. 
(5) ?Refusal to submit to breath analysis; misdemeanor. A person who was operating a commercial 
motor vehicle and who refuses to submit to a preliminary chemical breath analysis upon a peace 
officer's lawful request is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 90

advisement of rights; collection of urine or breath samples; blood withdrawn for post-accident 
medical treatment; admissibility of test results; withdrawal of blood from deceased driver; results of 
test to law enforcement agency. The following provisions apply with respect to chemical tests and

(a) ?The amount of alcohol or presence of a controlled substance or both in a driver's blood or urine 
or the amount of alcohol in a person's breath at the time alleged as shown by chemical analysis 
of the person's blood, urine or breath is admissible into evidence in any civil or criminal 
proceeding. 
(b) ?A person arrested for a crime described in section 5.15c(1)(a) shall be advised of all of the 
following: 
(i) ?If he takes a chemical test of his blood, urine or breath administered at the request of a 
peace officer, he has the right to demand that a person of his own choosing administer one 
of the chemical tests. 
(ii) ?The results of the test are admissible in a judicial proceeding as provided under the act 
and will be considered with other competent evidence in determining the defendant's 
innocence or guilt. 
(iii) ?He is responsible for obtaining a chemical analysis of a test sample obtained pursuant to 
his own request.

1978 (MCL 333.16215, MSA 14.15(16215)), as amended, qualified to withdraw blood and 
acting in a medical environment, may withdraw blood at a peace officer's request to determine 
the amount of alcohol or presence of a controlled substance or both in the person's blood, as 
provided in this subsection. Liability for a crime or civil damages predicated on the act of 
withdrawing or analyzing blood and related procedures does not attach to a licensed physician 
or individual operating under the delegation of a licensed physician who withdraws or analyzes 
blood or assists in the withdrawal or analysis in accordance with this subsection, unless the 
withdrawal or analysis is performed in a negligent manner. 
(d) ?A chemical test described in this subsection shall be administered at the request of a peace 
officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person has committed a crime described in 
section 5.15c(1)(a). A person who takes a chemical test administered at a peace officer's 
request, as provided in this section, shall be given a reasonable opportunity to have a person of 
his own choosing administer one of the chemical tests described in this subsection within a 
reasonable time after his detention. The test results are admissible and shall be considered with 
other competent evidence in determining the defendant's innocence or guilt. If the person 
charged is administered a chemical test by a person of his own choosing, the person charged is 
responsible for obtaining a chemical analysis of the test sample. 
(e) ?If, after an accident, the driver of a vehicle involved in the accident is transported to a medical 
facility and a sample of the driver's blood is withdrawn at that time for medical treatment, the 
results of a chemical analysis of that sample are admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding to 
show the amount of alcohol or presence of a controlled substance, or both, in the person's 
blood at the time alleged, regardless of whether the person had been offered or had refused a 
chemical test. The medical facility or person performing the chemical analysis shall disclose the 
results of the analysis to the prosecuting attorney who requests the results for use in a criminal 
prosecution as provided in this subdivision. A medical facility or person disclosing information in 
compliance with this subsection is not civilly or criminally liable for making the disclosure. 
(f) ?If, after an accident, the driver of a vehicle involved in the accident is deceased, a sample of the 
decedent's blood shall be withdrawn in a manner directed by the medical examiner to determine 
the amount of alcohol or the presence of a controlled substance, or both, in the decedent's 
blood. The medical examiner shall give the results of the chemical analysis of the sample to the 
law enforcement agency investigating the accident, and that agency shall forward the results to 
the department of state police. 
(g) ?The department of state police shall promulgate uniform rules pursuant to the administrative 
procedures act of 1969, Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1969 (MCL 24.201 et 
seq., MSA 3.560(101) et seq.), as amended, for the administration of chemical tests for the 
purposes of this section. An instrument used for a preliminary chemical breath analysis may be 
used for a chemical test described in this subsection if approved under the rules promulgated by 
the department of state police. 
(7) ?Introduction of other competent evidence on issue of intoxication not precluded. The provisions of 
subsection (6) relating to chemical testing do not limit the introduction of any other competent 
evidence bearing upon the question of whether a person was impaired by, or under the influence of, 
intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a controlled 
substance or whether the person had an alcohol content of 0.10 grams or more per 100 milliliters of 
blood, per 210 liters of breath or per 67 milliliters of urine, or if the person is less than 21 years of 
age, whether the person had any bodily alcohol content within his body. As used in this section, the 
expression "any bodily alcohol content" means either of the following: 
(a) ?An alcohol content of not less than 0.02 grams or more than 0.07 grams per 100 milliliters of 
blood, per 210 liters of breath, or per 67 milliliters of urine. 
(b) ?Any presence of alcohol within a person's body resulting from the consumption of intoxicating 
liquor, other than consumption of intoxicating liquor as a part of a generally recognized religious 
service or ceremony. 
(8) ?Offender entitled to copy of test results upon written request; failure of prosecution to furnish as bar 
to admissibility into evidence. If a chemical test described in subsection (6) is administered, the test 
results shall be made available to the person charged or the person's attorney, upon written request 
to the prosecution, with a copy of the request filed with the court. The prosecution shall furnish the 
results at least two days before the day of the trial. The prosecution shall offer the test results as 
evidence in that trial. Failure to fully comply with the request bars the admission of the results into 
evidence by the prosecution. 
(9) ?Presumptions. Except in a prosecution relating solely to a violation of section 5.15(1)(b) or (4), the 
amount of alcohol in the driver's blood, breath or urine at the time alleged as shown by chemical 
analysis of the person's blood, breath or urine at the time alleged as shown by chemical analysis of 
the person's blood, breath or urine gives rise to the following presumptions: 
(a) ?If there were at the time 0.07 grams or less of alcohol per 100 milliliters of the defendant's 
blood, per 210 liters of the defendant's breath or per 67 milliliters of the defendant's urine, it is 
presumed that the defendant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was not impaired due to the 
consumption of intoxicating liquor and that the defendant was not under the influence of 
intoxicating liquor. 
(b) ?If there were at the time more than 0.07 grams but less than 0.10 grams of alcohol per 100 
milliliters of the defendant's blood, per 210 liters of the defendant's breath or per 67 milliliters of 
the defendant's urine, it is presumed that the defendant's ability to operate a vehicle was 
impaired within the provisions of section 5.15(3) due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor. 
(c) ?If there were at the time 0.10 grams or more of alcohol per 100 milliliters of the defendant's 
blood, per 210 liters of the defendant's breath or per 67 milliliters of the defendant's urine, it is 
presumed that the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. 
(10) ?Jury instruction as to effect of refusal to take test. A person's refusal to submit to a chemical test as 
provided in subsection (6) is admissible in a criminal prosecution for a crime described in section 
5.15c(1)(a) only to show that a test was offered to the defendant, but not as evidence in determining 
the defendant's innocence or guilt. The jury shall be instructed accordingly.

NOTES: 
1. ?The listed daily maximum and monthly average limits are the concentrations which may not be 
exceeded and at which enforcement begins. The surcharge threshold concentrations as 
specified in notes 2 though 4 below, are the concentrations above which surcharges may be 
imposed. Discharges exceeding the surcharge thresholds, but which are less than the daily 
maximum and monthly average limits (and which do not violate any other applicable prohibitions 
and limitations or requirements), are not violations of this chapter, but are subject to surcharges 
as provided by this division. All exceedances of applicable discharge prohibitions and limitations 
and all instances of noncompliance with applicable discharge requirements shall constitute a 
violation of this division, subject to applicable fines, penalties and other enforcement actions. In 
no event shall the imposition of a surcharge for a discharge which does not meet the applicable 
prohibitions, limitations or requirements be construed as authorizing the illegal discharge or 
otherwise excuse a violation of this division. 
2. ?Any discharge of BOD-5 in excess of 250 mg/l (monthly average) shall be subject to surcharge 
as provided by this division. 
3. ?Any discharge of phosphorous in excess of 7.5 mg/l (monthly average) shall be subject to 
surcharge as provided by this division. 
4. ?Any discharge of TSS in excess of 200 mg/l (monthly average) shall be subject to surcharge as 
provided by this division. 
5. ?Mercury has a Nondetect for both instantaneous maximum concentration and monthly average. 
Any discharge of mercury at or above the detection limit is a specific violation of this division. 
The detection limit shall be established pursuant to the procedure for determine of the method 
detection limit ("MDL") as set forth in section 3(a) of Appendix B of 40 CFR part 136. The MDL 
study used to determine the MDL shall be made available to the POTW immediately upon 
request. In no case may the detection limit exceed 0.2 ug/l, unless a higher detection limit is 
approved by the POTW because of sample matrix interference. Mercury sampling procedures, 
preservation and handling, and analytical protocol for compliance monitoring shall be in 
accordance with EPA method 245.1, unless other methods are approved in advance by the 
WWTP superintendent. 
(b) ?In addition to the limits per section 82-302(a), any discharge that, in the judgment of the 
superintendent, would contribute a significant amount of these substances, regardless of the 
mg/l concentration, shall be prohibited except by special discharge allocation under section 82-
305. 
(c) ?Solvent extractibles, including, without limitation, oil, greases, wax, or fat, whether emulsified or 
not, in excess of 100 mg/l (daily maximum or monthly average); or other substances that may

sewage will be required to provide satisfactory pretreatment to reduce the strength of the sewage to 
normal strength sewage or pay a surcharge determined by the relative concentration of BOD, SS, or 
other pollutant as compared to normal strength sewage if the system has the capacity to handle such 
sewage. 
(Code 1970, § 6.212; Ord. No. 345, §§ 1, 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-163. - Industrial customer to provide plant layout sketch. 
    A sketch of the plant buildings shall be made by the industrial customer, including a diagram of 
process and chemical storage areas. Location of any pretreatment equipment must be indicated, and 
floor drains located near process and storage areas must be noted manhole and sewer locations at the 
industry's point of discharge into the system must be included on the plant layout sketch. 
(Code 1970, § 6.213; Ord. No. 345, §§ 1, 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-164. - Treatment of spent concentrates and toxic waste; handling of sludges. 
    Spent concentrates shall be prevented from entering the system to prevent toxic wastes from 
upsetting the sewage treatment facility. Supervision and operation of the pretreatment equipment to treat 
spent concentrates, toxic wastes and high-strength organic wastes to an acceptable level as defined by 
the city is the responsibility of the industrial customer. All sludges generated by such treatment must be 
handled in an acceptable manner, as in a designated area of a sanitary landfill or by a licensed waste 
hauler. 
(Code 1970, § 6.214; Ord. No. 345, §§ 1, 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-165. - Protection of floor drains; secondary containment. 
    Adequate secondary containment or curbing shall be provided to protect all floor drains from 
accidental spills and discharges to the system. Such curbing should be sufficient to hold 150 percent of 
total process area tank volume. All floor drains within the containment area must be plugged and sealed. 
Spill-throughs or sumps within process areas must discharge to appropriate pretreatment tanks. 
Secondary containment shall be provided for storage tanks and chemical storage areas serviced by 
commercial haulers. 
(Code 1970, § 6.215; Ord. No. 345, §§ 1, 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-166. - Sampling vault or manhole. 
    If so directed by the city, an adequate sampling vault or manhole shall be provided at the industrial 
customer's expense in a fully accessible place for city personnel to obtain samples and flow 
measurement data. The complexity of the vault will vary with the sampling requirements the city 
determines necessary to protect the system and receiving streams. Should the city desire continual flow 
recording and 24-hour composite sampling, a more complex manhole would be mandatory, complete with 
100-volt AC electric service. Samples collected may be divided between the industrial customer and city 
for analysis if so desired by the industrial customer. 
(Code 1970, § 6.216; Ord. No. 345, §§ 1, 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-167. - Surveillance fee. 
    All costs for industrial waste monitoring incurred by the city shall be paid by the industrial customer. 
A yearly surveillance fee may be initiated to reduce some equipment costs or for maintenance of 
monitoring devices. If a graduated surveillance fee is deemed necessary to check industrial discharges, a 
factor may be incorporated to reduce the costs as industrial customer lowers its waste strength. 
(Code 1970, § 6.217; Ord. No. 345, §§ 1, 2, 4-22-02)

Sec. 82-193. - Purpose and policy. 
(a) ?This division sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect contributors into the wastewater 
collection and POTW for the city and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal 
laws including the Clean Water Act of 1977 (33 USC 1251 et seq.), and the General Pretreatment 
Regulations (40 CFR, part 403); Part 31 of Act 451 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1994. MCLA 
324.3101, et seq., as amended (Water Resources Protection) and the rules. Michigan Administrative 
Code, R 323.2301 et seq., as amended, promulgated pursuant to sections 3103, 3106 and 3109, of 
Part 31, of Act 451, of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1994, as amended. This division will implement 
federal, state and local pretreatment standards to control pollutants which pass through or interfere 
with treatment processes in POTW's or which may contaminate sewage sludge. The objectives of 
this division are: 
(1) ?To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will interfere with the operation of 
the POTW; 
(2) ?To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass through the POTW, 
inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with 
the POTW; 
(3) ?To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and sludges from the POTW; 
(4) ?To provide for equitable distribution of costs for the POTW; 
(5) ?To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of 
their employment and to protect the general public; 
(6) ?To ensure that the quality of the wastewater treatment plant sludge is maintained at a level 
which allows its use and disposal in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations; and 
(7) ?To enable the city to comply with its NPDES permit conditions, sludge use and disposal 
requirements and any other federal or state laws to which the POTW is subject. 
(b) ?This division provides for the regulation of direct and indirect contributors to the POTW through the 
issuance of permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement of general requirements 
for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities; requires user reporting, 
assumes the existing customer's capacity will not be preempted, and provides for the setting of fees 
for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein. 
(c) ?This division shall apply to the city and to persons outside the city who are, by contract or 
agreement with the city, users of the city POTW. Except as otherwise provided herein, the city 
manager of the city shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this division.

Sec. 82-226. - Monitoring, inspections, and surveillance. 
(a) ?In General. The superintendent and other authorized representatives of the city are authorized to 
carry out all inspections, surveillance, and monitoring procedures necessary to determine, 
independent of information supplied by users or industrial users, compliance or noncompliance with 
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements with this division and with other applicable laws 
and regulations. This authority includes without limitation, the authority: 
(1) ?To verify the completeness, accuracy and representatives of self-monitoring data submitted by 
users. 
(2) ?To determine compliance with the requirements of this division or with wastewater discharge 
permits. 
(3) ?To support enforcement actions taken by the POTW against noncompliant users. 
(4) ?To determine if users have corrected problems identified in previous inspections. 
(5) ?To identify which, and to what degree, users influence the quality of the POTW's influent, 
effluent and sludge quality. 
(6) ?To evaluate the impacts of the POTW's influent on its treatment processes and receiving 
streams. 
(7) ?To evaluate the need for revised local limits. 
(8) ?To maintain current data on each user. 
(9) ?To assess the adequacy of each users self-monitoring program and wastewater discharge 
permit. 
(10) ?To provide a basis for establishing sampling and monitoring requirements for users. 
(11) ?To evaluate the adequacy of each user's operation and maintenance activities on its 
pretreatment system. 
(12) ?To assess the potential for spills and/or slug discharge control measures, and evaluate the 
effectiveness of spill and slug discharge control measures. 
(13) ?To gather information for industrial user permit development. 
(14) ?To evaluate compliance with existing enforcement actions. 
(15) ?To require any user to submit one or more representative samples of the wastewater 
discharged or that the user proposes to discharge into the POTW. 
(b) ?Right of entry. The superintendent and other authorized representatives of the city bearing proper 
credentials and identification are authorized to enter an industrial user's premises to conduct 
inspection, surveillance and monitoring activities as necessary to determine compliance with this 
division, and in that regard shall have, without limitation, the following minimum authority: 
(1) ?To enter into any premises of any industrial user in which a discharge source, treatment 
system or activity is located or in which records are required to be kept as provided by this 
division, for the purpose of inspecting, observing, measuring, sampling and testing the 
wastewater discharge, removing samples of wastewater for analysis, and inspecting and 
making copies of required records. 
(2) ?To set up and maintain on the discharger's property such devices as are necessary to conduct 
sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and or metering operations, or to require the 
discharger to do so, at the discharger's sole expense. 
(3) ?To randomly sample and analyze the effluent from industrial users and conduct surveillance 
activities to identify occasional and continuing noncompliance with applicable standards and 
requirements. The POTW shall inspect and sample the effluent from each significant user at

    City representative entering the user's premises for purposes authorized by this division shall comply 
with the user's plant safety requirements regarding such matters as entry into confined spaces, use of 
safety glasses, and hearing protection requirements, as requested by the user. 
(c) ?Access without delay required. Users shall allow the POTW ready access at all reasonable times to 
all parts of the user's facility where wastewater governed by this division is created, handled, 
conveyed, treated or discharged, or where any production, manufacturing, fabrication, or storage 
area where pollutants regulated under this division could originate, be stored, or be discharge to the 
POTW, or where wastewater records are kept, for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records 
examination, or in the performance of any of the POTW's duties. If a user has security measures in 
force that would require proper identification and clearance before entry into the premises by the 
POTW, the user shall make necessary arrangements in advance with it's security guards so that 
upon presentation of suitable identification, authorized representatives of the POTW, or authorized 
state or federal personnel, will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing 
their specific responsibilities. 
(d) ?Refusal to allow entry. If a user refuses to permit access to an authorized POTW representative or 
to permit the representative to obtain, take, and remove samples or make copies of documents or 
undertake other authorized inspection, surveillance and monitoring activities as provided by this 
division, the superintendent may order the termination of the discharge of wastewater to the POTW; 
order the user to permit access within a time certain; issue the user a notice of violation of this 
section; or take other appropriate action as provided by this division and other applicable laws and 
regulations. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-227. - Orders. 
    The superintendent may issue an order after obtaining approval from the city manager to any user as 
determined to be appropriate under the circumstances, as provided by this section. 
(1) ?Service. An order shall be served on a user and shall contain the information as provided by 
section 82-230. However, orders to immediately cease and desist discharge, or to terminate 
sewer service, or other emergency orders where delay may endanger human health, the 
environment or the POTW, may be oral and may be served by telephone (to be followed within 
five days by written confirmation by the superintendent of the order). 
(2) ?Types of orders. The superintendent may issue the following types of orders: 
a. ?Order to immediately cease and desist. The superintendent may issue an order to cease 
and desist from discharging any wastewater, incompatible pollutant or discharge not in 
compliance with this division. The order shall have immediate effect if the actual or 
threatened discharge of pollutants to the system presents, or may present imminent or 
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare or persons, to the environment, or 
causes or may cause, interference or pass through. The superintendent shall implement 
whatever action is necessary to halt the illegal discharge. The user shall be assessed for 
any penalties, fines, charges, surcharges, expenses, or losses incurred due to the actual or 
threatened discharge of pollutants as provided by this division. 
b. ?Order to cease discharge within a time certain. The superintendent may issue an order to 
show cause why an order to cease and desist by a certain time and date should not be 
issued. The proposed time for remedial action shall be specified in the order to show 
cause. The order may also contain conditions as determined appropriate by the 
superintendent. In addition to other circumstances as determined appropriate by the 
superintendent, the failure to pay applicable permit fees or to comply with any term of a 
wastewater discharge permit or special agreement constitutes sufficient cause to issue an 
order under this section. 
c. ?Order to effect pretreatment. The superintendent may issue an order to show cause why a 
user should not be required to pretreat its discharge in accordance with this division. Any 
user subject to an order to pretreat shall prepare a plan to pretreat its discharges so that 
the discharge complies with the requirements of the order and this division. The plan shall 
be submitted to the superintendent within a reasonable period as specified by the order. 
The plan shall be prepared in accordance with good engineering practice and shall state 
whether construction is necessary, as well as identifying measures which can be 
completed without construction. The plan shall contain a schedule of compliance for 
completion of each of the various phases necessary to implement full pretreatment. This 
schedule of compliance must be approved by an order of the superintendent. The schedule 
of compliance shall consist of one or more remedial measures, including enforceable 
timetables for a sequence of actions or operations leading to compliance with an effluent 
standard, or other prohibition or standard. The following steps or phases shall be included 
in the schedule of compliance as determined necessary by the superintendent: 
1. ?Retain a qualified engineer and/or consultant; 
2. ?Obtain an engineering or scientific investigation or surveys deemed necessary; 
3. ?Prepare and submit a preliminary plan to achieve pretreatment; 
4. ?Prepare plans and specifications, working drawings, or other engineering or 
architectural documents which may be necessary to effect pretreatment; 
5. ?Establish a time to let any contract necessary for any construction; 
6. ?Establish completion time for any construction necessary; 
7. ?Establish a time limit for complete, full pretreatment pursuant to the final order; and 
8. ?In the event a phase or unit of construction or implementation may be effected 
independently of another phase or unit, establish separate time tables for the phases 
or units. 
d. ?Order to perform affirmative action. The superintendent may issue an order requiring a 
user to perform any action required under this division, including, without limitation, 
requiring a user to submit samples; to install sampling, metering, and monitoring 
equipment; to submit reports; to permit access for inspection, sampling, testing, monitoring 
and investigation; to reduce or eliminate a discharge or pollutants in discharge; or to pay 
permit fees or other applicable charges. 
e. ?Order to terminate sewer service. The superintendent may issue an order to terminate the 
sewer services of user, including physical blockage of the user's sewer connection, for 
reasons including, without limitation, the following: 
1. ?A discharge which violates any general or specified discharge prohibition, including 
any pretreatment standard or requirement, or which reasonably appears to present an 
imminent endangerment to human health, the environment or the POTW; 
2. ?Failure of a user to notify the POTW of any discharge as described in subsection e.1 
of this section, of which the user was aware or reasonably should have been aware; 
3. ?Failure of a user to sample, monitor, pretreat or report, or failure to install monitoring 
or pretreatment facilities, as required by an order of the superintendent; 
4. ?A knowing, willful violation, of any term, condition, or requirement of an order, permit, 
or special agreement; or 
5. ?A negligent violation of any major term, condition, or requirement of an order, permit, 
or special agreement. For purposes of this section, a "major" term, condition or 
requirement is defined as one whose violation is reasonably likely to endanger human 
health, the environment or the POTW. 
f. ?Order to show cause. The superintendent may issue an order requiring a user to appear 
and explain any noncompliance with the requirements of this division or permit, order, 
decision, or determination promulgated, issued or made under this division, and to show 
cause why more severe enforcement actions again the user should not go forward. A show 
cause hearing shall be held within ten days after the order to show cause was issued, as 
follows: 
1. ?The hearing shall be conducted and evidence shall be taken by the superintendent or 
by an authorized representative designated by the superintendent. Notice of the 
hearing shall be provided to require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and 
the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in the hearing. If the 
hearing is conducted by an authorized representative of the superintendent, the 
superintendent shall thereafter be provided with a written report of the hearing, 
including transcripts, any other evidence, and any recommendations to the 
superintendent for further action. 
2. ?Any testimony taken at the hearing shall be under oath and recorded. A copy of the 
transcript of the hearing shall be made available at cost to any person upon payment 
of applicable charges for the transcript. 
3. ?After reviewing the evidence taken at the hearing, the superintendent shall decide 
whether further enforcement action is required and, if so, the nature and extent of that 
further action, including, without limitation, the issuance of any order or imposition of 
any fines, fees, surcharges or penalties, as authorized by this division. 
(3) ?Immediate response to order by user. Any user issued an order by the superintendent as 
provided by this section to immediately suspend its discharge to the POTW shall immediately 
stop or eliminate the discharge using whatever means are necessary to do so, or take any other 
action as required by the order. If the user fails to comply voluntarily with the order to 
immediately suspend discharge, the city shall take action determined necessary as authorized 
by this division, including immediate suspension of water service and/or severance of the sewer 
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW or endangerment to public health, 
safety, or the environment. The superintendent many reinstate the wastewater treatment 
service upon satisfactory proof or other demonstration by the user that the noncomplying 
discharge has been eliminated or will not reoccur. A detailed written statement submitted by the 
user describing the causes of noncomply discharge and the measures taken to prevent any 
further occurrence shall be submitted to the superintendent within 15 days of the occurrence. 
(4) ?Noncompliance due to factors beyond user's control. If noncompliance with an order is 
unintentional and temporary and due to factors beyond a reasonable control of a user, and the 
user can demonstrate the conditions necessary for demonstration of an upset as provided by 
section 82-234, the superintendent may modify the order or take other action as determined 
appropriate. However, a user shall not be relieved of liability for noncompliance with an order to 
the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed or inadequate treatment facilities, 
lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation. 
(5) ?Amendment suspension and revocation orders. An order shall be subject to amendment, 
suspension, or revocation as determined appropriate by the superintendent. Notice of the 
amendment, suspension, or revocation shall be served upon the user in the same manner as 
notice was provided for the original order. 
An amendment, suspension, or revocation of an order shall be subject to the same procedures 
for review and appeal as the original issuance of the order as provided by this article in § 82-
235 et seq. 
(6) ?Consent orders. The superintendent may enter into a consent order with a user to resolve 
disputed claims and address identified and potential deficiency's in the user's compliance 
status. The consent order shall be in the form of an agreement and may contain appropriate 
provisions, including, without limitation, compliance schedules and stipulated fines and remedial 
actions. 
(7) ?POTW authority to require financial assurances. The POTW may require a noncompliant 
industrial user to post a performance bond (or other form of surety acceptable to the POTW) 
sufficient to cover expenses that might reasonably be incurred as a result of future violations. 
Industrial users that have in the prior two years been responsible for causing interference or 
pass through at the POTW may be required to obtain liability insurance sufficient to cover the 
reasonable costs of responding or restoring the POTW in the event of a second such incident. 
These requirements may also be made conditions of an industrial user's permit.

Sec. 82-229. - Administrative fines. 
    The following shall be considered in determining the nature of a violation and the fine to be imposed 
in accordance with that violation. 
(1) ?If the superintendent determines that any person has violated, or is violating, any provision of 
this division, or any permit, order, decision or determination promulgated, issues, or made under 
this division, the superintendent may assess an administrative fine in an amount not to exceed 
$500.00 per violation. Each day on which a violation of this division shall occur or continue is a 
separate and distinct violation. The fine as authorized by this section may be assessed in 
addition to any other charge fee, surcharge, penalty, or fine authorized or levied under this 
division. Fines assessed by the superintendent under this section shall be subject to the prior 
approval of the city manager. 
(2) ?If a fine is assessed under this section, the superintendent shall cause a written notice of 
assessment to be served on the violator as provided by section 82-230. 
(3) ?In determining the amount of the fine, the superintendent shall consider the type, nature, 
severity, frequency, duration, preventability, potential and actual effect, and economic benefit to 
the violator (such as delayed or avoided cost or competitive advantage) of a violation and the 
violator's recalcitrance or efforts to comply. A violator shall bear the burden of demonstrating the 
presence and degree of any mitigating factors to be considered by the superintendent in 
determining the amount of a fine. However, mitigating factors shall not be considered unless the 
superintendent determines that the violator has made all good faith efforts to correct and 
terminate all violations. The fact that a fine may cause severe financial damage or put a violator 
out of business shall not be determinative of the amount of the fine. 
(4) ?Any person aggrieved by the assessment of an administrative fine under this section may 
request an informal hearing before the superintendent or a formal hearing before the city 
council. 
(5) ?Fines assessed by the superintendent under this section which have not been paid in full within 
30 days of receipt of the notice of assessment shall be added to the next scheduled service bill

(c) ?The superintendent may require any nonsignificant industrial user to obtain a permit to discharge to 
the POTW, subject to such terms and conditions as are determined necessary and appropriate by 
the WWTP to achieve the purposes, policies and objectives of this chapter. A discharge permit 
issued to a nonsignificant industrial user may contain, but shall not be required to contain, any of the 
terms and conditions that would apply to a discharge permit issued to a significant industrial user as 
provided by this article, including, but not limited to, discharge limitations, and requirements 
regarding sampling and monitoring, pretreatment, pollution reduction plans, and best management 
practices, to comply with the general and specific discharge prohibitions of this chapter. Failure to 
comply with a permit issued under this subsection constitutes a violation of this chapter. In no case 
shall a permit issued to a nonsignificant industrial user be construed as authorizing the illegal 
discharge or otherwise excuse a violation of this chapter. To the extent determined appropriate by 
the superintendent on a case-by-case basis, permits issued under this subsection shall be subject to 
provisions otherwise applicable to permits for significant industrial users. However, all nonsignificant 
industrial user permits are nontransferable, and are subject to the permit fee and permit appeals 
provisions of this chapter.

Notes: 
1. ?The listed daily maximum and monthly average limits are the concentrations which may not be 
exceeded and at which enforcement begins. The surcharge threshold concentrations as 
specified in notes 2. though 4. below, are the concentrations above which surcharges may be 
imposed. Discharges exceeding the surcharge thresholds, but which are less than the daily 
maximum and monthly average limits (and which do not violate any other applicable prohibitions 
and limitations or requirements), are not violations of this chapter, but are subject to surcharges 
as provided by this division. All exceedances of applicable discharge prohibitions and limitations 
and all instances of noncompliance with applicable discharge requirements shall constitute a 
violation of this division, subject to applicable fines, penalties and other enforcement actions. In 
no event shall the imposition of a surcharge for a discharge which does not meet the applicable 
prohibitions, limitations or requirements be construed as authorizing the illegal discharge or 
otherwise excuse a violation of this division. 
2. ?Any discharge of BOD-5 in excess of 250 mg/l (monthly average) shall be subject to surcharge 
as provided by this division. 
3. ?Any discharge of phosphorous in excess of 7.5 mg/l (monthly average) shall be subject to 
surcharge as provided by this division. 
4. ?Any discharge of TSS in excess of 200 mg/l (monthly average) shall be subject to surcharge as 
provided by this division. 
5. ?Mercury has a nondetect for both instantaneous maximum concentration and monthly average. 
Any discharge of mercury at or above the detection limit is a specific violation of this division. 
The detection limit shall be established pursuant to the procedure for determine of the method 
detection limit ("MDL") as set forth in section 3(a) of Appendix B of 40 CFR part 136. The MDL 
study used to determine the MDL shall be made available to the POTW immediately upon 
request. In no case may the detection limit exceed 0.2 ug/l, unless a higher detection limit is 
approved by the POTW because of sample matrix interference. Mercury sampling procedures, 
preservation and handling, and analytical protocol for compliance monitoring shall be in 
accordance with EPA method 245.1, unless other methods are approved in advance by the 
WWTP superintendent. 
(b) ?In addition to the limits per section 82-302(a), any discharge that, in the judgment of the 
superintendent, would contribute a significant amount of these substances, regardless of the mg/l 
concentration, shall be prohibited except by special discharge allocation under section 82-305. 
(c) ?Solvent extractibles, including, without limitation, oil, greases, wax, or fat, whether emulsified or not, 
in excess of 100 mg/l (daily maximum or monthly average); or other substances that may solidify or 
become viscous (with a viscosity of 110 percent of water) at temperatures between 32 degrees 
Fahrenheit and 150 degrees Fahrenheit in amounts that may cause obstruction to the flow in sewers 
or other interference with the operation of the POTW. 
(d) ?Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.5 or greater than 9.5 (instantaneous minimum or maximum 
limitation), or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage of hazard 
to structures, equipment, and/or personnel of the POTW. 
(e) ?Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in 
interference, but in no case heat in such quantities that the temperature at the POTW treatment plan 
exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Centigrade). No discharge to the POTW shall have a 
temperature less than 32 degrees Fahrenheit or greater than 150 degrees Fahrenheit. 
(f) ?Any liquids, solids or gases which, by reason of their nature or quantity, may either alone or by 
interaction with other substances create a fire or explosion hazard or be injurious in any other way to 
the POTW or to the operation of the POTW, including, without limitation, waste streams with a closed 
cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit 60 degrees Centigrade) using the test methods 
specified in 40 CFR 261.21. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, 
naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, 
perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides, and sulfides, and any other substances which may 
create a fire or explosion hazard or otherwise be injurious to the system. 
(g) ?Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or otherwise result 
in interference with the operation of the POTW such as, but not limited to, grease, garbage with 
particles greater than one-half inch in any dimension; animal guts or tissues; paunch manure; bones; 
hair; hides or fleshings; entrails; whole blood; feathers; ashes; cinders; sand; spent lime; stone or 
marble dust; metal; glass; straw; shavings; grass clippings; rags; spent grains; spent hops; 
wastepaper; wood; plastics; gas; tar; asphalt residues; residues from refining or processing of fuel or 
lubricating oil; mud; or glass grinding or polishing wastes. 
(h) ?Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with 
other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to 
humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to exceed the 
limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be 
limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to section 307(a) of the Act. 
(i) ?Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which either singly or by interaction with other 
wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into 
the sewers for maintenance and repair. 
(j) ?Any pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors or fumes within the POTW in a 
quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. 
(k) ?Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW such as 
residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse, or otherwise interfere with 
the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to 
be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under 
section 405 of the Act; under the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) (including Title II, more 
commonly referred to as RCRA, and including state regulations contained in state sludge 
management plan prepared pursuant to subtitle D of the SWDA); the Clean Air Act; the Toxic 
Substances Control Act; the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act; or any more 
stringent state of local regulations, as applicable.

standards. 
(m) ?Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment process, such as, but not 
limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions. 
(n) ?Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc) released at a flow rate and/or 
pollutant concentration (including a slug load) which will cause interference with the POTW. In no 
case shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain concentration or qualities of pollutants that exceed 
for any time period longer than 15 minutes more than 5 times the user's average 24-hour 
concentration, quantities, or flow during normal operation. 
(o) ?Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of a half-life or concentration that 
may exceed limits established by applicable state or federal regulations. 
(p) ?Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will 
cause interference or pass through. 
(q) ?Trucked or hauled pollutants, except those introduced into the system at discharge points 
designated by the POTW, subject to the prior approval of the superintendent and issuance of a 
wastewater discharge permit. 
(1) ?The superintendent shall determine whether to allow the discharge of trucked or hauled 
pollutants based on the particular nature or quantity of the proposed discharge in accordance 
with the discharge prohibitions, limitations and requirements provided by this division. 
(2) ?The superintendent may impose any condition on the discharge determined necessary to 
ensure compliance with this division, including, without limitation, conditions regarding the time, 
place, and manner of discharge, restrictions on the quantity and quality of the discharge, and 
sampling requirements. 
(3) ?The discharge shall not commence without prior notice to, and authorization from, the 
superintendent. 
(4) ?The permittee's discharge of hauled wastes shall be subject to sampling at their expense, 
either by the POTW or by the permittee, at any time, including, without limitation, prior to and 
during discharge. The superintendent may require the permittee to refrain from, or suspend, 
discharging until the sample analysis is complete. 
(5) ?Trucked or hauled pollutants will be accepted only if transported to the POTW in compliance 
with all applicable state and federal regulations. 
(r) ?Any pollutant that results in excess foaming during the treatment process. Excess foaming is any 
foam which, in the opinion of the superintendent, is a nuisance in the treatment process. 
(s) ?Any unpolluted water, noncontact cooling water, stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff 
or subsurface drainage (except to a stormsewer or a combined sewer as authorized by the division 
and other applicable laws and regulations and subject to the prior approval of the superintendent.

Sec. 82-303. - Compliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(a) ?Compliance by existing sources with categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three years 
of the date the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate 
subpart of 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N. 
(b) ?Existing sources which become industrial users subsequent to promulgation of an applicable 
categorical pretreatment standard shall be considered existing industrial users except where such 
sources meet the definition of new sources. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-304. - New source compliance. 
(a) ?New sources shall install, have in operating condition, and start up all pollution control equipment 
required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the 
shortest feasible time, but not more than 90 days, new sources shall meet all applicable pretreatment 
standards. Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results in a modification 
rather than a new source if the construction does not create a new building, structure, facility, or 
installation meeting the criteria of R 323.2302(r)(ii) or (iii), but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds to 
existing process or production equipment. Construction of a new source as defined in R 323.2302(r) 
has commenced if the owner or operator has done either of the following: 
(1) ?Begun, or caused to begin, as part of a continuous onsite construction program, either of the 
following: 
a. ?Any placement, assembly, or installation of facilities or equipment. 
b. ?Significant site preparation work, including clearing, excavation, or removal of existing 
buildings, structures, or facilities that is necessary for the placement, assembly, or 
installation of a new source facilities or equipment. 
(2) ?Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of facilities or equipment that is 
intended to be used in the operation within a reasonable time. Options to purchase or contracts 
that can be terminated or modified without substantial loss and contracts for feasibility, 
engineering, and design studies do not constitute a contractual obligation under this subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-305. - Special discharge allocation. 
    An industrial user (IU) may, at the time of application for a wastewater discharge permit, or by 
special discharge permit allocation application, but no more than once per year, request that the uniform 
concentration limits for ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 ) be increased for that permit. Such special discharge 
allocation is expressed as a total daily pound limitation. The superintendent reserves the right to amend 
the MAHL's set forth in table 1 of this section at its discretion. The superintendent shall publish public 
notice of any such change in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the Hastings area. Approval of a 
special discharge allocation shall be subject to the following provisions: 
(a) ?The user requests a special discharge allocation through the permit application process, and 
this request must include a written acknowledgment whereby the user consents to comply with 
all terms and conditions which may be imposed by the superintendent. 
(b) ?The superintendent makes a determination that adequate treatment capacity allowing for the 
special discharge allocation exists within the maximum allowable headworks loading (MAHL) 
which is set forth in table 1. 
(c) ?The proposed permit containing the increased limitation has been reviewed and approved by 
the superintendent. 
(d) ?The proposed permit containing the increased limitation has been published for public notice by 
the superintendent in accordance with approved pretreatment program procedures. 
(e) ?The superintendent determines that all comments received during the public comment period 
have been adequately addressed. 
(f) ?The superintendent's approval is within parameters established by the administrative committee 
(as may be amended from time to time). Requests for allocations above these established 
parameters are brought before the administrative committee for approval. 
(g) ?The user shall pay the physical plant capacity portion of the surcharge rate for its entire 
allocation. User shall pay the operation and maintenance portion of the surcharge rate for actual 
discharge based on monitoring results. The user shall pay the full surcharge rate (the physical 
plant capacity component and the operation and maintenance component) for any pounds in 
excess of the permitted allocation and shall be subject to enforcement remedies for 
noncompliance with the limits in its SDA permit. 
(h) ?The special discharge allocation is within the MAHL as found in table 1 and would not result in 
the POTW (including the collection system) receiving pollutants in excess of its ability to convey 
or treat. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment of the plant capacity portion of the surcharge 
rate shall not confer any right to any particular amount of capacity in future periods. In addition, 
the superintendent reserves the right to institute a review of any previously permitted special 
discharge allocation at any time, pursuant to which the superintendent in its discretion, upon 
notice and the opportunity for hearing, may reduce or eliminate a user's previously permitted or 
approved special discharge allocation (including in particular, but not limited to, any allocation 
amount for which a user has previously paid the physical plant capacity component of the 
surcharge but not the operation and maintenance component of the surcharge). 
(i) ?Any discharge in excess of the amount permitted under the special discharge allocation is 
prohibited and is therefore a violation of the user's wastewater discharge permit.

(Ord. No. 346, § 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-306. - Pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(a) ?The national categorical pretreatment standards when finalized for specific industries shall become 
a part of the requirements of this division in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations. 
A user shall comply with all categorical pretreatment standards and any other pretreatment 
requirements established under the Act that are applicable to that user. 
(b) ?Notwithstanding any provision of this division to the contrary, the most stringent or restrictive 
standard or requirement applicable to a user's discharge shall control, whether established by this 
division, by any notice, order, permit, decision or determination promulgated, issued or made by the 
POTW under this division, by state laws or regulations, including the POTW's NPDES permit, or by 
federal laws or regulations. Further, if state of federal laws or regulations provide for standards and 
requirements not covered by this division that are otherwise applicable to a user's discharge, those 
standards and requirements shall apply to the user in addition to those required by this division, and 
the most restrictive of those additional standards or requirements shall control and shall be complied 
with by the user within the time period required by the law or regulation. 
(c) ?Where categorical standards are expressed in terms of mass of pollutants per unit or production, the 
city may elect to convert these limits to equivalent limitations expressed as either a mass of pollutant 
discharged per day or an effluent concentration as provided by MAC R 323.2311(5). Equivalent 
discharge limits calculated in accordance with MAC R 323.2311(5) shall be deemed pretreatment 
standards and enforceable as pretreatment standards. Any industrial user subject to equivalent mass 
or concentration limits calculated from a production based standard that does not notify the 
superintendent of significant changes in production levels as required by MAC R 323.2311(5)(g) 
shall be required to meet the applicable mass or concentration limits that were based on the original 
estimate of the long term production rate. 
(d) ?Where process effluent is mixed prior to treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by 
the regulated process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived by the city, or by the 
industrial user with the written concurrence of the city, to be applied to the mixed effluent as provided 
by MAC R 323.2311(7). 
(e) ?Categorical pretreatment standards shall apply to any user subject to categorical standards, unless 
an enforceable alternative limit to the corresponding national categorical standards is derived using 
any of the methods specified in MAC R 323.2313, provided that if local limits are more stringent than 
derived alternative categorical limits, the local limits shall control and provided that the alternative 
limit will not result in interference or pass through. 
(f) ?Existing sources which become industrial user subsequent to promulgation of an applicable 
categorical pretreatment standard shall be considered existing industrial users except where such 
sources meet the definition of "new source." A new source shall install and have in operating 
condition, and shall "start up" all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable 
pretreatment standards and requirements before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible 
time (not to exceed 90 days), new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards and 
requirements. 
(g) ?Except as otherwise expressly provided by this division or by a wastewater discharge permit, the 
prohibitions and limitations provided by this division or a wastewater discharge permit shall apply at 
the point where wastewater and pollutants are discharged or caused to be discharged into the 
POTW and any required pretreatment shall, at a minimum, be complete before that point of 
discharge is reached. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-307. - City's right of revision. 
    The city reserves the right to establish by ordinance more restrictive prohibitions, limitations or 
requirements for discharges to the POTW as necessary to prevent interference, pass through, to protect 
the POTW, to comply with applicable federal or state laws or regulations, to comply with the POTW's 
NPDES permit, or otherwise as determined necessary by the superintendent. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-308. - Dilution. 
    Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, 
no industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a 
discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a federal 
or local standard or limitation. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-309. - Accidental discharges. 
    Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibition materials or other 
substances regulated by this division. Facilities, to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials, 
shall be provided and maintained at the owner or users own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing 
facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review by 
the city before construction of the facility. All existing users shall submit such a plan along with their 
permit application. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of the 
ordinance from which this article is derived shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until 
accidental discharge procedures have been reviewed by the city. Following submittal and review of such 
plans, the city may require additional measures and/or information. Review of such plans and operating 
procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to 
meet the requirements of this division Compliance with the requirements of this section shall not relieve a 
user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the 
POTW, or for any other damage to persons or property, or for any other liability which may be imposed 
under this chapter or under other applicable laws and regulations. Further, POTW review of plans, 
specifications, or procedures shall not relieve a user from liability for failure to achieve compliance with 
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. 
(a) ?Designation of person in charge of discharge operations. Each industrial user shall designate 
at least one person to be in charge of and responsible for the user's discharge to the POTW, 
including responsibility for maintaining pretreatment facilities and operations, if any, and 
prevention of accidental discharges ("person in charge"). The person so designated shall be an 
individual or a position with knowledge of all toxic waste or hazardous substances routinely or 
potentially generated by the user, and of all process alterations which could, in any manner, 
increase or decrease normal daily flow or waste strength to the POTW. 
(b) ?Description of chemicals stored, used or manufactured by user. Each industrial user shall 
catalog all chemicals stored, used, or manufactured by the user at the user's premises. The list 
of chemicals shall include specific chemical names (not just manufacturer's codes) and shall be 
provided to the superintendent. 
(c) ?Description of user discharges. Each industrial user shall provide the superintendent with a 
written description of the user's discharge practices, including an estimate of daily average 
flows, waste strengths, and flow types, separated according to appropriate categories including 
process, cooling, sanitary, etc. 
(d) ?Description of user premises. Each industrial user shall provide to the superintendent a sketch 
of the user's plant building(s), including the location of pretreatment equipment, process and 
chemical storage areas, floor drains located near process and storage areas, manhole or other 
control structures, and sewer locations at the user's point of discharge into the POTW. 
(e) ?Segregation of wastewaters requiring pretreatment. industrial users shall segregate 
wastewaters requiring pretreatment (including, without limitation, spent concentrates, toxins, 
and high strength organic wastes) as necessary to prevent pollutants from interfering with or 
passing through the POTW. All sludges generated by pretreatment shall be used or disposed of 
only as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. 
(f) ?Secondary containment requirements. Each industrial user must provide and maintain at the 
user's expense secondary spill containment structures (including diking, curbing or other 
appropriate structures) adequate to protect all floor drains from accidental spills and discharges 
to the POTW of any pollutants or discharges regulated by this division. The containment or 
curbing shall be sufficient to hold not less than 110 percent of the total process area tank 
volume and not less than 110 percent of liquid polluting material stored or used, unless a lesser 
containment area or alternate control measures are approved in advance by the superintendent. 
The containment area shall be constructed so that no liquid polluting material can escape from 
the area by gravity through the building sewers, drains, or otherwise directly or indirectly into the 
POTW. All floor drains found within the containment area must be plugged and sealed. Spill 
troughs and sumps within process areas must discharge to appropriate pretreatment tanks. 
Emergency containment shall also be provided for storage tanks which may be serviced by 
commercial haulers and for chemical storage areas. Solid pollutants shall be located in security 
areas designed to prevent the loss of the materials to the POTW. Detailed plans showing 
facilities and operating procedures to provide the protection required by this section shall be 
submitted to the superintendent for review, and shall be approved by the superintendent before 
construction. Construction of approved containment for existing sources shall be completed 
within the time period specified by the superintendent. No new source shall be permitted to 
discharge to the POTW until emergency containment facilities have been approved and 
constructed as required by this section. The superintendent may order an industrial user to take 
interim measures for emergency containment as determined necessary by the superintendent 
under the circumstances. 
(g) ?Submission of pollution incident prevention plan. Each industrial user required to develop a 
pollution incident prevention ("PIP") plan as provided by part 5 of the Michigan Water 
Resources Commission Rules, 1979 ACR 323.1151 et seq., as amended (promulgated 
pursuant to Part 31 of Act 451 of he Public Acts of Michigan of 1994, MCLA 324.3101 et seq., 
as amended), shall submit a copy of that plan to the superintendent. The PIP shall be submitted 
to the superintendent within 60 days of the effective date of this division for an existing source, 
or 30 days prior to the date of discharge for a new source. 
(h) ?Posting of accidental discharge information. All industrial users shall post a clearly legible set of 
instructions in the area where the user manages wastewater so that the applicable reporting 
and notice requirements are made known and are available to the user's employees. In 
addition, all industrial users shall instruct their employees on the applicable reporting and notice 
requirements of this section. 
(i) ?Notice of accidental discharge. In case of an accidental discharge, an industrial user shall 
immediately notify the superintendent of the incident by telephone. The notification shall include 
available information regarding the location of the discharge, its volume, duration, constituents, 
loading and concentrations, corrective actions taken and required, and other available 
information as necessary to determine what impact the discharge may have on the POTW. A 
detailed written report providing the same and any additional available information (including 
specifying the measures that will be taken by the user to prevent similar future discharges) shall 
also be provided by the user to the superintendent within five days of the incident. Such 
notification or report shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability 
which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to 
person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or 
other liability which may be imposed by this division or other applicable law. 
(j) ?Slug control plan. The superintendent may, by written notice to an industrial user, require that 
the user prepare and implement an individualized slug control plan. The plan shall be submitted 
to the superintendent for approval as specified in the written notice. The plan shall contain at 
least the following elements: 
(1) ?A description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(2) ?A description of stored materials; 
(3) ?The procedures for immediately notifying the superintendent of slug discharges, including 
any discharge that would violate any discharge prohibition, limitation or requirement under 
this article, and procedures for follow-up written notification within five days of the 
discharge; 
(4) ?The procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and 
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading 
operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures 
or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or 
measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-310. - Bypass. 
(a) ?Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. An industrial user may 
allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be 
violated, but only if the bypass is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These 
bypasses are not subject to the provisions in section 82-310(a) and (b). However, this section shall 
not be construed to authorize a discharge that exceeds a discharge prohibition or limitation under 
this division or other applicable laws or regulations; nor to relieve a user for any expense, loss, 
damage, or liability that may be incurred as a result of the bypass, such as damage to the POTW, 
fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor to relieve the User of any fines, penalties or 
other liability that may be imposed by applicable laws or regulations as a result of the bypass. 
(b) ?Prohibited. The bypass of industrial waste from any portion of a user's facility is prohibited, and 
enforcement action against a user may be taken for a bypass, unless: 
(1) ?Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage. 
(2) ?There was no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment 
facilities, retention of untreated waste, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment 
downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been 
installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass that occurred 
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
(3) ?The industrial user submitted notices as required under this section. 
(c) ?Notice. 
(1) ?If user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it must submit prior notice of the bypass to 
the superintendent. Such notice shall be submitted to the superintendent as soon as the user 
becomes aware of the need for the bypass, and if possible, at least ten days before the date of 
the bypass. 
(2) ?A user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable 
pretreatment standards to the superintendent within 24 hours from the time the user becomes 
aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the 
user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the 
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and if the 
bypass has not corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or 
planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The superintendent may 
waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 
hours. 
(3) ?The superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects, if 
the superintendent determines that it meets the conditions set forth in this section. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-311. - Operations upset. 
(a) ?An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with 
categorical pretreatment standards if a user or industrial user demonstrate can demonstrate through 
properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or relevant evidence that: 
(1) ?An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2) ?The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in 
compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
(3) ?The User has submitted the following information to the superintendent within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be 
provided within five days): 
a. ?A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b. ?The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the 
anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c. ?The steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the 
noncompliance. 
    However, in the event of an upset, the user or industrial user may still be liable for surcharges for 
exceeding applicable discharge limitations as provided by this division. In any enforcement proceeding, 
the user or industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof 
by clear and convincing evidence. 
(b) ?The user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance 
with categorical pretreatment standards and other applicable limits upon reduction, loss, or failure of 
its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This 
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the 
treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(c) ?A user shall have an affirmative defense in any action brought against it alleging a violation of the 
general prohibitions and specific prohibitions as expressly provided by MAC R 323.2303(3) if the 
user can demonstrate that all of the conditions necessary to establish the defense under MAC R 
323.2303(3)(a) and (b) are met. However, even if the affirmative defense is established, the user 
may still be liable for surcharges for exceeding applicable discharge limitations as provided by this 
division. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the affirmative defenses 
provided by MAC R 323.2303(3) shall have the burden of proof.

(b) ?If sampling performed by a user to demonstrate compliance with applicable pretreatment standards 
indicates a violation, the user shall notify the superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of 
the violation and shall resample within 30 days. 
(c) ?A user shall promptly notify the superintendent in advance of any substantial change in the volume 
or character of pollutants in its discharge, or of any facility expansion, production increase, or 
process modifications that could result in a substantial change in the volume or character of 
pollutants in its discharge. For purposes of this section, "substantial change" includes, without 
limitation, the following: 
(1) ?The discharge of any amount of a pollutant not identified in the user's permit application or in 
the permit issued; 
(2) ?An increase in concentration (or degree) of any pollutant that exceeds five percent of the 
concentration (or degree) for the pollutant as indicated in any report required under section 82-
336 or 82-338; 
(3) ?An increase in discharge volume that exceeds 20 percent of the volume as indicated in any 
report required under section 82-336 or 82-338; 
(4) ?Any increase in the amount of any hazardous wastes discharged, including, without limitation, 
the hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under 
section 82-338 of this chapter; 
(5) ?The discharge of any ground waters purged for a removal or remedial action; 
(6) ?The discharge of any pollutants that are present in the discharge due to infiltration; or 
(7) ?A change in discharge that may convert an industrial user into a significant industrial user (and 
if a change in discharge would convert an industrial user into a significant user, the user shall 
promptly submit an application for a wastewater discharge permit to the superintendent). 
    This section shall not be construed to authorize a discharge that exceeds a discharge prohibition or 
limitation provided by this division or a permit. In determining whether to accept any changed discharge, 
or, if so, under what conditions, the POTW shall evaluate the changed discharge pursuant to the general 
and specific discharge prohibitions of sections 82-301 and 82-302 and other applicable provisions of this 
division. 
(d) ?All of the following provisions apply to hazardous waste notification: 
(1) ?The nondomestic user shall notify the publicly owned treatment works, the EPA regional waste 
management division chief, and the department, in writing, of any discharge into the publicly 
owned treatment works of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous 
waste under 40 C.F.R. part 261 (1990). The notification shall include the name of the hazardous 
waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261 (1990), the E.P.A. hazardous waste number, and the 
type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the nondomestic user discharges more than 
100 kilograms of the waste per calendar month to the publicly owned treatment works, the 
notification shall also contain all of the following information to the extent the information is 
known and readily available to the nondomestic user: 
a. ?An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes. 
b. ?An estimation of the mass and concentration of the constituents in the wastestream 
discharged during that calendar month. 
c. ?An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged 
during the following 12 months. Nondomestic users who commence discharging after the 
effective date of this rule shall provide the notification not later than 180 days after the 
discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this 
subdivision need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, 
notifications of changed discharges shall be submitted under subrule (9) of this rule. The 
notification requirement in this rule does not apply to pollutants already reported under the 
self-monitoring requirements of this rule. 
(2) ?Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subdivision (a) of this subrule during a 
calendar month in which they discharge 15 kilograms or less of hazardous wastes, unless the 
wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) (1990). 
Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of 
any quantity of acute hazardous, wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) 
(1990), requires a 1-time notification. Discharges in subsequent months of more than the 
quantities of any hazardous waste specified in this subdivision do not require additional 
notification. 
(3) ?If new regulations under section 3001 of the resource conservation recovery act of 42 U.S.C. 
section 6901 et seq., identify additional characteristics of hazardous waste or list any additional 
substance as a hazardous waste, the nondomestic user shall notify the publicly owned 
treatment works, the E.P.A. regional waste management division chief, and state hazardous 
waste authorities of the discharge of the substance within 90 days of the effective date of the 
regulations. 
(4) ?If notification is made under section 82-338(d)(1) above, the nondomestic user shall certify that 
it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to 
the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(e) ?Within five days after completing installation of new pretreatment facilities, all users shall notify the 
superintendent in writing of the time and date when it intends to commence operation of the new 
facilities, and the identity of the person who will conduct any tests to be performed. The pretreatment 
facilities shall not be placed in regular operations until adequate tests have been conducted to 
establish that the discharges will comply with the requirements of this division. Upon prior written 
request by the superintendent, the user shall allow a representative of the POTW to observe the test 
at the time they are conducted. The cost of the test shall be paid by the user. 
(f) ?Users shall comply with all other reporting or notice requirements as provided by this division or as 
required by any other applicable law or regulation, including, without limitation, the reporting and 
notice requirements in connection with accidental discharge, upset, and bypass. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-339. - Signatory and certification requirements. 
    The reports required by section 82-336 shall be signed and certified as follows: 
(1) ?Required signatures. The report shall be signed by on authorized representative of the user as 
defined in section 82-191 of this division. 
(2) ?Required certification. The report shall include the following certification statement: 
    "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under 
my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified 
personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the 
person or persons who manage the system, or those persons who manage the system, or those 
persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the 
best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are 
significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and 
imprisonment for knowing violations." 
(3) ?Exception. If the POTW elects to perform instead of the user all of the sampling or analysis 
otherwise required for a report or notification, the user will not be required to comply with the 
certification requirements for the sampling and analysis (or portion thereof) performed by the 
POTW. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-340. - Requirements applicable to all reports and notifications. 
    All reports and notifications submitted by a user to the POTW as required by this division shall meet 
the following requirements: 
(1) ?All reports required by this division shall be based upon data obtained through appropriate 
sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report. The data shall be

requirement that the report be submitted by the user. 
(5) ?The reports, notifications, and other documents and data required to be submitted or 
maintained by this division shall be subject to all of the provisions as specified by MAC R 
323.2310(13). 
(6) ?Failure to provide the notifications and reports required by this division constitutes an 
independent violation of this division. However, providing the required notifications and reports 
shall not relieve a user of any expense, loss damage, or other liability that may be incurred as a 
result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall 
such notification or report relieve a user of any fines, penalties or other liability that may be 
imposed by applicable laws or regulations. Further, the reporting and notification requirements 
required by this division shall not be construed to authorize a discharge that exceeds a 
discharge prohibition or limitation under this division or other applicable laws or regulations. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2, 4-22-02) 


Sec. 82-341. - Confidential information.

submitted to or obtained by the city in the administration of this division: 
(1) ?Information and data regarding a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit 
applications, permits and monitoring programs, and from inspections shall be available to the 
public without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes 
or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets to user. 
(2) ?Information submitted by a user for which confidentiality is requested shall be clearly marked 
on each page as to the portion or portions considered by the user to be confidential and shall be 
accompanied by a written explanation of why the user considers the information to be 
confidential or why the release of the information would divulge information, processes or 
methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. 
(3) ?Information which may disclose trade secrets or secret processes and for which the user has 
requested confidentiality as provided by this section shall not be made available for inspection 
by the general public; however, that information shall be made available upon written request to 
governmental agencies for uses related to matter regulated by this division and shall be made 
available for use by the state, any state agency, or the city in judicial review of enforcement 
proceedings which involve the user that furnished the information. The city shall notify the user 
ten days in advance if it intends to release confidential information to another governmental 
agency as authorized by this section. 
(4) ?Information furnished to the city on the volume or characteristics of wastewater or pollutants 
discharged or proposed to be discharged into the POTW shall be available to the public or other 
governmental agency without restriction. 
(5) ?If a user has mass-based limits as allowed by certain categorical pretreatment standards on a 
production basis, the production data necessary to determine compliance must also be provided 
by the user to the city, and shall be available to the public. If application of the combined waste 
stream formula is necessary to apply categorical pretreatment standards to a user, the flow 
measurements and other data used in the calculation must be provided by the User to the city, 
and shall be available to the public. 
(6) ?Observations made by city inspectors shall be subject to the confidentiality provisions of this 
section as if they were in writing if he user specifies to the city in writing for which particular

(Ord. No. 346, § 2, 4-22-02) 


Subdivision VI. - Sampling, Analysis and Monitoring 


Sec. 82-343. - Sampling, analysis and monitoring. 
    Unless expressly provided otherwise for a particular industrial user by a wastewater discharge permit 
or order issued in pursuant to this division, all significant industrial users and any other user as required 
by the POTW shall sample, monitor and analyze their discharges to the POTW according to the following 
minimum requirements: 
(a) ?Sampling and analysis techniques and procedures. All sampling, measurements, tests, and 
analyses of the characteristics of discharges to the POTW shall be performed in accordance 
with the procedures approved by the U.S. EPA contained in 40 CFR Part 136. If the 
superintendent determines that these sampling and analytical techniques are not available or do 
not apply to the discharge or pollutants in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed 
using validated sampling and analytical methods and procedures approved by the approval 
authority. 
(b) ?Sampling frequency. Users shall sample their discharges to the POTW at a frequency 
necessary to assess and assure compliance with the requirements of this division, any permit or 
ORDER issued pursuant to this division, all applicable pretreatment standards and 
requirements, other applicable state and federal laws and regulations, or as otherwise 
determined necessary by the superintendent consistent with the purposes and intent of this 
division. 
(c) ?Appraisal of sampling methods, equipment and location required. Users shall submit a written 
description of the specific sampling method, sampling equipment, and sampling location to the 
superintendent for approval by the superintendent. Users discharging as of the effective date of 
this division shall obtain approval within 90 days of that effective date. For new sources, 
approval shall be obtained prior to commencement of the discharge. 
(d) ?Costs of sampling and analysis. Samples shall be taken and analyzed at the sole cost of the 
user. 
(e) ?Self-monitoring. Except otherwise provided by this division, self-monitoring shall be conducted 
by each user to insure compliance with all applicable requirements of this division and other 
applicable laws and regulations. A user performing its own sampling shall submit the samples 
for analysis to a laboratory (which may include the user's own laboratory) approved by the 
POTW. If the user uses its own laboratory for the analysis, the user shall send a split sample to 
an independent laboratory at least quarterly as a quality control check. If a user performs its 
own sampling and analysis, the POTW may also take and cause to be analyzed composite 
samples or grab samples at the sole cost of the user. A user performing its own sampling shall 
record the date when a sample is taken, start time, stop time, sample location, sampler 
programming information, and persons involved in the sampling. If sampling performed by a 
user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the superintendent within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the 
results of the repeat analysis to the POTW within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, 
except that the user shall not be required to resample if: 
(1) ?The city performs sampling at the user at a frequency of at least once per month; or 
(2) ?The city performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs initial 
sampling and the time when the user receives the results of the sampling which indicates 
the violation. 
(f) ?Sampling and analysis performed by POTW. The sampling and analysis is required by this 
division may be performed by the POTW in lieu of the user, as determined necessary by the 
superintendent. The city shall provide the user with copies of analytical results prepared by the 
POTW. (If the results of any sampling and analysis performed by the POTW instead of the user 
show that a pretreatment standard has been violated, the POTW shall provide the user with 
copies of the analytical results within ten days after the results are available.) If the POTW 
performs the required sampling and analysis for a user, the user shall pay a sampling fee to the 
POTW to fully reimburse the city for the sampling, including administrative and overhead costs. 
The POTW may contract with an independent firm to perform the sampling and analysis are the 
user shall fully reimburse the city for amounts paid by the POTW to the firm. 
(g) ?Split sampling. If requested, the POTW shall be provided with splits of any sample taken by a 
user. In cases of disputes arising over split samples, the portion taken and analyzed by the 
POTW shall be controlling unless proven invalid. 
(h) ?Maintenance, repair and calibration of equipment. A user who is performing self-monitoring, or 
the city if performing sampling and monitoring in lieu of a user, shall contract with an 
independent company to maintain, repair, and calibrate the sampling and flow measurement 
equipment and instruments used to monitor the user. The maintenance, repair, and calibration 
shall be performed as often as necessary to ensure that monitoring data is accurate and 
representative. The city, in any event, may inspect and test a user's flow meters at reasonable 
times. 
(i) ?Required sampling structures and devices. The POTW may require any user to install at each 
discharge point a suitable control structure (such as a manhole or sampling vault) and 
necessary measuring and sampling devices to facilitate the observation, sampling, and 
measurement of the quantity, composition, and concentrations of discharges to the POTW. The 
complexity of the required control structure or devices may vary with sampling requirements 
determined necessary by the superintendent to protect the POTW and to comply with applicable 
laws and regulations. 
(1) ?The required structures and devices shall be constructed and installed at the user's 
expense in accordance with plans submitted to the superintendent, and in compliance with 
all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be 
completed within 90 days following written notification by the city, or within such other 
shorter or longer time specified by the superintendent as required by the particular 
circumstances to meet the requirements of this division. The structures and devices shall 
be maintained by the user at the user's expense so as to be safe and accessible to POTW 
personnel during all reasonable times and so as to provide accurate and representative 
monitoring data. If a user fails to install or maintain a required structure or device, the city 
may do so at the expense of the user. 
(2) ?The structures and devices should be located on the user's premises, but the city may, if 
the city determines that such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to 
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and 
located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(3) ?Samples shall be taken at the control structure. In the absence of a suitable control 
structure as required by this section, samples shall not be taken immediately downstream 
from pretreatment facilities if pretreatment facilities exist, or immediately downstream from 
the regulated process if no pretreatment facilities exist.

Sec. 90-86. - Variances generally. 
    Subject to the provisions of section 90-87, and in addition to other duties and powers specified 
herein, the board, after public hearing, shall have the power to decide applications for variances: 
(1) ?Where it is alleged by the application or the applicant that there is error or misinterpretation in 
any order, requirement, decision, grant or refusal made by the building inspector or other 
administrative officer of the city in the carrying out or enforcement of the provisions of this 
chapter. 
(2) ?Where it is alleged by the applicant that by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness 
or shape of a specific piece of property on the effective date of the ordinance from which this 
chapter was derived, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary 
situation or condition of the land, building or structure, or of the use or development of property 
immediately adjoining the property in question, the literal enforcement of the requirements of the 
ordinance from which this chapter was derived would involve practical difficulties or would 
cause undue hardship, provided that the board shall not grant a variance on a lot of less than 
the requirements of its zone, even though such lot existed at the time of the passage of the 
ordinance from which this chapter was derived, if the owner or members of his immediate family 
owned adjacent land which could, without undue hardship, be included as part of the lot. 
(3) ?Where it is alleged by the applicant that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships 
in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this chapter relating to the construction, structural 
changes in equipment, or alterations of buildings or structures, or the use of land, buildings or 
structures, so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed, public safety secured and 
substantial justice done. 
(4) ?Where it is alleged that the condition or situation of the specific piece of property or the 
intended use of said property for which the variance is sought is not of so general or recurrent a 
nature as to make reasonably practical the formulation of a general regulation for such 
conditions or situation as part of this chapter. 
(Code 1970, § 3.245) 


Sec. 90-87. - Variances prohibited. 
    No variance in the provisions or requirements of this chapter shall be authorized unless the board 
finds from reasonable evidence that such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property 
and the surrounding neighborhood; will not impair the public health, safety, welfare or the intent and 
purpose of this chapter; and that at least two of the following conditions exist: 
(1) ?That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the 
property in question or to the intended use of the property that do not apply generally to other 
properties in the same zoning classification. 
(2) ?That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property 
right similar to that possessed by other properties in the same zoning district and in the vicinity, 
provided that the possibility of increased return shall not be deemed sufficient to warrant a 
variance. 
(3) ?That the condition or situation of the specific piece of property or the intended use of the 
property for which the variance is sought is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make 
reasonably practical the formulation of a general regulation for such conditions or situation as 
part of this chapter. 
(Code 1970, § 3.246) 


Sec. 90-88. - Land use variances. 
    An application for a land use variance to permit a use not otherwise permitted in that zoning district 
may be considered by the board but only according to the following procedures: 
(1) ?The applicant shall first seek to rezone the property to that zoning district that permits the 
desired use. If the rezoning request is denied by the council, the applicant may then file an 
application for a use variance from the board. 
(2) ?Such application shall be made to the city clerk/treasurer and an application fee paid in 
accordance with the fee schedule established by the council. 
(3) ?The city clerk/treasurer shall forward the application materials to the planning commission for 
consideration at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The commission shall review the request 
with attention to the recommendation of the master plan of the city for the property in question. 
The commission shall then make a recommendation to the board. 
(4) ?The variance request shall then be considered by the board in accordance with the hearing 
procedures set forth in this chapter. 
(5) ?In order to approve a use variance request, the board shall determine that an unnecessary 
hardship exists and that the variance request meets all of the following conditions: 
a. ?That the property could not be used (be put to a reasonable use) for the purposes 
permitted in that zone. 
b. ?That the plight is due to unique circumstances peculiar to the property and not to general 
neighborhood conditions. 
c. ?That the use would not alter the essential character of the area. 
d. ?That the problem is not self created. 
Further, the board must ensure that the spirit of this chapter is observed, public safety secured 
and substantial justice done. 
(6) ?In granting a use variance, the board may prescribe reasonable conditions and safeguards 
necessary to meet the spirit and intent of this chapter.

city and shall be sent to the person seeking the interpretation or appeal not less than 15 days before the 
public hearing.

interpretation or appeal of an administrative decision involves a specific parcel, written notice stating the 
nature of the interpretation request and notice of the public hearing on the interpretation request shall also 
be sent by first-class mail or personal delivery to all persons to whom real property is assessed within 300 
feet of the boundary of the property in question and to the occupants of all structures within 300 feet of 
the boundary of the property in question. If a tenant's name is not known, the term "occupant" may be 
used.

need for the extension were largely beyond the control of the applicant. 
(c) ?No application for a variance that has been denied wholly or in part by the board shall be 
resubmitted within one year from the date of the original filing of an application for the variance,

denial of the original appeal found by the board to be valid.

and soil removal and by topographic modifications that result in maximum harmony with 
adjacent areas. 
(3) ?Special attention shall be given to property site drainage so that removal of stormwaters will not 
adversely affect neighboring properties.

protection and enhancement of property and for the privacy of its occupants.

(11) ?With respect to vehicular and pedestrian circulation, including walkways, interior drives and 
parking, special attention shall be given to location and number of access points, general 
interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, particularly the avoidance of 
building corners next to access drives, and arrangement of parking areas that are safe and 
convenient, and insofar as practicable, do not detract from the design of the proposed buildings 
and structures and the neighboring properties. Streets and drives part of an existing or planned 
street pattern that serve adjacent development shall be of a width appropriate to the traffic 
volume they will carry and shall have a dedicated right-of-way equal to that specified in the city's 
master plan. 
(12) ?All public streets shall be built in accordance with the requirements of the city. 
(13) ?In order to achieve one of the objectives of the Hastings area plan, which is to "provide for a 
connected system of streets and pedestrian and bicycle trails between neighborhoods and 
activity centers," all site plans shall be designed to provide for the following as may be deemed 
necessary by the planning commission in order to meet the standards for approval set forth in 
subsections 90-131(1)(12) herein: 
a. ?Public and private streets shall be extended to the boundary line of adjacent parcels to 
allow for the logical continuation of such streets into the adjacent parcel. This extension 
may be in the form of constructing the road itself to the parcel boundary or providing a 
right-of-way to the parcel boundary so the road may be constructed at a future date. 
b. ?Sidewalks at least five feet wide on both sides of the street shall be installed within the 
street right-of-way for all projects. 
c. ?Improved walkways, where practicable, shall be located along certain side lot lines in order 
to provide an alternative pedestrian travel route to the sidewalk system located within the 
public right-of-way. 
These "mid-block" walkways shall be located with an easement and shall not be blocked 
by the property owner and shall be spaced approximately 600 feet apart. 
d. ?If the project provides common open space for use by its residents, a walking trail shall be 
provided within this open space if practicable. 
e. ?Street trees and street lights shall be provided at regular intervals within the street right-of-
way by the developer of the project if determined to be necessary by the planning 
commission. 
(14) ?Site plans shall conform to all applicable requirements of state and federal statutes, and 
approval may be conditioned on the applicant's receiving necessary state and federal permits 
before final site plan approval or an occupancy permit is granted. 
(Code 1970, § 3.279; Ord. No. 515, § I, 8-25-14) 


Sec. 90-132. - Access control standards. 
(a) ?The planning commission shall review site plans according to the standards of this section relating 
to vehicle access and circulation. The purpose of specific access standards is to increase traffic 
safety, lessen congestion, provide adequate access, promote community character, and ensure 
orderly development. 
(b) ?The planning commission shall have the authority to require a frontage road or service drive for 
contiguous parcels along M-43 and M-37 or on other streets as deemed necessary. The planning 
commission shall also have the authority to limit the number of driveways for a site, to require that 
parking lots on contiguous parcels be connected, that driveways for contiguous parcels be shared, 
and that opposite driveways be directly aligned. In determining whether the above or other access 
control measures are necessary, the following criteria shall be considered: 
(1) ?The type and location of commercial uses on the site and adjacent to the site. 
(2) ?The location, size and design of existing and proposed parking areas. 
(3) ?The existing and projected traffic volume on the roadway and adjacent roadways. 
(4) ?Compatibility between adjacent land uses and likelihood of change or expansion. 
(5) ?Number of parcels involved, location of lot lines and amount of road frontage. 
(6) ?Topography and site distance along adjacent roadways and on the site. 
(7) ?Distance from intersections. 
(8) ?Location of driveways opposite the site. 
(9) ?Width of roadway and number of lanes. 
(10) ?Environmental limitations (steep slopes, water, or vegetation). 
(11) ?Sufficient building setback. 
(c) ?For commercial uses along M-37 and M-43, and other streets as deemed necessary, the following 
regulations shall apply: 
(1) ?A parcel shall not be denied reasonable access to a public roadway. 
(2) ?A maximum of one driveway shall be provided to an individual parcel or to a contiguous parcel 
under the same ownership when the property in question has no other reasonable access to 
another abutting street or access road. Additional driveways may also be permitted in 
accordance with the driveway spacing standards herein. A one-way in, one-way out driveway 
system may be permitted if it is demonstrated that traffic circulation on and off the site will not 
create hazardous situations. 
(3) ?Temporary direct access to M-43 and M-37 may be granted in instances where access roads 
or adjoining parcels are not yet developed. A temporary driveway permit shall specify the future 
means of access, location if known, and date the change will be made. This temporary access 
agreement shall be recorded with the county register of deeds. 
(4) ?a.  
Parcels with 300 or more feet of road frontage with a single large use will not be required to 
construct a service drive but may be required to connect the parking area to parking areas on 
contiguous parcels. 
b. ?If a parcel with an established commercial use, and with 300 feet or more of road frontage, 
is divided to allow for an additional commercial use (resulting in parcels with less than 300 
feet of road frontage), an additional driveway for that use will not be permitted. Both the 
original and the additional commercial use will be required to construct an adjoining service 
drive. An exception to this standard exists if the anticipated traffic volumes generated by 
either the original or the additional commercial use will exceed 3,000 vehicles per day 
and/or are projected to cause traffic congestion during peak hours. 
c. ?If two or more existing contiguous parcels with noncommercial uses together comprise less 
than 300 feet of road frontage, and if any of those parcels converts to a commercial use (or 
any other use for which site plan review is required), the construction of a service drive will 
be required. As additional contiguous parcels convert to commercial uses, they will be 
required to construct additional segments of the service drive. These parcels will eventually 
be served by common driveway access, the placement of which will be determined by 
driveway spacing standards contained herein. 
(d) ?Driveways for a parcel shall be permitted based on the amount of road frontage for that parcel as 
follows, except that the planning commission may modify this in the interest of public safety based on 
the criteria in subsection (b) of this section:

*Street classification based on the city's master plan. 
(3) ?If the amount of street frontage is not sufficient to meet the above criterion, the driveway shall 
be constructed along the property line farthest from the intersection to encourage future shared 
use, and/or a frontage road or rear access service drive shall be developed. 
(4) ?For parcels which are only allowed a channelized right-turn-in, right-turn-out driveway, and 
alternative means of access (shared driveway, frontage road, service drive or connected 
parking lots) are not feasible due to parcel size or existing adjacent development, the planning 
commission may allow a nonchannelized, full movement driveway provided that: 
a. ?The driveway is spaced no closer to the intersection than the minimum spacing allowed for 
a right-turn-in, right-turn-out driveway. 
b. ?A traffic study, conducted by a registered traffic engineer, provides substantial justification 
that the driveway operation will not result in conflicts with vehicles at the adjacent 
intersection. 
(f) ?Driveway spacing from other driveways shall be determined as follows: 
(1) ?There shall be minimum spacing of 25 feet between the centerline of a driveway and the 
adjacent property line, not including the right turn lane and/or taper. The centerline for 
channelized driveways is measured at the street right-of-way line. This requirement does not 
apply to shared driveways. 
(2) ?Minimum driveway spacing requirements shall be determined based on posted speed limits 
along the parcel frontage, as indicated in table 18-1.

(3) ?The values in table 18-1 are considered minimums based on the distances required to avoid 
conflicts between vehicles turning right or left from adjacent driveways. 
(4) ?The planning commission shall have the authority to waive or modify the preceding spacing 
requirements when strict adherence to them would result in unreasonable access to the site. In 
waiving or modifying the spacing requirements, the criteria of subsection (b) of this section shall 
be used. 
(Ord. No. 301, § 9(3.279B), 2-10-97) 


Sec. 90-133. - Performance guarantee. 
(a) ?The planning commission may require a performance bond, letter of credit, or certified check in an 
amount equal to the estimated cost of road, lighting, utility, sidewalk, landscaping, drainage, and 
other required improvements associated with the project. The estimated amount shall be determined 
by the director of public services. Such performance guarantee shall be deposited with the city 
clerk/treasurer prior to the issuance of a building permit authorizing the activity or project. The 
performance guarantee is to ensure faithful completion of the improvements indicated with the 
approved site plan; if not completed, the performance guarantee shall be forfeited. 
(b) ?The city clerk/treasurer shall rebate a proportional share of cash deposits only when requested by 
the depositor, based on the percent of improvements completed, as attested to by the depositor and 
verified by the building inspector. In cases where the provisions of this article have not been met, the 
amount of the aforementioned performance guarantee shall be used by the city to complete the 
required improvements or return the property to a safe and healthy condition at the option of the city; 
and the balance, if any, shall be returned to the applicant. No rebate shall be paid until the work is 
completed and the costs have been accurately determined by the city. 
(Code 1970, § 3.280) 
State Law reference Similar provisions, MCL 125.584e. 


Sec. 90-134. - Time limit for site plan approval. 
    Each site plan approved under this article shall be under construction within one year after the date 
of final approval by the planning commission. If construction has not commenced within one year of 
issuance of final site plan approval, then approval shall automatically terminate unless the term for 
commencement of construction is extended as follows: Contingent upon receipt of a written application 
for an extension filed before the expiration of the initial one-year period, the planning commission may 
authorize a single extension for a further period of not more than one year. For the purposes of this 
section, the issuance of a building permit for the facilities to be constructed under the approved site plan 
shall constitute commencement of construction. 
(Code 1970, § 3.281; Ord. No. 509, § I, 1-27-14) 


Sec. 90-135. - Amendment of an approved site plan. 
(a) ?Any person or agency for which a site plan has been approved shall notify the building inspector of 
any proposed amendment to the approved site plan. Any minor change such as dimension changes, 
increase in parking, drive relocation, landscaping changes, or movement of lighting or signs may be 
approved by the building inspector, who shall notify the planning commission in writing of such 
amendments. A copy shall be placed in the file of the original permit requested. 
(b) ?Any major changes to any approved site plan shall comply with the filing procedures contained in 
this article for site plan review. Major changes shall include but are not limited to increasing the 
density or number of dwelling units, increasing the number of buildings or land area, and the addition 
of another use or uses not initially authorized under the original site plan. The building inspector shall 
determine if other similar changes constitute a major amendment.

Sec. 90-166. - Continuance of nonconforming use of structure. 
    The lawful use of any land or structure, exactly as such existed at the time of the enactment of the 
ordinance from which this chapter was derived, may be continued although such use or structure does 
not conform with the provisions of the ordinance from which this chapter was derived. Structures, or uses 
nonconforming by reason of height or area, or parking or off-street loading provisions only, may be 
extended, enlarged, altered, remodeled or modernized in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(Code 1970, § 3.50; Ord. No. 326, § II, 1-24-00) 


Sec. 90-167. - Unlawful use not authorized. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as authorization for or approval of the continuance of the 
use of a structure or premises in violation of zoning regulations in effect immediately prior to the date of 
the ordinance from which this chapter was derived. 
(Code 1970, § 3.51) 


Sec. 90-168. - Change of use. 
    The use of a nonconforming building or structure may be changed to another use permitted in the 
most restricted district in which such nonconforming use is permitted. Where the use of a nonconforming 
building or structure is changed to a use permitted in a more restricted district, it shall not thereafter be 
changed to a use not permitted in the more restricted district. The proposed use shall be subject to all the 
requirements applying to such proposed use in the most restricted zone in which the nonconforming use 
to be changed is permitted. 
(Code 1970, § 3.52) 


Sec. 90-169. - Restoration and repairs. 
(a) ?Such repairs and maintenance work as are required to keep a nonconforming building or structure 
in a sound condition may be made. 
(b) ?Nonconforming building or structure. If a nonconforming building or structure is damaged by fire, 
wind, act of God or other calamity to the extent that the cost for repair or replacement of the 
nonconforming building or structure is 60 percent or more of the fair market value of the building or 
structure prior to such damage or destruction, the building or structure may be rebuilt or restored and 
used only in accordance with the requirements of this zoning code. The owner shall provide sufficient 
documentation to the zoning administrator to demonstrate the fair market value of the building or 
structure as well as the cost for repair and replacement. 
    If the damage is less than 60 percent of the fair market value, the building may be rebuilt or restored 
to its size and footprint existing prior to such damage and the use resumed. 
(c) ?Nonconforming use located in a conforming building. Except as noted in section 90-170 below, a 
nonconforming use located in a conforming building or structure shall not be re-established if the 
building or structure is damaged by fire, wind, act of God or other calamity to the extent that the cost 
for repair or replacement of the building or structure is 60 percent or more of the fair market value of 
the building or structure prior to such damage or destruction. The owner shall provide sufficient 
documentation to the zoning administrator to demonstrate the fair market value of the building or 
structure as well as the cost for repair and replacement. 
    If the damage is less than 60 percent of the fair market value, the building may be rebuilt or restored 
to its size and footprint existing prior to such damage and the use resumed. 
(d) ?Any such restoration must be started within a period of one year at the time of such damage and 
diligently prosecuted to completion. The board may extend such period of time for restoration of any 
building or structure when a state or local emergency shall render it impossible to make the 
restoration of such building or structure within the stated time limit. 
(Code 1970, § 3.53; Ord. No. 530, § I, 9-28-15) 


Sec. 90-170. - Nonconforming due to reclassification. 
(a) ?The foregoing provisions of this article shall also apply to buildings, structures, land or uses which 
become nonconforming due to any reclassification of districts under this chapter or any subsequent 
change in the regulations of this chapter except as noted below. 
(b) ?Single-family dwellings in the B-4 and B-5 zones which became nonconforming uses due to a 
rezoning classification are subject to the following provisions: 
(1) ?If the building containing the single-family use is a conforming structure and is damaged by fire, 
wind, act of God or other calamity regardless of the extent of the damage, the building may be 
restored to the size and footprint which existed prior to such damage and the single-family use 
resumed. 
(Code 1970, § 3.54; Ord. No. 530, § II, 9-28-15) 


Sec. 90-171. - Enlargement of nonconforming buildings and uses. 
(a) ?In all the RR, RS, R1 and R2 zoning districts, single- and two-family dwellings which are 
nonconforming by reason of setback, height, parking, building square footage or other dimensional 
requirements may be altered or enlarged beyond the size which existed at the time of the adoption of 
this chapter (January 24, 2000) provided: 
(1) ?The alteration or enlargement complies with all setback, height, parking, and other applicable 
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located and does not increase the extent of the 
nonconformity. The extension of a nonconforming building in such a manner that the extension 
itself does not conform to the setback, height or other applicable standards of this chapter shall 
be deemed an increase in the extent of the nonconformity of the original building and is not 
permitted. 
(2) ?The gross square footage of the alteration or enlargement does not exceed 50 percent of the 
gross square footage of the building which existed prior to the adoption of this section. 
(b) ?All other nonconforming principal buildings and uses may be enlarged beyond the size which 
existed at the time of the adoption of this chapter provided that the zoning board of appeals finds: 
(1) ?That the gross square footage of the enlargement of the building does not exceed 50 percent 
of the gross square footage of the building which existed prior to the adoption of this chapter. 
(2) ?That the expansion or enlargement complies with all setback, parking, height and other 
applicable regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. 
(3) ?Such enlargement shall be on land owned by the nonconforming use at the time of adoption of 
this section from which this chapter is derived. 
(4) ?That such enlargement will not further reduce the value, livability or function of an existing or 
potential conforming use of adjoining property. 
(5) ?A request submitted to the board of appeals under this section shall be processed according to 
the procedures contained in section 90-89 of this chapter. 
(c) ?Nonconforming uses which are not located within a building including but not limited to open air 
businesses, contractor equipment yards and salvage yards, shall not be increased in size so that the 
use occupies more land area than the area occupied by the use prior to the adoption of this chapter. 
(Code 1970, § 3.55; Ord. No. 326, § I, 1-24-00) 


Sec. 90-172. - Nonconforming use discontinued. 
    No building, structure or premises where a nonconforming use has ceased for more than 12 months 
or has been changed to a use permitted in the district in which it is located shall be devoted to a 
nonconforming use. 
(Code 1970, § 3.56) 


Sec. 90-173. - Nonconforming uses eliminated. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of section 90-917, such nonconforming uses as signs, billboards, and 
primarily open land uses such as junkyards or similar uses shall be discontinued three years from the 
date of passage of the ordinance from which this chapter was derived. All such uses, both conforming 
and nonconforming, shall be issued a permit without fee, the permit to expire on the above date. At the 
expiration of such time, new five-year permits will be issued for a fee as set by resolution of the council to 
all such uses that conform to the ordinance from which this chapter was derived. All uses without permits 
shall be removed within six months. 
(Code 1970, § 3.57) 


Sec. 90-174. - Plans already filed. 
    If plans and specifications for a building or structure have been filed that would conform with the 
zoning regulations effective at the date of such filing but not with the regulations of this chapter, and if a 
building permit for such building or structure has been issued and construction work started at the 
effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, such work may proceed provided it is 
completed within one year of that date. 
(Code 1970, § 3.58) 


Sec. 90-175. - Existing platted lots. 
(a) ?Any residential lot laid out on an approved plat or existing at the time of the adoption of the 
ordinance from which this chapter was derived that fails to comply with the minimum requirements of 
this chapter may be used for a single-family dwelling, provided the lot is in single ownership as 
defined in this chapter and further provided that 88 percent of all yard requirements are complied 
with. Any existing platted lot in common ownership which contains 88 percent or more of the required 
area and width may also be utilized as a separate lot. 
(b) ?The use of more than one lot in common ownership where the same do not comply with 88 percent 
of the minimum requirements of this chapter shall be determined by the board on the basis of 
neighborhood character. For the purpose of this section, the board shall use the following standards 
to determine neighborhood character: 
(1) ?Two lots. If each of the two adjacent lots in question has both frontage and area measurements 
that equal or exceed the individual frontage and area measurements of at least 60 percent of 
the total number of developed lots within 400 feet on both sides of the same street, each lot in 
question shall be construed to be in character with the neighborhood. If not, the two lots shall be 
considered a single lot. 
(2) ?Three lots. If each of the three lots in common ownership has both frontage and area 
measurements that equal or exceed the individual frontage and area measurements of at least 
60 percent of the total number of developed lots within 400 feet on both sides of the same 
street, each lot shall be construed to be in character with the neighborhood. If not, the three lots 
shall be considered one or two lots meeting the zone district requirements. 
(3) ?Four or more lots. If each of the four or more lots in common ownership are less than the 
minimum requirements, they shall be resubdivided into one, two or three lots meeting the zone 
district requirements.

Sec. 90-212. - Map. 
    The zoning map delineating the zone districts listed in section 90-211 is declared to be a part of this 
chapter. Except where references on the map to a street line or other designated line by dimensions 
shown on the map, the district boundary lines follow lot lines or the centerlines of streets or alleys as they 
existed at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived; but where a district

    Subdivisions and site condominiums will be required to be served by these public utilities. Open 
space subdivisions are encouraged for site condominiums and platted subdivisions. 
    The R1-A zone is also proposed to serve as a receiving area for the transfer of development credits 
from agricultural and rural preservation areas in the county. Additional density will be permitted for 
projects which accept these development credits.

form of constructing the road itself to the parcel boundary or providing a right-of-way to the 
parcel boundary so the road may be constructed at a future date. 
(2) ?Sidewalks at least five feet wide, on both sides of the street, shall be installed within the street 
right-of-way for all plats and site condominiums in accordance with the applicable regulations of 
the City of Hastings Land Division Ordinance and article 8 of the Hastings Zoning Ordinance,

Sec. 90-293A. - Open space neighborhoods (OSN) within plats and site condominiums. 
(1) ?Intent. The intent of this section is to provide incentives for dedicated open space to be preserved 
within any new residential plat or site condominium development as recommended by the Hastings 
Area Plan. These regulations, which are voluntary, will allow an applicant to likely achieve a few 
more lots than would otherwise be possible under conventional plat or site condominium 
development. Further, this section seeks to achieve the following objective: 
(a) ?Identify and preserve natural features of the site proposed for development. 
(b) ?Provide for recreational areas and civic open space within new neighborhoods that are usable, 
centrally located and accessible to all residents of the neighborhood and which can promote a 
sense of community and opportunities for interaction among neighbors. 
(c) ?Provide for neighborhood design which has a definable center and an edge, and which 
provides pedestrian links throughout the development. 
(2) ?Authorization. An open space neighborhood shall be a use permitted by right within the R1-A, one-
family residential zone, when developed according to the regulations set forth in the City of Hastings 
Land Division Ordinance and article 8 of the Hastings Zoning Ordinance, site condominium projects.

(4) ?Open space requirements. 
(a) ?An OSN shall provide and maintain a minimum of ten percent of the gross site acreage as 
preserved dedicated open space. 
(b) ?A portion of the dedicated open space, but not more than five percent of the gross site 
acreage, may consist of woods, wetlands, steep slopes, existing ponds, creeks or floodplain 
areas. 
Dedicated open spaces shall also consist of play areas with play structures, open grass covered 
fields, ball fields, tennis courts, swimming pools and related buildings, community buildings, and 
similar recreational facilities, as well as natural areas such as fields and woods. 
It is the intent of this section to provide for recreational areas and civic open spaces within an 
OSN project that are usable, centrally located and accessible to all residents of the 
neighborhood and to preserve natural site features such as woods, stands of trees, wetlands, 
ravines, steep hills and similar areas which provide for wildlife habitat, shade, walking trails and 
pleasing views. 
(c) ?At least one contiguous area of open space shall be centrally located within the development, 
and shall be maintained as a village square, playground, or park. 
(d) ?The planning commission may require that specific natural features of the site be preserved as 
part of the dedicated open space. Such features may include stands of trees or woods, 
specimen trees, wetlands, steep slopes, natural drainage courses or open fields. 
(e) ?Except for those natural site feature areas noted above, an individual open space area shall 
not be more than 60,000 square feet or less than 10,000 square feet. An OSN project shall 
contain at least one individual open space area of at least 20,000 square feet. 
(f) ?Narrow bands of open space around the perimeters of sites will generally not qualify as usable 
dedicated open space, unless those areas are portions of walking trails that connect to larger 
areas of open space.

applicant can demonstrate that the intent of the open space neighborhood ordinance is met. 
However, the amount of dedicated open space shall not be reduced below the requirement in 
subsection 90-291A(1). 
(j) ?Areas not counted as open space. 
i. ?The area within all public or private road rights-of-way. 
ii. ?The area within a platted lot, or site condominium unit occupied or to be occupied by a 
building or structure. 
iii. ?Off-street parking areas. 
iv. ?Detention and retention ponds created to serve the project. 
v. ?Sidewalks, excepting those walkways that are a portion of a dedicated trail system. 
However, trail systems alone may not constitute the entire percentage of the dedicated 
open space. 
(k) ?Guarantee of open space. The applicant shall provide an open space preservation and 
maintenance agreement to the city council stating that all dedicated open space portions of the 
development shall be maintained in the manner approved. Documents shall be presented that 
bind all successors and future owners in title to commitments made as part of the proposal. This 
provision shall not prohibit a transfer of ownership or control, provided notice of such transfer is 
provided to the city council and the land uses continue as approved in the plat or site 
condominium, unless an amendment is approved by the city council. 
The agreement must be acceptable to the city council and may consist of a dedicated park, a 
recorded deed restriction, covenants that run perpetually with the land or a conservation 
easement established according to the Michigan Conservation and Historic Preservation Act, 
Public Act 197 of 1980 as amended. 
The agreement shall: 
i. ?Indicate the allowable use(s) of the dedicated open space. 
ii. ?Require that the dedicated open space be maintained by parties who have an 
ownership interest in the open space, whether those parties are of a private or 
municipal nature. 
iii. ?Provide standards for scheduled maintenance of the dedicated open space including 
necessary maintenance of vegetation, and repair, maintenance or management of site 
amenities and facilities. 
iv. ?Provide for maintenance to be undertaken by the city council in its discretion in the 
event that the dedicated open space is inadequately maintained, or is determined to 
be a public nuisance. Any costs incurred by the city shall be assessed to the owners 
of the property within the OSN. 
(5) ?Design standards for open space neighborhoods. 
(a) ?Within an OSN, lots shall be located to face upon the centrally located village green or play 
area so as to promote visibility, monitoring, and safety of the area. 
This central green or play area shall be adjacent to the public or private roadway. Ideally, the 
central green or play area should be encircled by the roadway or by a sidewalk. 
(b) ?Within the OSN, the edge of any central green or play area shall be located no more than 
1,320 feet (one-quarter mile) from another green, play area, or other dedicated open space. In 
addition, no lot within an OSN shall be located further than 1,320 feet (one-quarter mile) from 
any central green, play area, or natural area. 
(c) ?Stormwater shall be substantially managed with such techniques as vegetated swales, rain 
gardens, stone weirs or dikes, sediment basins and shallow stormwater areas. Stormwater shall 
be minimally managed with conventional stormwater management structures such as gutters, 
catch basins, underground pipes, detention ponds, and retention ponds. 
(d) ?Stormwater detention ponds shall be required, if necessary, for the containment of estimated 
surface water runoff. Such ponds shall be placed at locations that will not detract from visual 
amenities along the streetscape or result in a hazard to pedestrians in the immediate area. 
(Ord. No. 447, § I, 7-27-09) 


Sec. 90-294A. - Condition for amendment of the R1-A district. 
    It is the intent of this division to cooperate with the neighboring jurisdictions to guide growth and 
development in the Hastings area in a manner that benefits all communities. It is hereby determined that 
standards and regulations that permit or encourage competing high density residential or commercial or 
industrial uses of any kind outside the Hastings joint planning area will be in conflict with the intent of this 
division and are expressly prohibited. In keeping with the inter-jurisdictional cooperation that embodies 
the plan and this district, the provisions of this section shall not be amended by the City of Hastings to 
permit such competing uses without the approval of all signatories to the Hastings Area Joint Planning 
Agreement.

DIVISION 9. - A-2 APARTMENT EDGE DISTRICT[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 475, § I, adopted Feb. 27, 2012, amended Div. 9 in its entirety to read as set 
out herein. Former Div. 9, §§ 90-42190-427, pertained to A-2 apartment zoning district and derived 
from Ord. No. 301, § 7(3.1803.186), adopted Feb. 10, 1997; Ord. No. 357, § VII, adopted Sept. 23, 
2002; Ord. No. 399, § 2, adopted July 25, 2005. 


Sec. 90-421. - Purpose. 
    The intent of this district is to implement one of the recommendations of the 2007 Community 
Comprehensive Plan for the City of Hastings. Specifically, the plan calls for the establishment of a 
transitional edge area south and west of the central business district and along Hanover Street from East 
State Street and West Green Street. The existing physical form of much of this area is a neighborhood of 
single-family houses, churches, offices, and a funeral home. The area serves as a transition from the 
CBD to the well-maintained single-family neighborhoods south of Green Street and west of Broadway and 
west of Hanover Street. 
    The comprehensive community plan calls for the retention of the existing single-family structures but 
allowing for their conversion to offices and multi-family use. Permitted uses will be the same or similar to 
those allowed in the apartment-office district. Demolition of existing buildings to provide off-street parking 
is discouraged. New construction is to be designed to ensure compatibility with the residential scale and 
character of existing buildings. 
(Ord. No. 475, § I, 2-27-12) 


Sec. 90-422. - Permitted uses. 
    Land and structures in the apartment edge district may be used for the following purposes only:

833; 
(9) ?Accessory uses, buildings and structures customarily incidental to any of the above uses as 
regulated by article IX, division 3 of this chapter; 
(10) ?Essential public service equipment. 
(11) ?Public schools per section 90-810. 
(Ord. No. 475, § I, 2-27-12; Ord. No. 539, § 2, 12-27-16) 


Sec. 90-423. - Special uses.

(4) ?Private schools. 
(5) ?Antennas and towers exceeding a height of 35 feet;

(12) ?Accessory buildings which are more than one story in height and which are similar in 
architectural style to the principal building on the property per section 90-1090 herein.

Sec. 90-424. - District regulations. 
    Buildings and structures shall not be erected or enlarged in the apartment edge district unless the 
following requirements are met and maintained: 
(1) ?Minimum lot area and width shall be for: 
a. ?A single-family dwelling: 6,600 square feet and 66 feet of lot width. 
b. ?A duplex building: 13,000 square feet and 99 feet of lot width. 
c. ?A multi-family building: for each dwelling unit within the building, 5,445 square feet, which is

single-family dwellings to duplexes, multi-family or non-residential use. 
(2) ?Minimum and maximum setbacks: 
a. ?The front setback shall be no more than 15 feet and no less than five feet. 
The planning commission may allow a greater building setback than permitted by 
subsection 90-424(2)a., above, if compliance with such setbacks creates a practical 
difficulty in the operation of the proposed use. In considering whether or not to permit a 
greater setback, the commission shall consider the following criteria: 
1. ?Whether the proposed use is located on a parcel which has frontage on one or more 
streets; 
2. ?Whether the driveway(s) which are required to serve the site necessitate a greater 
building setback in order to safely accommodate on site maneuvering for vehicles and 
pedestrians; 
3. ?Whether a greater setback is needed in order to locate parking spaces, access drives 
or sidewalks between the building and the front lot line in order to improve safety for 
customers accessing the building; 
4. ?Whether the shape or size of the parcel or requirements of the zoning ordinance or 
other city ordinances create difficulties in complying with the required setback 
regulations. 
b. ?The side setback shall be a minimum of six feet on both sides. 
c. ?The rear setback shall be a minimum of 12 feet. 
d. ?In order to achieve the objectives of the apartment edge zone, some flexibility in the side 
and rear setback requirements may be necessary in certain instances. Therefore, the 
planning commission in its review of the final site plan shall have the discretion to modify 
the required side and rear setbacks. In deciding whether or not to modify setbacks the 
planning commission shall take into consideration the impact on adjoining land uses, 
whether the proposed setback disrupts the interior circulation pattern on that block, 
whether safe vehicular and pedestrian access is maintained, whether the setbacks will 
allow safe access for fire fighting purposes, and whether or not the proposed setbacks will 
create unusable or unsafe areas. 
(3) ?Maximum building height shall be 35 feet. 
(Ord. No. 475, § I, 2-27-12; Ord. No. 287, § I, 12-26-12)

    Off-street parking shall be as required by article X except that in the review of a site plan the 
planning commission may reduce the parking requirements by no more than 30 percent if it can be 
demonstrated that based on the use the required number of parking spaces is not needed. The 
commission may take into consideration that some portion of the required parking spaces can be 
reasonably provided by on-street parking spaces or municipal parking lots located within 300 feet of the 
proposed building. 
    Parking on site must be located behind the principal building and be designed so vehicles do not 
need to back into the public street when exiting the site.

wood or asphalt composition), slate, tiles or other material similar to the roofs on nearby buildings. 
(c) ?Exterior wall materials may consist of brick, stucco, wood, vinyl aggregate or split-face block, stone

Sec. 90-474. - District regulations. 
    Buildings and structures shall not be erected or enlarged in the B-1 zoning district unless the 
following requirements are met and maintained: 
(1) ?No minimum lot area and width is required. 
(2) ?A minimum and a maximum front building setback for lots in the B-1 zoning district is required 
in order to carry out one of the principal recommendations of the Hastings Comprehensive 
Community Plan which is to establish a "build to line" for new and expanding uses in the B-1 
zoning district. The establishment of the following front setback requirements will preserve the 
downtown character of the city and provide flexibility for new buildings and expansions of 
existing buildings to closely match the existing building setback line. The required setbacks will 
vary by street segments as the location of existing buildings differs along certain streets. The 
required minimum and maximum build to line is intended to provide uniformity in the visual 
character along streets in the B-1 zoning district. 
a. ?The required setback from the right-of-way along the following street segments shall be a 
minimum of zero feet and a maximum of five feet from each right-of-way line abutting the 
lot; a minimum of 80 percent of the front wall of the building must be within the required 
setback, which is also called a build to line, along each street frontage. 
Street segments 
-? State Street: Church Street to Boltwood Street both sides of street. 
-? Jefferson Street: Center Street to Apple Street both sides of street. 
-? Church Street: Center Street to Apple Street east side only. 
-? Michigan Avenue: Center Street to Apple Street west side only. 
-? East Court Street: Church Street to Michigan Avenue both sides of street. 
b. ?The required setback from the right-of-way along all other street segments for parcels in 
the B-1 zone shall be a minimum of zero feet and a maximum of 20 feet from each right-of-
way line abutting the lot; a minimum of 60 percent of the front wall of the building must be 
within the required setback, which is also called a build-to line, along each street frontage. 
The planning commission may allow a greater building setback than permitted by this 
subsection 90-474(2)b. above, if compliance with such setbacks creates a practical 
difficulty in the operation of the proposed use. In considering whether or not to permit a 
greater setback, the commission shall consider following criteria: 
1. ?Whether the proposed use is located on a parcel which has frontage on more than 
one street; 
2. ?Whether the driveway(s) which are required to serve the site necessitate a greater 
building setback in order to safely accommodate on site maneuvering for vehicles and 
pedestrians; 
3. ?Whether a greater setback is needed in order to locate parking spaces, access drives 
or sidewalks between the building and the front lot line in order to improve safety for 
customers accessing the building; 
4. ?Whether the shape or size of the parcel or requirements of the zoning ordinance or 
other city ordinances create difficulties in complying with the required setback 
regulations. 
c. ?No side yard is required; except where a property abuts a residentially zoned lot, a 
minimum ten-foot side yard shall be required. 
d. ?The rear yard shall be 12 feet. 
e. ?Any building which does not meet the front setback requirements of this section, but which 
existed before the effective date of this subsection 90-474(2), shall be allowed to expand 
provided the expansion will result in the building being within or closer to the setback or 
build to line required for the street on which the building fronts. Approval from the zoning 
board of appeals is not required for this type of expansion; however, all other requirements 
of this zoning ordinance shall apply. 
(3) ?Maximum building height shall be 40 feet. 
(4) ?No maximum lot coverage requirement. 
(5) ?Wherever the B-1 zoning district abuts a residential, apartment or industrial district, 
landscaping shall be provided as required by article XII of this chapter. 
(6) ?Within the B-1 zoning district, a building projection may be constructed to project into the street 
right-of-way provided the following conditions are met. For the purposes of this section, a 
building projection shall mean a projection out from the building face that has a clearance area 
over the sidewalk, such as an overhang, canopy, awning or balcony. 
a. ?All building projections are subject to the following: 
1. ?The projection into the street right-of-way shall not exceed four feet. 
2. ?The projection shall not be closer than four feet from the face of the curb as measured 
from the curb face perpendicular to the projection. 
3. ?The projection may be used as a sign, but must meet the requirements of article XI of 
this chapter, and in no event shall the end of the projection be used as a sign.

measured from the sidewalk. 
5. ?There shall be no extension or additions to the projection that would exceed the above 
requirements.

in or adjacent to the street as determined by the zoning administrator. 
11. ?Projections shall not violate regulations adopted by the zoning administrator pursuant 
to this Code. 
b. ?Balconies which project into the right-of-way are further subject to the following: 
1. ?A balcony shall have a minimum clearance height of 12 feet as measured from the

iv. ?Have any outdoor cooking devices of any kind. 
3. ?The balcony owner agrees to hold harmless the city, defend, pay on behalf of, its 
elected and appointed officials, employees and volunteers, and others working on 
behalf of the city against any and all claims, demands, suits, losses, including all costs 
connected therewith, for any damages which may be asserted, claimed or recovered 
against or from the city, its elected and appointed officials, employees, volunteers or 
others working on behalf of the city, by reason of personal injury, including bodily 
injury and death, and/or property damage, including loss of use therefore which arises 
out of or is in any way connected or associated with their balcony. 
4. ?The balcony owner shall show proof of and maintain comprehensive general liability 
insurance and have the city as an additional named insured. The amount of such 
insurance shall be determined by the city council. 
5. ?All balconies installed within the public right-of-way shall be in compliance with all 
code requirements established by this Code and the Michigan Building Code. 
6. ?A balcony may be required by the city to be removed at any time upon a finding that a 
balcony does not meet the standards of this Code, any other provisions of this Code, 
or other applicable law or regulation, or that the right-of-way is needed for other street 
or utility purposes. Upon such removal, all costs and expenses of removal, and 
restoration of the right-of-way shall be borne by the owner.

Sec. 90-476. - Design standards. 
(a) ?Purpose. The downtown area in the city is characterized by a variety of historical architectural styles 
and building materials which combine to create visual harmony and establish a sense of place for the 
Hastings community. In order to maintain this harmony, it is essential that renovations and additions 
to existing non-residential buildings and the construction of new nonresidential buildings be done in a 
manner which is visually compatible with such existing buildings. 
    The purpose of the B-1 design standards is to provide regulations so that as existing non-residential 
buildings are renovated, remodeled and restored and new non-residential buildings are constructed, 
these physical improvements adhere to a consistent set of design standards which will enhance and 
preserve the historical character of downtown Hastings. 
    To avoid duplication of the review process required by the downtown development authority (DDA) 
facade grant program but to ensure consistency of design for substantive building improvements, these 
regulations will only apply to those building improvements which are not subject to the DDA facade grant 
program except that windows which require a building permit to be replaced or increased or decreased in 
size shall be subject to subsection 90-476(d)(2) even if awarded a facade grant. 
(b) ?Applicability. The requirements of this section shall apply to the following uses within the area zoned 
B-1 central business district, as illustrated on the zoning map: 
(1) ?Newly constructed non-residential buildings. 
(2) ?Exterior alterations to existing non-residential buildings which require a building permit, except 
for those alterations which are subject to the downtown development authority (DDA) facade 
grant program. 
(c) ?Application and review procedures. 
(1) ?Site plan review. Development projects subject to review under this section shall be reviewed 
by the planning commission, except for windows as noted below, according to the procedures 
and requirements for site plan review as set forth in section 90-129 herein and the requirements 
of this section. 
(2) ?In addition to the submittal requirements of section 90-129, the application shall also include 
building plans and architectural drawings to demonstrate compliance with the design standards 
of this section. 
(d) ?Design standards. 
(1) ?Buildings. Alterations and additions to existing buildings and any new buildings to be 
constructed within the B-1 zoning district shall be designed to substantially incorporate such 
styles and building materials as are contained in the design guidelines for commercial buildings 
as adopted by the planning commission. These design guidelines shall be maintained by the 
zoning administrator and shall be available for review by the public. 
(2) ?Windows. Windows which are proposed to be added to a building, replaced or increased or 
decreased in size such that a building permit is required and which face one or more of the 
following public street segments shall be reviewed by the zoning administrator to determine 
compliance with the following requirements: 
Street segments: 
State Street: Church Street to Boltwood Street both sides of street. 
Jefferson Street: Center Street to Apple Street both sides of street. 
Church Street: Center Street to Apple Street east side only. 
Michigan Avenue: Center Street to Apple Street west side only. 
East Court Street: Church Street to Michigan Avenue. 
a. ?All windows.

story in height although windows higher than one story may be permitted if the design 
is such that the windows appear as separate stories. 
2. ?Windows shall be transparent and non-reflective glass. Only clear or lightly tinted, 
non-reflective glass in windows, doors, and display windows shall be considered 
transparent. 
3. ?Windows shall not be blocked by interior displays or otherwise have views to the 
interior obstructed for a depth of not less than five feet into the building. 
b. ?First-story windows. 
1. ?In order to provide clear view inward, the first story of a facade window opening shall 
cover a minimum of 40 percent and a maximum of 90 percent of the wall area. 
2. ?The bottom of the window opening shall be between 30 and 40 inches from the level 
of the sidewalk beneath the window. 
3. ?Upper-story windows. Between 20 percent and 40 percent of the facade wall area for 
all stories above the first story shall be devoted to transparent windows. If such 
windows are rectangular, they shall be oriented in a vertical fashion. In addition, all 
such windows shall contain visible sills and lintels on the exterior wall and no single 
pane of glass shall exceed 36 square feet in area. 
4. ?Facade transparency requirements do not apply for portions of structures in ground 
floor residential use, assembly area of theaters, auditoriums, churches, and similar 
non-commercial and office uses. 
(e) ?Modification of standards. The standards and recommendations of this section may be modified by 
the planning commission or the zoning administrator as applicable in their review of a site plan. In 
determining whether to approve a modification, the planning commission or zoning administrator 
shall document findings of fact regarding the following factors: 
(1) ?The modification shall satisfy the purposes stated in subsection 90-476(a). 
(2) ?The modification must result in the alteration of an existing building or the construction of new 
building which is visually compatible and comparable with nearby existing buildings and which 
maintains or improves upon the historical architectural character of downtown Hastings through 
the use of historical or contemporary similar building materials.

(7) ?Wood except materials such as T-111, plywood or particle board and similar processed wood 
materials. 
(8) ?Similar materials as approved by the planning commission. 
(d) ?Wall designs and features. That portion of a building which fronts on a public street shall be 
designed to eliminate large expanses of blank walls. Among other methods, this can be 
accomplished from the application of two or more of the following approximately every 50 feet in wall 
length: 
(1) ?Doors with corniced parapets over the main entry door. 
(2) ?Display windows that orient street-level customers to products. 
(3) ?Arched entryways, canopies or awnings. 
(4) ?Providing changes in the plane of a wall such as offsets, or projecting ribs which are at least 12 
inches in width. 
(5) ?Change in texture, color or masonry pattern. 
(6) ?Pilasters, piers or columns. 
(7) ?Other applications as approved by the planning commission which meet the intent of this 
section. 
(8) ?Facade walls more than 100 feet in total length must also incorporate wall plane projections or 
recesses having a depth of at least three percent of the length of the facade and extending at 
least 20 percent of the length of the facade. 
(9) ?Side or rear walls that face rear walkways or rear or side service drives may include false 
windows and door openings defined by frames, sills and lintels, or similarly proportioned 
modulations of the wall, but only when actual doors and windows are not feasible. 
(e) ?Facades. All facades shall have a recognizable "top" or upper portion consisting of one or more of 
the following: 
(1) ?Cornice treatments, other than just colored "stripes" or "bands," with integrally textured

units, from public view. The average height of such parapets shall not exceed 25 percent of the 
height of the supporting wall and such parapets shall not at any point exceed one-third of the 
height of the supporting wall. 
(h) ?Parking. 
(1) ?No more than two rows of off street parking shall be located within the front yard, which is 
defined as the area between the principal building and the front lot line across the entire width of 
the lot. In certain circumstances, the planning commission may allow permitted and special land 
uses to have more than two rows of parking between the building and the front lot line. In 
determining when such parking should be allowed, the commission shall consider the following 
criteria: 
a. ?Whether the need for truck loading and unloading docks and maneuvering areas for trucks 
does not allow for required parking spaces to be located to the side or in the rear of the 
building; 
b. ?The width of the lot relative to the size of the building; 
c. ?The parking requirements for large "big box type" stores create difficulties in providing the 
majority of the required parking in the side or rear yards; 
d. ?Whether additional front yard parking would result in the preservation of a natural site 
feature(s); 
e. ?Whether parking in the side or rear yard is impractical due to a wetland or steep slope or 
other similar natural feature. 
(2) ?For parcels located on a corner lot the above requirements shall only apply to that street which, 
in the opinion of the zoning administrator, carries the most traffic. For the remaining street the 
parking lot may be located in the front yard subject to the setback regulations of the zoning 
district in which it is to be located. 
(i) ?Sidewalks. 
(1) ?Sidewalks shall be provided along all streets abutting a parcel in accordance with city 
standards. Sidewalks shall be a minimum of five feet wide although the planning commission 
may require that an easement be provided within the front yard abutting the right-of-way to allow 
for the placement of a future non-motorized trail along M-37/M-43. 
(2) ?The commission may also require, where practical and feasible, that a walkway be provided 
extending from the public sidewalk to the entrance of the building on the site in order to provide 
for safe pedestrian access. 
(j) ?Additional considerations. In order to promote non-motorized access to businesses along the M-
37/M-43 corridor bike racks at individual stores are encouraged to be provided as well as lighting of 
non-motorized trials which traverse or abut the property. 
(k) ?Modification of standards. The design standards and requirements of section 90-487 may be 
modified by the planning commission for those projects which require site plan review by the 
commission or by the zoning administrator for projects which only require staff review per subsection 
90-127(2) or a building permit per subsection 90-487(b)(3) herein. In determining whether to approve 
a modification, the planning commission or zoning administrator shall submit findings of fact 
regarding the following factors: 
(1) ?The modification shall satisfy the purposes of the B-2 zone as stated herein. 
(2) ?Modification of the standards and requirements shall still result in the alteration of an existing 
building or construction of a new building being visually compatible with adjacent existing 
buildings and buildings on nearby properties. 
(3) ?Modifications of the standards and requirements are necessary as strict compliance would 
create practical physical difficulties in applying the standards and requirements in the 
reconstruction or conversion of an existing building. Any modifications permitted shall comply 
with subsections (a) and (b) above.

DIVISION 13A. - B-3 DOWNTOWN EDGE DISTRICT 


Sec. 90-492. - Purpose. 
    The B-3 zoning district is designed to implement a recommendation of the 2007 comprehensive 
community plan which calls for a transition from the central business district core by allowing the same 
commercial uses as B-1 zoning district but also allowing for the establishment of attached dwelling units 
which in some locations will abut established neighborhoods. The permitted density of the B-3 zoning 
district will allow new residential uses to closely abut and support the downtown shopping district and 
bring more vitality to the central business zoning district. Commercial and office uses in the B-3 zoning 
district will adhere to the same design guidelines and setbacks as the B-1 zoning district to ensure 
consistency in visual character with the B-1 zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 476, § I, 2-27-12) 


Sec. 90-493. - Permitted uses. 
    Land and structures in the B-3 general business district may be used for the following purposes only: 
(1) ?Uses as permitted in the B-1 zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 476, § I, 2-27-12) 


Sec. 90-494. - Special uses. 
    The following uses may be permitted as special land uses in the B-3 downtown edge district subject 
to the applicable general and specific requirements and standards of article XIII of this chapter: 
(1) ?Special uses as permitted in the B-1 zoning district. 
(2) ?Multi-family dwellings including attached single-family dwellings such as townhouses with no 
more than eight units per building. 
(Ord. No. 476, § I, 2-27-12) 


Sec. 90-495. - District regulations. 
    Buildings and structures shall not be erected or enlarged in the B-3 downtown edge district unless 
the following requirements are met and maintained: 
(1) ?The requirements of section 90-474 and 90-475 for the B-1 zoning district. 
(2) ?For a multifamily building, there shall be a minimum of 3,000 square feet of lot area for each 
dwelling unit which is a gross density of 14.52 dwelling units per acre. 
(3) ?Residential buildings shall comply with the following requirements: 
a. ?Minimum roof pitch: 4:12 to 12:12 (rise; run): Roofs which are less than 22 feet above 
grade may be flat or pitched at any slope. 
b. ?Minimum front porch area (if provided): 70 square feet. 
c. ?Minimum floor area: As required for dwellings in the A-1 zoning district. 
d. ?Windows: A minimum of 20 percent and a maximum of 30 percent of the front and side 
facades each shall have transparent non-reflective windows. Windows on upper stories 
shall be vertical with defined edges. 
e. ?Exterior building materials facing a public or private street: Minimum 80 percent brick, 
stone, or lap siding with trim and ornamentation consisting of metal, concrete, brick, stone 
or wood. 
f. ?Facade articulation: Differentiate each row house or townhouse separately with a vertical 
expression line; for other multifamily buildings provide articulation every 50 feet using 
windows, balconies, and a change in building materials or similar provision. 
g. ?Building entrance: For row or townhouses, provide one entrance per unit facing the street; 
for other multi-family buildings, provide one entrance for every 75 feet of building frontage. 
A walkway shall be provided from the existing or proposed sidewalk within the right-of-way 
to the building entrance. 
h. ?Enclosed porches are allowed. 
i. ?Parking: Parking for townhouses, row houses and multifamily buildings must be located 
behind the principal building on the same lot. For all other uses, the parking requirements 
may be met by the community parking requirements of section 90-919. 
j. ?Landscaping: Wherever a B-3 zoning district abuts a residential, apartment or industrial 
district, landscaping shall be provided as required by article XII of this chapter. For 
purposes of the landscape buffer zone table 8-1 in section 90-1010, the B-3 zoning district 
shall be the equivalent of the B-1 zoning district. 
(4) ?The required setback from the right-of-way along all street segments for parcels in the B-3 
district shall be a minimum of zero feet and a maximum of 20 feet from each right-of-way line 
abutting the lot; a minimum of 60 percent of the front wall of the building must be within the 
required setback, which is also called a build-to line, along each street frontage. 
The planning commission may allow a greater building setback than permitted by subsection 
90-495(4) above if compliance with such setbacks creates a practical difficulty in the operation 
of the proposed use. In considering whether or not to permit a greater setback, the commission 
shall consider following criteria: 
a. ?Whether the proposed use is located on a parcel which has frontage on one or more 
streets; 
b. ?Whether the driveway(s) which are required to serve the site necessitate a greater building 
setback in order to safely accommodate on site maneuvering for vehicles and pedestrians; 
c. ?Whether a greater setback is needed in order to locate parking spaces, access drives or 
sidewalks between the building and the front lot line in order to improve safety for 
customers accessing the building; 
d. ?Whether the shape or size of the parcel or requirements of the zoning ordinance or other 
city ordinances create difficulties in complying with the required setback regulations. 
e. ?Non-residential buildings shall comply with the requirements of section 90-476 which are 
the design standards for the B-1 district.

Sec. 90-496. - Additional regulations. 
(a) ?Signs shall be regulated by article XI of this chapter. 
(b) ?Site plan review requirements are contained in article IV of this chapter and are required for all 
special land uses. In addition to the submittal requirements of section 90-129 the application shall 
also include building plans and architectural drawings to demonstrate compliance with the design 
standards of this section. 
(c) ?Site condominiums shall be regulated by article VIII of this chapter. 
(d) ?Modification of standards. The design standards and requirements of section 90-485 may be 
modified by the planning commission for those projects which require site plan review by the 
commission. In determining whether to approve a modification, the planning commission shall submit 
findings of fact regarding the following factors: 
(1) ?The modification shall satisfy the purposes of the B-3 district as stated herein. 
(2) ?Modification of the standards and requirements shall still result in the alteration of an existing 
building or construction of a new building being visually compatible with adjacent existing 
buildings and buildings on nearby properties. 
(3) ?Modifications of the standards and requirements are necessary as strict compliance would 
create practical physical difficulties in applying the standards and requirements in the 
reconstruction or conversion of an existing building. Any modifications permitted shall comply 
with subsections (a) and (b) above.

DIVISION 13B. - B-4 WEST BUSINESS DISTRICT 


Sec. 90-501. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the B-4 zoning district is to provide specific design standards for the review and 
approval of commercial buildings in several locations in the City of Hastings: west of the central business 
district along West State Street, Apple Street and North Broadway; the area close to the intersection of 
Woodlawn and Michigan; and other areas as may be designated by the city in order to achieve the 
following community objectives: 
(1) ?To visually and functionally connect the commercial area west of Broadway Street with the 
central business zoning district through building design and placement standards while serving 
as a transition to the commercial uses west of Market Street which have developed outside of a 
traditional downtown pattern. 
(2) ?To allow for the conversion of this area to a more compact, walkable, mixed use commercial 
neighborhood center as recommended by the 2007 Hastings Comprehensive Community Plan. 
(3) ?To encourage commercial building facade treatments that are articulated and enhanced in 
order to reduce the massive scale and impersonal appearance of large retail buildings. 
(4) ?To maintain and improve community character by creating shopping areas which have a 
pedestrian scale. 
(5) ?To encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the design of commercial 
buildings. 
(6) ?To create a sense of "place" and add elements of uniqueness to commercial projects, thereby 
boosting the value, quality and economic sustainability of Hastings's commercial corridors. 
(7) ?To allow for design features which promote energy conservation. 
(Ord. No. 477, § I, 2-27-12) 


Sec. 90-502. - Permitted uses.

and an additional 150 square feet for each additional bedroom. 
(3) ?Second-story residential uses shall comply with all applicable accessibility requirements of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act. 
(c) ?Restaurants including those with outdoor seating. Outdoor dining is permitted where such dining 
does not encroach upon a minimum of five feet of unobstructed sidewalk space adjacent to the curb. 
Outdoor dining may be separated from the sidewalk only with movable planters, fencing or similar 
non-fixed barriers provided they do not exceed a height of 36 inches including plant material. 
(Ord. No. 477, § I, 2-27-12) 


Sec. 90-503. - Special uses. 
    The following uses may be permitted as special land uses in the B-4 zoning district subject to the 
applicable general and specific requirements and standards of article XIII of this chapter: 
(1) ?Any special use in the B-2 zoning district as set forth in section 90-484. 
(Ord. No. 477, § I, 2-27-12) 


Sec. 90-504. - District regulations. 
    Buildings and structures shall not be erected or enlarged in the B-4 zoning district unless the 
following requirements are met and maintained: 
(1) ?No minimum lot area and width is required. 
(2) ?For all streets in the B-4 zoning district other than West State Street, North Broadway, 
Michigan Avenue and Woodlawn Avenue, buildings shall be set back no more than ten feet 
from the street right-of-way line. A minimum of 80 percent of the front wall of the building must 
be within the build-to zone along each street. The required front setback from the right-of-way 
along West State Street, North Broadway, Michigan Avenue and Woodlawn Avenue shall be no 
more than 20 feet and no less than ten feet from the street right-of-way line. A minimum of 80 
percent of the front wall of the building must be within the build-to zone along each street. 
(3) ?The planning commission may allow a greater building setback than permitted by subsection 
90-504(2) above if compliance with such setbacks creates a practical difficulty in the operation 
of the proposed use. In considering whether or not to permit a greater setback, the commission 
shall consider following criteria: 
a. ?Whether the proposed use is located on a parcel which has frontage on one or more 
streets; 
b. ?Whether the driveway(s) which are required to serve the site necessitate a greater building 
setback in order to safely accommodate on site maneuvering for vehicles and pedestrians; 
c. ?Whether a greater setback is needed in order to locate parking spaces, access drives or

and functionally connecting the site to the central business district and serve as a transition 
to the commercial uses west of Market Street. 
(4) ?The side and rear setbacks shall be determined by the planning commission in its review of the 
final site plan or by the zoning administrator for projects which only require staff review per 
subsection 80-127(2) or a building permit per subsection 90-505(a)(3) herein. In determining the 
setbacks the planning commission or zoning administrator shall take into consideration the 
impact on adjoining land uses, whether the proposed setback disrupts the interior circulation 
pattern on that block, whether safe vehicular and pedestrian access is maintained, whether the 
setbacks will allow safe access for firefighting purposes, and whether or not the proposed 
setbacks will create unusable or unsafe areas. 
(5) ?Sidewalks shall be provided along all streets abutting a parcel in accordance with city 
requirements. For sidewalks which need to be placed within the front setback, an easement 
shall be granted by the property owner to the city for public use of the sidewalk. 
(6) ?Sidewalks shall be a minimum of five feet wide although the planning commission may require 
a maximum sidewalk width of ten feet in order to allow for safe and efficient pedestrian 
movement, allow for activities in front of commercial uses and to create a street front 
atmosphere similar to the central business zoning district. Sidewalks shall be concrete although 
other materials such as brick or concrete with brick borders or brick pattern may be required by 
the planning commission in order to provide visual continuity with the brick walkway system in 
the central business zoning district. 
(7) ?Maximum building height shall be 40 feet. 
(8) ?Wherever the B-4 zoning district abuts a residential, apartment or industrial district, 
landscaping shall be provided as required by article XII of this chapter. For purposes of the 
landscape buffer zone table 8-1 in section 90-1010, the B-4 zoning district shall be the 
equivalent of the B-2 zoning district. 
(9) ?All business, service or processing shall be conducted wholly within a completely enclosed 
building, except for automobile parking, off-street loading, drive-through banking and restaurant 
facilities, limited temporary outdoor display of merchandise, limited minor repair of vehicles at 
vehicle repair and service stations, open-air business special land uses, and outdoor seating at 
restaurants.

DIVISION 13C. - B-5 MIXED USE DISTRICT 


Sec. 90-513. - Purpose. 
    The B-5 zoning district is recommended in the 2007 Comprehensive Community Plan as an ideal 
area for redevelopment. Its proximity to Tyden Park and the central business district makes this area 
attractive for a new type of residential use, such as townhouses and lofts, and for live-work multi-story 
buildings with ground-floor retail. 
    The existing physical form of much of this area is a neighborhood of primarily single-family houses 
with a pedestrian scale; views of Tyden Park and the Thornapple River; proximity to retail and service 
uses; houses with front porches extending into the front setback; sidewalks; street trees; and detached 
garages. Offices are single-story with pitched roofs and residential flavor. 
    The B-5 mixed use zoning district regulations are designed to retain this form as new uses replace 
existing ones. Permitted land uses will be regulated according to the particular street in order to ensure 
the uses are appropriate and compatible with the level of traffic and character along that street segment. 
Typically a mix of land uses will be permitted along most street segments with building form and 
placement requirements designed to create residential and shopping areas with a pedestrian scale and 
architectural appearance reflecting the character of downtown Hastings. 
(Ord. No. 478, § I, 2-27-12) 


Sec. 90-514. - Permitted uses.

(1) ?Canopies or porticos. 
(2) ?Overhangs. 
(3) ?Recesses or projections of at least three percent of wall length. 
(4) ?Arcades. 
(5) ?Raised cornice parapets over the door. 
(6) ?Distinctive roof forms. 
(7) ?Arches. 
(8) ?Outdoor patios. 
(9) ?Display windows. 
(g) ?Roofs. 
(1) ?Buildings shall be topped with pitched roofs with overhanging eaves or flat roofs with 
articulated parapets and cornices. Materials for pitched roofs shall include shingles (either wood 
or asphalt composition), slate, tiles, or other material if such other material is similar to the roofs 
on nearby buildings in the business design overlay zone. 
(2) ?Parapets shall be used to conceal flat sections of roofs and rooftop equipment, such as HVAC 
units, from public view. The average height of such parapets shall not exceed 25 percent of the 
height of the supporting wall and such parapets shall not at any point exceed one-third of the 
height of the supporting wall. 
(h) ?Parking. 
(1) ?No more than two rows of off-street parking shall be located within the front yard, which is 
defined as the area between the principal building and the front lot line across the entire width of 
the lot. In certain circumstances the planning commission may allow permitted and special land 
uses to have more than two rows of parking between the building and the front lot line. In 
determining when such parking should be allowed the commission shall consider the following 
criteria: 
a. ?Whether the need for truck loading and unloading docks and maneuvering areas for trucks 
does not allow for required parking spaces to be located to the side or in the rear of the 
building; 
b. ?The width of the lot relative to the size of the building; 
c. ?The parking requirements for large "big box-type" stores create difficulties in providing the 
majority of the required parking in the side or rear yards; 
d. ?Whether additional front yard parking would result in the preservation of a natural site 
feature(s); 
e. ?Whether parking in the side or rear yard is impractical due to a wetland or steep slope or 
other similar natural feature. 
(2) ?For parcels located on a corner lot the above requirements shall only apply to that street which, 
in the opinion of the zoning administrator, carries the most traffic. For the remaining street the 
parking lot may be located in the front yard subject to the setback regulations of the zoning 
district in which it is to be located. 
(i) ?Sidewalks. 
(1) ?Sidewalks shall be provided along all streets abutting a parcel in accordance with city 
standards. Sidewalks shall be a minimum of five feet wide. 
(2) ?The commission may also require, where practical and feasible, that a walkway be provided 
extending from the public sidewalk to the entrance of the building on the site in order to provide 
for safe pedestrian access. 
(j) ?Additional considerations. In order to promote non-motorized access to businesses along South 
Hanover Street corridor, bike racks at individual stores are encouraged to be provided as well as 
lighting of non-motorized trails which traverse or abut the property. 
(k) ?Modification of standards. The design standards and requirements of section 90-487 may be 
modified by the planning commission for those projects which require site plan review by the 
commission. In determining whether to approve a modification, the planning commission shall submit 
findings of fact regarding the following factors: 
(1) ?The modification shall satisfy the purposes of the B-6 zone as stated herein. 
(2) ?Modification of the standards and requirements shall still result in the alteration of an existing 
building or construction of a new building being visually compatible with adjacent existing 
buildings and buildings on nearby properties. 
(3) ?Modifications of the standards and requirements are necessary as strict compliance would 
create practical physical difficulties in applying the standards and requirements in the 
reconstruction or conversion of an existing building. Any modifications permitted shall comply 
with subsections (a) and (b) above.

Sec. 90-601. - Primary intended use. 
    The floodplain district is intended primarily to protect those undeveloped areas of the city subject to 
predictable flooding in the floodplain area of the Thornapple River, Butler Creek and Fall Creek so that 
the reservoir capacity will not be reduced or to impede, retard, accelerate or change the direction of flow 
or carrying capacity of the river valley or to otherwise increase the possibility of flood. These regulations, 
while permitting reasonable use of such properties, will help to protect human life, prevent or minimize 
material and economic losses and reduce the cost to the public in time of emergency through public aid 
and relief efforts occasioned by the unwise occupancy of such flood areas. 
(Code 1970, § 3.224)

special land use as contained in this chapter and subject to the following conditions: 
(1) ?The applicant has first obtained approval from the state department of natural resources in 
accordance with the provisions of Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1994 (MCL 
324.3104). 
(2) ?The use pattern and structure proposed to accomplish the use shall be so designed as not to 
reduce the water impoundment capacity of the floodplain or significantly change the volume or 
speed of the flow of water. 
(3) ?All buildings constructed under special use permits shall have a minimum first floor elevation of 
not less than one foot above the established floodplain elevation. For the purpose of this article, 
the term "first floor elevations" shall mean any floor usable for living purposes, which includes 
basements, working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation areas, or a combination thereof. 
(4) ?Utilities, roads, off-street parking, railroads, structures and buildings for public or recreational 
uses may be permitted when designed so as not to increase the possibility of flood or be 
otherwise detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(5) ?All developments shall be built in such a way to be reasonably safe from flooding and shall be 
consistent with the standards of sections 60.3d and 60.6a of the rules and regulations of the

(except as provided for in the B1 and B2 zoning districts where the vegetation zone will be 
ten feet wide), shall be maintained in trees, shrubs, and other vegetation native to the area. 
It is the intent of the natural vegetation strip to provide a functional vegetative corridor 
along the edge of a stream. Its functions shall be to protect water quality, animal habitat, 
and aesthetic values of the Thornapple River feature by minimizing erosion, stabilizing the 
bank, minimizing nutrient flows into the water, shading the water to maintain low 
temperatures, and screening man-made structures. 
b. ?Dead, diseased, unsafe, or fallen trees, and noxious weeds and shrubs may be removed. 
c. ?Existing lawns at the time of adoption of this division may be allowed to remain.

river. One access point for every 50 feet of river frontage, with 30 feet of separation is 
allowed. 
(7) ?Vegetation strip exception for steep banks. Where there is a steep bank and the bank can be 
used as a functional vegetative buffer, the vegetation strip above the bluff may be reduced 
according to the following schedule: 
Where the bank height at the bluff is (a) feet as measured in vertical feet from the ordinary high 
water mark, the vegetation strip may be reduced to (b) horizontal feet from the bluff in all zoning

DIVISION 17. - ACCESSORY BUILDING OVERLAY ZONE 


Sec. 90-611. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to allow detached accessory buildings reflective of the style and size 
of the existing houses in R2 zoned areas of the city. This type of accessory building would be more than 
one story in height and be similar in architectural style to the existing house on the property. Such 
accessory buildings would maintain the character and historical nature of the R2 zoned areas of the city 
but would not fit other residentially zoned portions of the city. These regulations are not intended as a 
means to simply allow taller or larger accessory buildings in the R2 zone. 
    The regulations of the accessory building overlay zone are designed to ensure that these larger 
accessory buildings are characteristic of their neighborhood, are compatible with nearby properties and 
are given adequate public review. 
(Ord. No. 319, § I, 6-28-99) 


Sec. 90-612. - District boundaries. 
    The regulations of this article shall apply to all parcels which are zoned R2 as illustrated on the 
official city zoning map. 
(Ord. No. 319, § I, 6-28-99) 


Sec. 90-613. - Applicable requirements. 
(a) ?The requirements of this chapter are in addition to and shall supplement those requirements of the 
underlying R2 zoning district imposed by this division and other ordinances of the city. These 
regulations supersede all conflicting regulations of the underlying R2 zoning district to the extent of 
any such conflict. 
(b) ?The regulations of this section shall not apply to accessory buildings in the R2 zoning district which 
comply with the building height requirements of subsection 90-831(d)(1). 
(c) ?The total height of an accessory building permitted under this section shall not exceed the total 
height of the principal building on the same parcel. For purposes of this section, total height shall be 
the vertical distance measured from the average grade to the highest point of the building. 
(d) ?The height of any door opening shall not be greater than eight feet. 
(e) ?Accessory buildings which are more than 14 feet in total height shall be setback a minimum of six 
feet from side lot lines and ten feet from the rear lot line except that the planning commission in its 
discretion may increase or decrease these setback distances if the increase or decrease is 
necessary to meet the intent of this section and to ensure that the accessory building does not have 
a substantial negative impact on nearby properties. 
(f) ?Accessory buildings which have a second story shall have at least one window on two sides of the 
building. Each required window shall be a minimum of 32 inches wide by 48 inches high measured to 
the outside of the window frame. 
(g) ?The exterior of accessory buildings shall be constructed with building materials which match or are 
similar to the exterior building materials of the principal building located on the same lot or on nearby 
lots. 
(h) ?Accessory buildings shall not be constructed with a flat roof. The roof shall be covered with asphalt, 
fiberglass or cedar shingles or another building product which matches or is similar to the roof of the 
principal building on the same lot or nearby lots. 
(Ord. No. 319, § I, 6-28-99) 


Sec. 90-614. - Procedures. 
(a) ?Special land use. Any person wishing to construct an accessory building higher than 14 feet within 
the accessory building overlay zone shall first obtain a special land use in accordance with the 
procedures of article XIII of this chapter except as noted herein. 
(b) ?Site plan. A neat and accurate site drawing drawn to scale shall be submitted with the application 
for a special land use. The drawing shall, at a minimum, contain the following information: 
(1) ?The size, height and location of the proposed accessory building and the existing house on the 
lot. 
(2) ?Distance of the proposed accessory building from all lot lines. 
(3) ?Buildings on adjacent lots. 
(4) ?Roads abutting the lot. 
(5) ?Any driveway serving the proposed accessory building. 
(6) ?Size and location of existing trees on site. 
(7) ?An architectural elevation drawing illustrating building height, type of exterior building materials, 
height of door openings and other information necessary to show how the proposed building 
meets the standards of this section. 
(Ord. No. 319, § I, 6-28-99) 


Sec. 90-615. - Review standards. 
    The planning commission shall hold a public hearing as required by section 90-47 and make a 
decision on the special land use. To approve a special land use under this section the planning 
commission shall find that the request meets the standards of section 90-1049 and the following 
standards: 
(1) ?The proposed accessory building meets the standards of section 90-613. 
(2) ?The size, location, appearance, and architectural style of the proposed accessory building will 
be compatible with the house on the lot and with the existing building characteristics of the 
immediate neighborhood. 
(Ord. No. 319, § I, 6-28-99; Ord. No. 407, § IV, 8-28-06) 


Sec. 90-616. - Conditions. 
    In approving a request for a special land use under this section, the planning commission may 
impose conditions in accordance with section 90-1050 and may modify the proposed size of the 
accessory building in order to achieve the intent of the accessory building overlay zone.

(b) ?The provisions of this article are not intended as a device for ignoring this chapter or the planning 
upon which it has been based. To that end, provisions of this article are intended to result in land use 
development substantially consistent with the City of Hastings Master Plan, with modifications and 
departures from generally applicable site development requirements made in accordance with 
standards provided in this article may be permitted to achieve the intent of the article. A planned unit 
development must comply with this article. 
(Code 1970, § 3.291; Ord. No. 352, § I, 7-22-02) 


Sec. 90-662. - PUD authorization. 
    A planned unit development may be approved in any location within the city by the council. Any land 
use authorized in this article may be included in a planned unit development, as a principal or accessory

In each case, the maximum density for residential uses shall be determined by the council after review by 
the planning commission based on the following standards. The residential uses shall: 
(1) ?Be designed, constructed, and maintained to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance 
with the existing or intended character of the general vicinity and that such a use will not change 
the essential character of the area in which it is proposed. 
(2) ?Be served adequately by essential public facilities and services, such as highways, streets, 
pedestrian ways, police and fire protection, drainage structures, refuse disposal, water and 
sewer. 
(3) ?Not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for public facilities and services. 
(4) ?Be developed in accordance with the intent for a PUD as contained in this article. 
(b) ?Dwelling unit computation. The density permitted by the council shall be applied to the net 
development area of the site in order to determine the maximum number of dwelling units permitted 
for the site. The net development area is determined by subtracting the following from the gross or 
total site area: 
(1) ?Area within existing road rights-of-way. 
(2) ?Land within the 100-year floodplain. 
(3) ?Areas permanently inundated by water. 
(4) ?Areas devoted to nonresidential uses. 
(c) ?Open space. Each PUD shall contain open space areas equal to minimum of ten percent of the total 
site area devoted to residential use. Such open space shall be maintained by the developer or 
homeowner's association and shall be set aside for the common use of the home or lot owners 
within the PUD with written assurances that the required open space shall remain open and be 
properly maintained. For purposes of this section, open space shall only be considered to be those 
areas having a minimum dimension 50 feet by 100 feet. Land in streets, sidewalks, and parking 
areas shall not be considered as open space. 
(d) ?Mixed uses. 
(1) ?Residential and nonresidential uses may be permitted within the same PUD district upon 
demonstration to the city council that such uses meet the intent of this article and the standards 
of section 90-663(b). It shall also be demonstrated that the nonresidential uses will not 
negatively impact the residential uses and that the nonresidential uses will be separated and 
buffered from residential uses in a manner consistent with good land planning principles. 
(2) ?The permitted density for residential uses in a mixed use development shall be determined by 
the council upon recommendation of the planning commission, based on the type of dwelling 
unit proposed and the standards contained in subsection (a) of this section. 
(Code 1970, § 3.294; Ord. No. 352, § II, 7-22-02)

Sec. 90-672. - Phasing and commencement of construction. 
(a) ?Phasing. If a project is proposed for construction in phases, the planning and design shall be such 
that, upon completion, each phase shall be capable of standing on its own in terms of the presence 
of services, facilities and open space, and shall contain the necessary components to ensure 
protection of natural resources and the health, safety and welfare of the users of the PUD and the 
residents of the surrounding area. In addition, in developments that include residential and 
nonresidential uses, phasing shall base such that at least 35 percent of all proposed residential units 
are completed concurrent with the first phase of any nonresidential construction; completion of at 
least 75 percent of all proposed residential construction prior to the second phase of nonresidential 
construction; and completion of 100 percent of all residential construction prior to the third or final 
phase of nonresidential construction. The percentages shall be approximations and determined at 
the discretion of the council. The percentages may be significantly varied should the council 
determine that the applicant has presented adequate assurances that the residential components or 
components of the project shall be completed within a specified period. 
(b) ?Commencement and completion of construction. Construction shall be commenced within one year 
following final approval of a PUD or within one year of any other necessary governmental approval 
for commencement of the project, whichever is later, provided all other necessary approvals have 
been actively pursued. If construction is not commenced within such time, approval of the final plan 
for the project shall expire. An extension for a specified period may be granted by the council upon 
good cause shown if such request is made to the council prior to the expiration of the initial period. 
Moreover, if a final plan has expired, the council may rezone the property in any reasonable manner. 
If at the discretion of the council the property remains classified as PUD, prior to the commencement 
of construction, a new application shall be required and shall be reviewed in light of the then 
prevailing conditions and applicable law and ordinance provisions. 
(Code 1970, § 3.299C) 


Sec. 90-673. - Effect of approval. 
    The PUD amendment and all conditions imposed, if any, shall constitute the land use authorization 
for the property. All improvements and uses shall be in conformity with this article except for allowable 
changes according to the provisions of this article. 
(1) ?Date of approval of the PUD by the council. 
(2) ?Legal description of the property. 
(3) ?Legal description of the required open space along with a plan stating how this open space is 
to be maintained. 
(4) ?A statement that the property will be developed in accordance with the approved PUD site plan 
and any conditions imposed by the council unless an amendment thereto is duly approved by 
the city upon the request and/or approval of the applicant or applicant's transferees and/or 
assigns. 
(Code 1970, § 3.299D; Ord. No. 352, § V, 7-22-02) 


Sec. 90-674. - Modification of a PUD. 
(a) ?Minor changes to a PUD site plan may be approved administratively by the building inspector 
provided the changes comply with all applicable requirements of this chapter and all other city 
regulations or state law. Minor changes subject to administrative review include dimension changes, 
building relocation, parking and driveways, change in landscaping, signs, lighting, decrease in 
building size and increase in building size that does not exceed 5,000 square feet or five percent of 
the gross floor area, whichever is smaller. 
(b) ?A major change to an approved PUD shall comply with the filing procedures for a PUD as contained 
in this article. Major changes include but are not limited to increase in density or number of dwelling 
units, increase in land area or building size, except as noted above, or addition of other uses not 
authorized by the original PUD approval. The zoning administrator shall determine if other similar 
changes constitute a major amendment and may consult with the chair of the planning commission 
in making this decision.

PUD to the central business district. The Court Street PUD is intended to apply to a specific area along 
the north side of Court Street which abuts commercial land uses fronting on West State Street. 
    The area south of Court Street is a stable neighborhood characterized by well kept single-family 
houses. Such neighborhoods are an integral component of the City of Hastings and contribute to the 
vitality of the downtown area and the city as a whole. It is important that the development on the north 
side of Court Street be of a type and design that protects and enhances the character and vitality of the 
neighborhood to the south.

nearby residential uses and which are visually and functionally integrated into the 
neighborhood. 
(b) ?The appearance of the buildings facing State Street shall be as attractive as the buildings on 
the Court Street side. 
(c) ?Uses within the Court Street PUD should be a mix of retail, service, office and residential 
complemented by public space such as courtyards, squares, fountains, sitting areas or 
walkways to encourage shopping and social interaction and become an extension of the central 
business district. 
(d) ?Traffic control and traffic calming measures, including the number and placement of driveways 
onto public streets abutting the PUD, shall be well planned so that traffic volumes on Court 
Street do not significantly increase, turning movements to and from State Street are minimized, 
pedestrian safety along Court Street and State Street is not adversely affected and cut through 
traffic is minimized. 
(e) ?Walkability should be significant feature within the Court Street PUD. Safe and efficient design 
for pedestrian movement should be provided in order to ensure a physical connection to the 
central business district to the east and the commercial uses to the west and to benefit 
pedestrian movement between commercial and residential uses within the PUD.

Sec. 90-730.4. - District regulations. 
    Uses in the Court Street PUD District shall comply with the following regulations: 
(a) ?Minimum lot size/placement of commercial buildings/use of existing buildings. 
(1) ?New commercial, office and other nonresidential uses shall only be constructed on a lot 
which has a minimum width of 132 feet on both State Street and Court Street with a 
minimum lot depth of 264 feet throughout the lot. If this lot is subsequently developed for a 
nonresidential use the lot depth may then be reduced but only to allow new residential 
development to occur on that portion of the lot fronting on Court Street. A new lot may be 
created to accommodate this new residential use in accordance with subsection (2) 
hereinbelow. 
Also, lots with a depth of less than 264 feet may be approved for nonresidential uses 
fronting on State Street if new residential uses have been developed along the north side 
of Court Street which prevents the creation of a nonresidential lot with 264 feet of depth 
from being achieved. 
(2) ?New residential uses shall only be constructed on lots which have a minimum width of 132 
feet on Court Street and a maximum depth of 90 feet. 
(3) ?No part of any nonresidential building and the parking lot serving such building shall be 
more than 160 feet from the State Street right-of-way. The city council, following a 
recommendation from the planning commission, may modify this requirement if it is 
demonstrated that interior block vehicle circulation will be maintained between uses and 
that residential land use along the north side of Court Street for that block under 
consideration can still be accomplished as recommended by the Hastings Master Plan. 
(4) ?Dwellings and other uses existing at the date of adoption of this article are subject to the 
following regulations: 
a. ?Such uses may continue even if such uses do not conform to the requirements of this 
article. 
b. ?A change in the use of such building, structure or property or an expansion of such 
use, building or property shall be subject to the applicable review procedures and 
regulations of this article. If such expansion or change requires additional land the 
minimum lot size requirement shall be increased to the extent necessary to 
accommodate any additional required parking and to meet other required design 
standards of the Court Street PUD including but not limited to such standards as 
building setbacks, landscaping, lighting and vehicular and pedestrian circulation. The 
minimum lot size shall be determined by the city council following a recommendation 
by the planning commission. 
(5) ?Uses which have been approved according to the regulations of this article and which 
subsequently are desired to be changed by an applicant shall be subject to the 
requirements of sections 90-127 and 90-674 of the Hastings Zoning Ordinance which 
regulates modifications to approved site plans and PUD's. 
(b) ?Density and building size for residential uses. The density and number of dwellings per building 
for residential uses shall be determined by the city council following a recommendation from the 
planning commission. In determining the proper density and building size for any project in the 
Court Street PUD the council shall consider the impact of the density and building size 
proposed by the applicant on the existing residential character along Court Street. In making 
this determination the council shall take into consideration the proposed building type and size, 
the vehicular and pedestrian traffic to be generated, the proposed parking for the residential use 
and whether or not these or other project design items are likely to significantly detract from the 
existing residential character along Court Street. 
The council shall have the authority to modify the proposed density and building size in order to 
ensure that the project is compatible with the existing Court Street character. 
(c) ?Minimum and maximum setbacks. 
(1) ?For all streets other than State Street the front setback shall be no more than ten feet from 
the right-of-way line.

less than ten feet in order to provide a transition in the visual character from the strip 
commercial development west of Market Street to the traditional downtown of the Hastings 
central business district. 
(3) ?The side and rear setbacks shall be determined by the planning commission in its review 
of the final site plan. In determining the setbacks the planning commission shall take into 
consideration the impact on adjoining land uses, whether the proposed setback disrupts 
the interior circulation pattern on that block, whether safe vehicular and pedestrian access 
is maintained, whether the setbacks will allow safe access for fire fighting purposes, and 
whether or not the proposed setbacks will create unusable or unsafe areas. 
(d) ?Building height. Maximum building height shall be 40 feet. 
(e) ?Vehicle access and circulation. 
(1) ?Driveways onto Court Street which serve nonresidential uses are prohibited. 
(2) ?Access to Park, Washington and Market Streets shall be provided for all uses within the

access drives which are to be used by more than one property owner shall be provided 
prior to approval of any final site plan. 
(3) ?Driveways onto State Street shall be subject to the access control standards of section 90-

although other materials such as brick or concrete with brick borders or brick pattern may 
be required by the planning commission in order to provide visual continuity with the brick 
walkway system in the central business district. 
(2) ?Pedestrian safety measures such as painted crosswalks, "bump outs" at public street 
intersections, maintaining clear vision areas at driveways and building corners and 
other such measures shall be provided as determined to be necessary by the 
planning commission.

Sec. 90-730.12. - Findings. 
    The city council hereby determines that the final site plan and PUD zone for the Riverwalk project 
complies with the provisions of the Hastings Zoning Ordinance and promotes its intent and purposes. The 
council also finds that granting the PUD rezoning will result in a recognizable and substantial benefit to 
the users of the project and to the community and that the proposed type and density of use shall not 
result in a material increase in the need for public services, facilities and utilities, and shall not place a 
material burden upon the subject or surrounding land or property owners and occupants or the natural 
environment. 
    The council further finds that based on the design of the PUD, the proposed use is appropriate for 
the proposed location and is not likely to lead to a significant change in the uses master planned in the 
area adjacent to the Riverwalk PUD. Also the proposed development will not have a significant negative 
impact on the surrounding area and that there is a single person responsible for completing the project in 
conformity with this article.

Act No. 288 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1967 (MCL 560.101 et seq., MSA 26.430(101) et seq.). 
This article ensures that a site condominium development shall be reviewed with the objective and 
intent of achieving many of the same characteristics and land use results as if the proposed 
development and improvements were being reviewed under article II of chapter 46 of this Code. This 
article identifies minimum standards for the development of property as site condominiums in the 
city, and sets forth procedures to be followed by the city in applying these rules, regulations and 
standards. 
(b) ?In addition, the purpose of this article is to: 
(1) ?Provide for orderly growth and harmonious development of the city consistent with orderly 
growth policies;

major thoroughfares, adjoining subdivisions, and public facilities; 
(3) ?Achieve adequate provisions for water, drainage and sanitary facilities, and other health 
requirements; 
(4) ?Encourage the provision of recreational areas and facilities, school sites and other public 
facilities; 
(5) ?Ensure against the creation of unsafe or undesirable conditions; 
(6) ?Regulate the density of development in relation to the availability of, or lack of, utility service; 
(7) ?Conserve natural features; 
(8) ?Carry out the purpose and intent of the city's master plan and this chapter; and 
(9) ?Provide procedures for the achievement of these purposes. 
(c) ?Site condominium projects are condominium developments in which each condominium unit 
consists of an area of vacant land and a volume of vacant air space within which a building or other 
improvements may be constructed by the condominium unit owner. Each site condominium unit may 
also have an appurtenant limited common element reserved for the exclusive use of the owner of the 
condominium unit. 
(d) ?Either the condominium unit by itself, or the condominium unit taken together with any contiguous, 
appurtenant limited common element, shall be considered to constitute a building site which is the 
functional equivalent of a lot for purposes of determining compliance with the requirement of this 
chapter and other applicable laws, ordinances and regulations. Site condominium projects may also 
include general common elements consisting of common open space, recreational areas, streets, 
and other areas available for use by all owners of condominium units within the project.

unenclosed porch, deck or awning shall not be placed in any required side yard. 
(3) ?The minimum setback and yard requirements for structures, attachments, and permitted 
encroachments for the zone in which they are located shall apply to access ramps to be used 
by individuals with physical disabilities (hereinafter referred to as "access ramps") whenever 
possible. If, in the opinion of the zoning administrator, the required setbacks prevent the access 
ramp from being constructed so that it can be reasonably used, the zoning administrator shall 
have the discretion to allow reductions in the setback requirements so that the access ramp can 
be constructed in a manner to allow it to be usable. In no case shall the access ramp be closer 
than five feet from the front yard lot lines and three feet from the side and rear lot lines. The 
zoning administrator will allow only the minimum deviations from the minimum setback 
requirements necessary to reasonably permit construction of the access ramp and to ensure the 
safety of the public, and shall issue a permit documenting his/her findings related to the need for 
and extent of any reduction(s) in the required setback(s). Access ramps shall comply with all 
city building code requirements as well as all applicable state and federal regulations applying 
to such access ramps.

supplementary district regulations of this zoning ordinance. 
    However, public school officials may voluntarily submit site plans for such projects to the planning 
commission for administrative review. The planning commission, in its review of the project, may provide 
comments on the site plan pertaining to the district regulations of the zoning district in which the project is 
located, the general standards for site plan review in section 90-131 of this ordinance, the impact of the 
project on vehicle and pedestrian safety, storm water management, and compatibility with nearby land 
uses, as well as the relationship of the project to other applicable city ordinances.

Sec. 90-833. - Private communication antennas. 
(a) ?Permitted. In all zoning districts, the installation and/or use of private communication antennas as 
an accessory use is permitted provided the provisions of this section are satisfied. 
(b) ?Intent. It is the intent of this section to provide reasonable regulations for the mounting of private 
communication antennas. The objectives of these regulations are: 
(1) ?To promote safety and prevent dangers to persons and property resulting from accidents 
involving antenna facilities that become dislodged in whole or in part, and fall from building 
structural mountings due to wind load, snow load, and/or other factors and/or conditions that 
may reasonably be expected to impact upon such facilities when so mounted; 
(2) ?To promote the utilization of ground mounting for antennas where reasonably feasible; 
(3) ?In the interest of maintaining and promoting the aesthetic and architectural quality of property 
values, to minimize the visibility of antennas through the use of locational requirements; 
(4) ?To balance the city's authority and duty to regulate the placement and manner of antenna 
installation in relation to the right of the public to construct and use private antennas to receive 
and/or transmit signals without unreasonable restrictions; 
(5) ?To conditionally exclude from the operation of this section certain criteria of subsection (d) of 
this section based upon the following findings: 
a. ?There is relatively small concern for wind and snow load issues; 
b. ?There has been a long demonstrated safety record; 
c. ?There has been an historical acceptance of such facilities from an architectural and 
aesthetic standpoint; and 
d. ?The cost of compliance with the procedure for application and review would be great in 
relation to the cost of purchasing and installing such antennas. 
(c) ?Requirements. Prior to the issuance of a permit for the erection of a private communication antenna 
in any zoning district, the following provisions must be satisfied: 
(1) ?The applicant shall submit a site plan, showing to scale the proposed location and the elevation 
of the antenna, building located on the site, roads, and natural features. In addition, the site plan 
shall also provide foundation and/or mounting detail as appropriate for the building inspector to 
determine safety and building code compliance. 
(2) ?No portion of an antenna shall display any advertising message or other graphic representation 
other than a manufacturer's logo or nameplate. 
(3) ?All antennas located shall be on the same lot or premises as the use for which it is necessary. 
No antennas are to be allowed on public property or in the public streets right-of-ways. 
(4) ?All antennas shall be of a color and texture so as to promote its visual blending into the 
adjacent background. 
(d) ?Location of antenna. 
(1) ?Ground-mounted antennas. 
a. ?No ground-mounted antenna shall be constructed in any front yard area but shall be 
constructed to side or rear of the principal structure. 
b. ?Ground mounted satellite dish antennas under one meter (39.37 inches) shall be allowed in 
the front yard, but shall be setback a minimum of 20 feet from the front yard property lines. 
c. ?No ground-mounted antenna shall be located closer than its height to a rear or side 
property line. 
d. ?All ground-mounted antennas not mounted on a principal or accessory building shall be 
permanently anchored to a foundation located on the ground. 
e. ?No ground-mounted satellite dish antenna shall exceed a height of 12 feet or a diameter of 
ten feet. Conventional noncommercial radio and television antennas and amateur radio 
antennas shall not exceed the building height limitation of the zoning district. 
(2) ?Roof-mounted and/or building-mounted antennas. 
a. ?Antennas mounted on the roof or side of a building shall not exceed the height limitation for 
the district, and no satellite dish antenna shall extend higher than five feet above the ridge 
or peak of the building roof. 
b. ?An antenna mounted on the roof or side roof of a building shall be located on that portion of 
the building located adjacent to the rear of the property unless it is demonstrated that an 
alternative location is as safe or safer and the visibility of the antenna from the adjacent 
properties and by pedestrian or vehicular passersby is reduced or equal in comparison to a 
rear yard orientation/location. Satellite dishes under one meter (39.37 inches) shall be 
exempt from this regulation. 
(3) ?Maintenance. All antennas shall be well maintained, securely attached to a structure and shall 
not be allowed to become unsightly in appearance. 
(e) ?True hardship or practical difficulty. In regulating satellite dishes under one meter (39.37 inches) if a 
true hardship or practical difficulty exists on a particular lot or parcel of land such that compliance 
with the provisions of this ordinance is impossible because satellite sight lines are blocked, then a 
waiver may be granted by the zoning administrator to the extent necessary to permit reasonable 
reception, after consideration of the following factors and standards: 
(1) ?A showing of true hardship or particular difficulty; 
(2) ?The safety of the property owner and the surrounding property owners; 
(3) ?The waiver shall be the minimum necessary to afford relief to the applicant; 
(4) ?"Reasonable reception," as used in this section, does not mean perfect reception from each 
satellite service provider. 
(5) ?Conditions may be attached to the granting of a waiver, which are in the best interest of the 
health, safety, and welfare of the community. 
(6) ?Under no circumstance shall any satellite dish antenna or mounting device be located closer 
than five feet from any front property line or sidewalk. 
(f) ?Conditional exemption. Conventional VHF and/or UHF television antennas that have width and

DIVISION 6. - OPEN SPACE PRESERVATION PROJECTS 


Sec. 90-900. - Purpose. 
    Act No. 179 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 2001 ("Act 179") requires that zoned cities having a 
population of 1,800 or more and having undeveloped land zoned for residential purposes must adopt 
zoning regulations to permit "open space preservation" developments. 
    Under these regulations, a landowner has the option to retain at least 20 percent of the property as 
open space and place dwellings on the remaining portion. The number of dwellings cannot be less than 
the number which would be permitted on the land without the open space preservation regulations. 
    The purpose of this article is to adopt open space preservation provisions consistent with the 
requirements of Act 179. 
(Ord. No. 360, § I, 10-28-02) 


Sec. 90-901. - Review procedure; review by planning commission. 
    An open space preservation development shall be reviewed by the planning commission according

plan which shall be professionally prepared and which shall include information required by section 
90-130 of this chapter and the following information: 
(1) ?The areas devoted to preserved open space. 
(2) ?The site development plan shall illustrate the location of all proposed lots and proposed 
building envelopes and shall indicate the lot area and width of each lot, and the proposed front, 
side and rear yard building setbacks. The number of proposed lots on the site development plan 
shall not exceed the number of lots on the existing zoning plan, as approved by the planning 
commission. 
(3) ?The total number of acres of land that are proposed for preserved open space, the total 
number of acres of land that are proposed to be used for dwellings, and the percentage of each, 
as compared to the total site acreage. 
(4) ?The site development plan shall illustrate the location and type of all proposed structures or 
improvements that are not dwellings. 
(5) ?If the open space development will not be served by public sanitary sewer, the applicant shall 
submit documentation from the Barry-Eaton District Health Department that the soils are 
suitable for on site septic systems. 
(c) ?[Open space preservation development proposed as platted subdivision or site condominium.] If an 
open space preservation development is proposed as a platted subdivision or a site condominium, 
the applicant must also submit all information and follow the procedures required by the City of 
Hastings subdivision ordinance or article 8, site condominium projects, as applicable. 
(d) ?Existing zoning plan. In addition to the information required above, the applicant must also submit a 
separate existing zoning plan. This plan is to be prepared for the purpose of demonstrating the 
number of dwelling units that could be developed on the land under its existing zoning if the open 
space preservation option provided by this article were not exercised. The existing zoning plan shall 
be professionally prepared and shall include at least the following information: 
(1) ?Date, north arrow and scale, which shall not be more than 1 inch = 200 feet. 
(2) ?Location of streets adjacent to and within the site. 
(3) ?Location of all lots, illustrating lot area and width of each lot to demonstrate compliance with the 
minimum requirements of the applicable zoning district. 
(4) ?Location of all utilities that would be necessary to serve a development under the existing 
zoning plan. 
(5) ?If development under the existing zoning plan would require the use of septic tanks and drain 
fields, the applicant shall submit written documentation from the Barry-Eaton District Health 
Department that at least 20 percent of the lots are suitable for on site disposal systems. Such 
lots shall be spread evenly over the site. 
(6) ?The existing zoning plan shall illustrate all unbuildable land, which shall include slopes of 20 
percent or greater, regulated and unregulated wetlands, public utility easements, floodplains, 
and other similar features which limit or prevent construction of buildings or roads.

number of lots that could be developed on the land under its existing zoning if the clustering option 
provided by this article were not exercised. 
    The commission shall either approve the number of lots illustrated on the existing zoning plan or 
require the plan to be revised to accurately reflect the number of lots which could be developed on the 
land under the standards required for preparing the existing zoning plan in this article.

(Code 1970, § 3.67) 
_____


Sec. 90-925. - Uses not specified. 
    The minimum parking space requirements for all uses shall be as listed in section 90-924. For uses 
not specifically listed in section 90-924 the requirements shall be determined as follows: 
(1) ?The zoning administrator may establish the parking requirement by making the determination 
that the proposed use is similar in parking requirement to a use which is listed in section 90-
924. In such case, the same parking requirement shall apply. 
(2) ?If the proposed use is not similar to a use listed in section 90-924 the zoning administrator shall 
refer to engineering or planning manuals, publications and reports, or to the parking 
requirements used by other municipalities in order to determine the minimum parking 
requirements for the proposed use. 
(Code 1970, § 3.68; Ord. No. 390, § 1, 9-27-04) 


Sec. 90-926. - Off-street loading and unloading. 
    All uses except for single-family and two-family dwelling units, which customarily receive or distribute 
material or merchandise shall provide sufficient off-street loading and unloading spaces according to the 
following requirements: 
(1) ?Each loading space shall be at least 12 feet in width and 22 feet in length, and have a minimum 
clearance of 14 feet above grade. 
(2) ?A loading space may be located within the front, side or rear yard except for required 
landscape areas provided that maneuvering of trucks and other vehicles shall take place on the 
site and not in the right-of-way. 
(3) ?Loading spaces that face, abut or are adjacent to a residential district shall be at least 50 feet 
from the residential district lot line and shall be screened on all sides by a solid fence, wall or 
berm at least six feet in height. 
(Code 1970, § 3.69) 


Sec. 90-927. - Parking variation. 
    Where it can be demonstrated that the parking requirements of this article would result in more 
parking spaces than are necessary for the parking needs of a particular use, the planning commission 
may approve a parking plan with fewer spaces than required by section 90-924 according to the following 
requirements: 
(1) ?The applicant must provide written evidence to the planning commission that the parking 
proposed on the site for the use is sufficient to meet the parking needs of those who will 
patronize the use as well as the parking needs for employees during the largest working shift. 
Such evidence may consist of: arrangements for nearby shared parking; evidence that the 
proposed use will also be patronized by pedestrians or by those using bus service or; evidence 
from the parking history of the proposed use or a use similar to the proposed use at other 
locations or; that there is sufficient space on the site for the required parking to be provided if it 
becomes necessary at a later time. 
(2) ?If a plan is approved to allow fewer parking spaces than required by section 90-924 such 
parking plan shall only apply to the stated use. Any other use shall comply with the 
requirements of section 90-927 before an occupancy permit is issued or such use shall first 
obtain approval from the planning commission in accordance with section 90-927(1) above 
before an occupancy permit is issued. 
(Code 1970, § 3.70; Ord. No. 390, § 2, 9-27-04) 


Sec. 90-928. - Time limits. 
    When property has been acquired for off-street parking that cannot be improved as required due to 
temporary physical difficulties or for temporary financial or construction difficulties, the building inspector 
may issue a temporary occupancy permit upon agreement by the owner to comply with all improvements 
required in this article, by the expiration date of the permit period. Such permit shall not be for more than 
nine months and may be renewed by the board upon presentation of sufficient grounds therefor. 
(Code 1970, § 3.71) 


Sec. 90-929. - Supplemental parking requirements in residential zones. 
(1) ?All driveways and parking areas shall be maintained in good condition. All driveways and parking 
areas shall be constructed of stable materials designed and maintained to support parked vehicles. 
Parking on bare dirt, mud, grass, debris, refuse and other unstable material in any front yard is 
prohibited. Any rutting or deformation of the drive or parking surface shall be promptly repaired. 
(2) ?Parking of semi-tractors, semi-trailers, or vehicles with two or more rear axles in residential areas is 
prohibited. 
(3) ?Parking spaces and driveways shall not occupy in excess of 40 percent of the width of the front yard 
at any point within such front yard as measured from property line to property line. In the event that 
drive areas used exclusively to turn vehicles around are present, such turn-around drives shall not 
occupy in excess of 60 percent of the width of the front yard. No parking shall be allowed in the turn-
around area that extends beyond the 40 percent width limitation.

ARTICLE XII. - LANDSCAPING 


Sec. 90-1006. - Intent and purpose. 
(a) ?The purpose of this article is to promote the public health, safety and welfare by establishing 
minimum standards for the design, installation and maintenance of landscaping in parking lots, as 
buffer zones between uses and along roadways. Landscaping is considered by the city to be an 
important element of land development, which is a critical factor in maintaining an attractive 
community character and conserving the value of land and buildings in the city. 
(b) ?This article is also intended to: 
(1) ?Improve and enhance the character of the site; 
(2) ?Screen or filter views, where necessary; 
(3) ?Help unify the various parts of the site; 
(4) ?Blend inharmonious land uses; 
(5) ?Buffer incompatible uses; 
(6) ?Moderate harsh or unpleasant sounds; 
(7) ?Remove air pollutants; 
(8) ?Control glare and reflection; 
(9) ?Slow the effects of erosive winds or water and promote stormwater retention, thereby helping 
to prevent flooding; 
(10) ?Assist in directing safe and efficient traffic flow at driveways and within parking lots; 
(11) ?Ensure adequate sight distance; 
(12) ?Reduce the impacts of glare from headlights; and 
(13) ?Distinguish and separate vehicular and pedestrian circulation. 
(c) ?The landscape standards of this article are considered the minimum necessary to achieve the 
objectives noted above. In several instances, the standards are intentionally flexible to encourage 
flexibility and creative design. Applicants are encouraged to provide additional landscaping to 
improve the function, appearance and value of their property.

to the limitations given in subsection (b) of this section. The regulations of this article shall not apply 
to individual single-family and two-family dwelling units. 
(b) ?For existing and proposed uses that require site plan approval to either expand or be built, 
landscaping should be installed insofar as practical. The planning commission in its review of the site 
plan has the authority to increase, decrease or otherwise modify the landscaping and screening 
requirements of this article. In doing so, the commission shall consider the following criteria: 
(1) ?The amount of space on the site available for landscaping. 
(2) ?Existing landscaping on the site and on adjacent properties. 
(3) ?The type of use on the site and size of the development. 
(4) ?Existing and proposed adjacent land uses. 
(5) ?The effect the required landscaping would have on the operation of the existing or proposed 
land use.

(b) ?Site plan requirement. Applications for a special land use permit shall also be accompanied by a 
site plan, which shall contain the information for final site plans required by article IV of this chapter. 
(c) ?Additional information. The planning commission may also require that the applicant provide 
additional information about the proposed use. Such information may include but shall not be limited 
to traffic analysis; environmental impact statement; and economic analysis justifying the need for a 
proposed use or uses, impact on public utilities and services, and affect on the public school system. 
(d) ?Planning commission hearing. The application shall be referred to the planning commission, which 
shall set a public hearing for the application. Notice of the hearing shall be as required in section 90-
47 of this zoning ordinance.

appearance with the existing or intended character of the general vicinity and that such use will 
not result in a detrimental change to the essential character of the area in which it is proposed. 
(2) ?Be adequately served by essential public facilities and services such as highways, streets, 
police, fire protection, drainage structures, refuse disposal, water and sewage facilities, and 
schools. 
(3) ?Not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for public facilities and services. 
(4) ?Not involve uses, activities, processes, materials and equipment, or conditions of operation that 
will be overly detrimental to any persons, property or the general welfare by reason of excessive 
production of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare or odors. 
(5) ?Be consistent with the intent and purpose of the zoning district in which such use will be 
located. 
(6) ?Be compatible with and in accordance with the city's master plan. 
(Ord. No. 301, § 8(3.243), 2-10-97) 


Sec. 90-1050. - Conditions and safeguards. 
(a) ?In approving a request for a special land use permit, the planning commission may impose 
conditions and safeguards. Such conditions may include but are not limited to conditions necessary 
to:

roadways. In no case shall the setback be less than the setback requirement of the zoning 
district in which the lot is located; 
b. ?The tower and antenna shall comply with all applicable state construction and electrical 
codes and local building permit requirements as well as the manufacturer's installation 
requirements provided they do not conflict with the state and local requirements;

Zoning Act (Public Act 23 of 1950) and the Michigan Tall Structures Act (Public Act 259 of 
1959); 
e. ?A tower or similar structure which has been constructed to support an antenna which is 
unused or abandoned shall be removed, along with any associated buildings and 
structures, by the owner/operator within 90 days of the date of a written notice from the 
city. An extension of 90 days may be granted by the planning commission or zoning 
administrator as the case may be upon a request from the owner/operator citing

interference; 
k. ?Tower structures and communication facilities shall incorporate a color scheme which 
reduces visual impact; and 
l. ?A commercial or public antenna or tower, including accessory buildings and guy wire 
supporting structures, shall be fully enclosed by a sturdy fence, securely gated, and shall 
have such height as reasonably determined by the planning commission. The fence may 
be fitted with barbed wire along the top of the fence if permitted by the planning 
commission. 
m. ?Towers may be permitted to be on the same site as another principal use. In its 
consideration of this, the planning commission shall find that allowing the antenna or tower 
shall not pose a hazard to nearby buildings, properties and roadways and shall also 
comply with the special approval standards of this chapter. 
(5) ?Approval standards. In order to approve the application, the planning commission shall find 
that: 
a. ?The proposed use and structure meet the special land use approval standards of section 
90-1049; 
b. ?The proposed use and structure meet requirements of this subsection 90-1085(d); 
c. ?Approval of the project will fill a significant gap in the service coverage of the applicant; and 
d. ?That alternate sites or facilities for the wireless communications equipment and wireless 
communications support structure are not available or feasible. 
(6) ?Conditions of approval: Any conditions imposed on an approval must relate directly to this 
section, other applicable city ordinances and codes and applicable state and federal laws. 
(7) ?Noncompliance with subsection 90-1085(d) requirements. If the planning commission 
determines to deny an application for special use permit approval because the proposed project 
does not meet one or more of the requirements contained in subsection 90-1085(d) or any of 
the special use or site plan standards found elsewhere in this chapter the planning commission 
shall nevertheless approve the proposed project if the applicant can demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the planning commission that no other viable alternative to the installation of the 
wireless communication structure and equipment can be found which will either provide 
personal wireless services to the area in question or close a significant gap in the existing 
service coverage for the area. 
Pursuant to any such approval by the planning commission, the wireless communication 
support structure and equipment shall still comply with all of the requirements of subsection 90-
1085(d) and other applicable provisions of this section except to the extent that the applicant 
demonstrates that compliance with a particular requirement or regulation would: 
a. ?Prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the providing of personal wireless services to the 
area, or 
b. ?Prohibit the applicant from closing a significant gap in existing service coverage to the area 
involved.

(4) ?Roads abutting the lot. 
(5) ?Any driveway serving the proposed accessory building.

compatible with the house on the lot and with the existing building characteristics of the 
immediate neighborhood. 
(i) ?Conditions. In approving a request for a special land use under this section, the planning 
commission may impose conditions in accordance with section 90-1050, conditions and safeguards 
for approval of special land uses, and may modify the proposed size of the accessory building in 
order to achieve compatibility with the character of the neighborhood. 
(Ord. No. 449, § II, 10-26-09) 


Sec. 90-1091. - Height exceptions for buildings in the B-1, B-2, B-3, and D-2 zoning districts. 
    The maximum height requirement for buildings in the city is primarily 35 feet, although in certain 
zoning districts it increases to 40 feet. While it is the desire of the city that these maximum heights be 
maintained for consistency, it is recognized that in certain instances a greater building height may be 
permitted if a proposed building and its use can be determined to benefit the overall goals of the city. It is 
the intent of this section to allow buildings to exceed the maximum height requirements of its zone when 
allowed as a special land use by the planning commission in accordance with the procedures and 
standards of article XIII. In making a determination whether or not to allow a building to exceed the 
maximum height of the zoning district in which the development project is proposed, the planning 
commission must find that the proposed building height meets the standards of section 90-1049 and the 
following requirements and standards: 
(1) ?Only buildings in the B1, B2, B3, and D2 zoning districts are subject to the regulations of this 
section. 
(2) ?The proposed building must comply with the requirements of the city fire chief and police chief. 
(3) ?The proposed building must be of a size, scale and appearance which is substantially 
compatible with nearby buildings and the overall skyline of the city. 
(4) ?The proposed building shall be setback a minimum of 100 feet from an A-O, A-1, A-2, RR, RS, 
R1, R2, RD or RM zoning district and shall be setback an additional one foot from the minimum 
required lot line setback for each one foot that the building exceeds the maximum height 
limitation of the zoning district in which the building is proposed. 
This additional setback distance shall be taken from the lot line(s) of the lot containing the 
proposed building which are closest to the residential zone. For example, if a building is 
proposed to be 45 feet high in the B2 zone which has a maximum building height of 35 feet, 
then the proposed building must be setback 100 feet plus ten feet, which is the minimum side 
setback of the B-2 zone, plus an additional ten feet as the proposed building is ten feet higher 
than the maximum building height in the B-2 zone. The proposed building would then be a 
minimum of 120 feet from the residential zone. 
(5) ?The planning commission shall have the authority to require a greater setback than permitted 
by this section and to approve a building height which is less than requested by the applicant in 
order to mitigate any negative effects of the proposed building on nearby residents.

maintenance of the system for the next ensuing operating year shall be prepared, submitted to 
and approved by the city council at least 30 days prior to the commencement of each ensuing 
operating year. The amounts transferred into the operation and maintenance fund during each 
operating year shall not exceed said budget unless approved by a two-thirds vote of the city 
council. 
(b) ?Bond and interest redemption fund: 
    There shall next be established and maintained a separate depository account designated 
the bond and interest redemption fund, which shall be used solely and only for the purpose of 
paying the principal of and interest on the bonds hereby authorized. The moneys in the bond 
and interest redemption fund (including the bond reserve account hereinafter established) shall 
be kept on hand with the bank or trust company where the principal and interest on the bonds 
herein authorized are currently payable. 
    Out of the revenues remaining in the receiving fund after provision has been made for 
expenses of operation and maintenance of the system, there shall next be set aside periodically 
sufficient funds to provide for the payment of the principal and interest upon all bonds payable 
from the revenues of the system. The amount so set aside during each quarterly period 
commencing July 1, 1970, shall be not less than one-half of the interest next falling due on the 
bonds and one-fourth of the principal next maturing on the bonds. If there be any deficiency in 
the amount previously required to be set aside, then the amount of such deficiency shall be 
added to the current requirement. 
    There is hereby established in the bond and interest redemption fund a separate account, 
to be known as the bond reserve account, into which account there shall be deposited, in equal 
quarterly installments, the sum of not less than $15,000.00 during each of the operating years 
commencing July 1, 1970, to July 1, 1974, inclusive, so that said bond reserve account shall 
total $75,000.00 by the close of the operating year beginning July 1, 1974. Said bond reserve 
account shall be used solely for the payment of the principal and interest on said bonds as to 
which there would otherwise be default. 
    If, at any time, it shall be necessary to use moneys in the bond reserve account for such 
payment, then the moneys so used shall be replaced from the net revenues first received 
thereafter which are not required by this ordinance to be used for operation and maintenance or 
for current principal and interest requirements; provided, however, that such bond reserve 
account shall not be regarded as moneys otherwise appropriated or pledged for the purpose of 
determining the sufficiency of funds available for redemption of callable bonds. 
    No further payments need be made into the bond and interest redemption fund after 
enough of the bonds have been retired so that the amount then held in said fund (including the 
bond reserve account) is equal to the entire amount of principal and interest which will be 
payable at the time of maturity of all the bonds then remaining outstanding. 
(c) ?Replacement fund: 
    There shall next be established and maintained a separate depository account designated 
as the replacement fund, which shall be used solely and only for the purpose of making major 
repairs and replacements to the system. There shall be deposited into said account, in equal 
quarterly installments, after providing for all requirements of the operation and maintenance 
fund and the bond and interest redemption fund (including the bond reserve account) the sum of 
not less than $5,000.00 during each operating year commencing July 1, 1970, to July 1, 1974, 
inclusive, so that said replacement fund shall total $25,000.00 by the close of the operating year 
beginning July 1, 1974. If, at any time, it shall be necessary to use moneys in said fund for such 
purpose, the moneys so used shall be replaced from the net revenues in the receiving fund 
which are not required by this ordinance to be used for the operation and maintenance fund or 
the bond and interest redemption fund (including the bond reserve account). 
(d) ?Improvement and extension fund: 
    There shall next be established and maintained, a separate depository account to be 
designated improvement and extension fund. Out of the revenues remaining in the receiving 
fund after meeting the requirements of the operation and maintenance fund, the bond and 
interest redemption fund (including the bond reserve account), and the replacement fund, there 
shall be deposited into the improvement and extension fund, in any quarter, such sum as the 
city council may deem advisable, to be used for improvements, enlargements, extensions or 
repairs to the system. 
(e) ?Surplus fund: 
    Moneys remaining in the receiving fund at the end of any operating year, after full 
satisfaction of the requirements of the foregoing funds, may be transferred to a separate 
depository account to be designated surplus fund. Moneys from time to time in the surplus fund 
may be transferred, in the discretion of the city council, to the bond and interest redemption fund 
for the purpose of calling bonds, or to the improvement and extension fund or used for any other 
purpose permitted by law; provided, however, that if there should be any deficit in the operation 
and maintenance fund, bond and interest redemption fund (including the bond reserve account) 
or the replacement fund on account of defaults in setting aside therein the amounts 
hereinbefore required, then transfers shall be made from the surplus fund to such funds in the 
priority and order named, to the extent of such deficits. 
(f) ?Cash on hand: 
    Moneys on hand as of July 1, 1970, belonging to any account or fund of the system 
established by the 1952 ordinance, shall be used and applied on July 1, 1970, for the following 
purposes and in the following order of priority:

Section 16. - Reverse flow of funds. 
    In the event the moneys in the receiving fund are insufficient to provide for the current requirements 
of the operation and maintenance fund or the bond and interest redemption fund, any moneys and/or 
securities in other funds of the system shall be transferred, first, to the operation and maintenance fund, 
and second, to the bond and interest redemption fund to the extent of any deficit therein. 


Section 17. - Investment. 
    Moneys in any fund or account of the system may be invested in obligations of the United States of 
America subject to the provisions of Act No. 94 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1933 (MCL 141.101 et 
seq., MSA 5.2731 et seq.), as amended. In the event such investments are made, the securities 
representing the same shall be kept on deposit with the bank or trust company having on deposit the fund 
or funds from which such purchase was made. Income received from such investments shall be credited 
to the fund from which said investments were made. 


Section 18. - Application of bond proceeds. 
    The bonds herein authorized shall be sold and the proceeds applied in accordance with the 
provisions of Act No. 94 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1933 (MCL 141.101 et seq., MSA 5.2731 et 
seq.), as amended, as follows: 
(1) ?The sum of $100,000.00 shall immediately be deposited with the paying agent for the 
outstanding bonds, in the special trust account described in the second paragraph of section 
15(f) of this ordinance, and used only for the redemption of the outstanding bonds. 
(2) ?A sum equal to the accrued interest and premium, if any, on the bond, received on delivery 
shall be deposited in the bond and interest redemption fund established by this ordinance. The 
balance of said proceeds shall immediately be deposited in the National Bank of Hastings, 
Hastings, Michigan, a Federal Reserve System member bank, in a fund to be designated 
construction fund and used solely to pay the cost of the project. Any unexpended balance 
remaining in the construction fund, after completion of the project herein authorized, may, and 
to the extent of $135,000.00, be used for other improvements and additions to the system, 
provided that at the time of such expenditure, such use be approved by the municipal finance 
commission. Any remaining balance after such expenditure shall be paid into the bond and 
interest redemption fund and shall be used for the redemption of callable bonds, or, prior to the 
first call date only, purchasing bonds of this issue on the open market at not more than the fair 
market value thereof, and at a price in any event not exceeding the first call price. 
(Ord. No. 87, § 1, 11-9-70) 


Section 19. - Bank accounts. 
    Moneys in the several funds and accounts established pursuant to this ordinance except moneys in 
the bond and interest redemption fund (including the bond reserve account), moneys derived from the 
proceeds of sale of the bonds and moneys to be used to redeem and retire the outstanding bonds and 
pay interest and call premiums thereon, may be kept in one bank account, in which event the moneys in 
said bank account shall be allocated on the books and records of the city to the funds and accounts 
herein established in the manner and at the times as provided in this ordinance. 


Section 20. - Covenants. 
    The City of Hastings covenants and agrees with the successive holders of the bonds and coupons 
that so long as any of the bonds remain outstanding and unpaid as to either principal or interest: 
(a) ?The city will maintain the system in good repair and working order and will operate the same 
efficiently and will faithfully and punctually perform all duties with reference to the system 
required by the constitution and laws of the State of Michigan, including the making and 
collecting of sufficient rates for water and sewage disposal services rendered by the system and 
the segregation and application of revenues of the system in the manner provided in this 
ordinance. 
(b) ?The city will fix and collect rates and charges for all water and sewage disposal service 
supplied by the system in order to obtain revenues fully sufficient to provide for the payment of 
expenses of administration, operation and maintenance of the system, to provide for the 
payment of interest on and the principal of all obligations payable therefrom, including the bonds 
herein authorized, as and when the same become due and payable, and to create the bond 
reserve account and provide for the replacement fund and such other funds herein required. 
Such rates shall be fixed and revised from time to time as may be necessary to produce these 
amounts. 
(c) ?The city will not permit free water or sewage disposal service to be supplied by the system to 
the city or any department or agency thereof, or to any person, firm or corporation, public or 
private, or to any public agency or instrumentality. The reasonable cost and value of all water 
and sewage disposal service rendered to the city and its various departments shall be charged 
against the city and shall be paid as the service accrues. All payments so made shall be 
considered revenues of the system, and shall be applied in the manner herein provided for the 
application of the revenues of the system. 
(d) ?The city will maintain and keep proper books of record and account, separate from all other 
records and accounts, in which shall be made full and correct entries of all transactions relating 
to the system. Not later than three months after the close of each operating year, the council will 
cause to be prepared on forms furnished by the municipal finance commission, if such forms be 
available, a statement in reasonable detail, sworn to by its chief accounting officer, showing the 
cash income and disbursements of the system during such operating year, the assets and 
liabilities of the system at the beginning and close of the fiscal year, and such other information 
as is necessary to enable any taxpayer, user of the service furnished, or any holder or owner of 
the bonds or anyone acting in their behalf to be fully informed as to all matters pertaining to the 
financial operation of the system during such year. A certified copy of such statement shall be 
filed with the municipal finance commission, and such statement and books of record and 
account shall at all reasonable times be open to inspection by any taxpayer, user of the service 
or holder or holders of any bonds or anyone acting in their behalf. The council will also cause an 
annual audit of such books of record and account for the preceding operating year to be made 
and completed not more than three months after the completion of each fiscal year by a 
recognized independent certified public accountant and will make such audit available to the 
holders of any of the bonds. Said audit may at the option of the city council be used for all 
purposes in lieu of the statement on forms provided by the municipal finance commission. 
(e) ?The city will maintain and carry for the benefit of the holders of the bonds, insurance on all 
physical properties of the system, of the kinds and in the amounts normally carried by public 
utility companies and municipalities engaged in the operation of water and sewage disposal 
systems. All moneys received for losses under any such insurance policies shall be applied 
solely to the replacement and restoration of the property damaged or destroyed, and to the 
extent not so used, shall be used for the purpose of calling bonds. 
(f) ?The city will not sell, lease or dispose of the system or any substantial part thereof until all of the 
bonds have been paid in full, both as to principal and interest. The city, further, will cause the 
operation of the system to be carried on as economically as possible, will cause to be made to 
the system all repairs and replacements necessary to keep the same in good repair and 
working order, and will not do or suffer to be done any act which would affect the system in such 
a way as to impair or affect unfavorably the security of the bonds. 
(g) ?The city will not grant a franchise to any person, corporation or association, public or private, to 
operate a water or sewer system that will compete with the system. 


Section 21. - Additional bonds. 
    The right is reserved, in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 94 of the Public Acts of Michigan 
of 1933 (MCL 141.101 et seq., MSA 5.2731 et seq.), as amended, to issue additional bonds payable from 
the revenues of said system, which shall be of equal standing with the bonds herein authorized for the 
following purposes: 
(a) ?For the completion of the project in the event the funds realized from the sale of the bonds 
herein authorized prove to be insufficient therefor; 
(b) ?For subsequent extensions and improvements to the system; 
provided that no such additional bonds shall be issued unless the average net revenues for the last two 
completed operating years, or the last completed operating year, whichever is lower, when supplemented 
by the annual net revenues estimated to accrue from an increase in rates to be put into effect at the time 
such additional bonds are authorized and/or from the additional facilities constructed from the proceeds of 
sale of the additional bonds, shall be equal to at least 140 percent of the largest annual principal and 
interest requirements thereafter maturing on the bonds herein authorized, on any then previously issued 
bonds of equal standing with the bonds herein authorized, and on such additional bonds then being 
issued. Prior to the issuance of any additional bonds pursuant to this paragraph, there shall be filed with 
the city clerk a statement showing the annual net revenues for the last two completed operating years, 
the additional or augmented revenues reflecting the application of the increased rates and/or added 
facilities, if any, and the annual principal and interest requirements on all outstanding bonds payable from 
revenues of the system and the bonds proposed to be issued. The engineering matters contained in said 
statement shall be certified to by a registered engineer appointed by the city. Permission of the municipal 
finance commission (or such other state body having jurisdiction over the issuance of municipal bonds) to 
issue such additional bonds shall constitute a conclusive presumption of the existence of conditions 
permitting the issuance thereof. 
    Except as herein authorized, no additional bonds having equal standing with the bonds of this issue 
shall be authorized or issued. 


Section 22. - Bond form. 
    Said bonds shall be in substantially the following form:

preserve the same in good repair and working order, to provide for the payment of interest upon and the 
principal of all bonds payable therefrom as and when the same become due and payable, and for the 
creation of a reserve therefor, and to build up a reserve for major repairs and replacements which may

Michigan or by any taxing authority within said state.

be valid unless made on the books and noted on the back hereof in like manner; but transferability by 
delivery may be restored by registration to bearer. Such registration shall not affect the negotiability of the 
interest coupons. 
    It is hereby certified and recited that all acts, conditions and things required by law precedent to and 
in the issuance of this bond and the series of which this is one have been done and performed in regular 
and due time and form as required by law. 
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the city council of the City of Hastings, County of Barry, Michigan, has 
caused this bond to be signed in the name of said city by the mayor and countersigned by the city clerk,

    The bonds shall be signed with the manual or facsimile signature of the mayor, shall be

A attached to this ordinance with such changes as may be necessary or desirable, permitted by law, and 
not materially adverse to the city as determined by the mayor.

    Bonds maturing on or before July 1, 2002, shall not be subject to redemption prior to maturity. Bond

    If less than all the outstanding bonds of a single maturity shall be called for redemption, the registrar 
(as hereinafter defined [in section 8]) shall select by lot, in such manner as it shall in its discretion 
determine to be fair and equitable, the bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed. Notice of the call for 
any redemption, which shall identify the bonds or portions of bonds to be redeemed, shall be given by first 
class mail, not less than 30 days prior to the redemption date, to the registered owner of each bond or 
portion of bond to be redeemed at the address shown on the bond register kept by the registrar; provided, 
however, that failure to give such notice by mailing or any defect therein shall not affect the validity of any 
proceedings for the redemption of bonds. Bonds or portions of bonds called for redemption shall not bear 
interest after the redemption date specified in such notice, provided funds for the payment thereof are 
then on deposit with the registrar. 


Section 7. - Revenue as sole security; no general obligation. 
    The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds shall be payable solely from the net 
revenues derived from the operation of the system, including the system's future improvements, 
enlargements and extensions; and to secure such payment, there is hereby created a statutory lien upon 
the whole of the net revenues to continue until payment in full of the principal and interest on the bonds, 
or until sufficient cash or sufficient government obligations have been deposited in trust for payment in full 
of all bonds to be defeased. Upon deposit of cash or sufficient government obligations, as provided in the 
previous sentence, the statutory lien shall be terminated with respect to the bonds to be defeased, and 
the holders of the bonds shall have no further rights under this ordinance except for payment from the 
deposited funds; and such bonds shall no longer be considered to be outstanding bonds under this 
ordinance. 
    The bonds are not a general obligation of the city. The city is not required to levy taxes in an amount 
to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds. The bonds are self-liquidating revenue bonds and do not 
constitute an indebtedness of the city within any constitutional, statutory or charter limitation. The full faith 
and credit of the city is not pledged as security for payment of the principal of or interest on the bonds. 


Section 8. - Appointment of bond registrar. 
    Old Kent Bank and Trust Company (hereinafter the "registrar") is hereby appointed as initial transfer 
agent, paying agent and registrar for the bonds, with any successor thereto to be approved by the city. 
Payment of interest on the bonds shall be made by check or draft drawn on the registrar and mailed to 
the registered owners at their registered addresses as shown on the city's bond register to be kept by the 
registrar at its principal office. The registrar shall make payments of interest to those persons whose 
names appear on the bond register kept by the registrar as the owners of the bonds at the close of 
business on the 15th day of the month immediately preceding each interest payment date. Payments of 
principal shall be payable at the principal office of the registrar. No bonds shall be valid until authenticated 
by an authorized officer of the registrar nor be delivered by the registrar to the purchaser thereof until 
payment of the purchase price therefor shall be received and the city clerk shall have issued instructions 
to so deliver the bonds. 


Section 9. - Transfer of registered bonds. 
    Registered bonds may be transferred or exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of other 
authorized denominations of the same maturity upon the bond register kept by the registrar by the person 
in whose name it is registered, or by his legal representative duly authorized in writing, upon surrender of 
the bond for cancellation, duly endorsed for assignment. No transfer of registered bonds shall be valid 
unless and until registered on the bond register kept by the registrar. The person in whose name a bond 
is registered may for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, be deemed and treated by 
the city and the registrar as the absolute owner thereof, whether the bond is overdue or not; and any 
payment of principal or interest to a registered holder of any bond registered as to principal and interest 
shall constitute a valid discharge of the city's liability upon such bonds to the extent of such payment. A 
registered bond shall not be transferred or exchanged between the 15th day of the month immediately 
preceding any interest payment date and the interest payment date, nor after the bond has been called 
for redemption. Whenever any bonds shall be surrendered for transfer or exchange, the registrar shall 
authenticate and deliver a new bond or bonds for like aggregate principal amount of the same maturity. 
The registrar shall require the payment by the owner requesting the transfer or exchange of any tax or 
other governmental charge required to be paid with respect thereto. Executed blank bonds for registration 
and issuance to subsequent owners shall, as necessary, be delivered to the registrar for safekeeping. 


Section 10. - Mutilated, lost, stolen and destroyed bonds. 
    Subject to the requirements of Act No. 354 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1972 (MCL 129.31 et 
seq., MSA 3.993(21) et seq.), as amended, and any other applicable law, in the event any bond is 
mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the city shall authorize the execution, authentication and delivery of a 
new bond of like date, number, maturity and denomination as that mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed; 
provided, however, that in the case of any mutilated bond, such bond shall first be surrendered to the city 
or the registrar, and in the case of any lost, stolen or destroyed bond, there shall be first furnished to the 
city and the registrar evidence of the ownership thereof and of such loss, theft or destruction satisfactory 
to the city and the registrar, together with a bond or other indemnity satisfactory to them. The city and the 
registrar may charge the owner of the bond with their reasonable fees and expenses in this connection 
and shall charge such owner with any amounts provided by the aforesaid Act No. 354 of the Public Acts 
of Michigan of 1972 (MCL 129.31 et seq., MSA 3.993(21) et seq.), as amended, and any other applicable 
law. If any such bond shall have matured or shall be about to mature, instead of issuing a substitute bond, 
the city may pay the same without issuance and surrender thereof. 


Section 11. - Funds and accounts; flow of funds. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, all of the provisions relative to funds and accounts, 
their maintenance, the flow of funds and other details relative thereto, shall be as specifically set forth in 
the outstanding ordinance. 


Section 12. - Bond reserve account. 
    Prior to the sale of the bonds, the city shall deposit, from city funds on hand and legally available for 
such use, the amount of $110,000.00 in the bond reserve account contained in the bond and interest 
redemption fund, as established by the outstanding ordinance. When added to the $75,000.00 presently 
required to be on deposit in the bond reserve account, the amounts on deposit in the bond reserve 
account shall total not less than $185,000.00. Section 15(b) of the outstanding ordinance is hereby 
modified to provide that the amounts on deposit in the bond reserve account shall not be used to retire 
the outstanding bonds unless necessary to avoid a default. All other provisions relative to the bond 
reserve account shall remain as specifically set forth in the outstanding ordinance. 


Section 13. - Rates; rate covenant. 
    The rates to be charged for the services furnished by the system shall be those presently in effect in 
the city, and as set from time to time by the city council. In addition to the rate covenants set forth in the 
outstanding ordinance, the city further covenants and agrees to maintain rates and charges which will be 
sufficient to provide net revenues in an amount which equals or exceeds 115 percent of the amount 
required to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds then outstanding payable from the revenues of 
the system in the next fiscal year. For purposes of the foregoing covenant, net revenues may be 
augmented by an amount equal to the investment income representing interest on investments in the 
bond reserve account. 


Section 14. - Additional bonds. 
    While any of the outstanding bonds shall remain outstanding, no additional bonds payable from the 
system's revenues shall be issued that shall have a prior or equal standing to the outstanding bonds, 
except as provided in the outstanding ordinance. While any of the bonds herein authorized to be issued 
shall be outstanding, no additional bonds payable from the system's revenues shall be issued that shall 
have a prior or equal standing to the bonds, except as provided in the outstanding ordinance with the 
following modification: At such time as all outstanding bonds have been paid in full or defeased, the 
provisions of section 21 of the outstanding ordinance shall be revised to reduce the coverage 
requirements therein set forth from 140 percent to 125 percent of the largest annual principal and interest 
requirements thereafter maturing in any operating year on the then outstanding bonds, on any then 
previously issued bonds of equal standing with the bonds, and on the additional bonds then being issued. 
In all other respects, the requirements for issuance of additional bonds as set forth in the outstanding 
ordinance shall remain in full force and effect. 


Section 15. - Department of treasury approval; sale of bonds. 
    The bonds shall not be issued until the Michigan Department of Treasury grants prior approval for 
the issuance of the bonds or an exception from the prior approval requirements pursuant to Act No. 202 
of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1943 (MCL 131.1 et seq., MSA 5.3188(1) et seq.), as amended. The city 
clerk shall approve a form of notice of sale for the bonds, shall fix a date for sale of the bonds and publish 
the notice of sale in The Detroit Legal News, Detroit, Michigan. The city council shall receive bids for the 
bonds and award sale of the bonds to the successful bidder determined in accordance with Act 94 and 
this ordinance. 


Section 16. - Proceeds of bond sale. 
    From the proceeds of the bond sale there shall first be transferred to the bond and interest 
redemption fund, any premium and accrued interest paid to the city by the bond purchaser. The balance 
of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds shall be deposited with ____________ , ____________ , 
Michigan, in a separate depository account to be designated "Revenue Bonds Series 1992 Construction 
Fund" (the "construction fund"). Moneys in the construction fund shall be used solely to pay project costs, 
including any engineering, legal, financial, printing, and other expenses incident thereto and to the 
financing thereof. Payments for construction, either on account or otherwise, shall be made only upon the 
council's authorization; provided, that the council shall not authorize the payment of any such moneys for 
construction work until there shall have been first filed with it, by the consulting engineer in charge of such 
work, a written statement to the effect that the money to be paid is in full or partial payment of a contract 
obligation in connection with the project and that the city has received the consideration for such 
payment. The engineer's statement shall also show the amounts of the construction estimate that have 
been theretofore approved by him for payment and the amount of the balance required for the completion 
of the project. None of the proceeds of the bond sale are to be used to pay capitalized interest on the 
bonds or to fund any reserve account. 


Section 17. - Unexpended proceeds of bond sale. 
    Any unexpended proceeds of the bonds remaining after completion of the project may, in the 
discretion of the council, be used for further improvements, enlargements and extensions to the system if, 
at the time of such expenditure, such use is approved by the Michigan Department of Treasury, if such 
permission is then required by law, and if such use will not, in the opinion of nationally recognized bond 
counsel, impair the exclusion of interest on the bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes. 
Any remaining balance after such expenditure, or in the event no such expenditure is made, the entire 
unexpended balance, shall be paid into the bond and interest redemption fund and used only for 
redemption or purchase, at not more than the fair market value, of outstanding bonds of the issue from 
which the proceeds were derived. Any bonds acquired by purchase shall be canceled and shall not be 
reissued. The proceeds of the sale of the bonds may be invested in whole or in part in the manner 
provided by Act 94. 


Section 18. - Tax covenants; designation of qualified tax-exempt obligations. 
    Except as required by law, the city council will at no time cause the city to take any action or omit to 
take any action which, by commission or omission, would cause the bonds to be arbitrage bonds as 
defined in section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any successor provision, 
act or statute and the regulations from time to time promulgated or proposed thereunder (the "code"), 
including failing to rebate arbitrage earnings to the federal government if such rebate is required by the 
code. 
    The city council will not permit at any time or times the proceeds of the bonds or any other funds of 
the city to be used directly or indirectly in a manner which would result in the exclusion of the bonds from 
the treatment afforded by section 103(a) of the code, as from time to time amended, by reason of the 
classification of such obligations as private activity bonds within the meaning of section 141(a) of the 
code, or as obligations guaranteed by the United States of America, as provided in section 149(b) of the 
code; or cause interest on the bonds to be taxable for federal income tax purposes, or cause the interest 
on the bond to be includable in any alternative minimum tax other than an alternative minimum tax which 
applies to all tax-exempt bonds generally. 
    The city council hereby determines that the aggregate face amount of all tax-exempt bonds (other 
than private activity bonds) issued by the city (and all subordinate entities thereof) during the 1992 
calendar year is not reasonably expected to exceed $5,000,000.00. 
    The bonds are hereby designated as qualified tax-exempt obligations for purposes of deduction of 
interest expenses by certain financial institutions under section 265(b)(3) of the code. 


Section 19. - Penalty. 
    Any person, firm or corporation convicted of violating this ordinance shall be guilty of a misdemeanor 
and subjected to a fine not to exceed $500.00 or imprisonment in the county jail for a period not 
exceeding 90 days, or both, in the court's discretion, together with the cost of prosecution. Any violation 
hereof is deemed to be a nuisance per se. 


Section 20. - Headings. 
    The paragraph headings in this ordinance are furnished for convenience of reference only and shall 
not be considered to be a part of this ordinance. 


Section 21. - Recordation; publication; effective date. 
    This ordinance shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting of the city council at which it was 
adopted, as soon as practicable after its adoption, which record shall be authenticated by the signatures 
of the mayor and city clerk, and shall be published once in the Hastings Banner, a newspaper of general 
circulation within the city, promptly after its adoption. This ordinance shall become effective immediately 
after its adoption on July 27, 1992. 


Section 22. - Validity. 
    If any section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this ordinance shall be held invalid, it shall 
not affect any other part of this ordinance. 


Section 23. - Repeal. 
    All ordinances and resolutions and parts thereof, insofar as the same may be in conflict with the 
provisions of this ordinance, are hereby repealed.

    If less than all the outstanding bonds of a single maturity shall be called for redemption, the registrar 
shall select by lot, in such manner as it shall in its discretion determine to be fair and equitable, the bonds 
or portions thereof to be redeemed. Notice of the call for any redemption, which shall identify the bonds or 
portions of bonds to be redeemed, shall be given by first class mail, not less than 30 days prior to the 
redemption date, to the registered owner of each bond or portion of bond to be redeemed at the address 
shown on the bond register kept by the registrar; provided, however, that failure to give such notice by 
mailing or any defect therein shall not effect [affect] the validity of any proceedings for the redemption of 
bonds. Bonds or portions of bonds called for redemption shall not bear interest after the redemption date 
specified in such notice, provided funds for the payment thereof are then on deposit with the registrar. 
    This bond is transferable only upon the bond register of the city kept at the office of the registrar by 
the registered owner hereof in person, or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, upon the surrender of 
this bond duly endorsed for assignment, and thereupon a new registered bond or bonds of authorized 
denominations in the same aggregate principal amount and of the same maturity shall be issued to the 
transferee in exchange therefor as provided in the ordinances, and upon payment of the charges, if any, 
therein prescribed. No registration of transfer or exchange of this bond shall be made by the registrar 
between the 15th day of the calendar month immediately preceding an interest payment date and the 
interest payment date, nor after this bond has been called for redemption. The city and the registrar may 
treat the registered owner hereof as the absolute owner for the purpose of receiving payment on this 
bond and for all other purposes, and shall not be effected [affected] by any notice to the contrary. 
    This bond is not a general obligation of the city. The city is not required to levy taxes in an amount to 
pay the principal of and interest on this bond. This bond is a self-liquidating revenue bond and does not 
constitute an indebtedness of the city within any constitutional, statutory or charter limitation. The full faith 
and credit of the city is not pledged as security for the payment of the principal of or interest on the bonds. 
    The principal of and interest on the bonds are payable solely from the revenues of the system 
(including future improvements, enlargements and extensions thereof) after provision has been made for 
reasonable expenses of operation, maintenance and administration (the "net revenues"). The bonds of 
this issue are of equal standing and priority of lien as to the net revenues of the system and are equally 
secured with the city's outstanding water supply and sewage disposal system improvement refunding 
revenue bonds, dated as of October 1, 1970, presently outstanding in the principal amount of 
$150,000.00 (the "outstanding bonds"). The payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds and the 
outstanding bonds is secured by a statutory first lien on the net revenues of the system. 
    The city hereby covenants and agrees that at all times while any of the bonds of this issue shall be 
outstanding, it will maintain such rates for services furnished by the system as shall be sufficient to 
provide for the payment of the expenses of administration and operation of the system and such 
expenses for the maintenance thereof as may be necessary to preserve the same in good repair and 
working order and to cover the costs of expansion of the system; to provide for the payment of the 
principal of, premium, if any, and the interest on the bonds payable therefrom, as and when the same 
become due and payable; and to provide for such other expenditures and funds for the system as are 
required by the ordinances. Rates shall be fixed or revised from time to time by the city council to produce 
the foregoing amounts. 
    The city has designated this bond as a "qualified tax-exempt obligation" as defined in section 
265(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for purpose of deduction of interest 
expenses by certain financial institutions. 
    It is hereby certified that all acts, conditions and things necessary to be done by the city precedent to 
and in issuing the bonds have been done and performed and have happened in regular and due form as 
required by law, and that the total indebtedness of the city, including the bonds, does not exceed any 
constitutional, statutory or charter debt limitation. 
    This bond shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of 
authentication hereon shall have been executed by the registrar. 
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the City of Hastings, County of Barry, Michigan, by its city council, has 
caused this bond to be executed on its behalf with the facsimile signature of its mayor and countersigned 
with the facsimile signature of its city clerk, and a facsimile of its corporate seal to be affixed hereto, all as 
of the 1st day of September, 1992.

Section 8. - Registration and transfer. 
    The city treasurer is hereby authorized and directed to designate as bond registrar, paying agent and

duties under the laws of the State of Michigan. The city manager is hereby authorized to execute an

this section by the person or entity in whose name it is registered, in person or by the registered owner's 
duly authorized attorney, upon surrender of the bond for cancellation, accompanied by delivery of a duly

shall be surrendered for transfer, the issuer shall execute and the transfer agent shall deliver a new bond 
of the same series in like aggregate principal amount, maturity and interest rate. The transfer agent shall 
require the payment by the bondholder requesting the transfer of any tax or other governmental charge 
required to be paid with respect to the transfer. 
    Upon payment by the issuer of all outstanding principal of and interest on the bonds, the registered 
owner thereof shall deliver the bonds to the issuer for cancellation. 


Section 9. - Replacement of bonds. 
    If any bond shall become mutilated, the issuer, at the expense of the holder of the bond, shall 
execute, and the transfer agent shall authenticate and deliver, a new bond of like tenor in exchange and 
substitution for the mutilated bond, upon surrender to the transfer agent of the mutilated bond. If any bond 
issued under this ordinance shall be lost, destroyed or stolen, evidence of the loss, destruction or theft 
may be submitted to the transfer agent and, if this evidence is satisfactory to both and indemnity 
satisfactory to the transfer agent shall be given, and if all requirements of any applicable law including Act 
No. 354 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1972 (MCL 129.131 et seq., MSA 3.993(21) et seq.), as 
amended, have been met, the issuer, at the expense of the owner, shall execute, and the transfer agent 
shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new bond of like tenor and bearing the statement required by 
Act No. 354 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1972, or any applicable law hereafter enacted, in lieu of and 
in substitution for the bond so lost, destroyed or stolen. If any such bond shall have matured or shall be 
about to mature, instead of issuing a substitute bond the transfer agent may pay the same without 
surrender thereof. 


Section 10. - Payment of bonds. 
    The bonds and the interest thereon shall be payable solely from the net revenues pursuant to the 
statutory lien upon the whole of the net revenues created by section 7 [of this ordinance] and section 7 of 
the original ordinance which shall be a first lien to continue until payment in full of the principal of and 
interest on all the bonds or, until sufficient cash or sufficient government obligations have been deposited 
in trust for payment in full of all bonds of a series then outstanding, principal and interest on such bonds 
to maturity, or, if called for redemption, to the date fixed for redemption together with the amount of the 
redemption premium, if any. Upon deposit of cash or sufficient government obligations, as provided in the 
previous sentence, the statutory lien shall be terminated with respect to that series of bonds, the holders 
of that series shall have no further rights under this ordinance except for payment from the deposited 
funds; and the bonds of that series shall no longer be considered to be outstanding under this ordinance. 


Section 11. - Management; fiscal year. 
    The operation, repair and management of the system and the acquisition of the project shall continue 
to be under the supervision and control of the city council. The operating year of the system shall be the 
fiscal year of the issuer as such year may be changed from time to time. The fiscal year of the issuer is 
currently July 1 through June 30. 


Section 12. - Rates and charges; rate covenant. 
    The city will pay principal and interest on the 1997 bonds from sewer revenues. The sewer rates now 
in effect and the sewer rate increases to be placed into effect as of fiscal year 1998 are estimated to be 
sufficient to provide for the payment of the expenses of administration and operation and such expenses 
for maintenance of the sewer system as are necessary to preserve the sewer system in good repair and 
working order, to provide for the payment of the principal of and interest on all bonds secured by net 
sewer revenues as the same become due and payable, and the maintenance of the reserve therefor, and 
to provide for all other obligations, expenditures and funds for the system required by law and the original 
ordinance sewer rates shall be fixed and revised from time to time as may be necessary to produce these 
amounts; and it is hereby covenanted and agreed to fix and maintain rates for services furnished by the 
system at all times sufficient to provide for the foregoing. 
    No free service or use of the system, or service or use of the system at less than cost, shall be 
furnished by the system to any person, firm, or corporation, public or private, or to any public agency or 
instrumentality, including the issuer. 


Section 13. - Bondholders' rights; receiver. 
    The holder or holders of the bonds representing in the aggregate not less than 20 percent of the 
entire principal amount thereof then outstanding, may, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, 
protect and enforce the statutory lien upon the net revenues of the system, and may, by suit, action, 
mandamus or other proceedings, enforce and compel performance of all duties of the officers of the 
issuer, including the fixing of sufficient rates, the collection of revenues, the proper segregation of the 
revenues of the system and the proper application thereof. The statutory lien upon the net revenues, 
however, shall not be construed as to compel the sale of the system or any part thereof. 
    If there is a default in the payment of the principal of or interest upon the bonds, any court having 
jurisdiction in any proper action may appoint a receiver to administer and operate the system on behalf of 
the issuer and under the direction of the court, and by and with the approval of the court to perform all of 
the duties of the officers of the issuer more particularly set forth herein and in Act 94. 
    The holder or holders of the bonds shall have all other rights and remedies given by Act 94 and law 
for the payment and enforcement of the bonds and the security therefor. 


Section 14. - Flow of funds. 
    The issuer's treasurer is hereby directed to maintain the following funds and accounts into which the 
proceeds of the 1997 bonds and the revenues shall be deposited in the manner and at the times provided 
in this ordinance and the original ordinance, which accounts shall be established and maintained so long 
as any of the bonds remain unpaid, except as otherwise provided in this ordinance and the original 
ordinance. 
(a) ?1997 construction fund. Proceeds of the sale of the 1997 bonds (except as otherwise provided 
in sections 15 and 16 below [of this ordinance]) shall be deposited in the City of Hastings 1997 
Revenue Bonds Construction Fund (the "construction fund") in the depository bank. Moneys in 
the construction fund shall be applied solely in payment of the cost of the project and any 
engineering, legal and other expenses incident thereto and to the financing thereof, and shall be 
fully expended on project costs within three years after the date of delivery of the 1997 bonds. 
    Any unexpended balance of the proceeds of the 1997 bonds remaining after completion of 
the project may be used for further improvements, enlargements and extensions of the system 
in the discretion of the issuer, provided that at the time of such expenditure such use be 
approved by the Michigan Department of Treasury (if such approval is then required by law). 
Any remaining balance after such expenditure shall be paid into the 1997 bonds redemption 
fund (as hereinafter provided) and shall be used for the prepayment of the 1997 bonds. 
    After completion of the project and disposition of remaining proceeds, if any, of the 1997 
bonds pursuant to the provisions of this section, the construction fund shall be closed. 
(b) ?Reserve account. On the date of delivery of the bonds the city shall deposit into the bond 
reserve account from city funds on hand and legally available for such use an amount sufficient 
to cause the total amount on deposit therein to equal the 1997 reserve amount. 
    If at any time it shall be necessary to use moneys credited to the bond reserve account for 
such payment, then the moneys so used shall be replaced from the net revenues first received 
thereafter which are not required for current principal and interest requirements until the amount 
on deposit equals the reserve amount. If on any May 1 the amount in the bond reserve account 
exceeds the 1997 reserve amount, the excess shall be transferred to the redemption fund for 
payment of principal and interest on the 1997 bonds due on that date. 
(c) ?Replacement account. In addition to the amounts described in section 15(c) of the original 
ordinance, there shall be deposited into the replacement fund, in equal annual installments, 
after providing for all requirements of the operation and maintenance fund and the bond and 
interest redemption fund (including the bond reserve account) the sum of not less than 
$20,000.00, beginning July 1, 1998, and ending July 1, 2002, so that the total amount on 
deposit in the replacement fund shall total $125,000.00 by the close of the operating year 
beginning July 1, 2002. 


Section 15. - Investments. 
    Moneys in the funds and accounts established in the original ordinance and this ordinance and 
moneys derived from the proceeds of sale of the 1997 bonds may be invested by the issuer in United 
States of America obligations or in obligations the principal and interest on which is fully guaranteed by 
the United States of America or any other investments permitted by law, and moneys derived from the 
proceeds of sale of the bonds may also be invested in certificates of deposit of any bank whose deposits 
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Investment of moneys in the redemption fund 
being accumulated for payment of the next maturing principal or interest payment of the bonds shall be 
limited to obligations bearing maturity dates prior to the date of the next maturing principal or interest 
payment on the bonds. Investment of moneys in the reserve account shall be limited to obligations 
bearing maturity dates or subject to redemption at the option of the holder thereof, not later than five 
years from the date of investment. In the event investments are made, any securities representing the 
same shall be kept on deposit with the bank or trust company having on deposit the fund or funds or 
account from which the purchase was made. Profit realized or interest income earned on investment of 
funds in the receiving fund, including the operation and maintenance fund and surplus fund shall be 
deposited in or credited to the receiving fund at the end of each fiscal year. Profit realized on interest 
income earned on investment of moneys in the redemption fund, including income derived from the bond 
reserve account, shall be credited as received to the redemption fund. 


Section 16. - Bond proceeds. 
    Upon delivery of the 1997 bonds there shall be first immediately deposited from the proceeds of the 
1997 bonds in a separate account in the redemption fund, an amount equal to the accrued interest and 
premium, if any, received on delivery of the 1997 bonds. Next, proceeds of the 1997 bonds shall be 
deposited in the bond reserve account if provided in the resolution authorizing sale of the 1997 bonds. 
The balance of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds shall be deposited in the construction fund and 
applied as provided above.

maturity which have been previously redeemed or called for redemption (other than as a result of a 
mandatory redemption) or purchased or acquired by the issuer and delivered to the transfer agent for 
cancellation. 
    Notice of redemption shall be given to the registered owners of bonds called for redemption by 
mailing of such notice not less than 30 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to the registered 
address of the registered owner of record. Bonds so called for redemption shall not bear interest

said bonds.

the city treasurer by the registered owner hereof in person, or by his attorney duly authorized in 
writing, upon the surrender of this bond, together with a written instrument of transfer satisfactory to

same maturity shall be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor as provided in the resolution 
authorizing the bonds of this series, and upon the payment of the charges, if any, therein prescribed. 
    This bond is a self-liquidating bond and is not a general obligation of the issuer and does not 
constitute an indebtedness of the issuer within any constitutional statutory, or charter limitation, and 
is payable both as to principal and interest solely from the net revenues of the system and certain 
funds and accounts established under the ordinances. The principal of and interest on this bond are 
secured by the statutory lien hereinbefore described. 
    The issuer has covenanted and agreed, and does hereby covenant and agree to fix and 
maintain at all times while any bonds payable from the net revenues of the system shall be 
outstanding, such rates for service furnished by the system as shall be sufficient to provide for

system as and when the same shall become due and payable, and to maintain bond redemption 
funds (including a bond reserve accounts) therefor, to provide for the payment of expenses of

preserve the same in good repair and working order, and to provide for such other expenditures and 
funds for the system as are required by the ordinances. 
    This bond is transferable only upon the books of the issuer kept for that purpose at the office of 
the transfer agent by the registered owner in person or the registered owner's attorney duly 
authorized in writing, upon the surrender of this bond, together with a written instrument of transfer 
satisfactory to the transfer agent, duly executed by the registered owner or the registered owner's 
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon a new bond or bonds in the same aggregate 
principal amount and of the same maturity shall be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor as 
provided in the ordinances, and upon payment of the charges, if any, therein prescribed. 
    This bond is not valid or obligatory for any purpose until the transfer agent's certificate of 
authentication on this bond has been executed by the transfer agent. 
    It is hereby certified and recited that all acts, conditions and things required to be done, exist 
and happen, precedent to and in the issuance of said series of bonds of which this is one, in order to 
make them valid and binding obligations of the issuer, have been done, exist and have happened in

herein provided. The issuer will operate the system as economically as possible, will make all 
repairs and replacements necessary to keep the system in good repair and working order, and 
will not do or suffer to be done any act which would affect the system in such a way as to have 
a material adverse effect on the security for the bonds.

operate a system that will compete with the system and the issuer will not operate a system that 
will compete with the system.

not limited to actions relating to the rebate of arbitrage earnings, if applicable, and the expenditure and 
investment of bond proceeds and moneys deemed to be bond proceeds, all as more fully to be set forth 
in the nonarbitrage and tax compliance certificate delivered by the issuer with the 1997 bonds.
