Section 97 In towns which accept this section or have accepted corresponding provisions of earlier laws
there shall be a police department established under the direction of the Selectmen, who shall appoint a chief of

Section 98 The chief and other police officers of all cities and towns shall have all the powers and duties
of constables except serving and executing civil process. They shall suppress and prevent all disturbances and
disorder. They may carry within the commonwealth such weapons as the chief of police or the board or officer
having control of the police in a city or town shall determine; provided, that any law enforcement officer of
another state or territory of the United States may, while on official business within the commonwealth, carry
such weapons as are authorized by his appointing authority. They may examine all persons abroad whom they
have reason to suspect of unlawful design, and may demand of them their business abroad and wither they are
going; may disperse any assembly of three of more persons; and may enter any building to suppress a riot or
breach of peace therein. Persons so suspected who do not give a satisfactory account of themselves, persons so
assembled and who do not disperse when ordered, and persons making, aiding and abetting in a riot or
disturbance may be arrested by the police, and may thereafter be safely kept by imprisonment or otherwise
unless released in the manner provided by law, and taken before a district court to be examined and prosecuted.
If a police officer stops a person for questioning pursuant to this section and reasonably suspects that he is in
danger of life or limb, he may search such person for a dangerous weapon. If he finds such weapon or any
other thing the possession of which may constitute a crime, he may take and keep it until the completion of the
questioning, at which time he shall return it, if lawfully possessed, or he shall arrest such person.
Section 98A A police officer of a city or town who is empowered to make arrests within a city or town may,
on fresh and continued pursuit, exercise such authority in any other city or town for any offense committed in
his presence within his jurisdiction for which he would have the right to arrest within his jurisdiction without a
warrant. Said officer may return any person so arrested to the jurisdiction wherein said offense was committed.

town, provide police officers, who shall have the authority of constables and police officers within the limits of
such city or town, except as to the service of civil process, and, while exercising such authority within such

Section 100 Upon application by a fire fighter or police officer of a city, town or water district, or in the
event of the physical or mental incapacity or death of such fire fighter or police officer, by someone on his
behalf, the board or officer of such city, town or district authorized to appoint fire fighters or police officers, as
the case may be, shall determine whether it is appropriate under all the circumstances for such city, town or
district to indemnify such fire fighter or police officer for his reasonable hospital, medical, surgical, nursing,
pharmaceutical, prosthetic and related expenses incurred as the natural and proximate result of an accident
occurring, or of undergoing a hazard particular to his employment, while acting in the performance and within
the scope of his duty without fault of his own. If such board or officer determines that indemnification is
appropriate, such board or officer shall certify for payment, either directly or by way of reimbursement, by such
city, town or district, in the same manner as a bill lawfully incurred by such board or officer but out of an
appropriation for the purposes of clause (32) of Section 5 of Chapter 40, such of said expenses as may be
Town of Burlington, General Bylaws, Article IV 4-15
specified in such certificate. Whenever such board or officer denies an application in whole or in part, such
board or officer shall set forth in writing its or his reasons for such denial and cause a copy thereof to be
delivered to the applicant. At any time within two years after the filing of an application as aforesaid, an
applicant aggrieved by any denial of his application or by the failure of such board or officer to act thereon
within six months from the filing thereof may petition the superior court in equity to determine whether such
board or officer has without good cause failed to act on such an application or, in denying the application, in
whole or in part, has committed error of law or has been arbitrary or capricious or has abused its or his
discretion, or otherwise has acted not in accordance with law. After due notice and hearing, such court may
order such board or officer to act on such application or to consider, or further consider, and determine the
same in conformity with law.
A city, town or fire or water district shall further indemnify a fire fighter or police officer, or in the event of the
death of such fire fighter or police officer, his estate, to an amount not more than the amount recommended by
such board or officer, for expenses or damages incurred by such fire fighter or police officer in the defense of
settlement of an action brought against him for acts done by him while acting as a fire fighter or police officer.
No city or town or any fire or water district shall indemnify under this paragraph if insurance providing
indemnity for, or protection to, such fire fighter or police officer was in effect under authority of clause (1) of
Section 5 of Chapter 40 at the time when the expenses or damages for which indemnification is sought were
sustained, unless and until all rights under such insurance in favor of such city, town or fire or water district
shall have been exercised, determined and satisfied.
For the purposes of this section, call firemen and volunteer firemen shall be considered fire fighters. This
section shall be construed to require a city, town or district to indemnify, in the manner and to the extent herein
provided, any fire fighter or police officer who is assigned to special duty by a superior officer for expenses or
damages sustained by such fire fighter or police officer in the performance of such duty, whether or not he is
paid for such special duty by the city, town or district, or otherwise. This section shall also be construed to
require a city, town or fire or water district to pay compensation, in the manner herein provided, for damages,
including loss of pay, for personal injuries, whether or not death results, and for property damage sustained by
a person while assisting a police officer thereof in the discharge of his duty upon his retirement, and to require
a city, town or fire or water district to indemnify in the manner herein provided a person required to assist a
police officer in the performance of his duty for expenses or damages incurred by such person in the defense or
settlement of an action against him for acts done by him while so assisting such police officer.
In any town which by Bylaw shall so provide, the powers vested and duties imposed by this section upon the
board or officer authorized to appoint fire fighters in such town shall be exercised and performed by a majority
of the members of a panel consisting of (a) such officer or chairman of such board, (b) the town counsel or
other officer having similar duties, or a person designated in writing by such counsel or officer to act for him,
and (c) such physician as the Board of Selectmen shall in writing appoint.

Massachusetts State Police, the Massachusetts Department of Criminal Justice Information Services (“DCJIS”),
and/or the FBI or the successors of such agencies as may be necessary for the purpose of conducting fingerprintbased
state and national criminal records background checks for the license applicants specified in this by-law.
The Town authorizes the Massachusetts State Police, the DCIS and the FBI and their successors, as may be
applicable, to conduct fingerprint-based state and national criminal record background checks, including of FBI
records, consistent with this By-law. The Town authorizes the Police Department to receive and utilize State and
FBI records in connection with such background checks, consistent with this By-law and its implementing
regulations. In accordance with its implementing regulations, the Police Department shall communicate the results
of fingerprint-based criminal record background checks to the appropriate governmental licensing authority within
the Town.
8.3 Use of Criminal Record by Licensing Authorities
Licensing authorities of the Town shall utilize the results of fingerprint-based criminal record background checks for
the sole purpose of determining the suitability of the subjects of the checks in connection with the license
applications specified in this by-law. A Town licensing authority may deny an application for a license on the basis
of the results of a fingerprint-based criminal record background check if it determines that the results of the check
render the subject unsuitable for the proposed licensed activity. The licensing authority shall consider all applicable
laws, regulations and Town policies bearing on an applicant's suitability in making this determination.
Licensing authorities of the Town are hereby authorized to deny an application for any license specified herein and
in the implementing regulations, including renewals and transfers of said licenses, from any person who is
determined unfit for the license due to information obtained pursuant to this By-law. Factors that shall be considered
in making a determination of fitness shall include, but not be limited to, whether the record subject has been
convicted of, or is under pending indictment for a crime, that bears upon the subject’s ability or fitness to serve in
that capacity, including any felony or a misdemeanor that involved force or threat of force, possession of a controlled
substance, or sex-related offense.
Town of Burlington, General Bylaws, Article XIII 13-32
8.4 Fees
The fee charged by the Police Department for the purpose of conducting fingerprint-based criminal record
background checks shall be one hundred dollars ($100) for each fingerprinting and criminal history check. A portion
of the fee, as specified in Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 6, Section 172B½, shall be deposited into the
Firearms Fingerprint Identity Verification Trust Fund, and the remainder of the fee may be retained by the Town for
costs associated with the administration of the fingerprinting system.
8.5 Effective Date
This by-law shall take effect after compliance with Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 40, Section 32 have been
met.

ARTICLE XIV
ENVIRONMENT
1.0 Wetlands Protection Bylaw
1.1. Purpose
The purpose of this Bylaw is to protect the wetlands, water resources, flood prone areas, and adjoining upland
areas in the Town of Burlington by controlling activities deemed by the Conservation Commission likely to have a
significant effect on resource area interests deemed important to the community (collectively, the “resource area
interests protected by this Bylaw”). These include but are not limited to the following:
? public or private water supply
? groundwater supply
? flood control
? erosion and sedimentation control
? storm damage prevention including water quality
? prevention and control of pollution
? fisheries
? wildlife habitat
? rare species habitat including rare plant and animal species
? recreational and educational values
This Bylaw is intended to utilize the Home Rule authority of Burlington so as to protect the resource areas under
the Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L. Ch.131 §40; the Act) to a greater degree, to protect additional resource areas
beyond the Act recognized by the Town as significant, to protect all resource areas for their additional values
beyond those recognized in the Act, and to impose in local regulations and permits additional standards and
procedures stricter than those of the Act and regulations thereunder (310
CMR 10.00), subject, however, to the rights and benefits accorded to agricultural uses and structures of all kinds
under the laws of the Commonwealth and other relevant Bylaws of the Town of Burlington. This Bylaw shall not
be applicable to projects for which a Determination of Applicability, Order of Conditions, Order of Resource Area
Delineation or other permit under the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act has been issued and is valid or if an
application for one of the foregoing is pending at the effective date of this Bylaw. The Bylaw provisions in effect
prior to the effective date of this Bylaw shall apply to a project for which such approval has been issued or for
which such application is pending.
1.2. Jurisdiction
Except as permitted by the Conservation Commission no person shall remove, fill, dredge, build upon, degrade,
discharge into, or otherwise alter the following resource areas as defined in the Burlington Wetland Bylaw
Regulations: any freshwater wetlands; marshes; wet meadows; bogs; swamps; vernal pools; springs; banks;
reservoirs; lakes; ponds; beaches; lands under water bodies; lands subject to flooding by groundwater or surface
water; or lands adjoining these resource areas out to a distance of 100 feet, known as the buffer zone. The
Commission may establish performance standards for work within the buffer zone to protect the aforementioned
resource areas, however, the buffer zone itself is not a resource area.
Except as permitted by the Conservation Commission, no person shall remove, fill, dredge, build upon, degrade,
discharge into, or otherwise alter the following resource areas: streams; brooks; creeks; rivers; lands adjoining
these waterways out to a distance of 200 feet, known as the riverfront area. Said 200-foot riverfront resource area
shall apply to all streams shown on the map “Regulatory Streams of Burlington” to be adopted and incorporated in
regulations, whether the stream is perennial or intermittent.
All said resource areas (collectively the “resource areas protected by this Bylaw”) shall be protected whether or not
they border surface waters.
Town of Burlington, General Bylaws, Article XIV 14-2
1.3. Exemptions and Exceptions
The applications and permits required by this Bylaw shall not be required for work performed for normal
maintenance or improvement of land in agricultural and aquacultural use as defined by the Wetlands Protection
Act regulations at 310 CMR 10.04.
The applications and permits required by this Bylaw shall not be required for maintaining, repairing, or replacing,
but not substantially changing or enlarging, an existing and lawfully located structure or facility used in the service
of the public to provide electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, or other telecommunication services, provided
that written notice has been given to the Conservation Commission prior to commencement of work, and provided
that the work conforms to any performance standards and design specifications in regulations adopted by the
Commission.
The applications and permits required by this Bylaw shall not be required for emergency projects necessary for the
protection of the health and safety of the public, provided that the work is to be performed by or has been ordered
to be performed by an agency of the Commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof; provided that advance
notice, oral or written, has been given to the Commission prior to commencement of work or within 24 hours after
commencement; provided that the Commission or its agent certifies the work as an emergency project; provided
that the work is performed only for the time and place certified by the
Commission for the limited purposes necessary to abate the emergency; and provided that within 21 days of
commencement of an emergency project a permit application shall be filed with the Commission for review as
provided by this Bylaw. Upon failure to meet these and other requirements of the Commission, the Commission
may, after notice and a public hearing, revoke or modify an emergency project approval and order restoration and
mitigation measures.
Other than stated in this Bylaw or in regulations adopted by the Commission, subsequent exemptions created under
the Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L. Ch. 131 §40) and regulations (310 CMR 10.00) shall not apply under this
Bylaw.
1.4. Applications and Fees
A written permit application shall be filed with the Conservation Commission to perform activities with the
potential to affect resource areas protected by this Bylaw. The Commission may accept digital electronic copies in
lieu of paper copies. The permit application shall include such information and plans as are deemed necessary by
the Commission to describe proposed activities and their effects on the resource areas protected by this Bylaw. No
activities shall commence without receiving and complying with a permit issued pursuant to this Bylaw.
The Commission, in an appropriate case, may accept as the application and plans under this Bylaw any application
and plans filed under the Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L. Ch. 131 §40) and regulations (310 CMR 10.00), but the
Commission is not obliged to do so.
Any person desiring to know whether or not a proposed activity or an area is subject to this Bylaw may in writing
request a determination from the Commission. Such a Request for Determination of Applicability (RDA) or
Abbreviated Notice of Resource Area Delineation (ANRAD) filed under the Act shall include information and
plans as are deemed necessary by the Commission.
At the time of an application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified in regulations of the Commission. The
fee is in addition to that required by the Wetlands Protection Act and regulations.
Additionally, pursuant to M.G.L. Ch. 44 §53G and regulations promulgated by the Commission, the Commission
may impose reasonable fees upon applicants for the purpose of securing outside consultants including engineers,
wetlands scientists, wildlife biologists or other experts in order to aid in the review of proposed projects. Such
funds shall be deposited with the town treasurer, who shall create an account specifically for this purpose.
Additional consultant fees may be requested where the requisite review is more expensive than originally
calculated or where new information requires additional consultant services.
Only costs relating to consultant work done in connection with a project for which a consultant fee has been
Town of Burlington, General Bylaws, Article XIV 14-3
collected shall be paid from this account, and expenditures may be made at the sole discretion of the Commission.
Any consultant hired under this provision shall be selected by, and report exclusively to, the Commission. The
Commission shall provide applicants with written notice of the selection of a consultant, identifying the consultant,
the amount of the fee to be charged to the applicant, and a request for payment of that fee. Notice shall be deemed
to have been given on the date it is mailed or delivered. The applicant may withdraw the application or request
within five (5) business days of the date notice is given without incurring any costs or expenses.
The entire fee, at a mutually agreed upon amount, must be received before the initiation of consulting services.
Failure by the applicant to pay the requested consultant fee within ten (10) business days of the request for
payment shall be cause for the Commission to declare the application administratively incomplete and deny the
permit without prejudice, except in the case of an appeal. The Commission shall inform the applicant and
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) of such a decision in writing.
The applicant may appeal the selection of an outside consultant to the selectboard, who may disqualify the
consultant only on the grounds that the consultant has a conflict of interest or is not properly qualified. The
minimum qualifications shall consist of either an educational degree or three or more years of practice in the field
at issue, or a related field. The applicant shall make such an appeal in writing, and must be received within fifteen
(15) business days of the date that request for consultant fees was made by the Commission. Such appeal shall
extend the applicable time limits for action upon the application.
1.5. Notice and Hearings
Any person filing any application permit other than an RDA, shall at the same time give written notice thereof, by
certified mail (return receipt requested) or hand delivered, to all abutters at their mailing addresses shown on the
most recent applicable tax list of the assessors, including owners of land directly opposite on any public or private
street or way, and abutters to the abutters within 100 feet of the property line of the applicant, including any in
another municipality or across a body of water. The notice shall state a brief description of the project or other
proposal and the date of any Commission hearing or meeting date if known. The notice to abutters also shall
include a copy of the application or request, with plans, or shall state where copies may be examined and obtained
by abutters. An affidavit of the person providing such notice, with a copy of the notice mailed or delivered, shall be
filed with the Commission. When a person requesting a determination is other than the owner, the request, the
notice of the hearing and the determination itself shall be sent by the Commission to the owner as well as to the
person making the request.
The Commission shall conduct a public hearing on any permit application (or public meeting for an RDA) with
written notice given at least seven days prior to the hearing at the expense of the applicant, in a newspaper of
general circulation in the municipality. The Commission shall commence the public hearing or public meeting
within 21 days from receipt of a completed permit application, RDA, or ANRAD unless an extension is authorized
in writing by the applicant. The Commission shall have authority to continue the hearing, with the applicant’s
consent, to a specific date announced at the hearing or meeting, for reasons stated at the hearing or meeting, which
may include the need for additional information from the applicant or others as deemed necessary by the
Commission in its discretion, based on comments and recommendations of the boards and officials listed in §1.6.
The Commission shall issue its permit, in writing within 21 days of the close of the public hearing thereon unless
an extension is authorized in writing by the applicant. The Commission in an appropriate case may combine its
hearing under this Bylaw with the hearing conducted under the Wetlands Protection Act (G.L. Ch.131 §40) and
regulations (310 CMR 10.00).
1.6. Coordination with Other Boards
Any person filing a permit application, other than an RDA, with the Conservation Commission shall provide a
copy thereof at the same time, by certified mail (return receipt requested) or hand delivery, to the Board of
Selectmen, Planning Board, Board of Health, and Engineering Department. Digital electronic copies may be
submitted in lieu of paper copies. A copy shall be provided in the same manner to the Commission of the
adjoining municipality, if the property for which the application has been filed is within 100 feet of that
municipality. An affidavit of the person providing notice, with a copy of the notice mailed or delivered, shall be
Town of Burlington, General Bylaws, Article XIV 14-4
filed with the Commission. The Commission shall not take final action until the above boards and officials have
had 10 calendar days from receipt of notice to file written comments and recommendations with the Commission,
which the Commission shall take into account but which shall not be binding on the Commission. The applicant
shall have the right to receive any comments and recommendations, and to respond to them at a hearing or meeting
of the Commission, prior to taking final action.
1.7. Permits and Conditions
If the Conservation Commission, after a public hearing or meeting, determines that the activities which are subject
to the permit application, or the land and water uses which will result therefrom, are likely to have a significant
effect on the resource area values protected by this Bylaw, the Commission, within 21 days of the close of the
hearing or meeting, shall issue or deny a permit for the activities requested. The Commission shall take into
account the extent to which the applicant has avoided, minimized and mitigated any such effect.
If a permit is issued, the Commission shall impose conditions deemed necessary or desirable to protect said
resource area values, and all activities shall be conducted in accordance with those conditions. Where no
conditions are adequate to protect said resource area values, the Commission is empowered to deny a permit for
failure to meet the requirements of this Bylaw. The Commission may also deny a permit:
? for failure to submit necessary information and plans requested by the Commission;
? for failure to comply with the procedures, design specifications, performance standards, and other
requirements in regulations of the Commission; or
? for failure to avoid, minimize or mitigate unacceptable significant or cumulative effects upon the resource
area values protected by this Bylaw.
Due consideration shall be given to any demonstrated hardship on the applicant by reason of denial, as presented at
the public hearing. The Commission may waive specifically identified and requested procedures, design
specifications, performance standards, or other requirements set forth in its regulations, provided that: the
Commission finds in writing after said public hearing that there are no reasonable conditions or alternatives that
would allow the proposed activity to proceed in compliance with said regulations; that avoidance, minimization
and mitigation have been employed to the maximum extent feasible; and that the waiver is necessary to
accommodate an overriding public interest or to avoid a decision that so restricts the use of the property as to
constitute an unconstitutional taking without compensation.
In reviewing activities within the buffer zone, the Commission shall presume the buffer zone is important to the
protection of other resource areas because activities undertaken in close proximity have a high likelihood of
adverse impact, either immediately, as a consequence of construction, or over time, as a consequence of daily
operation or existence of the activities. These adverse impacts from construction and use can include erosion,
siltation, loss of groundwater recharge, poor water quality, and loss of wildlife habitat. The Commission may
establish, in its regulations, design specifications, performance standards, and other measures and safeguards,
including setbacks, no-disturb areas, no-build areas, and other work limits for protection of such lands, including
strips of continuous, undisturbed vegetative cover, unless the applicant convinces the Commission that the area or
part of it may be disturbed without harm to the values protected by the Bylaw.
In reviewing activities within the riverfront area, the Commission shall presume the riverfront area is important to
all the resource area values unless demonstrated otherwise, and no permit issued hereunder shall permit any
activities unless the applicant, in addition to meeting the otherwise applicable requirements of this Bylaw, has
proved by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) there is no practicable alternative to the proposed project with
less adverse effects, and that (2) such activities, including proposed mitigation measures, will have no significant
adverse impact on the areas or values protected by this Bylaw. The Commission shall regard as practicable an
alternative which is reasonably available and capable of being done after taking into consideration the proposed
property use, overall project purpose (e.g., residential, institutional, commercial, or industrial), logistics, existing
technology, costs of the alternatives, and overall project costs.
To prevent resource area loss, the Commission shall require applicants to avoid alteration wherever feasible; to
minimize alteration; and, where alteration is unavoidable and has been minimized, to provide full mitigation. The
Town of Burlington, General Bylaws, Article XIV 14-5
Commission may establish, in its regulations, design specifications, performance standards, and/or other measures
and safeguards, including the establishment of thresholds and limitations on amounts of permissible alteration of
resource areas. The Commission may authorize or require replication of wetlands as a form of mitigation, but only
with specific plans, professional design, proper safeguards, adequate security, and professional monitoring and
reporting to assure success, because of the high likelihood of failure of replication. Because of the uncertainty of
the long-term viability of created wetlands, the Commission may, in its regulations, establish replication to fill ratio
requirements exceeding 1:1.
If wetland resource areas are to be altered, the Commission may require a wildlife habitat study of the project area,
to be paid for by the applicant, whenever a resource area alteration is proposed that exceeds thresholds established
in regulations. The decision shall be based upon the Commission’s estimation of the importance of the habitat area
considering (but not limited to) such factors as proximity to other areas suitable for wildlife, importance of wildlife
“corridors” in the area, or actual or possible presence of rare plant or animal species in the area. The work shall be
performed by an individual who at least meets the qualifications set out in the wildlife habitat section of the
Wetlands Protection Act regulations (310 CMR 10.60).
A permit shall expire three years from the date of issuance. At the discretion of the Commission, any permit may
be renewed for additional three-year periods, provided that requests for renewals are received in writing by the
Commission prior to each expiration. Notwithstanding the above, a permit may identify requirements which shall
be enforceable for a stated number of years, indefinitely, or until permanent protection is in place, and shall apply
to all present and future owners of the land.
For good cause the Commission may revoke any permit issued under this Bylaw after notice to the holder, the
public, abutters, and town boards, pursuant to §1.5 and §1.6, and after a public hearing.
Amendments to permits shall be handled in the manner set out in the Wetlands Protection Act regulations and
policies thereunder.
The Commission in an appropriate case may combine the decision issued under this Bylaw with the permit issued
under the Wetlands Protection Act and regulations.
No work proposed in any application shall be undertaken until the permit, issued by the Commission with respect
to such work, has been recorded in the registry of deeds or, if the land affected is registered land, in the registry
section of the land court for the district wherein the land lies, and until the holder of the permit certifies in writing
to the Commission that the document has been recorded.
The resource area “vernal pools”, as defined in the regulations, includes all vegetated habitats within one-hundred
feet of the seasonal high water of said pools. The Commission shall presume that both the inundated and adjacent
upland areas provide essential habitat functions. This presumption may be overcome only by the presentation of
credible evidence which, in the judgment of the Commission, demonstrates that the pool or adjacent upland does
not provide essential habitat functions. Any formal evaluation shall be performed by an individual who at least
meets the qualifications under the wildlife habitat section of the Wetlands Protection Act regulations (310 CMR
10.60).
1.8. Regulations
At a public meeting and in accordance with the Open Meeting Law, the Conservation Commission may
promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this Bylaw, effective when voted and filed with the
town clerk. Failure by the Commission to promulgate such rules and regulations or a legal declaration of their
invalidity by a court of law shall not act to suspend or invalidate the effect of this Bylaw. At a minimum these
regulations shall reiterate the terms defined in this Bylaw, define additional terms not inconsistent with the Bylaw,
and establish filing and consultant fees.
1.9. Definitions
Except as otherwise provided in this by-law or in regulations of the Commission, the definitions of terms in this
Town of Burlington, General Bylaws, Article XIV 14-6
Bylaw shall be as set forth in the Wetlands Protection Act, MGL c. 131, § 40, and regulations, 310 CMR 10.00,
thereunder.
1.10. Security
As part of a permit issued under this Bylaw, in addition to any security required by any other municipal or state
board, agency, or official, the Conservation Commission may require that the performance and observance of the
conditions imposed thereunder (including conditions requiring mitigation work) be secured wholly or in part by
one or both of the methods described below:
(a) By a proper bond, deposit of money or negotiable securities under a written third-party escrow arrangement, or
other undertaking of financial responsibility sufficient in the opinion of the Commission, to be released in whole or
in part upon issuance of a COC for work performed pursuant to the permit.
(b) By accepting a conservation restriction, easement, or other covenant enforceable in a court of law, executed
and duly recorded by the owner of record, running with the land to the benefit of the Town of Burlington whereby
the permit conditions shall be performed and observed before any lot may be conveyed other than by mortgage
deed. This method shall be used only with the consent of the applicant.
1.11. Enforcement
No person shall remove, fill, dredge, discharge into, build upon, degrade, or otherwise alter resource areas
protected by this Bylaw, or cause, suffer, or allow such activity, or leave in place unauthorized fill, or otherwise
fail to restore illegally altered land to its original condition, or fail to comply with a permit or an enforcement order
issued pursuant to this Bylaw.
The Conservation Commission, its agents, officers, and employees shall have authority to enter upon privately
owned land for the purpose of performing their duties under this Bylaw and may make or cause to be made such
examinations, surveys, or sampling as the Commission deems necessary, subject to the constitutions and laws of
the United States and the Commonwealth.
The Commission shall have authority to enforce this Bylaw, its regulations, and permits issued thereunder by
letters, phone calls, electronic communication and other informal methods, violation notices, non-criminal citations
under M.G.L. Ch. 40 §21D, the Town of Burlington Bylaws, Article 1, General Provisions, §4, and civil and
criminal court actions. Any person who violates provisions of this Bylaw may be ordered to restore the property to
its original condition and take other action deemed necessary to remedy such violations, or may be fined, or both.
Upon request of the Commission, the Board of Selectmen and Town Counsel may take legal action for
enforcement under civil law. Upon request of the Commission, the chief of police may take legal action for
enforcement under criminal law. Municipal boards and officers, including any police officer or other officer having
police powers, shall have authority to assist the Commission in enforcement.
Any person who violates any provision of this Bylaw, regulations, permits, or administrative orders
issued thereunder, may be punished by a fine of not more than Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) per day.
Each day or portion thereof during which a violation continues, or unauthorized fill or other alteration
remains in place, shall constitute a separate offense, and each provision of the Bylaw, regulations,
permits, or administrative orders violated shall constitute a separate offense.
Note: Amended Art. 19, TM 1/25/2016; App. A.G. 5/16/2016; Posted 5/17/2016;
As an alternative to criminal prosecution in a specific case, the Commission may issue citations with specific
penalties pursuant to the non-criminal disposition procedure set forth in M.G.L. Ch. 40 §21D, which has been
adopted by the Town in the General Bylaws, Article 1, §4.
Town of Burlington, General Bylaws, Article XIV 14-7
Any person who purchases, inherits or otherwise acquires real estate upon which work has been done in violation
of the provisions of this Bylaw, or in violation of any order issued under this Bylaw, shall forthwith comply with
any such order or restore such land to its condition prior to any such violation; provided, however, that no action,
civil or criminal, may be brought against such person unless such action is commenced within three years
following the recording of the deed of the date or the death by which such real estate was acquired by such person.
The Board of Selectmen may, upon request of the Conservation Commission, instruct Town Counsel to take such
legal action as may be necessary to restrain a violation of this Bylaw and enforce the orders of the Conservation
Commission hereunder, and the Town Counsel shall forthwith comply with such instructions.
1.12. Burden of Proof
The applicant for a permit shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the credible evidence that the
work proposed in the permit application will not have unacceptable significant or cumulative effect upon the
resource area values protected by this Bylaw. Failure to provide adequate evidence to the Conservation
Commission supporting this burden shall be sufficient cause for the Commission to deny a permit or grant a permit
with conditions.
1.13. Appeals
A decision of the Conservation Commission may be reviewable in the superior court in accordance with M.G.L.
Ch. 249 §4.
1.14. Relation to the Wetlands Protection Act
This Bylaw is adopted under the Home Rule Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution and the Home Rule
statutes, independent of the Wetlands Protection Act (G.L. Ch. 131 §40) and regulations (310 CMR 10.00)
thereunder. In the event of an ambiguity or conflict as to the meaning of any “resource area” or other definitions,
the definitions in this Bylaw or regulations promulgated under this Bylaw shall control. It is the intention of this
Bylaw that the purposes, jurisdiction, authority, exemptions, regulations, specifications, standards, and other
requirements shall be interpreted and administered as stricter than those under the Wetlands Protection Act and
regulations.
1.15. Severability
The invalidity of any section or provision of this Bylaw shall not invalidate any other section or provision thereof,
nor shall it invalidate any permit, approval or determination which previously has been issued.

BURLINGTON STORM WATER MANAGEMENT BYLAW GOVERNING EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION
CONTROL FOR NEW AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS DURING CONSTRUCTION AND POSTCONSTRUCTION
PERIODS.
6.0 Erosion and Sedimentation Control
6.1 Purpose and Objective
Regulation of discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) is necessary for the protection of Burlington’s
water bodies and groundwater, and to safeguard the public health, safety, welfare and the environment. Increased and
contaminated storm water runoff associated with developed land uses and the accompanying increase in impervious surface
are major causes of impairment of water quality and flow in lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, wetlands and groundwater.
A. The harmful impacts of soil erosion and sedimentation are:
1. impairment of water quality and flow in lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, wetlands and groundwater;
2. contamination of drinking water supplies;
3. alteration or destruction of aquatic and wildlife habitat;
4. flooding;
5. erosion of stream channels; and
6. overloading or clogging of municipal catch basins and storm drainage systems.
This bylaw establishes storm water management standards for the temporary and final conditions that result from
development and redevelopment projects to minimize adverse impacts offsite and downstream which would be born by
abutters, townspeople and the general public. This bylaw complies with EPA regulations National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II final rule (Dec 8, 1999) requiring regulated municipalities reduce the discharge of
pollutants in stormwater to the maximum extent practicable and adopt bylaws to address the control of sources of pollutants
entering the municipal storm drain system.
B. The objectives of this bylaw are to:
1. Protect ground water and surface water to prevent degradation of drinking water supply
2. Require practices that eliminate soil erosion and sedimentation and control the volume and rate of storm water
Town of Burlington, General Bylaws, Article XIV 14-33
runoff resulting from land disturbing activities;
3. Promote infiltration and the recharge of groundwater;
4. Ensure that soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and storm water runoff control practices are
incorporated into the site planning and design process and are implemented and maintained;
5. Require practices to control waste such as discarded building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter,
and sanitary waste at a construction site that may cause adverse impacts to water quality;
6. To prevent pollutants from entering the Burlington municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and to minimize
discharge of pollutants from the MS4;
7. To ensure adequate long-term operation and maintenance of structural storm water best management practices so
that storm water structures work as designed;
8. Comply with state and federal statutes and regulations relating to storm water discharges; and
9. Establish Burlington’s legal authority to ensure compliance with the provisions of this by-law through inspection,
monitoring, and enforcement.

A. Application. Where a land disturbing activity of 20,000 ft2 or greater OR a land disturbing activity of 500 yd3 or greater of
earth volume is proposed, the site owner or his/her agent shall file with the Conservation Commission, eleven(11) copies of a
completed application package with a cover sheet specified by the Commission (available from the Commission office or the
Commission’s web site) (one for each Commissioner, 2 office copies, and 2 for distribution to other Boards (Board of Health
and Planning Board) for an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Permit. Permit issuance is required prior to any site altering
activity. While the applicant can be a representative of the site owner, the permittee must be the owner of the site.
The Conservation Commission (through its agent, the Conservation Commission Administrator) may, at its discretion, elect to
delegate its authority to the Planning Board to issue an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Permit, in order to expedite the
permitting process for an applicant who must appear before the Planning Board for other matters in connection with the
proposed work.
Within 7 days of the filing date, the Conservation Commission (through its agent) will make a determination on whether to
schedule a formal hearing before the Commission or delegate its authority under this bylaw to the Planning Board. This
determination will be made based on an assessment of the potential for sedimentation and erosion from the proposed land
disturbing activity (including grubbing, clearing and/or grading). The Commission’s agent will give consideration to the
original and proposed grading of the site, existing slopes, the presence of intermittent streams or channels, the size of the site,
and/or other factors which may contribute to runoff and erosion potential. Proposed projects where routine erosion and
sedimentation controls are needed, will be referred to the Planning Board for a simultaneous hearing for this permit with other
matters in connection with this project.
If the Conservation Commission or its agent delegates its authority under this bylaw to the Planning Board, the staff of the
Conservation Commission will transfer the original application package (and associated copies) to the Planning Board office
and notify the applicant in writing of the Commission’s decision to refer this application to the Planning Board and that the
hearing under this bylaw will be scheduled before the Planning Board within twenty-one (21) days of the receipt of a
complete application or at a time to coincide with other regulatory matters which are being heard by the Board on the same
project..
For sites where a land disturbing activity of greater than or equal to 10,000 ft2 but less than 20,000 ft2 is proposed, the site
owner or his/her agent shall file (at their option) with either the Conservation Commission or the Planning Board, two (2)
copies of a completed application package for a Standard Erosion and Sedimentation Control Permit. Permit issuance is
required prior to any site altering activity. While the applicant can be a representative of the site owner, the permittee must be
the owner of the site.
Within 7 days of the filing date, the agent of either the Conservation Commission or Planning Board will issue a Standard
Erosion and Sedimentation Control Permit under this bylaw. No public meeting or hearing will be required for sites in this
category. For sites in this size category that are not adequately covered by the Standard Erosion and Sedimentation Control
Permit, additional special conditions may be appended by the issuing Board or Commission. The issuing Board or
Commission may extend the 7 day turnaround time for issuing the Standard Erosion and Sedimentation Control Permit for
reasons of insufficient information of which the applicant has been notified in writing.
The Erosion and Sedimentation Control Application package (for sites which propose a land disturbing activity of 20,000 ft2
or greater) shall include:
1. a completed Application Form with original signatures of all owners;
2. a list of abutters, certified by the Assessors Office;
3. eleven (11) copies of the Storm Water Management
Plan and project description referenced in Section 6.7. of this bylaw.;

minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this bylaw may
have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement
agency will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the Board of Health for
a reconsideration and hearing.
A person commits an offense of this bylaw if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this
Section, without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency.
7.10 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm water discharge permit shall comply with all
provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Board of Health
and its Agents designated to enforce this bylaw prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
7.11 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS
Notwithstanding other requirements of local, state or federal law, as soon as a person responsible for a facility or operation, or
responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of or suspects a release (as defined in 310
CMR 40.0352 and 310 CMR 40.1600) of materials at that facility or operation resulting in or which may result in discharge
of pollutants to the municipal drainage system or waters of the Commonwealth, the person shall take all necessary steps to
ensure containment, and cleanup of the release.
In the event of a release of oil or hazardous materials, the person shall immediately notify the municipal fire and police
departments and Board of Health. In the event of a release of non-hazardous material, the reporting person shall notify the
Board of Health no later than the next business day. The reporting person shall provide to the Board of Health written
confirmation of all telephone, facsimile or in-person notifications within three business days thereafter. If the discharge of
prohibited materials is from a commercial or industrial facility, the facility owner or operator of the facility shall retain on-site
a written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least
three years.
7.12 ENFORCEMENT
Town of Burlington, General Bylaws, Article XIV 14-46
The Board of Health and its Agents shall enforce this bylaw, regulations, orders, violation notices, and enforcement orders,
and may pursue all civil and criminal remedies for such violations as noted below:
A. Civil Relief. If a person violates the provisions of this bylaw, regulations, permit, notice, or order issued thereunder, this
Board may seek injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction restraining the person from activities which would create
further violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
B. Orders. The Board of Health and its Agents designated to enforce this bylaw may issue a written order to enforce the
provisions of this bylaw or the regulations thereunder.
Orders of this Board may include:
(a) elimination of illicit connections or discharges to the MS4;
(b) performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(c) that unlawful discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist; and
(d) remediation of contamination in connection therewith.
The issuance of an enforcement order by a Board of Health Agent without a prior vote of the Board of Health to address
conditions that require immediate attention, is subject to ratification by the Board of Health at its next regularly scheduled
meeting.
The party responsible for completing monitoring, abatement or remediation must contract a person licensed to conduct such
work, as necessary. During and upon completion of the work, the professional opinion of this licensed person and a final
report will be required to be submitted to the Board of Health in summary and certification of said work being accomplished.
If the enforcing person determines that abatement or remediation of contamination is required, the order shall set forth a
deadline by which such abatement or remediation must be completed. Said order shall further advise that, should the violator
or property owner fail to abate or perform remediation within the specified deadline, the Town of Burlington may, at its
option, seek a court order requiring the property owner to perform the work.
C. Criminal Penalty. Any person who violates any provision of this bylaw, regulation, order or permit issued thereunder,
shall be punished by a fine. Each day or part thereof that such violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate
offense.
D. Non-Criminal Disposition. As an alternative to criminal prosecution or civil action, the Town of Burlington may elect to
utilize the non-criminal disposition procedure set forth in G.L. Ch. 40, S21D in which case the Environmental Engineer is
authorized to be the enforcing person designated to issues non-criminal disposition penalties. The penalty for the 1st violation
shall be $100. The penalty for the 2nd violation shall be $300. The penalty for the 3rd and subsequent violations shall be
$300. Each day or part thereof that such violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate offense.
E. Appeals. The enforcement decisions or orders of the Board of Health and its Agents shall be final unless modified or
reversed in a public meeting of the Board of Health. Persons aggrieved by an enforcement action by the Board of Health
and/or its Agents designated to enforce this bylaw may request a public meeting with the Board of Health within 7 days of
written enforcement action to review the circumstances and decisions related to the enforcement action. At this hearing, any
affected party has the right to appear, and have the right to inspect and obtain copies of all relevant inspection and
investigation reports, orders, notices, and other documentary evidence. If further relief by aggrieved persons is desired, such
relief shall be to a court of competent jurisdiction.
F. Remedies Not Exclusive. The remedies listed in this bylaw are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any
applicable federal, state or local bylaw.
7.13 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm water discharges associated with industrial activity,
including construction activity.
Town of Burlington, General Bylaws, Article XIV 14-47
B. Access to Facilities. Access to facilities shall be governed by the following:
1. To the extent permitted by state law and if probable cause exists, or if authorized by the owner or other party in control of
property which is not permitted with an NPDES Permit, the
Board of Health and its Agents may enter upon privately owned property for the purpose of performing their duties under this
bylaw and regulations and may make or cause to be made such examinations, surveys or sampling as the Board of Health
deems reasonably necessary. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the
authorized enforcement agency.
2. Under the conditions for access stated in Part (a) above, facility operators shall allow the Board of Health and its Agents
designated to enforce this bylaw, ready access to all parts of the premises for a facility not already regulated with a NPDES
Permit for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records relating to the discharge of storm water
that may contain sewage, hazardous materials or wastes, or other pollutants, and the performance of any additional duties as
defined by state and federal law. For NPDES permit holders, the Town of Burlington will contact the appropriate U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency enforcing agents to inform them of suspected violations of an NPDES permit for
discharges from that facility.
3. The Board of Health and its Agents designated to enforce this bylaw shall have the right to set up on any non-NPDES
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or
sampling of the facility's storm water discharge.
4. The Board of Health and its Agents designated to enforce this bylaw has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a
safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
5. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be
promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the Board of Health and its Agents designated to enforce
this bylaw and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
6. If the Board of Health and its Agents designated to enforce this bylaw has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which storm water is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this bylaw, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this bylaw or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court
of competent jurisdiction.
7.14 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS BY THE USE OF
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
The Board of Health designated to enforce this bylaw may adopt requirements identifying Best Management Practices for any
activity, operation, or non-NPDES permitted facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm
water, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further
discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
For NPDES permitted facilities, compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge
of storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of
this section. In the event that the Board of Health determines that additional BMPs may be required for NPDES permitted
facilities, the Board of Health may at its option, ask for EPA to review the terms of the facility’s NPDES permit to determine
if additional best management practices may be required.
Town of Burlington, General Bylaws, Article XIV 14-48
In the event that said person responsible for a non-NPDES property or premise, believes that said compliance with additional
BMPs is not required, the Board of Health may issue an enforcement order requiring such compliance. If said person refuses
to comply with such order for implementing additional BMPs, then the Town of Burlington may seek a court order requiring
such implementation.
Compliance with this bylaw, its regulations or BMPs, or policies promulgated under this bylaw does not imply that there will
be no contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants. Compliance with this bylaw, its regulations or
BMPs, or policies promulgated under this bylaw also does not relieve a person from being subject to such enforcement
actions as may be required to correct contamination, pollution, and/or unauthorized discharge of pollutants.
7.15 COMPENSATORY ACTION
In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this Bylaw, the authorized enforcement agency
may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance
workshops, creek cleanup, etc.
7.16 SEVERABILITY
The provisions of this bylaw are hereby declared to be severable. If any provision, paragraph, sentence, or clause, of this
bylaw or the application thereof to any person, establishment, or circumstances shall be held invalid, such invalidity shall not
affect the other provisions or application of this bylaw.
7.17 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS
Residential property owners shall have 60 days from the effective date of the bylaw to comply with its provisions provided
good cause is shown for the failure to comply with the bylaw during that period.
7.18 REMEDIES NOT EXCLUSIVE
The remedies listed in this bylaw are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law
and it is within the discretion of the authorized enforcement agency to seek cumulative remedies.
Note: Amended Art. 8 TM 9/25/06. App. AG 10/31/06. Posted 11/20/06.
8.0 DEMOLITION PERMIT DELAY
8.1 Intent and Purpose
It is the intent and purpose of this bylaw to preserve and protect from demolition, whenever possible, historically significant
buildings or structures which reflect distinctive features of the architectural, cultural, political, economic, and/or social history
of the town; to encourage owners of such buildings or structures to explore and develop alternatives to such demolition; to
seek out persons or entities who might be willing to purchase, preserve, rehabilitate or restore such buildings or structures
rather than demolish them; and thereby to preserve the historic resources of the Town, and to make the Town a more
attractive and desirable place in which to live, and so promote the general welfare.
8.2 Procedure
8.2.1 Notice of Intent to Demolish
No demolition permit shall be issued for any building or structure which was constructed one hundred (100) or more
years prior to the year of application, other than in conformity with the provisions of this Bylaw. An application for a
demolition permit shall first be filed by the applicant and/or property owner with the Inspector of Buildings, and a copy
of such application shall be forwarded within one (1) week by the Inspector of Buildings to the Historical Commission,
the Board of Selectmen, and the Planning Board. Such application shall be in the form provided and established by the
Inspector of Buildings and shall include a copy of the demolition plan, a description of the building or structure to be
Town of Burlington, General Bylaws, Article XIV 14-49
demolished, the reasons for the demolition and the proposed reuse of the property. If the applicant and/or property
owner is unable to specify the exact age of the building or structure, the application shall so state and shall set forth the
most approximate age known and the basis for such approximation.
8.2.2 Determination
The Historical Commission shall, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the application for a demolition permit, make a
determination whether the building is historically significant.
Non-Applicability
Upon determination by the Historical Commission that the building is not historically significant, the Historical
Commission shall submit a negative finding to the applicant and/or property owner, and a copy thereof shall be
furnished to the Inspector of Buildings. Upon receipt of such notification, or after the expiration of fifteen (15) days
from the date of submission of the demolition permit to the Historical Commission, the Inspector of Buildings may issue
the demolition permit.
Determination of Significance
Upon determination by the Historical Commission that the building is historically significant, the Historical Commission
shall submit a positive finding to the applicant and/or property owner, and a copy thereof shall be furnished to the
Inspector of Buildings who shall not issue a demolition permit. The Historical Commission shall then hold a public
hearing on the matter according to Section 8.2.3.
8.2.3 Public Hearing
The Historical Commission shall hold a public hearing within twenty (20) days after a positive Determination of
Significance to determine whether the building should be preferably preserved. The Public Hearing shall be held
pursuant to applicable statutory requirements. The newspaper publication and abutter notification shall be completed by
the Historical Commission at the expense of the applicant. The Historical Commission shall complete the following:
a) Hold a public hearing to determine the following:
(i) if the proposed demolition of the historically significant building or structure would be detrimental to the historical or
architectural heritage or resources of the Town, and therefore, such building or structure shall be considered preferably
preserved:
(ii) if less than a complete demolition is proposed, whether the work to be done will materially diminish its historical
significance, and
(iii) to explore alternatives to demolition.
b) Submit such determination according to Section (a) in writing to the Inspector of Buildings and the applicant and/or
property owner.
8.2.4 Determination of Non-Applicability
If after the Public Hearing the Historical Commission determines that the building or structure is not historically
significant, or where less than a complete demolition is being proposed that the work to be done will not materially
diminish its historical significance, then the Historical Commission shall within seven (7) days after the Public Hearing
notify the Inspector of Buildings of its determination. The Inspector of Buildings may thereafter proceed with the
proposed demolition in accordance with applicable law. The failure of the Historical Commission to issue its written
determination within seven (7) days after such hearing shall be deemed to constitute a determination that the building or
structure is not considered preferably preserved.
8.2.5 Determination of Applicability and Delay of Demolition
Town of Burlington, General Bylaws, Article XIV 14-50
If after the Public Hearing the Historical Commission determines that the building or structure is preferably preserved
and that the proposed work would materially diminish its historical significance, then the Historical Commission shall
notify the Inspector of Buildings with seven (7) days after the Public Hearing of its determination. The Historical
Commission is hereby empowered to impose a demolition delay of up to six (6) months from the date of such
determination. Written notice of its determination and the period of delay imposed shall be mailed promptly to the
applicant and/or property owner, and a copy thereof shall be furnished to the Inspector of Buildings who shall not issue
a demolition permit during the period specified therein; provided, however, that such permit may be issued prior to the
end of such period if the Historical Commission notifies the Inspector of Buildings that the applicant and/or owner (i)
has made a bona fide, reasonable and unsuccessful effort to locate a purchaser for the building or structure who has
agreed to, preserve, rehabilitate, restore or relocate same, or (ii) has agreed to alternatives to demolition as set forth in
Section 8.3.
8.3 Alternatives to Demolition
If the Historical Commission imposes a demolition delay as set forth in Section 8.2.5 and/or if alternatives to demolition are
developed in the public hearing which are acceptable to the applicant and/or owner, then the Historical Commission is hereby
empowered, in its discretion, to enter into an agreement with such applicant and/or property owner providing for such
alternatives and a time period for implementation of same. A copy of said agreement shall be filed with the Inspector of
Buildings and any other applicable Town agency, and thereafter no work shall be done on the building or structure except in
accordance with the terms of said agreement unless and until a new application for a demolition permit is filed and processed
hereunder.
8.4 Expiration of Demolition Delay
At the end of any period of demolition delay as set forth in this bylaw, including any alternatives agreed upon pursuant to
Section 8.3, the Historical Commission shall notify the Inspector of Buildings that the period of delay has expired, and the
applicant and/or property owner shall be entitled to apply for all necessary demolition permits to allow the work to go forward
as set forth in the Demolition Permit, and pursuant to applicable law.
8.5 Emergency Demolition
Nothing in this bylaw shall restrict or prevent the Inspector of Buildings from ordering the immediate demolition of any
building or structure which is determined to be imminently dangerous or unsafe to the public. The Inspector of Buildings
shall file a copy of any such order of emergency demolition with the Historical Commission.
8.6 Enforcement and Remedies
8.6.1 Enforcement
The Inspector of Buildings shall have the authority to enforce this Bylaw.
8.6.2 Non-Compliance
Anyone who undertakes demolition of any building or structure without complying with the provisions of this bylaw
shall be subject to a fine of three hundred dollars ($300.00). Each day such violation continues following such
demolition shall constitute a separate offense.
8.6.3 Issuance of Building Permit
No building permit shall be issued or be valid for any parcel or premises upon which a historically significant building
or structure, or property listed in the Cultural Resources Inventory, has been demolished by an intentional or grossly
negligent violation of this bylaw for a period of up to two (2) years after completion of such demolition.
8.6.4 Multiple Remedies
The remedies and enforcement procedures set forth in this Section may be applied separately or in conjunction with one
Town of Burlington, General Bylaws, Article XIV 14-51
another, or to act in any other manner in relation thereto.

ARTICLE V: DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS
SECTION 5.1.0 APPLICABILITY OF REGULATIONS
Except as otherwise provided by the General Laws and this Article, no building or structure, nor any accessory
building, shall be erected on a lot in any district unless the lot and building or structure shall conform to the
requirements of Section 5.2.0.
5.1.1 Compliance with Density Regulations Schedule
A separate lot of land complying with the requirements specified in Article V, Section 5.2.0 hereof (Density
Regulations Schedule) shall be provided for each dwelling or other principal use permitted in an RO District.
Every building or structure located on a lot shall comply with the requirements of said Density Regulations
Schedule, except where specifically provided otherwise by this Bylaw or by General Laws.
5.1.1.1 Projections
Nothing herein shall prevent the projection of cornices or eaves not exceeding thirty (30) inches in width,
or of open steps or window sills into any required yard or other open space.
5.1.2 Lot Interpretation and Restrictions
5.1.2.1 Determination of Area and Frontage
(a) The lot area shall include the horizontal area located within the lot lines, with the following exceptions.
(b) In determining the area and frontage of a lot there shall not be included any land within the limits of a
street upon which such lot abuts even if the fee to such street is in the same ownership as the lot, except
that if a corner lot has its corner bounded by a curved line connecting other bounding lines, which if
extended, would intersect, then area and frontage shall be computed as if such bounding lines were so
extended.
(c) Land which is determined by the Burlington Conservation Commission to be wetlands subject to
protection as defined by the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, Massachusetts General Laws
Chapter 131, Section 40 or as subsequently determined in a superseding Determination of Applicability
shall not be included in determining lot area. More particularly, wetlands shall include land under a
watercourse, pond or lake, banks bordering on such water bodies, bordering vegetated wetland areas, and
marsh and swamp areas but shall not include land subject to flooding.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, land which is determined to be wetlands shall be included as part of the lot
area for the purposes of determining how much of the lot must be kept open and landscaped under
Section 8.3.8.4, "Impervious Surfaces (in the Aquifer and Water Resource Districts)."
Further, wetlands that are kept in an open and natural state shall be counted as part of the lot kept open and
landscaped in satisfaction of the requirements of Section 8.3.8.4.
(d) Any lot in existence or contained in a subdivision filed prior to the effective date of this amendment
and subsequently approved shall remain conforming with respect to minimum lot area notwithstanding the
provisions of 5.1.2.1(c).
5.1.2.2 Division or Reduction in Area
No lot, upon which is then located any building or with respect to which a permit has been issued and is then
outstanding for the erection of any building, shall be divided or reduced in area in any manner unless said lot
shall thereafter be of sufficient area and width to meet the requirements of this Bylaw and unless such lot so
Article V
Town of Burlington Zoning Bylaw Page 5-2
altered and any buildings thereon shall meet all the other requirements of this Bylaw. If land be divided,
conveyed, devised or otherwise transferred in violation hereof, no building or other permits shall be issued with
reference to any of the land so transferred or to the lot(s) retained until all of such land and lots meets the
requirements of this Bylaw. Any land or easement taken by eminent domain or conveyed for a public purpose
for which the land or easement could have been or was taken by eminent domain shall not be deemed to be
transferred in violation of the provisions hereof.
On or after March 30, 1998, where any land or easement adjacent to an existing public way is taken by eminent
domain, or conveyed for a public purpose for which the land or easement could have been taken by eminent
domain by the Town or the Commonwealth, the remainder of the lot not so acquired or affected by said
easement shall be treated, in calculating the dimensional or density requirements of Section 5.2.0, as though the
portion of the lot so acquired or affected were still included as part of the premises. Furthermore, the owner of
the remainder of the lot shall not be deemed to have changed a site plan approved under Section 9.3.0. For the
purposes of this provision, a public purpose shall be the use of land for public roadway, sidewalk or utility
purposes. This provision shall not apply where the Town has taken or accepted land or easements for such
public purpose as the result of a petition or request by some or all of the owner(s) of land for the original
acceptance of a way as a public way.
5.1.2.3 Lots Partially in Burlington
When a lot in one (1) ownership is situated in part of the Town of Burlington and in part in an adjacent town or
city, the provisions, regulations, and restrictions of this Bylaw shall be applied to that portion of such lots as lies
in the Town of Burlington in the same manner as if the entire lot were situated therein.
5.1.2.4 Calculation of Aggregate Building Area to Ground Area Percentage
(a) Aggregate building area to ground area percentage shall be calculated by dividing building area
(defined as the sum of the cross sectional area of all buildings on a lot exclusive of cornices, eaves, gutters,
chimneys, steps, unenclosed porches, bay windows, balconies and terraces) by the lot area and multiplying
by 100 to give the percentage. The lot area shall be determined according to the provisions of
Section 5.1.2.1.
(b) Any building, or set of buildings located on a single lot, which was lawfully constructed, under
construction, or not yet under construction but part of a site plan approved prior to March 28, 1985 which
has not expired shall remain conforming within the meaning and application of Section 6.1.2,
"Nonconforming Buildings, Structures or Premises," and Section 6.1.4, "Damage to Nonconforming
Buildings, Structures or Premises," with respect to maximum aggregate building area to ground area
percentage notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.6.1(c). This provision shall not be construed to
exempt buildings, structures or premises which were nonconforming with respect to maximum aggregate
building area to ground area percentage on or before March 28, 1985. New construction or any
improvements to an existing building that increases the footprint of that building approved after
March 28, 1985 shall be subject to maximum aggregate building area to ground area percentage as
determined by the provisions of 5.1.2.4(a).
5.1.2.5 Lot-Slope Requirements in One Family Dwelling (RO) Districts
(a) Slope shall be calculated as the change in elevation divided by the horizontal distance over which the
change in elevation occurs multiplied by 100 to result in slope stated as a percentage. Slope shall be
measured perpendicular to the contour of the land from one lot boundary to another. Slope shall be
measured at least three points and averaged to ensure an accurate determination of the overall slope of the
lot.
(b) Where the ground slope is ten (10%) percent or less, the minimum lot area in One Family Dwelling
(RO) Districts shall be twenty thousand square feet. Where the average ground slope is more than ten
(10%) percent, the minimum lot size shall be increased by one thousand additional square feet for each
additional one percentage of slope, to a maximum of forty-five thousand square feet.
Article V
Town of Burlington Zoning Bylaw Page 5-3
Slope shall be measured to the nearest tenth of a percent. Minimum lot size shall be calculated as follows:
minimum lot size = 20,000 sq. ft. + 1,000 sq. ft. x (n-10.0), where n is the percentage of slope for the
lot, rounded to the nearest one tenth of a percent.
(c) Any lot in existence or contained in a subdivision filed prior to the effective date of this amendment
and subsequently approved shall remain conforming with respect to minimum lot area notwithstanding the
provisions of this section.
5.1.3 Limitation of Area of Accessory Uses
5.1.3.1 No accessory use or uses within a building shall occupy more than a combined total of twenty-five (25)
percent of the floor area of the principal building, other than required off-street parking.
5.1.3.2 In all but RO districts, no accessory uses or uses not within a building shall occupy more than a
combined total of twenty-five (25) percent of the unbuilt lot area, other than required off-street parking and
loading.
5.1.3.3 In RO districts, no accessory use or uses shall occupy part of the required front or side yards and not more
than twenty (20) percent of the rear yard, other than required off-street parking.
5.1.3.4 In all districts except RO, no accessory use shall occupy any part of the required minimum yard adjacent
to RO and RG districts.
5.1.3.5 In RO districts, no accessory building shall be more than twenty (20) feet in height.
5.1.4 Density Requirements for Religious and Educational Uses and Child Care Facilities
In RO and RG districts, churches or educational uses and their related facilities shall be subject only to: the
required front, side and rear minimum yards and minimum lot frontage as required in RO districts; to a
twenty-five (25) percent maximum aggregate building to ground area percentage; to the parking regulations as
provided in Article VII; and to Site Plan approval as provided by Sections 9.3.0 through 9.3.6.
In addition to the requirements listed above, child care facilities located on residentially zoned lots shall also be
required to provide or erect a landscaped buffer area, or buffer area comprised of existing natural vegetation
along the perimeter of the side and rear lot lines where such facility or facilities lot abuts a residentially zoned
or used lot. Such landscaped or natural buffer area shall be no less than ten (10) feet in width along the side
yard, and no less than twenty feet (20) feet along the rear yard of any such lot used for a child care facility or
facilities. Such buffer area shall also be reflected on a Site Plan submitted to the Planning Board in accordance
with the provisions of Section 9.3.0 through 9.3.6.
5.1.5 Floor Area Ratio

Article VI
Town of Burlington Zoning Bylaw Page 6-1
ARTICLE VI: NON-CONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
6.1.0 Applicability. This zoning by-law shall not apply to structures or uses lawfully in existence, or to a
building or special permit issued before the first publication of notice of the public hearing required by G.L. c.
40A, s. 5 at which this zoning by-law, or any relevant part thereof, was adopted. Such prior, lawfully existing
nonconforming uses and structures may continue, provided that no modification of the use or structure is
accomplished, except as authorized hereunder.
6.1.1 Nonconforming Uses.
6.1.1.1 Alteration of a Nonconforming use
Nonconforming Uses may be altered upon a determination by the Inspector of Buildings under the following
criteria so long as the alteration does not increase the nonconformity of said use. The following shall be
deemed to increase the nonconformity of said use:
A change to the nature and purpose of the use as it existed when the zoning bylaw took effect; or
An increase in the degree of use; or,
An increase in impacts of the use on the neighborhood (such as noise, traffic, odor and environmental effects).
In the event that the Inspector of Buildings determines that the alteration of the nonconforming use increases
the nonconformities under the above criteria, the Planning Board may, by special permit, allow such alteration
where it determines that the proposed alteration will not be substantially more detrimental than the existing
nonconforming use to the neighborhood. In making the determination that the alteration will not be
substantially more detrimental, the Planning Board shall consider, without limitation, impacts upon the
following: traffic volumes, traffic congestion, adequacy of infrastructure, noise, odor, scale, character and
visual effects.
6.1.1.2 Expansion of a Nonconforming Use
The Planning Board may issue a special permit to expand a nonconforming use in accordance with this
section only if it determines that such expansion of use shall not be substantially more detrimental than the
existing nonconforming use to the neighborhood. The expansion of a preexisting nonconforming use shall be
related to the general nature and purpose of the pre-existing nonconforming use. The addition of an unrelated
(prohibited) use on the premises shall be deemed a change in nonconforming use. In making the determination
that the extension will not be substantially more detrimental, the Planning Board shall consider, without
limitation, impacts upon the following: traffic volumes, traffic congestion, adequacy of infrastructure, noise,
odor, scale, character and visual effects. The Planning Board may not issue a special permit to change a
nonconforming use to another nonconforming use.
6.1.2 Nonconforming Structures and Premises.
6.1.2.1 The Planning Board may issue a special permit to allow for the reconstruction, extension, or
alteration, of a nonconforming structure or premises in accordance with this section only if it determines that
such reconstruction, extension or alteration is not substantially more detrimental than the existing
nonconforming structure to the premises, neighborhood and environment. The following including but not
limited to types of changes to nonconforming structures may be considered by the Planning Board:
1. Reconstruction, extension or structural change of a nonconforming structure, including an increase to
existing nonconformity, which does not create a new nonconformity. Each side yard setback shall be
considered separately in the determination of the nature of the nonconformity.
2. Extension of an exterior wall at or along the same nonconforming distance within a required yard.
Article VI
Town of Burlington Zoning Bylaw Page 6-2
3. Alteration to provide for a substantially different purpose or for the same purpose in a substantially
different manner or to a substantially greater extent.
4. Modification or alteration of the premises, including but not limited to parking, landscaping, or
impervious surface area.
6.1.2.2 The Planning Board may through a favorable administrative finding allow for alteration of a
nonconforming structure or premises in accordance with this section only if the alteration to the
nonconformity on site is diminimus in nature, unchanged or is improved and after a determination that such
alteration is not substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming structure or premises to the
premises, neighborhood and environment.
6.1.3 Nonconforming Single and Two Family Residential Structures. Nonconforming single and two family
residential structures may be reconstructed, extended, altered, or structurally changed upon a determination by the
Inspector of Buildings under the criteria herein that such proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change
does not increase the nonconformity of said structure or premises. The following shall not be deemed to increase
the nonconformity of single or two-family structures:
1. Alteration to a structure located on a lot with insufficient area which complies with all current
setback, yard, building coverage, and building height requirements, where no new nonconformities
are created.
2. Alteration to a structure located on a lot with insufficient frontage which complies with all current
setback, yard, building coverage, and building height requirements, where no new nonconformities
are created.
3. Alteration to a structure which encroaches upon one or more required yard or setback areas, where
the alteration will comply with all current setback, yard, building coverage and building height
requirements, where no additional nonconformities are created. Each side yard setback shall be
considered separately in the determination of the nature of the nonconformity.
In the event that the Inspector of Buildings determines that the nonconforming nature of such structure would be
increased by the proposed reconstruction, extension or alteration, the Planning Board may, by special permit,
allow such reconstruction, extension, or alteration where it determines that the proposed modification will not be
substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming structure to the neighborhood. The Planning Board
may not authorize new nonconformities, where a pre-existing nonconformity does not exist. Each side yard
setback shall be considered separately in the determination of the nature of the nonconformity. Introduction of
any new nonconformity would require a variance from the Board of Appeals.
6.1.4 Abandonment or Non-Use. A nonconforming use or structure which has been abandoned, or not used for a
period of two years, shall lose its protected status and be subject to all of the provisions of this Zoning Bylaw. The
abandonment of a nonconforming use results from the concurrence of two factors; (1) the intent to abandon and
(2) the voluntary conduct that carries the implication of abandonment.
6.1.5 Reconstruction after Catastrophe. Any nonconforming structure may be reconstructed after a
catastrophe in accordance with the following provisions:
1. Reconstruction of said premises shall commence within two years after such catastrophe. Provided
however that if a request to the Planning Board before the expiration of two years, the Planning Board
may extend the time for reconstruction for up to 4 years from the date of the catastrophe if the Board find
that the applicant has exercised due diligence.
6.1.6 Reversion to Nonconformity. No nonconforming use shall, if changed to a conforming use, revert to a
nonconforming use.

container within a building, or in a free standing container above ground level with protection adequate to
contain a spill the size of the container's total storage capacity plus ten percent (10%) to prevent spills or leaks
from reaching groundwater or surface waters.
8.3.7 Special Permit Procedure
8.3.7.1 Any use or activity identified in the use regulations schedule contained in Sections 4.2.0 through 4.4.0 of
this Bylaw which requires a Special Permit in the Aquifer or Water Resource Districts shall require the
submission of an application to the Planning Board for approval of such use or activity in accordance with
Section 9.2.0.
8.3.7.2 Submittal: The following shall be submitted in addition to the requirements of Section 9.2.0 in applying
for a special permit within the Aquifer or Water Resource Districts:
a) A complete list of all chemicals, pesticides, fuels, and other potentially toxic or hazardous materials to
be used or stored on the premises in quantities greater than those associated with normal household use,
accompanied by a description of measures proposed to protect from vandalism, corrosion, and leakage,
and to provide for spill prevention and countermeasures.
b) A description of potentially toxic or hazardous wastes to be generated, indicating storage and disposal
method.
c) Evidence of joint permit approval under the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) Rules and
Regulations Covering Discharge of Sewage, Drainage Substances, or Wastes to Sewerage Works within
the Metropolitan Sewerage District, and the Town of Burlington's Regulation of Sewer Use for any
discharge of industrial wastes to the sewer system.
d) For storage of toxic and hazardous materials, evidence of qualified professional supervision of system
design, installation, and operational management.
e) Analysis by a qualified professional engineer experienced in groundwater evaluation and/or hydrology
certifying compliance with Section 8.3.7.3 below.
8.3.7.3 Special Permit Criteria: Special permits shall only be granted if the Planning Board determines that at
the boundaries of the premises the groundwater quality resulting from on-site waste disposal, other on-site
operations, natural recharge, and background water quality will not fall below the standards established by the
Department of Environmental Protection in "Drinking Water Standards of Massachusetts", or for parameters
Article VIII
Town of Burlington Zoning Bylaw Page 8-9
where no standard exists, below standards established by the Board of Health and, where existing groundwater
quality is already below those standards, upon determination that the proposed activity will result on no further
degradation.
8.3.7.4 Approval: Special permit shall be granted only if the Planning Board determines that the intent of this
bylaw and the criteria of Section 9.2.4 are met. In making such determination, the Planning Board shall give
consideration to the simplicity, reliability, and feasibility of the control measures proposed and the degree of
threat to water quality which would result of the control measure(s) were to fail.
8.3.8 Design and Operations Requirements
Within Aquifer and Water Resource Districts, the following design and operations requirements shall be observed:
8.3.8.1 Safeguards: Provision shall be made to protect against toxic or hazardous materials discharge or loss
through corrosion, accidental damage, spillage, or vandalism through such measures as provision for spill control
in the vicinity of chemical or fuel delivery points, secure storage areas for toxic or hazardous materials, and
indoor storage provisions for corrodible or dissolvable materials.
8.3.8.2 Location: Where the premises are partially outside of the Aquifer or Water Resource Districts, such
potential pollution sources as on-site waste disposal systems shall, to the degree feasible, be located outside the
District.
8.3.8.3 Disposal: Provisions shall be made to assure that any waste disposed into the sewers shall conform with
the MWRA's Rules and Regulations Covering Discharge of Sewage, Drainage Substances, or Wastes to
Sewerage Works within the Metropolitan Sewerage District and the Town of Burlington's Sewer Use
Regulations. Connecting sewers from the building shall be vitreous clay pipe or any other pipe shown to provide
equivalent protection against corrosion.
8.3.8.4 Impervious Surfaces: Within the Aquifer and Water Resource Districts, not less than forty percent (40%)
of the lot shall be landscaped or if wooded, may be left in a natural state. Within the Aquifer and Water Resource
Districts all streets, sidewalks, parking areas, driveways, ramps, service areas, loading docks, and exterior service
areas shall be paved or surfaced with impervious materials; in areas where contamination or other environmental
factors do not preclude infiltration, porous pavement, porous concrete and/or permeable pavers may be used. All
systems shall be designed and constructed so that water falling on such areas and on buildings on the same
premises, and spilled liquid substances on such areas and in adjacent buildings, will be contained and controlled
and directed into an approved system of pipes and/or drainage structures. Such drainage system shall trap for
removal, all oil based pollutants and suspended sediment and materials and shall provide for the full recharge of
stormwater and precipitation to the ground beneath the site by the use of leaching structures, pipes, and fields, or
an approved low impact development technique. The outlet from such drainage system shall be designed to
obtain the efficient operation of the leaching structures and to allow the passage of excess amounts of water so
that no flooding of the site will occur. Residential lots which render impervious not more than fifteen percent
(15%) or 2,500 square feet of the lot, whichever is greater, shall be exempt from this recharge and maintenance
requirement. A drainage maintenance schedule shall be developed, subject to the approval of the Board of Health
and the Town Engineer, which provides for the periodic inspection and maintenance of all drainage structures and
systems. The property owner shall be responsible for continually implementing such drainage system
maintenance.
8.3.8.5 Monitoring: Periodic monitoring may be required as a condition of approval of a special permit or site
plan by the Planning Board, including sampling of wastewater disposed to off-site systems or drywells and
sampling from groundwater monitoring wells to be located and constructed as specified in the special permit with
reports to be submitted to the Planning Board and the Board of Health, and costs to be borne by the owner or
operator of the premises.
8.3.9 Non-Conforming Uses
Article VIII
Town of Burlington Zoning Bylaw Page 8-10
Non-conforming uses which were lawfully existing or having been begun in reliance upon application or receipt of
a building permit or special permit prior to the first publication of the notice of the public hearing of this Bylaw
amendment, may be continued. In addition, such non-conforming uses may be extended or altered, as specified in
MGL Chapter 40A, Section 6, and Section 6 of this Bylaw, provided that, in addition to the other requirements of
Section 6.1.0 of this Bylaw, there is a finding by the Planning Board that such extension or alteration does not
increase the danger of surface water or groundwater pollution or adversely affect surface water or groundwater
quality from such use. The terms extended or altered shall include, but not be limited to, a change in the
substance(s) that constitute the hazardous material(s) or waste(s).
SECTION 8.4.0 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES
8.4.1 Purpose and Intent
The Town of Burlington recognizes the quasi-public nature of wireless communications systems and
finds that these regulations are necessary to protect public safety, to protect the ecological, scenic,
historical and recreational values of the Town and to ensure that adverse visual and operational effects
will not contribute to blighting, deterioration or other deleterious effects upon the surrounding
neighborhood.
It is the intent of this Section to provide for establishment and/or expansion of cellular telephone, mobile
radio and personal communication and similar systems within the Town of Burlington while protecting
neighborhoods and minimizing the adverse visual and aesthetic effects of wireless telecommunications
facilities through careful design, siting and screening and in furtherance of the requirements of the federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996. More specifically the Section has been developed in order to:
a) Comply with the intent and obligations of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996;
b) Increase and promote competition in the telecommunications industry;
c) Regulate the siting of wireless communications facilities relative to visual and aesthetic concerns;
d) Encourage the use of screening and camouflaging techniques to minimize adverse visual and aesthetic
impacts of wireless communications facilities on adjacent properties and residential neighborhoods;
e) Minimize the overall number of wireless communications facilities and structures as may be necessary
to provide wireless communications services within the community, by promoting shared use of
facilities among multiple providers while providing reasonable opportunity for all providers to operate
facilities within the community;
f) Maximize use of existing and approved towers and other structures to accommodate new antennas and
transmitters in order to reduce the number of wireless communications facilities needed to serve the
community;
g) Minimize the location of facilities in visually sensitive areas;
h) Site facilities below visually prominent ridge lines;
i) Protect historic and residential areas from potential adverse impacts of such facilities;
j) Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from facility failure through engineering and careful
siting of facilities.
8.4.2 Definitions
For the following definitions refer to Article II: Definitions, “Wireless Communication Facilities” (WCF) and
“Wireless Communication Services” (WCS).
Article VIII
Town of Burlington Zoning Bylaw Page 8-11
8.4.3 General Requirements
a) Wireless communications facilities, including towers, poles, antennas, satellite dishes, and
accessory equipment cabinets, shall be considered structures under this Zoning Bylaw and shall
be subject to the density and dimensional requirements of Section 5.2.0.
b) No wireless communications facility, including towers, poles, antennas, and satellite dishes shall
be erected or installed except in compliance with the provisions of this Section. Unless
otherwise noted in Section 4.3.0 “Accessory Use Regulations Schedule” or in subsection “c”
below, a special permit is required from the Planning Board. Any proposed construction of a
new freestanding support structure, extension in height of an existing freestanding facility, or
replacement of an existing freestanding facility, shall be subject to a new application for a
special permit.
c) Wireless communication facilities may only be located within the overlay districts identified on
the map entitled “Town of Burlington - Wireless Communications Overlay Districts”. Such
properties are also enumerated by Assessor’s Map and Parcel number in the “Comprehensive
Plan for Wireless Communication Facilities in Burlington, MA.” WCF’s involving new
freestanding support structures, or any facility proposed to be located within 200 feet of a
property occupied by a residence shall be permitted in these overlay districts by special permit,
pursuant to the criteria set out under Section 9.2.0 of this Bylaw, in addition to the approval
criteria of this Section. WCF’s proposed to co-locate on a previously approved free-standing
support structure shall be permitted by right in these overlay districts. Building facade-mounted
facilities and building rooftop facilities which are more than 200 feet from a property occupied
by a residence shall be permitted by right in the overlay districts. (Municipal communication
facilities shall be exempt from this section).
d) Wireless communications facilities shall be screened and/or camouflaged to minimize their
visual and aesthetic impacts upon the surrounding neighborhood.
e) Wireless communications facilities shall be sited so as to minimize visibility from abutting
streets and nearby buildings and to limit the need to remove existing vegetation.
f) Collocation is generally viewed as preferable to construction of a new freestanding support
structure where it is assumed that collocation may often be less imposing on the landscape. To
minimize the number of wireless communications facility sites in the community in the future,
the proposed facility shall be designed and constructed so it is reasonably capable of
accommodating other users, including other wireless communication companies and local
police, fire and ambulance companies, unless the Planning Board determines that such use is
technically infeasible, based upon the evidence submitted.
g) Where a new freestanding support structure is proposed, alternative structures that employ
“stealth” or camouflage techniques, such as artificial trees and flagpoles, shall be considered
preferred. Free standing monopoles are less preferential, but may be acceptable where the
applicant can successfully demonstrate to the Planning Board that the proposed facility will have
minimal visual impact on the landscape. Lattice towers and guyed towers shall not be permitted
unless the Planning Board determines that no other structure is feasible due to subsurface
conditions, topography, or other extenuating geologic or geographic circumstances. (Structures
that were existing when this bylaw became effective shall be exempt from this provision)
h) For freestanding support structures, any principal part of the structure shall be setback from the
nearest residential dwelling by a minimum distance equal to the height of the facility (as
measured to its highest point, including antennae, etc.), or a distance of two hundred feet (200’),
whichever is greater.
Article VIII
Town of Burlington Zoning Bylaw Page 8-12
i) Wireless communication facilities shall not be permitted within eight hundred (800) feet of a
public school building.
j) No artificial lighting shall be installed unless required by the Federal Aviation Administration.
If such lighting is required, it shall be screened so as not to project its light below the horizontal
plane in which it is located.
k) No interference to existing television, cable television or radio signals, including emergency
systems and public safety communications, shall be permitted from the facility or components
thereon. If interference occurs, it shall be the responsibility of the facility owner to immediately
remedy it.
l) A wireless communications facility may be sited on a lot which already accommodates a lawful
principal use. Due consideration will be given to the use, size, and other structures on the lot,
and other applicable sections of this bylaw, during the Board’s review of the special permit
application.
m) All structures and/or equipment erected for providing wireless communication services shall be
removed within six (6) months of cessation of use at the owner’s expense.
n) Antennas and directly related facilities used exclusively for communication for the purpose of
federally licensed amateur radio operators shall be exempt from this section.
8.4.4 Design Criteria
The following guidelines shall be used when preparing plans for the siting and construction of all wireless
communications facilities:
a) All free standing towers and monopoles shall be designed to be constructed at the minimum
height necessary to accommodate the anticipated and future users.
b) All satellite dishes and antennas attached to a structure shall be screened or camouflaged so as to
minimize visibility from abutting streets and residences. All support equipment shall be painted,
colored, molded, and/or installed to blend into the structure or background horizon/landscape.
c) Free standing wireless communications facilities shall be located on the landscape in such a
manner so as to minimize visibility from abutting streets and residences and to minimize the
need to remove existing vegetation. All equipment shall be painted, colored, molded, and/or
installed to blend into the landscape.
d) Wireless communications facilities shall be designed to accommodate the maximum number of
users. The intent of this requirement is to reduce the total number of structures which will be
required to provide service throughout the community by multiple providers.
e) All free standing towers, poles, and similar support structures shall maintain a fall zone from any
adjacent residential buildings or structures not associated with the wireless communications
facility, or the proponent shall submit a structural analysis from a professional structural
engineer certifying that the proposed structure does not need a fall zone due to its design
specifications. A fall zone shall not be required for antenna panels, whip antennas, or satellite
dishes, which are attached to existing structure facades or erected on building rooftops.
f) Fencing shall be provided to provide security and control access to freestanding wireless
communications facilities and ground mounted support equipment. Additional landscaping shall
be required to provide additional screening for safety as well as to enhance the visual and
aesthetic appearance of the facility, in consideration of the character of the neighborhood in
which the facility is proposed. The fencing style and specific landscaping species and quantities
Article VIII
Town of Burlington Zoning Bylaw Page 8-13
shall be shown on a landscaping plan to be approved by the Planning Board as part of the special
permit approval process.
g) There shall be no signs, except for “no trespassing” signs, and any required safety signage. No
advertising shall be permitted on the facility. All signs shall conform with the sign regulations
of Article XIII of this Bylaw.
h) Night lighting of facilities shall be prohibited unless required by the Federal Aviation
Administration. Lighting shall be limited to that needed for emergencies and/or as required by
the FAA. If such lighting is required, it shall be screened so as not to project its light below the
horizontal plane in which it is located.
i) For free standing towers, monopoles, or satellite dishes, there shall be a minimum and maximum
of one (1) off street parking space for each facility, to be used in connection with the
maintenance of the site, and not to be used for the permanent storage of vehicles or other
equipment. When abutting residential districts, such parking space shall be suitably situated and
screened to minimize its potential visual impact on such abutting residences.
j) Unless otherwise required by the Federal Communications Commission or the Federal Aviation
Administration, facilities shall be painted noncontrasting gray or blue in color, or camouflaged
with some other treatment deemed acceptable by the Board. Facade mounted antenna(e) shall be
non-contrasting or camouflaged to match the background color of the surface to which they are
attached.
k) Any related equipment and appurtenances shall not be more than twelve (12) feet in height.
l) All utilities proposed to serve the facility shall preferably be installed underground.
m) Dish antennae shall be no more than six (6) feet in diameter, and shall be mesh (rather than
solid). Panel antennae shall be no more than five (5) feet in height.
n) Antennas or panels which are located on nonresidential buildings shall be mounted so as to be
less than twelve (12) feet in height above the roof of the building.

The Planning Board shall adopt and maintain design review regulations to govern the future construction and reuse
of properties in the Town Center. Adoption and amendment to such regulations shall require a public hearing in
accordance with Section 9.6.0 of this Bylaw, and with notice to Town Meeting Members. Such regulations shall
address:
1. Facade and exterior building treatment, including the style and sizes of all signage affixed to
buildings;
2. A minimum percentage of landscaped surface area;. All open space, landscaped and usable, shall be
designed to add to the visual amenities of the area by maximizing, in so far as practical, its visibility for
persons passing the site or overlooking it from nearby properties.
3. A reduction in the number of existing curb openings that exist on the premises;
4. The placement of utilities and wiring underground to the extent possible;
5. The placement of HVAC equipment, fans, generators, and other site related structures and items so
that they are not visible on roofs or building frontage areas, or that such features are suitably screened
from view;
6. The layout & design of parking and loading spaces;
7. Other design standards and conditions deemed appropriate by the Planning Board; and,
8. Pedestrian amenities - sidewalks to provide access between parking areas and uses, and between
properties.

insofar as practicable, by minimizing tree and soil remove and any grade changes shall be in keeping with
the general appearance or neighboring developed area.
10. Relation of buildings to environment. The proposed development shall be related harmoniously to the
terrain and to the design, scale, and architecture of existing buildings in the surrounding area that have
visual relationship to the proposed buildings, in so far as practical. Proposed buildings shall be related to
their surroundings with respect to:
a) Street facade and exterior walls visible from public ways.
b) Variations and breaks in wall and/or roof planes.

Disabilities Act requirements.
8.5.9 Transfer of Development Rights
The Planning Board may, by Special Permit, consider requests to transfer development capacity between parcels
of land in the Town Center. The Planning Board shall base its decision on the purposes and objectives criteria of
Section 8.5.1. A major purpose of this provision is to provide a buffer between the adjoining established
neighborhoods and the Town Center where no such buffer currently exists. Transferred development rights may
be used for residential or nonresidential uses.
Development rights may not be transferred from land which may not be otherwise developed because of deed
restrictions, easements, prior transfer of development rights, or other reasons that render the land not developable,
including land with conservation restrictions, land owned by a government agency or a nonprofit corporation or
other entity for park, open space, agricultural, historical, or conservation purposes.
Transfer of development rights is contingent upon placing a permanent deed restriction and recording such
restriction at the South Middlesex Registry of Deeds, the form of which is subject to approval by Town Counsel,
on the land from which the development rights are being transferred and restricting the use of the land to
agriculture, forestry, open space, passive or active recreation, or deeding the land to the Town of Burlington as
permanent open space or parkland.
Development rights may be transferred from a sending parcel with the accompanying deed restriction and held
indefinitely by the owner of the parcel before being transferred to a receiving parcel. Development rights may be
transferred by sale or other means and may subsequently be transferred to any owner of receiving parcels in the
Town Center allowed pursuant to this bylaw.

The Planning Board shall not approve any application for approval of a site plan or special permit in the Town
Center District unless it finds that all the following conditions are met:

application, will further the goals enumerated in the 1993 Land Use Element of the Master Plan and 2004
Community Development Plan for the Town Center, and the objectives listed in this section;
2. The use or uses proposed to be developed will enhance and improve pedestrian access, vehicular
circulation, and the aesthetic appearance and function of the property and the area; and,

SECTION 10.4.0 ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS FOR RESTAURANTS IN AN (IG) DISTRICT
The Planning Board may grant a Special Permit for a restaurant use within a General Industrial (IG) District,
subject to the following restrictions:
10.4.1 Purpose
The purpose of allowing restaurants by Special Permit within an office/commercial park setting is to
enhance previously established commercial areas by permitting a mixture of uses which reduce the
number of vehicular trips generated during peak hour periods and promote pedestrian activities through
the interconnection of compatible uses and facilities.
10.4.2 Procedures
All requests for consideration by the Planning Board for a Special Permit pursuant to this section shall be
consistent with Section 9.2.0 “Special Permit” of this bylaw.

office/commercial park of 600,000 square feet or more.
b) Prior to the submission of any formal application to the Planning Board for consideration of a Special
Permit under this section, the Planning Board shall make a determination as to whether the property
qualifies as part of a previously established office/commercial park. An “office/commercial park” shall
be defined as a property which, when taken as a whole with other properties in the general area, possesses
a commonality of purpose, use, management, maintenance, and other indicia which provides to the
general public a perception of a unified operation and character. In an office/commercial park, the
individual parcels do not have to be under the same ownership. The delineation of a particular
office/commercial park may change over time based upon the Planning Board’s determination that other
properties have been incorporated into a commonality of operation and character. The determination of
Article X
Town of Burlington Zoning Bylaws Page 10-3
whether a property qualifies under this definition shall be at the discretion of the Planning Board.
c) Once an area has been designated by the Planning Board as an office/commercial park, any addition or
removal of a parcel, shall require authorization by the Planning Board prior to the submission of any
Special Permit application under this Section.
d) Any proposal for a restaurant submitted pursuant to this section of the bylaw shall be required to
incorporate pedestrian enhancements which interconnect adjacent commercial buildings/properties
through a network of sidewalks and/or bike paths. These amenities shall be considered by the Planning
Board when analyzing any applicable traffic analysis and/or transportation demand management
alternatives.
e) The total square footage of each restaurant pad and the total number of restaurants within an
office/commercial park shall not exceed the following criteria:
i) No individual restaurant pad shall exceed 12,000 square feet.
ii) An office/commercial park with a square footage of 600,000 square feet or more
shall be limited to no more than two (2) restaurant pads.

Headstart facilities; commercial establishments that host children's parties. This bylaw regulates
intentional congregation of children--such as at schools, play structures, athletic fields, and the like, rather
than incidental congregation of children, such as at ice cream parlors, pediatrics offices, and
shopping venues, and the like. The applicant shall demonstrate compliance with buffer requirements
under this regulation by provision of maps, and by an inventory of tenants and owners within the buffer,
or by any other means the Planning Board might require. The buffer requirement applies to facilities in
adjacent communities as well as facilities within Burlington.
10.6.4.2 Amending the buffer requirement
The Planning Board shall have discretion to amend the buffer requirement as follows:
Article X
Town of Burlington Zoning Bylaws Page 10-5
1) Where the Planning Board clearly distinguishes between uses within a single parcel, and finds that the
intent of the buffer requirement can be met, as set forth in 10.6.4.1 above, the Board, in the exercise of its
reasonable discretion, may waive the requirement that the 1,000 foot buffer be measured between the nearest
points of parcel boundaries and instead require that measuring between nearest points of facilities, for example,
measuring building to building, shall be the method of measurement where circumstances warrant the change.
10.6.4.3 Adjacency to residentially zoned land
A RMD shall not be located on a parcel that touches residentially zoned property (excluding Town-owned
property that is zoned RO and is not used for residential purposes).

glare, fumes, odors, or electrical interference detectable to the normal senses off the parcel.
10.6.7 Compliance and Suspension of License
The Special Permit for this use is subject to review for compliance on an annual basis by the Planning Board. Any
new owner and or operator shall require a new Special Permit. In the event that the state Department of Public
Health (DPH) (or any successor agency) suspends the license or registration of a RMD, the Planning Board may
require the licensee's appearance at a public meeting.
SECTION 10.7.0 TEMPORARY MORATORIUM ON MARIJUANA RETAIL SALE
Section 10.7.0Temporary Moratorium on Marijuana Retail Sale (which includes dispensing, processing, and
cultivation activities, and other related activities to the sale, storage and distribution of marijuana for non-medical
use and the operation of a marijuana establishment for non-medical use):
Section 10.7.1. PURPOSE
By vote at the State election on November 8, 2016, the voters of the Commonwealth approved a law that would
legalize recreational marijuana. The law requires a newly appointed Cannabis Control Commission, made up
of three (3) members appointed by the Massachusetts Treasurer that would be responsible for regulating and
supervising marijuana businesses. The law, as amended, provides that the commission must adopt initial
regulations by March 15, 2018. If the commission fails to develop regulations by July 1, 2018, the ballot
question, as amended, allows existing medical marijuana treatment centers to begin selling recreational
marijuana to adults without any additional regulations. The commission would develop procedures for issuing
and renewing licenses. It would develop requirements for the security of marijuana businesses, for preventing
marijuana sales to minors, for record keeping, health and safety standards, packaging and labeling
requirements, testing requirements, marketing restrictions and enforcement mechanisms. The commission
would have authority to limit the total amount of marijuana grown in Massachusetts. Cities and towns can
adopt ordinances and bylaws that impose "reasonable safeguards" on the operation of marijuana shops,
including limiting the number or type of marijuana establishments.
The regulation of recreational marijuana and associated sales raises novel and complex legal, planning, and public
safety issues and the Town needs time to study and consider the regulation of recreational marijuana sales and
address such novel and complex issues, as well as to address the potential impact of the State regulations on local
Article X
Town of Burlington Zoning Bylaws Page 10-6
zoning and to undertake a planning process to consider amending the Zoning Bylaw regarding regulation of
Marijuana Retail Sale (which includes dispensing, processing, and cultivation activities, and other related activities
to the sale, storage and distribution of marijuana for non-medical use and the operation of a marijuana
establishment for non-medical use). The Town intends to adopt a temporary moratorium on the use of land and
structures in the Town for Marijuana Retail Sale (which includes dispensing, processing, and cultivation activities,
and other related activities to the sale, storage and distribution of marijuana for non-medical use and the operation
of a marijuana establishment for non-medical use) so as to allow the Town sufficient time to engage in a planning
process to address the effects of such structures and uses in the Town and to enact bylaws in a manner consistent
with sound land use planning goals and objectives.
Section 10.7.2 DEFINITIONS
The definitions contained in the AN INITIATIVE PETITION FOR A LAW RELATIVE TO THE REGULATION
AND TAXATION OF MARIJUANA shall be the definitions used in the Moratorium. These definitions include

Department of Public Works, the Board of Selectmen, the Police Department, the Board of Health, the
Town Engineer, the Conservation Commission, and the Fire Department. Any such board or agency to
which petitions are referred for review shall submit such recommendations as it deems appropriate to
the Planning Board and the applicant. Failure to make recommendations within 35 days of receipt shall
be deemed lack of opposition.
(d) Public Hearing: After the opportunity for review by other boards has taken place, the Planning
Board shall hold a hearing under this section, in conformity with the provisions of G.L. Chapter 40A,
S9, and of the zoning bylaw and regulations of the Planning Board. The hearing shall be held within
65 days after filing of the application with the Board and the Clerk. Notice shall be given by publication
and posted and by first-class mailings to "parties in interest" as defined in G.L. Chapter 40A, #11. The
decision of the Board, and any extension, modification or renewal thereof, shall be filed with the Board
and Clerk within 90 days following the public hearing. Failure of the Board to act within 90 days shall
be deemed a grant of the permit applied for. The required time limits for a public hearing and Board
action may be extended by written agreement between the applicant and the Planning Board. Issuance
of the permit requires an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Planning Board.
(e) Relation to Subdivision Control Act: Planning Board approval of a special permit hereunder shall
not substitute for compliance with the subdivision control act, nor oblige the Planning Board to approve
any related definitive plan for subdivision, nor reduce any time periods for Board consideration under
that law. However, in order to facilitate processing, the Planning Board shall, insofar as practical under
existing law, adopt regulations establishing procedures for submission of a combined plan and
application which shall satisfy this section and the Board's regulations under the subdivision control act.
11.6.3 Findings of Board

following: that the Open Space Residential Development plan will be in harmony with the general purpose of
the bylaw and the requirements of G.L. Chapter 40A, and the long range plan of the town; that it will not have a
detrimental impact on the neighborhood, will be designed with due consideration for health and safety, and is
superior to a conventional plan in preserving open space, minimizing environmental disruption, allowing for
more efficient provision of services, or allowing for greater variety in prices or types of housing.
11.6.4 Minimum Dimensional Requirements
(a) The area of the parcel to be developed is not less than ten acres.
(b) The minimum parcel frontage shall be 50 feet.

in perpetuity and as such become the responsibility of the owners' heirs and assigns.
11.6.5 Required Open Land
(a) At least 40% of the parcel exclusive of land set aside for roads and parking, shall be open land.
(b) The open land and such other facilities as may be held in common shall be conveyed to one of the
following, as determined by the Planning Board, subject to the following guidelines. In general, natural
resource land such as wetlands not suitable for any public use, or suitable for extensive public
recreational use, should be conveyed to the Town or to a trust; whereas land which will be principally
used by the residents of the Open Space Residential Development should be conveyed to a home
association. At least 10% of the open land shall be useable for active or passive recreation.
1. To a corporation or trust comprising a home association whose membership includes the owners of
all lots or units contained in the parcel. The developer shall include in the deed to owners of
individual lots beneficial rights in said open land, and shall grant a conservation restriction to the
Town of Burlington over such land pursuant to M.G.L. Chapter 184, S131-33, to insure that such land
be kept in an open or natural state and not be built upon for residential use or developed for accessory
uses such as parking or roadways. This restriction shall be enforceable by the Town through its
Conservation Commission in any proceeding authorized by S33 of Chapter 184 of M.G.L.
In addition, the developer shall be responsible for the maintenance of the common land and any other
facilities to be held in common until such time as the homes association is capable of assuming said
responsibility. In order to ensure that the association will properly maintain the land deeded to it
under this section, the developer shall cause to be recorded at the Middlesex South County Registry of
Deeds a Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions which shall, at a minimum, provide for the
following:
- Mandatory membership in an established homes association, as a requirement of ownership of
any lot in the parcel.
- Provisions for maintenance assessments of all lots in order to ensure that the open land is
maintained in a condition suitable for the uses approved by the homes association. Failure to pay
such assessment shall create a lien on the property assessed, enforceable by either the homes
association or the owner of any lot. (Note: At no time shall the Town assume the responsibility
for maintenance.)
- Provision which, so far as possible under the existing law, will ensure that the restriction placed
on the use of the open land will not terminate by operation of law.
2. To a nonprofit organization, the principal purpose of which is the conservation of open space.
3. To the Conservation Commission of the Town for a park or open space use, subject to the approval
of Town Meeting, with a trust clause insuring that it be maintained as open space.
(c) Subject to the above, the open space may be used for recreational purposes including golf courses,
riding trails, tennis courts, gardens, swimming pools and temporary structures (i.e., tents, stages for special
events and other structures that are intended to be assembled and disassembled within a 14 day period).
The Board may permit open land owned by a homes association to be used for individual septic systems, or
for communal septic systems if it, and the Board of Health so recommends.
11.6.6 Further Requirements
(a) No use of the parcel other than residential or recreational shall be permitted.
Article XI
Town of Burlington Zoning Bylaws Page 11-7

Planning Board that the premises have been built in accordance with the plan approved by the Board
hereunder.
(d) The Planning Board may impose other conditions, safeguards, limitations on time and use, pursuant to
its regulations.
(e) The Planning Board may grant a special permit hereunder for Open Space Residential Development
even if the proposed development is not subject to the subdivision control law.
(f) Special Permits granted under this section shall lapse within two years (or less), excluding time
required to pursue or await the determination of an appeal, from the grant thereof, if a substantial use has
not sooner commenced or if construction has not begun, except that the Planning Board may grant an
extension for good cause and shall grant an extension if the delay was caused by the need to seek other
permits.
(g) Subsequent to granting of the permit, the Planning Board may permit relocation of lot lines within the
Open Space Residential Development. However, any change in overall density, street layout, or open
space layout will require further hearings.
11.6.7 Optional Units Incentive
(a) Notwithstanding the limitations set out above, the Planning Board, if it deems it otherwise advisable to
do so, shall as a provision of a special permit issued hereunder authorize increases in the permissible
intensity of use in the proposed Open Space Residential Development over the base units per acre
providing that the tract is tied to the public sewer system and that the number of units within the tract shall
not exceed a density of 4 dwelling units per acre. The additional units may be obtained at the discretion of
the Planning Board over the base density of units per acre by providing one or more of the following:
1. Traffic or pedestrian improvements (e.g., bike paths, bridle paths, screened parking): up to 0.3
units added.
2. Open space which is landscaped or has unusual value to the community or to the residents and
comprises an unusually large percent of the tract: up to 0.5 units added.
3. Units that permanently contribute to the Town's Affordable Housing Action Plan: up to 1.0 units
added.
(Note A: The maximum density per acre with bonus shall be no more than 180% of the base
density as determined by the Planning Board pursuant to Section 11.6.2, subsection (b)1.)
(Note B: The Planning Board may grant less than the maximum bonus provision for affordable
housing if there are only minimal number of units that are affordable and/or where severe
environmental constraints exist on the parcel.)
(b) Such bonus may include any or all of the following:
1. Decrease of minimum lot size.
2. Increase in number of lots.
(c) Off Premises Improvements: The Planning Board may approve a density bonus when the applicant
agrees to make public improvements or improvements in the public interest on property not under the
applicant's control.

SECTION 11.7.0 RESIDENTIAL 2 (R2) DISTRICT
11.7.1 Purposes
The Residential 2 (R2) District is intended:
To stimulate more affordable housing units through the creation of two family or duplex development on
individual lots, or on a larger single lot in which internal lot lines may have been drawn and established
and where open space and other site amenities may be held or used in common by all unit owners.
To permit a developer, public agency, or developer in conjunction with a public agency, to propose two
family or duplex development and units which shall be affordable to individuals of low and moderate
incomes, and to first time home buyers, as defined by the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency, the
Executive Office of Communities and Development, or the income and price guidelines for Middlesex
County, and as may be periodically amended.
To help the community to meet the requirements and objectives of Massachusetts General Laws,
Chapter 40B, S20-23.
To achieve a broader range of housing choice within the community.
To permit such development on parcels which can be divided into numerous lots, or which can contain
numerous units, so as to form a well-planned district rather than a single or substantial deviation from
surrounding land uses and neighborhood pattern.
To encourage such development on parcels zoned for industrial and commercial purposes, but which may
be appropriate for residential purposes.
11.7.2 Uses by Special Permit and Permitted Uses in an R2 District
The following use shall require a special permit as set forth in Section 13.1.7:
(a) Two Family Dwellings: The following uses shall be permitted by right without need of a special
permit once R2 zoning is obtained:
1. One family dwellings and one family dwellings purchased or erected and maintained by the
Burlington Housing Authority or any other nonprofit housing development agency developing
affordable housing as described in Section 4.2.1.6 of the Zoning Bylaw.
2. Places primarily used for religious purposes, including rectories and parish houses as described in
Section 4.2.2.1 of the Zoning Bylaw.
3. Public parks as described in Section 4.2.2.8 of the Zoning Bylaw.
11.7.3 Dimensional Requirements
Where lots within an R2 District are proposed for subdivision, all two family structures/dwellings must be
situated on individual lots which conform to the density and dimensional regulations of an RO- One Family
Dwelling District specified in Article V, Section 5.2.0 of these Bylaws.
All two family structures/dwellings which are proposed to be developed within a single consolidated parcel
must also be developed and laid out so that all two family structures within the site conform to the density and
dimensional regulations of an RO- One Family Dwelling District specified in Article V, Section 5.2.0 of these
Bylaws.

SECTION 11.8.0 INCLUSIONARY ZONING REQUIRMENTS FOR MULTIFAMILY HOUSING
11.8.1 Purpose and Intent
The purpose of this Bylaw is to outline and implement a coherent set of policies and objectives for the
development of affordable housing in compliance with the 2004 Burlington Community Development Plan, G.L.
c. 40B sec. 20-23 and ongoing initiatives of the Burlington Housing Partnership to promote a reasonable
percentage of housing that is affordable to low and moderate income buyers. It is intended that the affordable
housing units that result from this Bylaw be considered as Local Initiative Program (LIP) dwelling units in
compliance with the requirements for the same as specified by the Massachusetts Department of Housing and
Article XI
Town of Burlington Zoning Bylaws Page 11-15
Community Development (DHCD), or successor, or additional programs adopted by the Commonwealth or its
agencies, and that said units count toward the Town’s requirements under G. L. c . 40B sec. 20-23, as amended.
11.8.2 Definitions
For the following definitions refer to Article II: Definitions, “Affordable Housing Unit”, “(Qualified) Affordable
Housing Unit Purchaser” and “(DHCD) Affordable Housing Unit Sales Price or Rent”.
11.8.3 Applicability
Beginning with the adoption of this Bylaw by Town Meeting, applications for approval of all multifamily housing
developments creating 4 or more new or converted units, including housing within mixed use developments,
whether on one or more contiguous parcels, owned or controlled by the applicant or a related entity, now or in the
future, shall provide an affordable component within the project pursuant to the provisions in this Bylaw. The
Affordable Housing Units to be provided shall remain affordable in perpetuity. This provision shall apply whether
the proposal is for rental or ownership units. The Affordable Housing Units required above shall be affordable to
persons and households of low and moderate income as defined by G.L. c. 40B, Section 20. The applicant shall be
responsible for preparing a Massachusetts Local Initiative Program Units Only Application, as administered by the
DHCD or any successor program, or an application for any other program that provides for inclusion of such
Affordable Housing Units as part of the Town’s affordable housing inventory under G.L. c. 40B Section 20.
11.8.3.1 For multifamily housing developments, the applicant shall provide one and a-half (1.5)
Affordable Housing Unit within the development for every ten (10) housing units constructed. When the
calculation of the number of Affordable Housing Units to be provided yields a fraction, the applicant shall
round up to the next whole number of Affordable Housing Units (Figure 1). The applicant may choose to
provide an Affordable Housing Unit off-site, pursuant to the off-site provisions in Section 11.8.3.2.

And so on…
11.8.3.2 Provisions for off-site affordable units
Affordable Housing Units shall be provided within any multifamily housing project, unless the Planning
Board finds that unique or extraordinary circumstances exist and that the public purpose may be better
served by authorizing off-site Affordable Housing Units. The off-site Affordable Housing Units shall be
affordable to persons and households of low and moderate income as defined by G.L. c. 40B, Section 20.
The applicant shall be responsible for preparing a Massachusetts Local Initiative Program Units Only
Application, as administered by the Department of Housing and Community Development, or any
successor program, or an application for any other program that provides for inclusion of such affordable
units as part of the Town’s affordable housing inventory under G.L. c. 40B Section 20. The units shall be
equivalent or better in bedroom count to the on-site project and be phased with the project pursuant to

coincident to the development of market rate units, but in no event shall the development of the
Affordable Housing Units be delayed beyond the schedule noted in Section 11.8.5
11.8.3.3 Payments to the Affordable Housing Fund
If the Affordable Housing Trust Fund has not yet been established at the time of said payment, the
payment shall be placed in such fund(s) as the Town Treasurer shall determine appropriate for the
purpose of being held and used for affordable housing purposes. Such fund shall be established by the
Town Treasurer to receive all payments made under this Section, and shall be kept separate and apart
from other monies by the Town Treasurer. Any moneys in said fund shall be expended in accordance
with G.L. c. 44 Section 55C or other applicable statutes, to support the creation of low and moderate
income housing units which meet the definition of “low or moderate income housing” as defined by
MGL Chapter 40B, Section 20. All moneys which are collected as a result of any contribution to this fund
shall be transferred to the principal of said fund, and the Town Treasurer shall be the custodian of the
fund and shall deposit the proceeds in a bank or invest the same in such securities as are legal for the
investment of funds of savings banks under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, or in
federal savings and loan associates situated in the Commonwealth. Any interest earned thereon shall be
credited to and become a part of such fund.
