PREFACE
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent
ordinances of the City of Portland, Michigan.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1972 Code, as
supplemented, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The
source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses
at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new
and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the
comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate
any section of the 1972 Code, as supplemented, and any ordinance included
herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical
order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to
facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and
which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state
law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the
back of this Code.
Chapter and Section Numbering System
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same
system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number
consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to
the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the
section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered
1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is
identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted
in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come
between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be
numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same
way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end
of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be
assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using
one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabet-
ical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.
Page Numbering System
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters
to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion
of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of
the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix
to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter
of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which
may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding
prefixes:

Indexes
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular
item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay
phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally
used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross
references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the
user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and
supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication
will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly
edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the
manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the
holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the
responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the
attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all
such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing
them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical
reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Senior
Code Attorney, and Timothy MacMartin, Editor, of the Municipal Code
Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other
members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance
throughout the project.
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Tom Dempsey, City Manager, Mr. Bill
Davis, City Attorney, and Ms. Nikki Miller, City Clerk, for their cooperation
and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped

viii
Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all
citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of
the City's affairs.

evidence as ordered under the provisions of this
section shall constitute misconduct in office, and

vote of the members of the Council in office at the
time, exclusive of any member whose removal
may be being considered, shall be required for any
such removal.

REGARDING OFFICERS AND

Section 5.1. Eligibility for Office in City.
(a) No person shall hold any elective office of
the City, unless he was a resident of the City for at
least one year immediately prior to the date of the
election at which he is a candidate. He must also
have been a registered elector on the last day for
filing nominating petitions for such office or prior
to his appointment to fill a vacancy.
(b) No person shall be eligible for any elective
or appointive City office who is in default to the
City. The holding of office by any person who is in
such default shall create a vacancy unless such
default shall be eliminated within thirty (30) days
after written notice thereof has been served at his
last known place of residence according to the
records [of] the City by the City Clerk upon the
direction of the Council, or, unless the officer
contests his liability for the default in a court of
competent jurisdiction.
(c) No person who holds or has held the office
of Councilman shall be eligible to hold any ap-
pointive office for which there is compensation
paid by the City until one year has elapsed
following the expiration of the term of office for
which he was elected. This provision would not
apply to such appointments as the Board of Re-
view where nominal compensation may be paid by
the City.
(d) No appointive City officer or employee shall
seek an elective office of the City unless he
resigns his position with the City.
(e) The Council shall be the sole judge of the
election and qualifications of its own members.
Section 5.2. Financial Interests Prohibited.
No person holding any elective or appointive
office under the City government shall take any
official action on any contract with the City or
other matter in which he is financially interested,
or be a bondsman or surety on any contract or
bond given to the City. Any member of the Council
or other officer found guilty of violating the pro-
visions of this section may be punished by a fine of
not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) or be
imprisoned for not more than ninety (90) days or
both within the discretion of the court. The con-
viction of any Councilman or officer under this
section shall operate in itself to forfeit his office.

ment concerned, in such sums as the Council may
determine. All such officers or employees who
receive, distribute, or are responsible for City
funds or investments shall be bonded. The resig-
nation, removal, or discharge of any officer or
employee, or appointment of another person to
such office or employment, shall not exonerate
such officer or employee or any sureties of such
officer or employee from any liability incurred by
such officer, employee or sureties. All official
bonds shall be corporate surety bonds and the
premiums thereon shall be paid by the City.
Bonds required by this section shall not be re-

CHT:14
Clerk, except that the Clerk's bond (unless he is
covered within the scope of a blanket surety bond)
shall be filed with the Treasurer. The require-
ments of this section may be met by the purchase
of one or more blanket corporate surety bonds
covering all or any group or groups of the officers
and employments [employees] of the City. Any
officer or employee who is covered by a blanket
surety bond need not be bonded individually for
the purpose of qualifying for office.
Section 5.4. Delivery of Office.
Whenever any officer or employee shall cease
to hold such office or employment, for any reason
whatsoever, he shall within five days, and sooner
on demand, deliver to his successor in office or to
his superior all the books, papers, money and
effects in his custody as such officer or employee.
Any officer violating this provision may be pro-
ceeded against in the same manner as public
officers generally for a like offense under statute.
Any employee found guilty of violating this pro-

ings of the Council at the time of each
absence;
(d) If the officer shall be found guilty of any
act constituting misconduct in office un-
der the provisions of this Charter, either
by a court or by a vote of a majority of the
remaining members of the Council, at or
following a hearing.
Section 5.6. Filling Vacancies.
(a) If a vacancy occurs in any elective office it
shall be filled within thirty (30) days by a major-
ity of the remaining members of the Council. Such
appointee shall hold office until the next regular

days after such vacancy occurs, at which election
a successor shall be elected for the unexpired
term of the member in whose office the vacancy
occurs. Provided, however, that the term of no
member of the Council shall be lengthened by his
resignation and subsequent appointment.
(b) If a vacancy occurs in any appointive office,

property of such persons so assessed. Such lien
shall take precedence over all other claims, en-
cumbrances, and liens to the extent provided by
law and shall continue until such taxes, interest
and charges are paid.
Section 7.14. Taxes Due: Notification
Thereof.
City taxes shall be due and payable on the first
day of July of each year. The Treasurer shall not
be required to call upon the persons named in the
tax roll, nor to make personal demand for the
payment for taxes, but he shall publish notice of
the time when said taxes will be due for collection
and of the penalties and fees for the late payment
thereof, and mail a tax bill to each person named
in said roll. In cases of multiple ownership of
property only one bill need be mailed. Failure on
the part of the Treasurer to publish said notice or
mail such bills shall not invalidate the taxes on
said tax roll nor release the person or property
assessed from the penalties and fees provided in
this charter in case of late payment or nonpay-
ment of the same.
Section 7.15. Collection Charges on Late
Payment of Taxes.
All taxes paid on or before September 30th of
each year shall be collected without penalty by
the Treasurer. On the first day of October, he shall
add to all taxes paid thereafter a penalty of three
percent of the amount of said taxes and on the
first day of October and of each succeeding month
he shall add an additional one-half of one percent
as interest on all unpaid municipal taxes until
paid or returned to the County Treasurer. Such
collection fees, penalties and interest shall belong
to the City and constitute a charge and shall be a
lien against the property to which the taxes
themselves apply, collectible in the same manner
as the taxes to which they are added.
Section 7.16. Failure or Refusal to Pay Per-
sonal Property Tax.
If any person, firm or corporation shall neglect
or refuse to pay any tax assessed to him or them,
the Treasurer shall collect the same by seizing the
personal property of such person, firm or corpo-
ration, to an amount sufficient to pay such tax,
fees and charges for subsequent sale, wherever
the same may be found in the State, and from
which seizure no property shall be exempt. He
may sell the property seized to the amount suffi-
cient to pay the taxes and all charges in accor-
dance with statute. The Treasurer may, if other-
wise unable to collect a tax on personal property,
sue the person, firm or corporation to whom it is
assessed in accordance with statute.

collected by the Treasurer on the first day of
March following the date when said roll was
received by him, shall be returned to the County
Treasurer in the same manner and with like
effect as returns by township treasurers of town-
ship, school and county taxes. Such returns shall
be made upon a delinquent tax roll to be prepared
by the Treasurer and shall include all the addi-
tional charges and assessments hereinbefore pro-
vided, which charges shall, in such return, be
added to the amount assessed in said tax roll
against each description. The taxes thus returned
shall be collected in the same manner as other
taxes returned to the County Treasurer are col-
lected under provisions of the general laws of the
State and shall be and remain a lien upon the
property against which they are assessed, until
paid.

expenditure of money be incurred without an
appropriation covering all payments which will be

unencumbered appropriation balance, or any por-
tion thereof, from one account, department, fund
or agency to another.
(b) The Council may make additional appro-
priations during the fiscal year for unanticipated

other logical account to which expenditure can be
charged, expenditures shall not be charged di-
rectly to the contingency fund (or other similar

during the fiscal year, and more often if required

degree as may be necessary to keep expenditures
within the revenues.

or ordinance, with respect to violations of this
Code that are continuous with respect to time,
each day that the violation continues is a separate
offense. As to other violations, each violation
constitutes a separate offense.

vent suspension or revocation of a license, permit
or franchise, or other administrative sanctions.
(h) Violations of this Code that are continuous
with respect to time are a public nuisance and
may be abated by injunctive or other equitable
relief. The imposition of a penalty does not pre-
vent injunctive relief or civil or quasi-judicial
enforcement.

Sec. 3-7. Definitions G to N.
(1) Net profits means the net gain from the
operation of a business, profession or enterprise,
after provision for all costs and expenses incurred
in the conduct thereof, determined on either a
cash or accrual method, on the same basis as
provided for in the Federal Internal Revenue
Code for Federal Income Tax purposes, excluding
items exempted under this chapter, but without
deduction of federal and city taxes based on

over to the same extent and on the same basis as

3-7(2) of the chapter shall mean the City of
Portland income tax imposed by this chapter.
Depreciation shall be computed in the same
manner as under the Federal Internal Revenue
Code and taken to the same extent as taken on

able year. Depreciable assets acquired before the

Provided, however, that a taxpayer may take

extent still being depreciated on its official books,
on which it elected to take special amortization
in lieu of depreciation under the authority of
Acts of Congress for Federal Income Tax purposes.
(2) Nonresidentmeans an individual domiciled

(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-8. Definitions N to P.
(1) Person means a natural person, partner-
ship, fiduciary, association, corporation or other
entity. When used in any provision imposing a
criminal penalty, person as applied to an associa-
tion means the parties or members thereof, and

(2) Predominant place of employment means
that city imposing a tax under a uniform city
income tax ordinance other than the city of
residence, in which the employee estimates he
will earn the greatest percentage of compensa-
tion from the employer, which percentage is 25
percent or more.
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-9. Definitions R to T.
(1) Resident means an individual domiciled in
the city. Domicile means a place where a person
has his true, fixed and permanent home and
principal establishment, to which, whenever
absent therefrom, he intends to return, and
domicile continues until another permanent
establishment is established. If an individual,
during the taxable year, being a resident becomes
a non-resident or vice versa, taxable income
shall be determined separately for income in
each status.
(2) Taxable year means the calendar year, or
the fiscal year, used as the basis on which net
profits and other income subject to tax under
this chapter are to be computed, and in case of a
return for a fractional part of a year, the period
for which the return is required to be made.
(3) Taxpayer means a person required under
this chapter to file a return or to pay a tax.
Actual residence is not necessarily domicile,
for domicile is the fixed place of abode which, in
the intention of the individual, is permanent
rather than transitory. It is the place in which an
individual has voluntarily fixed his habitation,
not for a mere special or limited purpose, but
with the present intention ofmaking a permanent
home, until some unexpected event shall occur to
cause him to adopt some other permanent home.
Every individual has one and only one domicile.
Once established it continues until a new one is
established, coupled with the abandonment of
the old. Prima facie, a married woman has the
same domicile as her husband. Ordinarily, the
domicile of a minor follows that of the father.
The administrator may require of individuals
claiming domicile outside the City of Portland, a
statement of information with respect to the
particular case. Mailing address, place of voting,
statements in license and other applications,
establishment of business and social contacts,
marital status, and other overt acts are evidence
of domicile, but no one such item is controlling.
If an individual is a resident during part of a
taxable year and a non-resident during the
remainder he shall not file two returns. If he is
required to file under this chapter he shall file a
resident return only, Form P-1040, reporting
thereon the period of time for each status. Income
which is taxable to residents but not to non-
residents (e.g. interest and dividends) shall be
reported, and be subject to tax, only for the
portion of the year during which he was a
resident.
UNIFORM CITY INCOME TAX § 3-9
Supp. No. 3 CD3:5
Each person shall use the same taxable year
for city income tax purposes as such person uses
for federal income tax purposes.
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)

tions and deductions herein provided, an annual

individuals and


(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-12. Excise tax on incomes; applica-
tion to resident individuals.
The tax shall apply on the following types of
income of a resident individual to the same
extent and on the same basis that the income is
subject to taxation under the Federal Internal
Revenue Code:
(a) On a salary, bonus, wage, commission
and other compensation.
(b) On a distributive share of the net profits
of a resident owner of an unincorporated
business, profession, enterprise, undertak-
ing or other activity, as a result of work
done, services rendered and other busi-
ness activities wherever conducted.
(c) On dividends, interest, capital gains less
capital losses, income from estates and
trusts and net profits from rentals of real
and tangible personal property.
(d) On other income of a resident individual.
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-13. Types of nonresident income to
which tax applicable; extent and
basis of tax.
(1) The tax shall apply on the following types
of income of a non-resident individual to the
same extent and on the same basis that the
income is subject to taxation under the Federal
Internal Revenue Code:
(a) On a salary, bonus, wage, commission
and other compensation for services
rendered as an employee for work done
or services performed in the city. Vaca-
tion pay, holiday pay, sick pay and a
bonus paid by the employer are deemed
to have the same tax situs as the work
assignment or work location and are
taxable on the same ratio as the normal
earnings of the employee for work actu-
ally done or services actually performed.
(b) On a distributive share of the net profits
of a non-resident owner of an
unincorporated business, profession,
enterprise, undertaking or other activity,
as a result of work done, services rendered
and other business activities conducted
in the city.
(c) On capital gains less capital losses from
sales of, and on the net profits from
rentals of, real and tangible personal
property, if such arise from property
located in the city.
(2) The amount of taxable compensation of
nonresidents working in and out of the city is to
be computed by dividing the total number of
days worked in the city by the total number of
days worked during the year, or the total number
hours worked in the city by the total number of
hours worked during the year, and applying the
resulting percentage to gross annual compensa-
tion including vacation, holiday, sickness and
bonus pay: except that the amount of taxable
compensation of a nonresident compensated on
the volume of business secured or other results
achieved by him, such as a salesman on a
commission basis, shall be the amount received
by him for business secured or other results
achieved by him attributable to his efforts in the
city.
(3) The mere fact that a nonresident employee
is subject to call at any time does not permit the
allocation of compensation on a seven day per
week basis. The mere fact that a nonresident
employee is compensated on a seven day per
week basis, when he does not in fact perform
work or render services seven days per week,
does not permit the allocation of compensation
on a seven day per week basis. The mere fact
UNIFORM CITY INCOME TAX § 3-13
Supp. No. 3 CD3:7
that a nonresident employee takes work home
with him and performs such work at his home
does not permit the allocation of compensation.
(4) A nonresident employee who is paid com-
missions and renewal commissions for selling
insurance, not a general insurance agent who
conducts his own independent insurance busi-
ness, shall allocate such compensation on the
following basis: for life, health and accident
insurance the locus shall be the location of the
purchaser of the insurance; for group insurance
the locus shall be the location of the group; for
fire and casualty insurance the locus shall be the
location of the risk insured, except that on
vehicles it shall be the location of the purchaser.
(5) Compensation paid to officers or employees
of the State of Michigan is subject to the tax.
Such compensation shall be taxable even though
the services are performed on the property owned
or controlled by the State within the corporate
limits of the City of Portland.
(6) Compensation paid to officers or employees
of the United States Government, not for service
in the armed forces, is subject to the tax. Such
compensation shall be taxable even though the
services are performed on property owned or
controlled by the United States Government
within the corporate limits of the City of Portland.
(7) The mere fact that part or all of the work
of a nonresident employee working within the
city limits may be attributable to branches,
governmental units, projects, undertakings, or
other activities outside of the corporate limits of
the City of Portland does not give rise to an
exclusion of the related compensation from tax-
able income.
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-14. Excise tax on incomes; taxable
net profits of a corporation,
definition.

profits of a corporation doing business in the city,
being levied on such part of the taxable net
profits as is earned by the corporation as a result
of work done, services rendered and other busi-
ness activities conducted in the city, as determined
in accordance with this chapter. Taxable net
profits of a corporation means federal taxable
income as defined in section 63 of the Federal
Internal Revenue Code but taking into

provided in this chapter. No deductions shall be
allowed for:
(a) Net operating losses and net capital losses
sustained prior to the effective date of

(b) The city income tax imposed by this
chapter.
A corporation may deduct income, war profits

cable to income included in taxable net income,
any part of which would be allowable as a
deduction in determining Federal Taxable Income
under the applicable provisions of the Federal
Internal Revenue Code.
(2) Corporations are not permitted to file as
so-called tax option corporations. Every corpora-
tion subject to the city tax must file a return and
pay the tax, regardless of any option available to
it under sections 1371-1377 of the Federal Internal
Revenue Code. The taxable income or net operat-
ing loss of a corporation shall not be prorated to
the shareholders and reported on their individual
returns.
(3) In determining taxable net profits of a
corporation no deduction shall be allowed for:
a. Net operating losses and net capital losses
sustained prior to the effective date of
the city income tax, which date was
January 1, 1984.
b. The city income tax imposed by this
chapter.
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-15. Excise tax on incomes;
unincorporated business, profes-
sion; sole proprietorship, partner-
ship.

other activity conducted by one or more persons

persons carrying on the unincorporated busi-
ness, profession or other activity are liable for
income tax only in their separate and individual
capacities and on the following basis:
(a) A resident proprietor or partner is tax-
able upon his entire distributive share of
the net profits of the activity regardless
of where the activity is conducted.
(b) A nonresident proprietor or partner is
taxable only upon his distributive share
of the portion of the net profits of the
activity which is attributable to the city
under the allocation methods provided in
this chapter.
(c) In the hands of a proprietor or partner of
an unincorporated activity, the character
of any item of income taxable under this
chapter is determined as if such item
were realized by the individual proprietor
or partner directly from the source from
which it is realized by the unincorporated
activity. In computing his taxable income
for a taxable year, a person who is required
to file a return shall include therein his
taxable distributive share of the net profits
for any partnership year ending within
or with his taxable year.
(2) A nonresident owner or an unincorporated
business or profession must include in income
subject to tax his distributive share of interest,
dividends, and other income from intangibles if
such income is directly related to the nature of
the business (as, for example, where one of the
functions of the business is to lend money at
interest).
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-16. Unincorporated business, profes-
sion, or activity; return.
An unincorporated business, profession or other
activity owned by two or more persons shall file
an annual information return setting forth:
(a) The entire net profit for the period covered
by the return and the taxable portion of
the net profit attributable to the city.
(b) The names and addresses of the owners
of the unincorporated activity and each
owner's taxable distributive share of the
total net profit and each nonresident
owner's share of the taxable net profit
attributable to the city.
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-17. Unincorporated business, profes-
sion, or activity; election to pay
tax.
(1) At the election of an unincorporated busi-
ness, profession or other activity, the entity, on
behalf of the owners, may compute and pay the
tax due with respect to each owner's share of the
net profit of the activity after giving effect to
exemptions to which each owner is entitled. This
election is available to all unincorporated busi-
ness entities having two or more owners regard-
less of the residence of the owners. The tax thus
paid by the entity shall constitute all tax due
with respect to each owner's distributive share of
the net profits of the unincorporated business,
profession or other activity.
If the unincorporated business, profession or
other activity elects under this section to file a
return and pay the tax on behalf of its owners,
the election and filing are deemed to meet the
requirements of this chapter for the filing of a
return for each owner who has no other income
subject to the tax. However, a return is required
from any such owner having taxable income
other than his distributive share of the net
profits of the entity. In such case the entire
income subject to the tax shall be included in the
return and credit taken thereon for the tax paid
in his behalf by the unincorporated activity.
(2) If the unincorporated business, profession
or other activity elects to pay the tax on behalf of
its owners then such unincorporated business,
profession or other activity assumes the status of
a taxpayer under sections 3-62, 3-63, and 3-64 of
the chapter and is required to file a declaration
of estimated tax and pay the estimated tax
shown thereon.

UNIFORM CITY INCOME TAX § 3-17
Supp. No. 3 CD3:9
Sec. 3-18. Partial business activity in city;
apportionment of net profit.
(1) When the entire net profit of a business
subject to the tax is not derived from business
activities exclusively within the city, the portion
of the entire net profit, earned as a result of work
done, services rendered or other business activ-
ity conducted in the city, shall be determined at
the election of the taxpayer under either section
3-19, sections 3-20 to 3-24, or section 3-25.
(2) The fact that a person fills orders by
shipment to an out-of-city destination, when
such person has no regularly maintained and
established out-of-city location and engages in
no out-of-city business activity, does not entitle
such person to apportion part of his net profit as
being earned as a result of work done, services
rendered or other business activity conducted
out of the city.
(3) Themere solicitation of orders by telephone
or catalogs or other mailed matter, from a loca-
tion within the city for shipment to an out-of-city
destination, does not itself constitute out-of-city
activity. The solicitation of orders for or on
behalf of a person by an independent contractor
does not constitute business activity by the
person.
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-19. Partial business activity in city;
separate accounting method.
(1) The taxpayer may petition for and the
administrator may grant approval of, or the
administrator may require the separate account-
ing method. If such method is petitioned for, the
administrator may require a statement explain-
ing the manner in which apportionment will be
made, in sufficient detail to determine whether
the net profits attributable to the city will be
apportioned with reasonable accuracy.
(2) Approval to use the separate accounting
method must be requested of the administrator,
in writing, within the first 90 days following the
beginning of the taxable year or period for which
its use is requested.
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-20. Partial business activity in city;
business allocation percentage
method.
The business allocation percentage method
shall be used if such taxpayer is not granted
approval to use the separate accounting method
of allocation. The entire net profits of such
taxpayer earned as a result of work done, services
rendered or other business activity conducted in
the city shall be ascertained by determining the
total in-city percentages of property, payroll and
sales. In-city percentages of property, payrolls
and sales, separately computed, shall be
determined in accordance with sections 3-21 to
3-24.
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-21. Partial business activity in city;
percentage of average net book
value; gross rental value of real
property.
First, the taxpayer shall ascertain the percent-
age which the average net book value, of the
tangible personal property owned and the real
property, including leasehold improvements,
owned or used by it in the business situated
within the city during the taxable period, is of
the average net book value if all such property,
including leasehold improvements, owned or used
by the taxpayer in the business during the same
period wherever situated. Real property shall
include real property rented or leased by the
taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
deemed to be eight times the annual gross rental
thereon. Gross rental of real property means the
actual sum of money or other consideration
payable, directly or indirectly, by the taxpayer
for the use or possession of real property and
includes but is not limited to:
(a) An amount payable for the use or posses-
sion of real property or any part thereof,
whether designated as a fixed sum of
money or as a percentage of sales, profits
or otherwise.
(b) An amount payable as additional rent or
in lieu of rent such as interest, taxes,
§ 3-18 PORTLAND CODE
Supp. No. 3 CD3:10
insurance, repairs or other amount
required to be paid by the terms of a
lease or other arrangement.
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-22. Partial business activity in city;
percentage of compensation paid
employees.
Second, the taxpayer shall ascertain the
percentage which the total compensation paid to
employees for work done or services performed
within the city is of the total compensation paid
to all the taxpayer's employees within and without
the city during the period covered by the return.
For allocation purposes, compensation shall be
computed on the cash or accrual basis in
accordance with the method used in computing
the entire net income of the taxpayer.
If an employer performs services within and
without the city, the following examples are not
all inclusive butmay serve as a guide for determin-
ing the amount to be treated as compensation for
services performed within the city.
(a) In the case of an employee compensated
on a time basis, the proportion of the
total amount received by him which is
his working time within the city is of his
total working time.
(b) In the case of an employee compensated
directly on the volume of business secured
by him, such as a salesman on a commis-
sion basis, the amount received by him
for business attributable to his efforts in
the city.
(c) In the case of an employee compensated
on other results achieved, the proportion
of the total compensation received which
the value of his services within the city
bears to the value of all his services.
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-23. Partial business activity in city;
percentage of gross revenue.
Third, the taxpayer shall ascertain the percent-
age which the gross revenue of the taxpayer
derived from sales made and services rendered
in the city is of the total gross revenue from sales
and services wherever made or rendered during
the period covered by the return.
(1) For the purposes of this section, sales
made in the city means all sales where
the goods, merchandise or property is
received in the city by the purchaser, or a
person or firm designated by him. In the
case of delivery of goods in the city to a
common or private carrier or by other
means of transportation, the place at
which the delivery has been completed is
considered as the place at which the
goods are received by the purchaser.
The following examples are not all inclusive
but may serve as a guide for determining sales
made in the city:
(a) Sales to a customer in the city with
shipments to a destination within
the city from a location in the city or
an out-of-city location are considered
sales made in the city.
(b) Sales to a customer in the city with
shipments to a destination within
the city directly from the taxpayer's
in-city supplier or out-of-city sup-
plier are considered sales made in
the city.
(c) Sales to a customer in the city with
shipments directly to the customer
at his regularly maintained and
established out-of-city location are
considered out-of-city sales.
(d) Sales to an out-of-city customer with
shipments or deliveries to the
customer's location within the city
are considered sales made in the
city.
(e) Sales to an out-of-city customer with
shipments to an out-of-city destina-
tion are considered out-of-city sales.
(2) In the case of public utilities, or busi-
nesses furnishing transportation, services,
gross revenue for the purposes of this
section may be measured by such means
as operating revenues, vehicle miles,
revenue miles, passenger miles, ton miles,
UNIFORM CITY INCOME TAX § 3-23
Supp. No. 3 CD3:11
tonnage or such other method as shall
reasonably measure the proportion of
gross revenue obtained in the city by
such business.
(3) In the case the business of the taxpayer
involves substantial business activities
other than sales of goods and services
such other method or methods of alloca-
tion shall be employed as shall reason-
ably measure the proportion of gross
revenue obtained in the city by such
business.
In determining sales made in the city the fact
that title may pass to the purchaser on delivery
to a common or private carrier or other means of
transportation is immaterial. The place at which
the goods are ultimately received after all
transportation has been completed, shall be
considered as the place at which goods are
received by the purchaser.
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-24. Partial business activity in city;
business allocation percentage.
Fourth, the taxpayer shall add the percent-
ages determined in accordance with sections
3-21, 3-22 and 3-23 and divide the total by three
and the result so obtained is the business alloca-
tion percentage. In determining this percentage,
a factor shall be excluded from the computation
only when the factor does not exist anywhere
insofar as the taxpayer's business operation is
concerned and, in such case, the total of the
percentages shall be divided by the number of
factors actually used. The business allocation
percentage shall be applied to the entire net
profits, wherever derived, of the taxpayer subject
to the tax to determine the net profits allocable
to the city.
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-25. Partial business activity in city;
substitute methods.
An alternative method of accounting shall be
used if the taxpayer or the administrator
demonstrates that the net profits of the taxpayer
allocable to the city cannot be justly and equitably
determined under the separate accountingmethod
or the business allocation percentage method, or
if undue expense to the taxpayer would result
from complying therewith because of the
taxpayer's manner of operations and methods of
accounting. In such case the administrator, upon
application of the taxpayer or upon his own
initiative, may approve or specify factors or
methods of determination as will effect a just,
non-discriminatory and reasonable result.
Application to the administrator to substitute
other factors in the formula or to use a different
method to allocate net profits shall be made in
writing and state the specific grounds on which
the substitution of factors or use of a different
method is requested and the relief sought. No
specific form need be followed in making the
application. Once a taxpayer has filed under a
substitute method, he shall continue so to file
until given permission by the administrator to
change.
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-26. Capital gains and losses;
determination.
(1) Capital gains and capital losses, other
than gains and losses on securities issued by the
government of the United States, shall be included
in income only to the extent of that portion of the
gains or losses which occur after the effective
date of this chapter. In determining the amount
of gain or loss, the taxpayer may use net proceeds
from the sale or exchange less fair market value
as of the effective date of this chapter. The fair
market value of property shall be determined by
an appraisal or similar reliable evidence. The
fair market value of a security shall be the last
quoted price on the last business day prior to the
effective date. For a security trader over the
counter the last quoted price shall be the last bid
price on the last business day prior to the
effective date. The taxpayer may determine the
gain or loss on a transaction in the same manner
as for federal income tax purposes taking into
account only that portion thereof which occurs
after the effective date. The portion of that gain
or loss includible in computing taxable income
will be the same proportion of the total gain or
loss as the period of time the property was held
after the effective date of the chapter bears to
§ 3-23 PORTLAND CODE
Supp. No. 3 CD3:12
the total time the property was held. In any city
adopting this chapter which had a valid local
income tax chapter in effect on January 1, 1964,
capital gains and losses shall be included to the
extent of that portion of such gains or losses
which occur after the effective date of the original
city income tax ordinance.
(2) If capital losses exceed capital gains in a
taxable year, the unused portion may be utilized
to the same extent and on the same basis as
under the federal revenue code.

includible in the return of a resident individual
as income from estates and trusts. A resident

an inter vivos or testamentary trust created by
an individual for the benefit of 1 or more persons.

the distributable net income of the estate
decreased by the amount of depreciation or
depletion allowed the resident individual as a
deduction under section 642 of the Federal
Internal Revenue Code. The exceptions
hereinafter set forth with respect to trusts are
also applicable to income from estates. Income
from trusts means the amount of income as
defined in section 643 (b) of the Federal Internal
Revenue Code, distributed or required to be
distributed under sections 652 9a) or 662 (a) (1)

(b) Interest from obligations of the United
States, the states or subordinate units of

trusts where the income is taxed to the grantor
or some other person under subpart E of sub-
chapter J of the Federal Internal Revenue Code,
the grantor or other person shall include in his
return all items of income and deductions allowed
by this chapter.
(3) An individual shall include income from
estates and trusts in his return in the same year
as provided in the Federal Internal Revenue
Code with respect to distributions of income
from estates and trusts. The amount of income
included in the return for the first tax year of a
resident individual, with respect to estates and
trusts, shall be computed as thought the tax year
of the estate or trust for federal income tax
purposes began on the effective date of this
chapter and ended with the end of the tax year of
the estate or trust for federal income tax purposes
which ends next following the effective date.

taxable income is allowed a deduction of $1,000.00
for each personal and dependency exemption

Ordinary, necessary, reasonable and unreim-
bursed expenses paid or incurred by an individual

(3) The fact that a taxpayer has paid his
entire tax liability on a declaration of estimated

filing an annual return. (See section 3-64. (1) of
this chapter.)
The fact that an individual not subject to
withholding has an entire tax liability of $1.00 or
less does not relieve him from the requirement of

information return, Form W-2 or PW-2, required
to be furnished him by his employer in section
3-61.(2) of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-43. Payment of tax; refund; interest;
allocation of payment;notice;non-
obligated spouse; form; filing;
release of liability; definitions.
(1) Any balance of the tax which is due the
city at the time of filing the annual return shall
be paid therewith unless the balance is less than
$1.00, in which event payment is not required.
(2) If the annual return reflects an over-
payment of the tax, the declaration thereof on
the return constitutes a claim for refund and the
overpayment shall be applied against any
subsequent liability thereunder or, at the elec-
tion of the taxpayer and when so indicated on the
return, the overpayment shall be refunded but
refunds for amounts of less than $1.00 shall not
be paid.
(3) If a valid claim for a refund of taxes,
except a refund under section 3-61, due for the
taxable year 1992 or a taxable year after 1992 is
filed, interest at the rate established in section
30(3) of Act No. 122 of the Public Acts of 1941,
being section 205.30 of the Michigan Compiled
Laws shall be added to the refund beginning 45

payment between the tax liabilities against which
the payment should be applied, the amount paid
shall first be applied against the taxpayer's tax
liability under this act and any remaining amount

ent tax liability of an employee due to an increase
in the number of exemptions claimed during the
year, or due to the actual percentage of work

Sec. 3-64. Annual return; filing; extension
of time; failure to file; penalty.
(1) The filing of a declaration of estimated tax

has entered into an agreement pursuant to
section 9 of chapter 1, filed with the department

UNIFORM CITY INCOME TAX § 3-64
Supp. No. 3 CD3:21

administrator may extend the time for filing the
annual return for not to exceed six months. The
administrator or the department may require a
tentative return and payment of the estimated
tax.
(2) A penalty or interest shall not be assessed
if the return is filed and the final tax paid within

70 percent or more of the tax shown due on the
taxpayer's return for the preceding taxable year.

Internal Revenue Code grants an automatic
extension to person outside the United States
the administrator shall grant a like automatic
extension to the same date.
(4) Nothing in this chapter or rules and regula-
tions shall be construed to give the administra-
tor authority to extend the time for making
quarterly returns and payments of tax withheld,
or for filing and making payments on declaration
of estimated tax.

Sec. 3-64a. Sale of business or stock of goods
or quitting business; liability for
tax; escrowby purchaser; release
to purchaser of known tax
liability; failure to comply with
escrow requirements; liability
of corporation officers.
(1) If a person liable for the tax imposed
under this chapter sells a business or the stock of
goods of a business or quits a business, the
person shall make a final return to the city or the
department within 15 days after the date the
business or stock of goods is sold or the person
quits the business. The purchaser or succeeding
purchasers, if any, who purchase a going or
closed business or stock of goods of a going or
closed business shall escrow sufficient money to
cover the amount of taxes, interest, and penal-
ties that may be due and unpaid until the former
owner produces a receipt from the administrator
that shows that the taxes due have been paid, or
a certificate that states that taxes are not due. If
the owner provides a written waiver of
confidentiality, the administrator may release to
a purchaser a business's known tax liability for
the purposes of establishing an escrow account
for the payment of taxes. If the purchaser of
succeeding purchasers of a business or stock of
goods of a business fail to comply with the escrow
requirements of this subsection, the purchaser is
personally liable for the payment of the taxes,
interest, and penalties accrued and unpaid by
the business of the former owner. The purchaser's
or succeeding purchaser's personal liability is
limited to the fair market value of the business
less the amount of any proceeds applied to
balances due on secured interests that are superior
to any lien provided for in this chapter.
(2) If a corporation that is liable for the tax
imposed under this chapter fails for any reason
to file the required returns or to pay the tax due,
any officers of the corporation that have control
or supervision of, or who are charged with the
responsibility for, making the returns or pay-
ments are personally liable for the failure to file
or pay. The signature of any corporate officer on
a return or negotiable instrument submitted in
payment of a tax is prima facie evidence of the
officer's responsibility for making the returns
and payments. The dissolution of a corporation
does not discharge an officer's liability for a prior
failure of the corporation to make a return or
remit a tax due. The sum due for a liability may
be assessed and collected under this chapter.

For tax years after the 1996 tax year in paying
the tax due under this chapter if any amount
other than a whole dollar amount is used the
administrator, or department shall disregard the
fractional part of the dollar unless the fractional
part amounts to

dollar or more, in which case
the amount shall be increased to $1.00.

designated city depository. For years after the
1996 tax year and for which a city has entered
into an agreement pursuant to section 9 of
chapter 1, the department shall collect taxes and

due, the administrator or the department may
obtain information on which to base an assess-
ment of the tax. The administrator personally, or
his duly authorized agent or a duly authorized
city employee, may examine the books, papers
and records of any person, employer, taxpayer or

Secs. 3-75—3-81. Reserved.
Sec. 3-82. Payment of tax; interest; adjusted
prime rate defined; penalty for
delay; waiver of penalty for
reasonable cause.
(1) All taxes imposed upon taxpayers and
moneys withheld by employers under this chapter
and remaining unpaid after they are due bear
interest from such due date at the rate of

of
one percent per month until paid.
For the 1994 taxable year and each subsequent
taxable year before 1997, all taxes imposed on a
taxpayer and money withheld by an employer
under this chapter and remaining unpaid after
taxes or money withheld are due bear interest
from the due date at the current monthly rate of
one percentage point above the adjusted prime
rate per annum per month until the tax or the
money is paid. For taxable years after the 1996
taxable year, if the amount of a tax paid is less
than the amount that should have been paid or
an excessive claim for credit has been made, the
deficiency and interest on the deficiency at the
current monthly interest rate of one percentage
point above the adjusted prime rate per annum
from the time the tax was due, and until paid,
are due and payable after a final assessment as
provided in section 3-85. A deficiency in an
estimated payment required by this chapter
shall be treated in the same manner as a tax due
and is subject to the same current monthly
interest rate of one percentage point above the
adjusted prime rate per annum from the time
the payment was due, until paid. The term
adjusted prime rate means the average
predominant rate quoted by not less than three
commercial banks to large businesses, as
determined by the department of treasury. For
tax years before the 1997 tax year, the adjusted
prime rate is to be based on the average prim
rate charged by not less than three commercial
banks during the 12 month period ending on
September 30. One percentage point shall be
added to the adjusted prime rate, and the result-
ing sum shall be divided by 12 to establish the
current monthly interest rate based on the 12
month period ending September 30 will become
effective on January 1 of the following year. For
tax years after the 1996 tax year, adjusted prime
ratemeans that termas defined in and determined
under section 23(2) of Act. No. 122 of the Public
Acts of 1941, being section 205.23 of theMichigan
Compiled Laws.
(2) A person failing to file a return, or to pay
the tax, or to remit withholding when due, is
liable, in addition to the interest, to a penalty of
one percent of the amount of the unpaid tax for
each month or fraction thereof, not to exceed a
total penalty of 25 percent of the unpaid tax. The
administrator may abate the penalty or a part
thereof for just cause. If the total interest or
interest and penalty to be assessed is less than
$2.00, the administrator, in lieu thereof, shall
assess a penalty in the amount of $2.00.
(3) Except as provided in subsection (4), if
any part of the deficiency or an excessive claim
for credit is due to negligence, but without intent
to defraud, a penalty for $10.00 or ten percent of
the total amount of the deficiency in the tax,
whichever is greater, plus interest as provided in
subsection (1), shall be added. The penalty
becomes due and payable after a final assess-
ment is issued as provided in section 3-85. If a
taxpayer subject to a penalty under this subsec-
tion demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
administrator or the department that the
deficiency or excess claim for credit was due to
reasonable cause, the administrator or the depart-
ment shall waive the penalty.
(4) If any part of the deficiency or an exces-
sive claimfor credit is due to intentional disregard
of this chapter, but without intent to defraud, a
penalty of $25.00 or 25 percent of the total
amount of the deficiency in the tax, whichever is
greater, plus interest as provided in subsection
(1), shall be added. The penalty becomes due and
payable after a final assessment is issued as
provided in section 3-85. If a penalty is imposed
under this subsection and the taxpayer subject
to the penalty successfully disputers the penalty,
UNIFORM CITY INCOME TAX § 3-82
Supp. No. 3 CD3:25
the administrator or the department shall not
impose a penalty prescribed by subsection (3) to
the tax otherwise due.
(5) If any part of the deficiency or an exces-
sive claim for credit is due to fraudulent intent to
evade the tax imposed under this chapter, or to
obtain a refund for a fraudulent claim, a penalty
of 100 percent of the deficiency, plus interest as
provided in subsection (1), shall be added. The
penalty becomes due and payable after a final
assessment is issued as provided in section 3-85.
(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-83. Additional tax assessment; when
interest and penalty not imposed.
(1) Interest or a penalty shall not be imposed
on an additional tax assessment if, within 90
days from final determination of a federal tax
liability which also affects the computation of
the taxpayer's city income tax liability, the
taxpayer prepares and files an amended city
income tax return showing income subject to the
city tax based upon the final determination of
federal income tax liability, and pays the additional
tax shown due thereon or makes claim for refund
of an overpayment. Interest shall not be allowed
on a refund of the city income tax resulting from
a final determination of federal tax liability.

at least 70 percent or more of the tax shown due
on the final return or 70 percent or more of the
tax shown on the taxpayer's return for the
preceding taxable year.
(3) An employee shall not be penalized because
of the failure of his employer to report or pay tax
withheld from the employee when the employer
has in fact withheld the proper amount of tax.

Sec. 3-84. Due and unpaid assessment;
determination; procedure.

tax years after the 1996 tax year and for which a
city has not entered into an agreement pursuant

tor determines that a taxpayer or an employer
subject to the provisions of this chapter has
failed to pay the full amount of the tax due or tax
withheld, he shall issue a proposed assessment
showing the amount due and unpaid, together
with interest and penalties thatmay have accrued
thereon. The proposed assessment shall be served
upon the taxpayer or employer in person, or by
mailing by registered or certified mail to the last
known address of the taxpayer or employer.
Proof of mailing the proposed assessment is
prima facie evidence of a receipt thereof by the
addressee.
(2) A taxpayer or employer has 30 days after
receipt of a proposed assessment within which to
file a written protest with the administrator or
30 days after receipt of a notice of intent to
assess from the department of treasury to file a
written protest with the department of treasury,

his duly authorized representative an opportunity
to be heard an present evidence and arguments
in his behalf.

3-84, the administrator or the department shall
issue a final assessment setting forth the total
amount found due in the proposed assessment or
notice of intent to assess and any adjustment he
or she may have made as a result of the protest.
The final assessment shall be served in the same
manner as a proposed assessment or notice of
intent to assess. Proof of mailing of the final
assessment is prima facie evidence of a receipt
thereof by the addressee.
(2) If a protest under section 3-73(3) or 3-84(2)
is not filed in respect to a proposed assessment
or notice of intent to assess, a taxpayer or
employer is deemed to have received a final
assessment 30 days after receipt of the proposed.

showing the amount of tax or withholding due
§ 3-82 PORTLAND CODE
Supp. No. 3 CD3:26
the city, but fails to pay the amount to the city
treasurer, the administrator is not required to
issue a proposed assessment, notice of intent to
assess, or a final assessment. The administrator
shall issue a 10-day demand for payment and if
no payment or satisfactory evidence of payment
is made in the ten days he may thereafter

(Ord. No. 150A, eff. 10-12-2017)
Sec. 3-87. Jeopardy assessment; procedure.
(1) If the administrator or the department
believes that collection of the tax withheld from
an employee's compensation as imposed under

finds that a person liable for the tax administered
under this chapter intends quickly to depart
from the city or to remove property from this city,

the city, or to do any other act tending to render
wholly or partly ineffectual proceedings to collect
the tax unless proceedings are brought without

ment. When the warrant or warrant-notice is
issued, the tax shall become immediately due
and payable. If the person is not in default in
making a return or paying a tax prescribed by
this chapter, and furnishes evidence satisfactory
to the administrator or the department that the
return will be filled and the tax to which the
finding relates will be paid, then the tax shall
not be payable before the time otherwise fixed
for payment.

fact, separated from the applicant's property by a
public or private street.
Backyard means that portion of a lot enclosed
by the property's rear lot line and the side lot

Duck means either a male drake or a female
duck of the Muscovy breed; all other breeds are

Private restrictions include but are not limited
to deed restrictions, condominium master deed
restrictions, neighborhood association by-laws, and
covenant deeds.
Resident means any person living in the City of
Portland.
(b) Residents may keep hens in the City of
Portland, subject to all of the following require-
ments:
(1) A permit must be obtained under subsec-

lows:
(i) If the principal use of resident's prop-
erty is for a single-family dwelling,
all adjacent landowners must verify
in writing that there is no objection
to the issuance of the permit.
(ii) If the principal use of the resident's
property is for a two-family dwell-
ing, all adjacent landowners and the
occupants of the other dwelling must
verify in writing that there is no
objection to the issuance of the per-
mit.
(9) All enclosures for the keeping of fowl
must be constructed or repaired so as to
prevent rats, mice, or other rodents from
being harbored underneath, within, or
within the walls of the enclosure.
(10) All feed and other items associated with
the keeping of fowl that are likely to
attract rats, mice, or other rodents must
be protected so as to prevent rats, mice, or
other rodents from coming into contact
with them.
(11) A person who has been issued a permit
must submit it for examination on de-
mand by any police officer or code enforce-
ment officer.

listed under subsection (b), the city may revoke

infraction violation.
(f) Private restrictions on the use of property
remain enforceable and take precedence over a
permit to keep fowl. A permit issued to a person
whose property is subject to private restrictions
that prohibit the keeping of fowl is void. Interpre-
tation and enforcement of private restrictions is
the sole responsibility of the private parties in-
volved.
(g) The city clerk will mail a copy of a permit
issued under this section to the owners of adja-
cent property.

grounds adjoining the building or structure by

assessor of the notice of the amount of the cost,
the city shall have a lien for the cost incurred by
the city to bring the property into conformance
with this article. The lien shall not take effect
until notice of the lien has been filed or recorded
as provided by law. A lien provided for in this

ing or structure or grounds adjoining the build-
ing or structure. The city shall have a lien on the
property for the amount of a judgment obtained

recorded liens and encumbrances.
(e) A judgment in an action brought pursuant
to the subsection above may be enforced against
assets of the owner other than the building or
structure. The city shall have a lien for the
amount of a judgment obtained pursuant to such

or structure against whom the judgment is
obtained. A lien provided for in this section does
not take effect until notice of the lien is filed or

Sec. 24-62. License fee.
The fees currently established or as hereafter
adopted by resolution of the city council from time
to time shall be paid to the clerk of the city at the
time of application and no license shall be issued
until such fees are paid.
(1) Duplicate copies of licenses. The issuance
of a license and payment of the license fee
by a firm, partnership, association, corpo-
ration, company or other organization shall
not waive the requirement that each in-
dividual person engaged in soliciting, can-
vassing or peddling shall also be licensed.
(2) Application for adjustment. None of the
license fees provided for by this article
shall be so applied as to occasion an
undue burden upon interstate commerce.
In any case where a license fee is believed
by a licensee or applicant for license to
place an undue burden upon such com-
merce, he may apply to the city manager
for an adjustment of the fee so that it
shall not be discriminatory, unreasonable,
or unfair as to such commerce. Such ap-
plicationmay bemade before, at, or within
six months after payment of the pre-
scribed license fee. The applicant shall, by
affidavit, and supporting testimony, show
his method of business and the gross
volume or estimated volume of business
and such other information as the city
manager may deem necessary in order to
determine the extent, if any, of such un-
due burden on such commerce. The city
manager shall then conduct an investiga-
tion, comparing applicant's business with
other businesses of like nature and shall
make findings of a fact from which he
shall determine whether the fee fixed by
this article is unfair, unreasonable or dis-
criminatory as to applicant's business and
shall fix as the license fee for the appli-
cant, an amount that is fair, reasonable
and nondiscriminatory, or, if the fee has
already been paid, shall order a refund of
the amount over and above the fee so
fixed. In fixing the fee to be charged, the
city manager shall have the power to base
the fee upon a percentage of gross sales,
or any other method which will assure
that the fee assessed shall be uniform
with that assessed on businesses of like
nature, so long as the amount assessed
does not exceed the fees as prescribed by
this section. Should the city manager de-
termine the gross sales measure of the fee
to be the fair basis, then he may require
the applicant to submit, either at the time
of termination of applicant's business in
the city or at the end of each three month
period, a sworn statement of the gross
§ 24-61 PORTLAND CODE

sales and pay the amount of fee therefor;
provided, that no additional fee during
any one calendar year shall be required
after the licensee shall have paid an
amount equal to the annual license as
prescribed in this section.

Sec. 24-65. Orders.
All orders taken by licensees shall be in writing

both the solicitor, canvasser or peddler and his
employer, and, if applicable, the terms of the
order, a description of the goods and/or products
involved, the sale price, the down payment, the
balance and the terms of payment of same. One
copy of the order shall be delivered to the pur-
chaser. Such order shall contain a statement that
buyer has a right to cancel the agreement by
mailing a notice to seller stating that the buyer
does not want the goods or services and that such
notice must be mailed before midnight on the

order, requirement, decision, or determination
made by an administrative official charged with
the enforcement of this chapter.
(c) Variance. The planning commission may
authorize a variance from the terms of this chap-
ter where the variance will not be contrary to the
public interest and where, owing to special condi-
tions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
this chapter would violate the intent of the chap-
ter. A variance may be granted for height, area,
and size of structure, sign setback, or other di-
mensional limitation, to the maximum allowed in
other areas of the city as specified in this chapter.
(1) The planning commission may only grant
a variance from the provisions of this
chapter when it finds, based on the evi-
dence presented, that all of the following
standards have been met:
a. Compliance with the strict enforce-
ment of the provisions of this chap-
ter would unreasonably prevent the
applicant from using the property
for a permitted purpose;
b. Conditions and circumstances exist
that are unique to the property;
c. Granting the variance applied for
would do substantial justice to the
applicant as well as to other prop-
erty owners in the vicinity or that a
lesser variance than that applied for
would give substantial relief to the
applicant and be more consistent
with justice to other property own-
ers; and
d. The problem is not created by the
applicant.
(2) Further, in granting a variance, the plan-
ning commission must find that the spirit
of this chapter is observed, public safety is
secured, and substantial justice is done.
(d) Conditions of approval. In authorizing a
variance, the planning commission may attach
conditions reasonably necessary to further the
intent and spirit of this chapter and to protect the
public interest.
(e) Time limitations on variances. Any vari-
ance granted automatically terminates 12months
after the date granted unless all of the following
requirements are met:
(1) Before the variance expires, the owner
must apply for a 12-month extension of
the variance;
(2) The owner must show good cause why the
variance was not implemented; and
(3) The owner or the owner's agent must
have taken substantial steps in implement-
ing the variance.
(f) Procedure.
(1) An appeal or application for a variance or
from any ruling of the officer administer-
SIGNS § 28-14
CD28:13
ing this chapter must be made to the city
manager or the city manager's agent. The
applicant shall pay a fee as established,
from time to time, by resolution of the city
council. The application must contain all
information required by the city manager
or agent. The city manager or agent must
transmit the application and all other
pertinent information to the planning com-
mission.
(2) The planning commission must fix a rea-
sonable time and place for the appeal
hearing and must give 15 days notice of
the hearing to all persons owning real
property within 300 feet of the premises
in question. The notice may be delivered
personally or by mail addressed to the
respective owners and tenants at the ad-
dress given in the last assessment roll.
(3) The planning commission must conduct a
public hearing on the appeal, during which
any affected party may appear in person
or by agent and must be given an oppor-
tunity to be heard. The applicant or the
applicant's agentmust appear at this hear-
ing to present or answer questions regard-
ing the appeal.
(g) Decisions of the planning commission.
(1) The planning commission may reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify
the order, requirement, decision, or deter-
mination appealed and must make what-
ever order, requirement, decision, or de-
termination it deems appropriate. To that
end, the planning commission has all the
powers of the officer from whom the ap-
peal is taken and may issue or direct the
issuance of a permit.
(2) A majority vote of the members of the
planning commission is necessary to re-
verse any order, requirement, decision, or
determination of the citymanager or agent
or to take any action under this chapter.
(3) The planning commission must make a
decision within 45 days after the comple-
tion of the public hearing. Failure to do so
will cause the appeal to be approved un-
less the failure is beyond the commission's
ability to control. The applicantmay waive
this time requirement in writing. A copy
of the commission's decision must be fur-
nished to the applicant and the city man-
ager or agent.
(4) An appeal stays all proceedings in further-
ance of the action appealed from, unless
the city manager or agent from whom the
appeal is taken certifies to the planning
commission after the notice of appeal is
filed that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would cause imminent
peril to life or property. In these circum-
stances, proceedings may not be stayed
other than by a restraining order granted
by the planning commission or by the
circuit court on application, on notice to
the city manager or agent from whom the
appeal is taken, and on due cause shown.

taking lawful action as necessary to restrain or
prevent a violation of this chapter.
(d) In addition to any other available remedy,
the city may bring an action in its own name to

ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the
provision that establishes the higher standard for
the promotion and protection of public health and
safety shall prevail.

spect to the making of such improvement and the

part of the cost of the improvement which the city
council has proposed to so assess and review the
assessment roll.

erty is acquired by condemnation, or otherwise,
for the purpose of any public improvement, all or

part of the cost of such improvement.
(b) Any assessment may be made upon the
basis of the estimated cost of the improvement if
the actual cost has not been definitely deter-

(a) Preparation. The city assessor shall upon
the order of the city council as provided in section
32-6(b) prepare the special assessment roll in
which shall be entered and described all the lands
and premises to be assessed, with the names of
the respective owners thereof, if known, and the
amount to be assessed against each parcel of land
or premises. Such amount shall be such relative
portion of the whole sum to be levied against all
the lands and premises in the special assessment
district as the benefit to such parcel of land or
premises bears to the total benefits to all the
lands and premises in the special assessment
district. There shall also be entered upon such roll
the amount, which has been assumed by the city
at large, if any.
(b) Filing; certification. When the city assessor
shall have completed the assessment roll, he shall
file the same in the office of the city clerk, after
first having affixed thereto a certificate stating
that it was made pursuant to a resolution of the
city council adopted on a specified date and that
in making such assessment roll he has, according
to his best judgment, conformed in all respects to
such resolution, this chapter and the charter of
the city.

Sec. 32-10. Approval by resolution; special
assessment roll; contents.
After the hearing provided for in section 32-7, if
the city council desires to proceed with the mak-
ing of the improvement and the special assess-
ment therefor, it shall adopt a resolution approv-
ing the map or drawing, plans, specifications and
cost estimate as originally presented or as re-
vised, corrected, amended, or changed, determin-
ing to make the improvement, designating the
lands and premises constituting such special as-
sessment district, specifying the number of install-
ments in which the assessments shall be payable,
and shall confirm the special assessment roll, or
may correct it as to any matter appearing therein
and confirm it as so corrected, or may refer it back
to the city assessor for revision, or may annul it
and direct a new roll to be made. No special
assessment roll shall be confirmed except with
the affirmative vote of at least three members of
the city council. If at or prior to final confirmation
of any special assessment roll, more than 50
percent of the number of owners of privately
owned real property to be assessed thereon, or in
the case of paving or similar improvement, more
than 50 percent of the number of owners of
frontage to be assessed thereon, shall object in
writing to the proposed improvement, the special
assessment roll shall not be confirmed without a
four-fifths vote of the members of the city council.
When a special assessment roll shall be con-
firmed, the city clerk shall endorse thereon the
date of confirmation. After such confirmation the
special assessment roll and all assessments therein
shall be final and conclusive. In cases of a volun-
tary special assessment where 100 percent of the
property owners involved in the special assess-
ment district or where property owners petition-
ing for a special improvement offer to make
available 100 percent of all of the property owners
share of the costs related thereto, the hearing,
publication and notification as required in section
32-3 shall not be required.

CD32:5
Sec. 32-11. Special assessments; payment.
(a) Installments.
(1) Special assessments may be made pay-
able in one or more installments, as de-
termined by the city council, but such
installments may not exceed five in the
case of sidewalk improvements, 15 in the
case of paving or similar street improve-
ments, and 20 in the case of water, storm
sewer, sanitary sewer or other improve-
ments. The first installment shall be due
at such time after confirmation as the city
council shall provide and the several sub-
sequent installments shall be due at in-
tervals of 12 months from the due date of
the first installment.
(2) The amount of each installment (if more
than one) need not be extended upon the
special assessment roll until after confir-
mation. All installments not paid by a
date to be fixed by the city council shall
bear interest thereafter at a rate to be
established by resolution by the city coun-
cil, but in no case may the city council use
a rate less than the rate established by
the selling of special assessment bonds
where said bond money will be used to
finance construction of the improvement,
or a rate less than one-half of one percent
for each month or fraction thereof that the
same remain unpaid prior to their trans-
fer to the city tax roll. Such accrued
interest on all unpaid installments shall
be due and payable annually on the due
dates of the respective installments. Any
one or more installments may be paid at
any time before due together with accrued
interest on such installments.
(b) Failure to pay. If any installment is not
paid when due, then the same shall be deemed to
be delinquent, and there shall be collected thereon,
in addition to interest as above provided, a pen-
alty of two percent of such installment. In case
any assessment or any installment thereof shall
remain unpaid on the first Monday of May follow-
ing the date when the same became delinquent,
the same shall be reported unpaid by the city
treasurer to the city council, and such delinquent
assessments, together with all accrued interest,
shall be transferred and reassessed on the next
annual city tax roll in a column headed "Special
Assessments" with a penalty of four percent upon
such total amount added thereto, and when so
transferred and reassessed upon such tax roll,
shall be collected in all respects as provided for
the collection of city taxes.

Sec. 32-12. Lien of city upon property as-
sessed.
(a) Special assessments and all interest, charges
and penalties thereon, from the date of confirma-
tion of the roll and until paid, shall be and remain
a lien upon the property assessed of the same
character and effect as the lien created by general
law for the state and county taxes and by the city
charter for city taxes.
(b) No judgment or decree, nor any act of the
city council vacating a special assessment shall
destroy or impair the lien of the city upon the
property assessed, for such amount of the assess-
ment as may be equitably charged against the
same, or as by a regular mode of proceeding might
be lawfully assessed thereon.
(Code 1972, § 12.212; Ord. No. 91, § 12, eff.
3-15-1972)
Sec. 32-13. Special assessment; collection of.
(a) Assessment roll. When any special assess-
ment shall be confirmed, the city council shall
direct the assessment so made in the special
assessment roll to be collected. The assessor shall
thereupon deliver to the city treasurer such spe-
cial assessment roll to which the mayor shall
attach his warrant commanding the city trea-
surer to collect from each of the persons assessed
in such roll the amount of money assessed to and
set opposite his name therein. Upon receiving
such special assessment roll and warrant, the city
treasurer shall proceed to collect the several
amounts assessed therein with a one percent
collection fee.
(b) Delinquent; court action. In addition to any
other remedies and without impairing the lien
therefor, any delinquent special assessment to-
§ 32-11 PORTLAND CODE
CD32:6
gether with interest and penalties may be col-
lected in an action at law in the name of the city
against the person assessed, in any court having
jurisdiction. If in any such action it shall appear
that by reason of any irregularities or informali-
ties the assessment has not been properly made
against the defendant or upon the premises sought
to be charged, the court may, nevertheless, on
satisfactory proof that expense has been incurred
by the city, which is a proper charge against the
defendant or the premises in question, render
judgment for the amount properly chargeable
against such defendant or upon such premises.
(Code 1972, § 12.213; Ord. No. 91, § 13, eff.

Sec. 32-14. Division; lot or parcel; proce-
dure.
Should any lot or parcel of land be divided after
a special assessment thereon has been confirmed
and before the collection thereof, the city council
may require the city assessor to apportion the
uncollected amounts upon the several parts of
such lot or parcel of land. The report of such
apportionment when confirmed shall be conclu-
sive upon all parties; provided, that before such
confirmation, notice of hearing shall be given to
all the interested parties by personal service or by
publication and mailing as provided in case of an
original assessment roll.
(Code 1972, § 12.214; Ord. No. 91, § 14, eff.
3-15-1972)
Sec. 32-15. Additional pro rata assessments.
Additional pro rata assessments may be made
when any special assessment roll proves insuffi-
cient to pay for the improvement for which it was
levied and the expenses incidental thereto, or
insufficient to pay the principal and interest on
bonds issued in anticipation of such assessment
roll; provided, that the additional pro rata assess-
ment shall not exceed ten percent of the assess-
ment as originally confirmed, unless a meeting of
the city council be held to review such additional
assessment, for which meeting notices shall be
published and mailed as provided in the case of
review of the original special assessment roll.
(Code 1972, § 12.215; Ord. No. 91, § 15, eff.
3-15-1972)
Sec. 32-16. Newassessment; original invalid;
power of council.
Whenever any special assessment roll shall, in
the opinion of the city council, be invalid by
reason of irregularity or informality in the pro-
ceedings, or if any court of competent jurisdiction
shall adjudge such assessment to be illegal, the
city council shall, whether the improvement shall
have been made or not, or whether any part of the
assessment shall have been paid or not, have
power to cause a new assessment to be made for
the same purpose for which the former assess-
ment was made. All proceedings on such reassess-
ment and for the collection thereof shall be con-
ducted in the same manner as provided for in
original assessment except as to corrections in the
proceedings required to make the assessment
legal. Whenever any sum or part thereof, levied
upon any property in the assessment so set aside,
has been paid and not refunded, the payment so
made shall be applied upon the reassessment. If
the payments exceed the amount of the reassess-
ment, refunds shall be made.

State law reference—Invalidation of assessment, reas-
sessment, MCL 211.744.
Sec. 32-17. Special assessment fund.
Moneys raised by special assessments for any
public improvement shall be credited to a special
assessment fund and shall be used to pay for the
costs of the improvement for which the assess-
ment was levied and for expenses incidental
thereto, to repay any principal and interest on
money borrowed therefor, and to refund excessive
assessments. The excess by which any special
assessment proves larger than the actual cost of
the improvement and expense incidental thereto
shall be placed in the special assessment fund of
the city if such excess is five percent or less of the
assessment, but should the assessment prove
larger than necessary by more than five percent
of the entire excess shall be refunded on a pro rata
basis to the owners of the property assessed. Such
refund shall be made by credit against future
unpaid installments to the extent such install-
ments then exist and the balance of such refund
shall be in cash. No refunds may be made which

idence of indebtedness secured in whole or in part

the city upon or in respect to any single premises,
which expense is chargeable against such pre-
mises and the owner thereof under the provisions
of the Charter or any ordinance of the city or law
of the state, and is not of that class required to be
prorated among the several lots and parcels of
land in a special assessment district, an account
of the labor, material and service for which such
expense was incurred, with a description of the
premises upon or in respect to which the expense
was incurred, and the name of the owner, if
known, shall be reported to the city treasurer,
who shall immediately charge and bill the owner,
if known. In the event that the city treasurer
finds that such amount is not otherwise collect-
ible, he shall report the same to the city council,
which may direct the city assessor to prepare a
special assessment roll covering all such charges
reported to it, together with a penalty of ten
percent. Such roll shall be filed with the city clerk,
who shall present the same to the city council.
Thereafter the same proceedings shall be followed
in respect to such special assessment roll as are
provided in section 32-9 and subsequent sections
of this chapter and all the provisions of such
sections with reference to special assessments
generally shall apply to special assessments un-
der this section, insofar as the same may be
applicable.

ment; exception.
No lands in a special assessment district which
are benefited by the improvement therein, shall
be exempt from assessment, but if the same are
owned by a public or other corporation exempt by
law from the payment of special assessments,
then the special assessments against such lands,
of the installments thereof, may be paid by the
city as the same become due or may be paid in
advance of their due dates or may be paid by the
exempt unit by special agreement.

ernmental improvements.
When the city may, by law, participate in
intergovernmental improvements, the cost ofwhich
may be defrayed in whole or in part by special
assessments, the procedure therefor shall be as
provided by the law permitting the same. If such
procedure is not so provided, the procedure estab-
lished by this chapter shall govern.

provisions of this article. No provision of this
article may be deemed or construed to require the

council it is in the public interest to restrict the
number of grantees to one or more, and competi-

the existing franchise.

any franchise granted hereunder uses in his cable

to the grantee by a telephone company pursuant
to tariff or contract on file with a regulatory body
having jurisdiction and said grantee makes no
use of the streets independent of such telephone
company-furnished facilities, said grantee shall
be required to comply with all of the provisions
hereof as a "licensee" and in such event whenever
the term "grantee" is used herein it shall be
deemed to mean and include "licensee."

Prior to commencement of construction of the
distribution system, the grantee shall submit a
construction schedule and map to the city show-
ing in detail the franchise area to be wired during

ule as adopted or modified by the council.
(d) Failure on the part of the grantee to com-
mence and diligently pursue each of the foregoing

referred to in subsections (a)—(c) of this section
will result in damage to the city and that it is and
will be impracticable to determine the actual
amount of such damage in the event of delay; and
the grantee therefore agrees that, in addition to
any other damage suffered by city, he will pay to
city the sum as currently established or as here-
after adopted by resolution of the city council
from time to time per day for each and every day's
delay beyond the time prescribed, for completion
of any of the acts required to be done by this
section.
(e) The grantee shall utilize existing poles,
conduits, and other facilities whenever possible,
and shall not construct or install any new, differ-
ent, or additional poles, conduits, or other facili-
ties without first securing the written approval of
the director; provided, that the privilege of the
grantee to construct, install, or replace any poles,
conduits, or other facilities in, on, or over any
TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 36-26
CD36:9

the city in the exercise of its police power or
pursuant to the terms hereof, upon reasonable
notice to the grantee, to require any such conduits
or other facilities of the grantee to be constructed,
installed, placed, or replaced beneath the surface
of the streets; and any construction, installation,
placement, replacement or changes which may be
so required shall be made at the expense of the
grantee.
(f) The city shall have the right, free of charge,
to make additional use, for any public or munici-
pal purpose, whether governmental or propri-
etary, of any poles, conduits, or other facilities
erected, controlled, or maintained exclusively by
or for the grantee in any street or other public
way or public place; provided, such use by city
does not interfere with the use by the grantee.
(g) The grantee shall at the expense of the
grantee, protect, support, temporarily disconnect,
or temporarily relocate any property of the grantee
when, in the opinion of the director, the same is
required by reason of freeway or street construc-
tion, change or establishment of street grade,
installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power
lines, signal line, or movement of buildings.
(h) In the event the use of any part of the
system of the grantee is discontinued for any
reason for a continuous period of 30 days, without
prior written notice to and approval by the man-
ager, or in the event any part of such system has
been installed in any street or other area without
complying with the requirements hereof, or in the
event any franchise shall be terminated, can-
celled, or shall expire, the grantee shall, at the
option of the city, and at the expense of the
grantee and at no expense to the city, promptly
remove from any street or other area all property
of the grantee, and the grantee shall promptly
restore the street or other area from which such
property has been removed to such condition as
the director shall approve; provided the city coun-
cil may, upon written application therefor by the
grantee, approve the abandonment of any of such
property in place by the grantee and under such
terms and conditions as the city council may
prescribe; and upon abandonment of any such
property in place, the grantee shall cause to be
executed, acknowledged, and delivered to the city
such instruments as the city attorney shall pre-
scribe and approve, conveying the ownership of
such property to the city.
(i) Upon the failure, refusal or neglect of the
grantee to cause any work or other act required
by law or by this article to be completed in, on,
over, or under any street within any time pre-
scribed therefor, or upon notice given, where
notice is prescribed, the manager may cause such
work or other act to be completed in whole or in
part, and upon so doing shall submit to the
grantee an itemized statement of the costs thereof,
and the grantee shall, within 30 days after receipt
of such statement, pay unto the city the entire
amount thereof.
(j) Unless otherwise provided in any given
instance, where any time is prescribed herein for
the doing or causing to be done of any act, city
council for good cause, stated in writing, may
extend any time for two additional periods of not
to exceed 90 days each. Further, the running of
any time period specified herein shall be automat-
ically tolled whenever and so long as the certifi-
cate of compliance issued by the FCC to the
grantee is the subject of a petition for stay, peti-
tion for review, or appeal filed with any United
States Court.

with interest thereon at not less than six percent

Sec. 36-28. Franchise limitations.
In addition to any other franchise limitations
hereunder or as herein provided, the following
limitations shall apply to any franchise granted
or renewed by the council under this article.
(1) Nature of franchise. Such franchise shall
be nonexclusive, and neither the granting
TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 36-28
CD36:11
thereof nor any of the provisions con-
tained herein or in such franchise shall
limit, abridge, diminish, alter, or affect
the right, privilege, power, or authority of
the city council; and the council hereby
reserves and preserves the right to grant
any identical or similar or different fran-
chise to any person, firm, or corporation
other than the grantee, either within or
without or partly within or partly without
the franchise area of any grantee, subject
only to the restriction provided in section
36-20. No privilege or exemption shall be
granted or conferred by any franchise
granted hereunder except those specifi-
cally prescribed in this article.
(2) Subordination of franchise privileges. The
grant of any privilege by any franchise
hereunder shall be subordinate to any
prior lawful occupancy of any street or
public property or to the grant of any
privilege under any other franchise of
prior date, insofar as there shall be any
conflict.
(3) Transfer of franchise.
a. Any franchise granted hereunder
shall be a privilege to be held in
personal trust by the original grantee.
It cannot in any event be sold, trans-
ferred, leased, assigned or disposed
of, in whole or in part, either by
forced or involuntary sale, or by vol-
untary sale, merger, consolidation or
otherwise, without prior consent of
the city council and then only under
such conditions as may therein be
prescribed. Any such transfer or as-
signment shall be made only by an
instrument in writing, such as a bill
of sale, or similar document, a duly
executed copy of which shall be filed
in the office of the city clerk within
30 days after any such transfer or
assignment. The said consent of the
council may not be unreasonably re-
fused; provided, however, the pro-
posed assignee must show financial
responsibility as determined by the
council and must agree to comply
with all provisions of the franchise
and of this article; provided, further,
that no such consent shall be re-
quired for a transfer in trust, mort-
gage, or other hypothecation, inwhole
or in part, to secure an indebtedness,
except that when such hypotheca-
tion shall exceed 50 percent of the
market value of the property used by
the franchisee in the conduct of the
cable television system, prior con-
sent of the council shall be required
for such a transfer. Such consent
shall not be withheld unreasonably.
b. In the event that the grantee is a
corporation, prior approval of the
city council, expressed by resolution,
shall be required where there is an
actual change in control or where
ownership of more than 50 percent
of the voting stock of the grantee is
acquired by a person or group of
persons acting in concert, none of
whom already own fifty percent or
more of the voting stock, singly or
collectively.
(4) Term of franchise. No franchise granted or
renewed by the council under this article
shall be for a term shorter than five years,
unless terminated prior to its expiration
as herein provided, nor shall any such
franchise be granted or renewed for a
term longer than 15 years. Any franchise
renewal shall be subject to the prior ap-
proval of the council utilizing the same
procedures as prescribed herein for the
granting of a new franchise. Any fran-
chise granted hereunder shall be revoca-
ble at the will of council.
(5) Recourse against city. The grantee shall
have no recourse or remedy whatsoever
against the city for any loss, cost, expense,
or damage arising out of or with respect to
any franchise hereunder, or this article,
or the enforcement thereof.
(6) City rules and regulations. The grantee
shall be subject to all ordinances, rules,
regulations, and specifications of the city
§ 36-28 PORTLAND CODE
CD36:12
heretofore or hereafter established, includ-
ing but not limited to those pertaining to
works and activities in, on, over, under
and about streets.
(7) Prohibited activities of the grantee. The
grantee shall be prohibited from directly
or indirectly doing any of the following:
a. Engaging in the business of selling
at retail, leasing, renting, repairing
or servicing of television sets or ra-
dios;
b. Soliciting, referring, or causing or
permitting the solicitation or refer-
ral of any subscriber to persons en-
gaged in any business herein prohib-
ited to be engaged in by the grantee;
c. Providing information concerning the
viewing patterns of identifiable indi-
vidual subscribers to any person,
group or organization for any pur-
pose, without the consent of the sub-
scriber;
d. Entering or encroaching upon or in-
terfering with or obstructing any pri-
vate property without the express
consent of the owner; and
e. Providing any repair service to its
subscribers for a fee, which repair
extends beyond the connection of its
service or the determination by the
grantee of the quality of its signal to
the recipients thereof.

11-2-1980)
Sec. 36-29. Regulation of rates and service.
At the time of the granting of any franchise
hereunder, the city council shall approve and
include therein all rates and charges allowable to
the grantee, including but not limited to all such
rates and charges for installation of equipment,
service charges for all classifications of service
including additional connections at one location,
and any other rates or charges of the grantee to
subscribers; and no such rates or charges shall be
changed at any time after the granting of a
franchise, except by authority of the city council,
and upon written request of the grantee; pro-
vided, that prior to authorizing the change of any
rates or charges of the grantee to subscribers, at
any time after the granting of such franchise, the
council shall first pass its resolution of intention
to do so, describing and stating any rates or
charges to be changed, the reasons of the council
therefor, fixing a day, hour, and place certain
when and where any persons having any interest
therein may appear before the council and be
heard and directing the city clerk to publish
notice of such hearing at least once. The city clerk
shall cause such notice to be published in a
newspaper of general circulation within the city,
and the same shall be published and a copy
thereof shall be mailed to any grantee hereunder
at least ten days prior to the date specified for
hearing thereon. At the time set for such hearing,
or at any adjournment thereof, the council shall
proceed to hear and pass on all presentations
made before it, and the decision of the council
thereon shall be final and conclusive. If the coun-
cil shall find that a change of rates or charges is
justified by a change in the costs of operation, the
council may approve the change in rates.
(Code 1972, § 12.340; Ord. No. 133, § 9.01, eff.
11-2-1980)
Sec. 36-30. Enlargement of franchise area.
(a) If new territory shall be annexed to the city
which shall be contiguous to only one of any
franchise area in the city, said franchise area
shall thereafter be deemed to include the new
territory.
(b) If new territory shall be annexed to the city
which shall be contiguous to more than one fran-
chise area in the city, or which shall not be
contiguous to any franchise area, then the council
shall invite all grantees of franchises hereunder
to submit sealed bids for such new territory, and
such new territory shall become a part of the
franchise area of the grantee determined by the
council to be best suited to provide service to such
territory based upon the quality of past service,
proximity of facilities and capability.

Sec. 36-31. Inspection of property and

(a) The grantee shall at all reasonable times,
and to the extent necessary to carry out the
provisions of this article, permit any duly autho-
rized agent or representative of the city to exam-
ine all franchise property of the grantee, together
with any appurtenant property of the grantee
situated within or without the city, and to exam-
ine and transcribe any and all maps and other
records kept or maintained by the grantee or
under the control or direction or at the request of
the grantee which deal of the franchise opera-
tions, affairs, transactions, or property of the
grantee.
(b) Any of such maps or other records which
are not situated within the city and which are not
made available in the city within a reasonable
time after written request therefor by the man-
ager, shall be produced for examination wherever
the same shall be situated and the grantee shall
pay all travel and other expenses necessarily or
reasonably incurred by the city, its agents, and
representatives in making such examination.
(c) The grantee shall prepare and furnish to
the manager, at such times and in such form as
prescribed by the manager, references, and mate-
rials with respect to the operations, affairs, trans-
actions, or property of the grantee as may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate to the perfor-
mance of any of the duties of the manager.

11-2-1980)
Sec. 36-32. Default.
Willful failure, refusal, or neglect by the grantee
to comply with any requirement herein, or any
term or condition of franchise issued hereunder,
shall be sufficient cause for termination of any
franchise by the city, as follows:
(1) Upon the continuing of any such failure,
refusal, or neglect for a period of ten days
next following written demand by the
manager that the grantee do or comply
with any such requirement, limitation,
term or condition, the manager may cause
to be placed upon the agenda of a regular
session of the council his request for ter-
mination of such franchise, and in such
case, the manager shall cause to be served
upon such grantee, at least five days prior
to the date of such session of the council, a
written notice of his intent to request
such termination at the time and place of
such session.
(2) At such session of the council, or any
adjournment thereof, the council shall con-
sider the request of the manager and
shall hear any persons desiring to be
heard, and shall determine whether or
not any such failure, refusal or neglect by
the grantee was with just cause.
(3) If the council shall determine such fail-
ure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was
without just cause, then the council may
pass its resolution declaring that the fran-
chise of such grantee shall be terminated
and forfeited unless there be compliance
by the grantee within ten days, and such
resolution shall operate to declare such
franchise terminated and forfeited on the
tenth day next following the passage
thereof, and without further notice to the
grantee, unless the grantee shall so com-
ply within such ten-day period, such ter-
mination and forfeiture to become effec-
tive for all purposes 180 days thereafter.
(4) Within 180 days after such declaration of
termination and forfeiture, the grantee
may sell, remove, or transfer the entire
system of the grantee, subject to the pro-
visions of section 36-28(3), and upon any
such sale or transfer in addition to any
other rights hereunder or otherwise, city
shall have a lien (next in order of prefer-
ence to any liens of encumbrances exist-
ing of record on the date of such termina-
tion and forfeiture) against any and all
proceeds thereof, in the full amount of any
loss, cost, expense or other financial det-
riment incurred by the city in the exercise
of any right hereunder, or by reason of
such termination and forfeiture.
(5) If the grantee shall fail to refuse to sell,
remove or transfer the entire system of
the grantee, as hereinabove provided, and
§ 36-31 PORTLAND CODE
CD36:14
regardless of the exercise of any other
right of the city hereunder, then the city
may institute appropriate court action to
enforce the requirements of this section.

city, or within any privately owned area within
the city which has not yet become a public street
but is designated or delineated as a proposed
public street on any tentative subdivision map
approved by the city, any equipment or facilities
for distributing any television signals or radio

ARTICLE III. USE OF PUBLIC
RIGHTS-OF-WAY BY
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS
Sec. 36-57. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate the
access to and ongoing use of public rights-of-way
by telecommunications providers to ensure and
protect the public health, safety, and welfare and
to exercise reasonable control of the public rights-
of-way pursuant to the City Charter, the Michi-
gan Telecommunications Act, Public Act No. 216
of 1995 (MCL 484.2101 et seq.), other state stat-
utes (including, without limitation,MCL 247.183),
and Mich. Const. art. VII, § 29 of the 1963
Michigan Constitution by:
(1) Minimizing disruption of the public rights-
of-way by regulating the access to and
ongoing use of the public rights-of-way by
telecommunications providers and the con-
struction, installation, operation, and use
of facilities in the public rights-of-way to
provide telecommunication services;
(2) Ensuring that the city and the public are
protected from liability for use of the
public rights-of-way by telecommunica-
tions providers;
(3) Providing for the payment of nondiscrim-
inatory permit fees which do not exceed
the fixed and variable costs of granting
permits and maintaining the rights-of-
way used by telecommunications provid-
ers; and
(4) Assisting telecommunications providers in
understanding the city's requirements for
use of the public rights-of-way and provid-
ing a fair and nondiscriminatory policy
for permitting the use of the public rights-
of-way by such providers.
(Code 1972, § 20.801; Ord. No. 190, § 1, eff.
3-30-2000)
Sec. 36-58. Reservation of rights.
The issuance of a permit or permits under this
article and the access to and use of the public
TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 36-58
CD36:15
rights-of-way by a telecommunications provider
shall not constitute a waiver of or otherwise
adversely affect the following reserved rights:
(1) Right to require franchise. Mich. Const.
art. VII, § 29 of the 1963 Michigan Con-
stitution and the City Charter require
that all public utilities obtain a franchise
to conduct a local business within the city.
The applicability of this requirement to
telecommunications providersmay be chal-
lenged under section 102(dd) of the Mich-
igan Telecommunications Act (MCL
484.2102(dd)) which purports to define
telecommunications services as not con-
stituting public utility services. Due to
this and other legal and regulatory issues,
and to avoid the expense and delay of
litigation that may be unnecessary, the
city hereby determines that telecommuni-
cations providers shall not be required at
this time to obtain franchises for the trans-
action of local business within the city.
Telecommunications providers shall be re-
quired to obtain and maintain a permit
for access to and ongoing use of the public
rights-of-way and to otherwise comply with
the terms of this article. Such a permit
shall not constitute a franchise. The city
reserves the right to require telecommu-
nications providers to obtain a franchise
in the future to transact local business
within the city.
(2) Rights regarding takings claim. Certain
cable or telecommunications providers have
initiated or supported legal proceedings
in which they contend that federal law
grants them the right to physically occupy
the rights-of-way and other property of a
municipality for the purpose of providing
telecommunications service without com-
pensating the municipality for the use or
value of the property so occupied or the
cost of acquiring and maintaining such
property.Municipalities dispute that claim.
The city believes that if such a claim were
sustained it would, among other things,
constitute an unlawful taking by theUnited
States in violation of the Fifth Amend-
ment of the United States Constitution.
The legal issues involved in such disputes
have not been finally decided. The city
desires to act on applications for permits
granting access to its public rights-of-way
at this time rather than wait for determi-
nation of these issues; provided, this can
be done without waiver or loss of any
rights of the city or a permittee. There-
fore, notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, a permittee is not precluded by
this article from seeking relief from the
fee provisions of section 36-62 from any
court or agency of competent jurisdiction.
If a permittee seeks such relief, the city
reserves the right to assert a takings
claim and to take all action it deems
necessary in support thereof. Neither this
article nor the issuance or acceptance of a
permit hereunder constitutes or will be
claimed to constitute a waiver or relin-
quishment of any rights or defenses of
either the city or the permittee in connec-
tion with these disputed issues, and the
acceptance of a permit constitutes an ac-
knowledgment and agreement thereto by
the permittee.
(3) Option to obtain consent agreement. The
city finds that legislative, legal and regu-
latory issues in connection with use of the
public rights-of-way by telecommunica-
tions providers and the resulting poten-
tial for litigation and delay are likely to
have an adverse impact on the develop-
ment of a healthy, competitive telecommu-
nications infrastructure in the commu-
nity. This would be detrimental to the city
and its residents as well as to telecommu-
nications providers. The issues affect,
among other things, both the cost to tele-
communications providers and compensa-
tion to the city for the maintenance and
use of its public rights-of-way. In order to
promote certainty, encourage competition
and avoid litigation, the city will, at the
request and sole option of an applicant or
permittee, consider entering into a con-
sent agreement for use of the public rights-
of-way for the provision of telecommuni-
cations services on terms and conditions
mutually acceptable to the city and the
§ 36-58 PORTLAND CODE
CD36:16
telecommunications provider. It is the city's
intent that such an agreement would sat-
isfy the requirement for a permit under
this article, and would include, among
other things, a fee of up to five percent of
the applicable gross revenues of the tele-
communications provider, which would in-
clude the permit fee; an extended term of
up to 15 years; authorization to conduct a
local business in the city pursuant to
Mich. Const. art. VII, § 29 of the 1963
Michigan Constitution; and a covenant to
abide by the terms of the agreement as a
compromise of disputed issues and uncer-
tain outcomes, notwithstanding the reso-
lution of these legislative, regulatory and
legal requirements in the future. A per-
mittee may request a consent agreement
at any time.
(Code 1972, § 20.802; Ord. No. 190, § 2, eff.

(a) Permit required. No person shall use the
public rights-of-way to provide telecommunica-
tions services without a permit issued pursuant
to this article or a consent agreement under
TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 36-60
CD36:17
section 36-58(3). For purposes of this article, use
of the public rights-of-way includes the installa-
tion, construction, maintenance, repair, or opera-
tion of a telecommunications system within the
public rights-of-way. In addition, a person provid-
ing local exchange service or other local telecom-
munications services is using the public rights-of-

permit requirement of this section shall consti-
tute a violation of this article. A person who

agreement substantially satisfies the obligations
of a telecommunications provider under this arti-
cle, giving due regard to any special circum-
stances involving the telecommunications pro-
vider, the consent agreement will be deemed to
satisfy the requirement of a permit under this
article and under the Telecommunications Act.
When a consent agreement is no longer in effect,
the telecommunications provider shall be re-
quired to comply with all terms and conditions of
this article as it may be amended from time to

of the agreement or legal instrument
granting the telecommunications pro-
vider the right to the use of or access
to such facilities.
(4) A map setting forth the specific location of
the facilities in the public rights-of-way.
The map shall identify the location of
aboveground and underground facilities.
(c) Application fee. The application will be ac-
companied by a nonrefundable application fee in
an amount established by this article or resolu-
§ 36-60 PORTLAND CODE
CD36:18
tion of the city council. The nonrefundable appli-
cation fee shall be designed to reimburse the city
for the costs of reviewing an application for a
permit and issuance of a permit in accordance
with the procedures of this article.
(d) Administrative completeness. An applica-
tion shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of
the 90-day permit application review period in
section 251(3) of the Telecommunications Act un-
less and until the application is determined by the
city manager to be administratively complete. A
determination whether the application is admin-
istratively complete shall be made by the city
manager within ten business days after the ap-
plication is received by the city. If the city man-
ager determines that the application is not admin-
istratively complete, the city manager shall so
advise the telecommunications provider in writ-
ing and shall identify the items which must be
furnished by the applicant for an administra-
tively complete application.
(e) Additional information. The city manager
may request an applicant to submit such addi-
tional information which the city manager deems
reasonably necessary or relevant to review the
application. The applicant shall comply with all
such requests in compliance with reasonable dead-
lines for such additional information established
by the city manager. If the applicant fails to
provide the requested additional information by
the deadline established by the city manager, the
90-day period for acting on the application under
subsection (g) of this section shall be extended by
the number of days after the deadline that the
information was provided to the city manager.
(f) Misleading statements. A person who pro-
vides information to the city in connection with a
permit application or any other matters under
this section which contains an untrue statement
of a material fact or omits a material fact neces-
sary to make the information not misleading shall
be in violation of this article, and shall be subject
to all remedies for violation of this article and the
city Code including, without limitation, denial of
the requested action and permit revocation pur-
suant to section 36-69. Each day that a person
fails to correct an untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission of a material fact necessary to
make the information not misleading shall con-
stitute a separate violation of this article.
(g) Permit approval or denial. Within 75 days
after the city manager determines that the appli-
cation is administratively complete (subject to
any adjustments for delays in providing addi-
tional information as provided in subsection (e) of
this section), the city council shall hold a public
hearing on the application. Notice of the public
hearing shall be published in a newspaper in
general circulation not less than ten days before
the public hearing. Notice of the public hearing
shall also be mailed to the applicant not less than
ten days before the public hearing. Any report or
recommendation on the application obtained or
prepared by the city manager shall be mailed to
the applicant not less than ten days before the
public hearing. The applicant and any other in-
terested parties may appear in person, by agent,
or by letter at such hearing to submit comments
on the application. Following the public hearing,
the city council shall approve, approve with con-
ditions, or deny the application within 90 days
after the city manager determines that the appli-
cation is administratively complete pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section, subject to any ad-
justments for delays in providing additional infor-
mation as provided in subsection (e) of this sec-
tion. The city council shall not unreasonably deny
an application for a permit. The failure of the city
to comply strictly with the procedural require-
ments of this section for the review of permit
applications shall not invalidate the decision or
proceedings of the city.
(h) Conditions. The city council may impose
conditions on a permit to protect the public health,
safety and welfare. Without limitation, these con-
ditions may include the posting of a bond by the
telecommunications provider in an amount, which
shall not exceed the reasonable cost to ensure
that the public rights-of-way are returned to their
original condition during and after the telecom-
munications provider's access and use.
(i) Modification. The city council may, in its
discretion, grant a modification of a specific re-
quirement of sections 36-35, 36-63, 36-64, or 36-67
if the applicant requests such modification in its
TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 36-61
CD36:19
application for a permit and if the applicant
demonstrates that: there are exceptional or ex-
traordinary circumstances which warrant a mod-
ification; the modification will not be detrimental
to the public health, safety, and welfare; and the
modification will not impair the intent and pur-
poses of this article and its several sections. The
application shall describe the applicant's request
for a modification and the reasons for the request
with specificity. A modification granted by the city
council pursuant to this section shall expire upon
the expiration of the permit or earlier if so deter-
mined by the city council. A modification shall
modify only those requirements expressly set
forth in the approval of the city council and shall
not modify any other provisions of this article. If a
request for a modification is denied by the city
council, the telecommunications provider shall
comply with all requirements of this article with-
out exception.
(j) Waiver.
(1) The city council shall grant a waiver of
any requirement of this article if an ap-
plicant or permittee requests a waiver
and the city council finds that:
a. Unless waived the requirement will
prohibit or have the effect of prohib-
iting the ability of the applicant or
permittee to provide any telecommu-
nications service within the mean-
ing of section 253(a) of the Federal
Telecommunications Act, 47 USC
253(a);
b. The requirement is not within the
scope of any state or local authority
referenced in section 253(c) of the
Federal Telecommunications Act, 47
USC 253(c); or
c. The requirement is not necessary to
protect the public safety and welfare
or safeguard the rights of consum-
ers.
(2) A request for a waiver may be included in
an application for a permit.
(3) A request for a waiver shall include a
detailed statement of the facts and circum-
stances forming the basis for the request.
(4) If the request is made in connection with
an application for a permit, the provisions
of subsections (e)—(g) of this section shall
apply to the request, except that submis-
sion of a request for a waiver shall consti-
tute consent that the time periods pro-
vided in subsection (g) of this section for
holding a public hearing and acting on an
application are extended by 90 days.
(5) Subsections (a), (c) and (f) of this section
shall apply to a waiver request that is not
made in connection with a permit appli-
cation, and the request may be denied for
violation of or failure to comply with any
of those provisions.
(6) Subsection (g) of this section shall also
apply to such a request, with the excep-
tion of the 75- and 90-day time periods set
forth in that section, but the city council
may by resolution establish different or
additional procedures for conducting the
public hearing and acting on the request.
(Code 1972, § 20.808; Ord. No. 190, § 8, eff.

Sec. 36-62. Annual permit fees.
(a) Establishment of annual fees; payment.
(1) In addition to the nonrefundable applica-
tion fee set forth in section 36-61(c) and
any other fees for other permits or autho-
rizations required by the city Code, the
permittee shall pay an annual fee in an
amount established by resolution of the
city council. The annual fee may be mod-
ified from time to time by resolution of the
city council. The amount of the annual fee
shall not exceed the fixed and variable
costs to the city in maintaining the public
rights-of-way used by a telecommunica-
tions provider unless otherwise permitted
by law. The annual fee shall be payable
quarterly as follows:
1st quarter (January 1—March 31)—
April 30
2nd quarter (April 1—June 30)—July 31
3rd quarter (July 1—September 30)—
October 31
§ 36-61 PORTLAND CODE
CD36:20
4th quarter (October 1—December 31)—
January 31
(2) When a permit is issued during a calen-
dar year, the annual fee shall be prorated
for the balance of the calendar year. In the
event that a quarterly payment is not
paid when due, the permittee shall pay a
late payment charge of the greater of
$100.00 or interest at the rate of one
percent over the prime rate then charged
by NBD Bank and computed monthly. A
person who violates this article by failing
to obtain a permit shall pay the annual
fee plus late payment charges, as re-
quired by this section, for the time period
in which the violator did not have a per-
mit plus the actual costs of the city in
enforcing this article against the person.
(b) Option to pay annual fee based upon gross
revenues. A permittee, at its option, may elect to
pay an annual fee of one percent of its annual
gross revenues as set forth below, in lieu of and in
full satisfaction of the annual fee established by
the city council pursuant to subsection (a) of this
section. Permittees may elect this annual fee
option for administrative convenience in comput-
ing the fee or for any other reason.
(1) An election shall be made within 45 days
of applying for a permit or at least 60 days
before the start of any calendar year after
issuance of a permit.
(2) Any election, once made, shall continue in
effect until the end of the next three
calendar years, such that an electionmade
in a permit application in 1997 would
continue in effect through the end of the
year 2000.
(3) An election shall be made on a form
provided by the city. Copies of the form
shall be submitted in the manner pro-
vided in section 36-61(a). The permittee
shall supply all information requested on
the form and any additional information
that the city manager deems reasonably
necessary or relevant, including informa-
tion on affiliates of the permittee relating
to the requirements of subsections (b)(5)—
(7), and (c) of this section. After providing
notice and an opportunity to be heard the
city may reject or revoke an election for
failure to comply with this subsection.
(4) The annual fees shall be paid quarterly by
the same due dates as are set forth in
subsection (a) of this section.
(5) An election shall apply to all affiliates of a
permittee. In making its election, a per-
mittee shall expressly affirm that it has
the authority to bind, and does bind, its
affiliates to the obligations of this subsec-
tion, including subsection (b)(6) of this
section and the audit and records provi-
sions of subsections (b)(7) and (c) of this
section.
(6) For purposes of this subsection (b) of this
section, the term "gross revenues" is de-
fined in section 36-75.
(7) If a permittee or any affiliate of a permit-
tee refuses to pay the fees due under this
option or prohibit or effectively prohibit
the city from auditing the permittee or its
affiliates under subsection (c) of this sec-
tion to verify the accuracy of annual fees,
then the city at its option may revoke the
election for all or any portion of the time
period in question. The annual fees com-
puted under subsection (a) of this section
shall then become immediately due and
payable, less a credit for any sums paid by
the permittee or its affiliates, plus the
late payment charges set forth in subsec-
tion (a) of this section and any additional
sums due under the last sentence of sub-
section (c) of this section.
(c) Records. All records (including those of af-
filiates) reasonably necessary to verify the accu-
racy of annual fees paid by the permittee under
either subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall be
made available by a permittee at a location within
the city or within 20 miles of the city's bound-
aries. The city, by itself or in combination with
other municipalities, reserves the right to audit
any permittee (or any affiliate of a permittee) to
verify the accuracy of annual fees paid or to be
paid to the city. Any additional amount due the
city shall be paid within 30 days of submission of
an invoice. If the additional amount due exceeds
TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 36-62
CD36:21
two percent of the total annual fee which the
audit determines should have been paid for a
calendar year, the permittee shall pay the city's
costs in connection with the audit within 30 days
of submission of an invoice.
(d) Other payments. The nonrefundable appli-
cation fees and the annual fees established pur-
suant to this article shall be in addition to any
tax, charge, fee, or payment due, or to become
due, to the city by a permittee under the city Code
or the laws of the state.
(e) Misleading statements. A person who pro-
vides information to the city in connection with
any matter under this section which contains an
untrue statement of a material fact or omits a
material fact necessary to make the information
not misleading shall be in violation of this article,
and shall be subject to all remedies for violation of
this article and the city Code including, without
limitation, rejection or revocation of an election
under subsection (b) of this section and permit
revocation pursuant to section 36-69. Each day
that a person fails to correct an untrue statement
of a material fact or the omission of a material
fact necessary to make the information not mis-
leading shall constitute a separate violation of
this article.
(Code 1972, § 20.810; Ord. No. 190, § 10, eff.
3-30-2000)
Sec. 36-63. Duration of permit; renewal.
A permit shall remain in effect until December
31 following the fifth anniversary of the issuance
of the permit (unless the permit expires pursuant
to section 36-64(l) or the permit is earlier revoked
pursuant to section 36-69). Applications for re-
newal of permits shall be filed in the same man-
ner as original applications in section 36-61 and
shall be filed with the city not less than 120 days
before the expiration of the permit. The city
expressly reserves all rights to approve, approve
with conditions, or deny applications for permit
renewals pursuant to this article and to impose
additional conditions on renewed permits.
(Code 1972, § 20.811; Ord. No. 190, § 11, eff.
3-30-2000)
Sec. 36-64. Permit terms and requirements.
(a) Nonexclusive; additional permits. A permit
shall be nonexclusive. The city expressly reserves
the right to approve, at any time, additional
permits for access to and ongoing use of the public
rights-of-way by telecommunications providers
and to enter into agreements and grant fran-
chises for such access and use. The issuance of
additional permits, entry into agreements, or grant
of franchises shall not be deemed to amend,
modify, revoke, or terminate the terms and condi-
tions of any permits previously issued to telecom-
munication providers.
(b) Underground cable or conduit use. Unless
expressly authorized by the permit, the telecom-
munications provider shall install, operate and
maintain underground all cable, wire, facilities or
apparatus used for the transmission of two-way
interactive communicationwithin the public rights-
of-way. All undergrounding work shall be at the
sole cost and expense of the permittee.
(c) Expansion requests. A permit approved by
the city council shall authorize access to and
ongoing use of the public rights-of-way described
in the permit, subject to strict compliance with
the conditions of the permit, the requirements of
this article, and any other applicable require-
ments of the City Code or applicable state and
federal law. The permittee shall not use any
public rights-of-way not expressly authorized by
the permit. Any use of the public rights-of-way
(including any installation, construction, mainte-
nance, repair, or operation of a telecommunica-
tion system within the public rights-of-way) to
provide telecommunications services shall be per-
formed only as authorized by the permit. A per-
mittee may, however, expand its telecommunica-
tions system to public rights-of-way not described
in its permit by obtaining approval of an amended
permit fromthe city. Such approvalmay be granted
in writing by the city manager in response to a
written request from the permittee for expansion
to specific portions of named public rights-of-way.
The city council may establish by resolution a
nonrefundable application fee for such a request.
The city manager may grant, grant with condi-
tions, or deny such request. The city manager
shall not unreasonably deny any request.Adenial
§ 36-62 PORTLAND CODE
CD36:22
of any request may be appealed to the city council,
which shall make the final decision. Any expan-
sion into additional public rights-of-way shall be
subject to all terms and conditions of the original
permit and this article including, without limita-
tion, the application of the annual fee to the
expanded public rights-of-way used by the permit-
tee.
(d) Construction permit. A permittee shall not
commence construction upon, over, across or un-
der the public rights-of-way in the city without
first obtaining a construction permit as required
under section 8-19, as amended, for construction
within the public rights-of-way.
(e) Lease or use of facilities; overlashing. A
permittee shall not lease, sublease, license or
otherwise allow the use of wires, conduit, poles or
facilities in the public rights-of-way by a person
who is required to obtain a permit under section
36-60 or is required by law to obtain the city's
permission or consent to transact local business
in the city, and who lacks such permit, permission
or consent. A permittee shall not allow the prop-
erty of a third party or nontelecommunications
systemwires or any other facilities to be overlashed,
affixed or attached to any portion of a permittee's
telecommunications system; or allow other ac-
tions with a similar result without the written
consent of the city manager.
(f) As-built maps. Without expense to the city,
a permittee shall provide the city with as-built
maps, records and plans showing its telecommu-
nications system or portions thereof within the
city, including those of affiliates used by the
permittee, and maps and descriptive information
of facilities of other persons used by the permit-
tee. The city manager may waive part or all of this
requirement if satisfactory records of the location
of the telecommunications system were previ-
ously provided to the city. The as-built maps,
records and plans shall be provided within 30
days of the completion of the telecommunications
system and any extensions, additions, or modifi-
cations to the telecommunications system. In ad-
dition to the foregoing, a permittee, without ex-
pense to the city, shall, upon 48 hours notice, give
the city access to all as-built maps, records, plans
and specifications showing its telecommunica-
tions system or portions thereof within the city.
Upon request by the city, a permittee shall inform
the city as soon as possible (but no more than one
business day after the request) of any changes
from previously supplied maps, records, or plans
and shall mark up maps provided by the city so as
to show the location of its telecommunications
system.
(g) No recourse. A permittee shall have no
recourse whatsoever against the city for any loss,
cost, expense or damage arising out of the failure
of the city to have the authority to grant all or any
part of a permit or the authority to grant permis-
sion to use all or part of the public rights-of-way.
A permittee expressly acknowledges that on ac-
cepting a permit it did so relying on its own
investigation and understanding of the power and
authority of the city.
(h) No inducement. By acceptance of a permit,
a permittee acknowledges that it has not been
induced to obtain the permit by any understand-
ing or promise or other statement, whether verbal
or written, by or on behalf of the city or by any
third person concerning any term or condition of a
permit not expressed in this article.
(i) Acceptance of terms and conditions. Permit-
tee acknowledges by the acceptance of a permit
that it has carefully read its terms and conditions
and does accept all of such terms and conditions.
(j) No priority. A permit does not establish any
priority of use of the public rights-of-way by a
permittee over any present or future permittees
or parties having agreements with the city or
franchises for such use. In the event of any
dispute as to the priority of use of the public
rights-of-way, the first priority shall be to the
public generally, the second priority to the city,
the third priority to the state and its political
subdivisions in the performance of their various
functions, and thereafter as between permittees,
other permit holders, parties having agreements
with the city, and franchisees, as determined by
the city in the exercise of its powers, including the
police power and other powers reserved to and
conferred on it by the state.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 36-64
CD36:23
(k) Future use by city. A permittee acknowl-
edges by accepting a permit that it obtains no
rights to or further use of the public rights-of-way
other than those expressly granted herein. Each
permittee acknowledges and accepts as its own
risk that the city may make use in the future of
the public rights-of-way which a permittee is
using or in which a permittee's telecommunica-
tions system is located in a manner inconsistent
with the permittee's use of such public rights-of-
way and that in such event the permittee will not
be entitled to compensation from the city.
(l) Expiration of permit. Unless the city grants
an extension, a permit shall expire one year from
the date of issuance unless prior thereto the
permittee either:
(1) Commences construction, installation, or
operation of its telecommunications sys-
temwithin the public rights-of-way autho-
rized by the permit and diligently pursues
completion of construction or installation;
or
(2) Commences use of the public rights-of-
way to provide telecommunications ser-
vices as authorized by the permit.
(Code 1972, § 20.812; Ord. No. 190, § 12, eff.
3-30-2000)
Sec. 36-65. Use of public rights-of-way by
permittee.
(a) No burden on public rights-of-way. A per-
mittee and its contractors and subcontractors and
a permittee's telecommunications system shall
not unduly burden or interfere with the present
or future use of any of the public rights-of-way
within the city. A permittee shall install and
maintain its telecommunications system so as to
cause minimum interference with the use of the
public rights-of-way and with the rights and rea-
sonable convenience of property owners. Permittee's
cables and wires shall be suspended or buried so
as to not endanger or injure persons or property
in the public rights-of-way. If the city in its
reasonable judgment determines that any portion
of the telecommunications system constitutes an
undue burden or interference, the permittee at its
sole cost and expense shall modify its telecommu-
nications systems or take such other actions as
the city may determine are in the public interest
to remove or alleviate the burden, and the per-
mittee shall do so within the time period estab-
lished by the city.
(b) Restoration of property. A permittee and its
contractors and subcontractors shall immediately
restore, at the permittee's sole cost and expense
and in a manner approved by the city, any portion
of the public rights-of-way that is in any way
disturbed, damaged, or injured by the construc-
tion, operation, maintenance or removal of the
telecommunications system to as good or better
condition than that which existed prior to the
disturbance. In the event that the permittee, its
contractors or subcontractors fail to do so within
the time specified by the city, the city shall be
entitled to complete the work and the permittee
shall reimburse the city for the costs of doing so.
(c) Easements. Any easements over or under
private property necessary for the construction or
operation of a telecommunications system shall
be arranged and paid for by the permittee. Any
use or intrusion on private property without an
easement or other instrument evidencing permis-
sion of the property owner shall constitute a
trespass by the permittee and a violation of this
article. Any easements over or under property
owned by the city other than the public rights-of-
way shall be separately negotiated with the city.
(d) Pavement cut coordination/additional fees.
Apermittee shall coordinate all construction work
in the public rights-of-way with the city's program
for street construction, rebuilding, resurfacing
and repair (collectively, street resurfacing). A per-
mittee shall meet with the official of the city
primarily responsible for the public rights-of-way
at least twice per year to this end.
(1) The goals of such coordination shall be to
require a permittee to conduct all work in
the public rights-of-way in conjunction
with or immediately prior to any street
resurfacing planned by the city, and to
prevent the public rights-of-way from be-
ing disturbed by a permittee for a period
of years after such street resurfacing.
(2) In addition to any other fees or payments
required by this article, a permittee shall
pay to the city the sum as currently es-
§ 36-64 PORTLAND CODE
CD36:24
tablished or as hereafter adopted by res-
olution of the city council from time to
time for each 50 feet cut into or excava-
tion of any public rights-of-way, or portion
thereof, which was subject to street resur-
facing within 18 months prior to such cut
or excavation. This fee is in addition to
and not in lieu of the obligation to restore
the public rights-of-way and is in addition
to all other fees required by this article or
the City Code.
(e) Marking. A permittee shall mark any in-
stallations of its telecommunications systemwhich
occur after the effective date of the ordinance
from which this article is derived as follows:
(1) Aerial portions of its telecommunications
system shall be marked with a marker on
its lines on alternate poles, which shall
state the permittee's name and provide a
toll-free number to call for assistance;
(2) Direct buried underground portions of its
telecommunications system shall have:
a. A conducting wire placed in the
ground at least several inches above
the permittee's cable (if such cable is
nonconductive);
b. At least several inches above that a
continuous colored tape with the
permittee's name and a toll-free phone
number and a statement to the effect
that there is buried cable beneath;
and
c. Stakes or other appropriate
aboveground markers with the
permittee's name and a toll-free num-
ber indicating that there is buried
telephone cable below.
(3) Portions of its telecommunications sys-
tem located in conduit, including facilities
of others used by a permittee, shall be
marked at each manhole with the
permittee's name and toll-free telephone
number to call for assistance.
(f) Compliance with laws. A permittee shall
comply with all laws, statutes, ordinances, rules
and regulations regarding the installation, con-
struction, ownership and use of its telecommuni-
cations system, whether federal, state or local,
now in force or which hereafter may be promul-
gated (including, without limitation, any chapter
requiring the installation of additional conduit
when a permittee installs underground conduit
for its telecommunications system). Before any
installation is commenced, the permittee shall
secure all necessary permits, licenses and approv-
als from all appropriate departments, agencies,
boards or commissions of the city or other govern-
mental entity as may be required by law, includ-
ing, without limitation, all utility line permits
and highway permits. A permittee shall comply in
all respects with applicable codes and industry
standards, including but not limited to the Na-
tional Electrical Safety Code (latest edition) and
the National Electric Code (latest edition). A
permittee shall comply with all zoning and land
use ordinances and historic preservation ordi-
nances asmay exist ormay hereafter be amended.
(g) Street vacation. If the city vacates or con-
sents to the vacation of public rights-of-way within
its jurisdiction, and such vacation necessitates
the removal and relocation of a permittee's facil-
ities in the vacated right-of-way, the permittee
shall, as a condition of the permit, consent to the
vacation and move its facilities at its sole cost and
expense when ordered to do so by the city or a
court of competent jurisdiction. The permittee
shall relocate its facilities to such alternate route
as the city, acting reasonably and in good faith,
shall designate.
(h) Relocation. If the city requests a permittee
to relocate, protect, support, disconnect, or re-

in connectionwith or attributable to the permittee's
telecommunications system in the city or to the
permittee's or its affiliates' provision of telecom-
munications services within the city.
(1) Gross revenues shall include, but not be
limited to, all revenues from or attribut-
able to customers, other carriers, or third

fect on October 31, 1996, 47 CFR 32
subpart D, whether or not the permittee
or its affiliates are subject to such system
of accounts, including accounts 4999
through 5302 and any cross referenced
accounts or subaccounts which may be

relating to the preceding account num-
bers. Gross revenues shall include all ser-
vices provided by a permittee or its affil-
iates, whether or not subject to regulation

including in particular section 32.27(d),
and otherwise at the fair market rate.

revenue is associated are provided at
cost or the revenue amount can be
matched against an equivalent ex-
penditure;
d. The amounts are characterized, sep-
arately identified, or accounted as
being for goods, services, or fees to
be paid to units of government or
government agencies; or

Revenues from nonswitched telecommu-
nications services shall be allocated to the
city as set forth in appendix A-1.
(5) Revenues whose source cannot be identi-
fied with a specific customer or city shall

served by that portion of permittee's
telecommunications system(including por-
tions outside the city) to which such
revenues are reasonably attributable.
(Code 1972, § 20.831; Ord. No. 190, app. A, eff.
3-30-2000)
Sec. 36-76. Appendix A-1: Allocation of
revenue from nonswitched
telecommunications services.
Gross revenues from nonswitched telecom-
munications services shall be allocated to the
city as follows:
(1) For purposes of this appendix A-1, the
term

nonswitched telecommunications
services

means the two-way transmis-
sion of high speed digital voice, data and
(for such applications as teleconferenc-
ing) video signals to:
a. Carry interexchange traffic between
long distance carrier points-of-pres-
ence;
b. Interconnect user locations to inter-
exchange carrier points-of-presence;
and
c. Interconnect user locations.
(2) If all the locations of a given customer
receiving service from the permittee are
in the city, gross revenues shall include
all revenues received from or imputed to
that customer.
(3) If any but not all of the locations of a
given customer receiving service from
the permittee are in the city, the revenues
attributable to the city shall be computed
separately for each service taken by the
customer. For each separate service taken
the revenues attributable to the city are
all revenues received from or imputed to
that service times a fraction whose
numerator is the number of locations of
the customer within the city taking that
service and whose denominator is all the
customer's locations taking that service.
(4) If (such as with an interexchange carrier
which contracts for capacity from the
permittee so as to connect with its custom-
ers through the permittee's telecom-
munications system) a customer uses the
permittee's telecommunications system
to connect to third parties, such third
parties shall be treated as customers (or
customer locations, as the case may be)
for purposes of this provision and revenue
attribution thereunder. The term

inter-
exchange carrier

means a person who
provides interexchange telecommunica-
tions service, commonly called a long
distance carrier (Sprint, MCI and AT&T
are examples), and typically deemed a
carrier under the Federal Communica-
tions Act of 1934 or amendments thereto.
(5) The different services taken by custom-
ers shall correspond with the classes of
service offered by the permittee.
(6) Examples of the preceding computations
are as follows:
a. Example 1: A customer leases a 56
kbps data channel for $5,000.00/
month which serves/may be accessed
by one customer location each in
municipality A, municipality B, and
municipality C. $1,666.00/month is
gross revenues from municipality A
(one-third times $5,000.00).
b. Example 2: A customer leases 3 T-1
telephone lines at $400.00/month to
connect toMCI. Gross revenues from
municipality A are computed
separately for each line as follows:
1. The first connects a location in
municipality B to anMCI point
of presence in municipality A.
$200.00/month is the gross
revenues from municipality A
for this service (one-half times
$400.00).
2. The second connects a location
in municipality A to the same
MCI point of presence. All
$400.00 is gross revenues from
municipality A for this service.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 36-76
Supp. No. 3 CD36:31
3. The third connects a location
in municipality C to a different
MCI point of presence, located
in municipality D. There are
no gross revenues from
municipality A for this service
(but there would be gross
revenues of $200.00 each in
municipality C and municipal-
ity D).
c. Example 3: Sprint, an interex-
change (long distance) carrier, leases
a large amount of capacity from the
permittee for $50,000.00/month so
that persons desiring to use its
services may connect with it directly
and not have to go through the local
Ameritech central office. Sixteen
customers take advantage of this
service, comprising 42 locations, of
which 28 locations are in municipal-
ity A. Sprint's point of presence is
also in municipality A. $41,667.00
is gross revenues from municipality
A as follows:
1. $25,000.00 (half of the
$50,000.00) is included because
all the circuits (wherever the
customer is located) connect to
the point of presence in
municipality A, i.e., each
customer circuit is composed
of two locations (one at the
customer, one at Sprint), one of
which is in municipality A.
2. $16,667.00 (28/42 of $25,000.00)
because the other half of the
$50,000.00 is attributable to
the specific customer locations
being connected to Sprint, of
which 28 out of 42 are in
municipality A.

ance to the extent caused by operational error,
improperly designed treatment facilities, inade-
quate treatment facilities, lack of preventivemain-
tenance, or careless or improper operation.
(b) Effect of an upset. An upset shall constitute
an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with pretreatment standards if
the requirements of subsection (a) of this section
are met.
(c) Conditions necessary for a demonstration of
upset. A user who wishes to establish the affirma-
tive defense of upset shall demonstrate, through
properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs,
or other relevant evidence that:
(1) An upset occurred and the user can iden-
tify the cause of the upset;
(2) The facility was, at the time, being oper-
ated in a prudent and workman-like man-
ner and in compliance with applicable
operation and maintenance procedures;
(3) The user has orally submitted the follow-
ing information to the city immediately
upon becoming aware of the upset and a
written report provided within five days
containing the following:
a. A description of the upset discharge
and cause of noncompliance;
b. The period of noncompliance, includ-
ing exact dates and times or, if not
corrected, the anticipated time the
noncompliance is expected to con-
tinue; and
§ 40-138 PORTLAND CODE
CD40:22
c. Steps being taken and/or planned to
reduce, eliminate and prevent recur-
rence of the noncompliance.
(4) In any enforcement proceeding, the indus-
trial user seeking to establish the occur-
rence of an upset shall have the burden of
proof.
(5) The industrial user shall control produc-
tion of all discharges to the extent neces-
sary tomaintain compliance with pretreat-
ment standards upon reduction, loss, or
failure of its treatment facility until the
facility is restored or an alternativemethod
of treatment is provided. This require-
ment applies in the situationwhere, among
other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, or
fails.

Sec. 40-142. Industrial user reporting re-
quirements; significant dis-
chargers baseline report.
(a) All significant industrial users shall sub-
mit baseline reports to the city in a form pre-
scribed and furnished by the city. If reports al-
ready containing this information have been
submitted to the city, it will not be necessary to
submit this information again. Any changes in
the base line monitoring report submitted to the
city shall be reported within 60 days of the
change.
(b) Within 180 days after the effective date of a
National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, or
180 days after a final administrative decision has
been made by the city upon a SIU determination
submission, whichever is later, SIU's, which are
existing sources subject to such National Categor-
ical Pretreatment Standards and currently dis-
charging to the city, shall submit a properly
completed baseline report.
(c) New SIU sources, shall submit a baseline
report at least 90 days prior to commencement of
discharge to the city.
(d) In support of the baseline report, the indus-
trial user shall submit, in units and terms speci-
fied in the application, the following information:
(1) Name and address of the facility includ-
ing the name of the operator and owners;
(2) List of any environmental control permits
held by or for the facility;
(3) Brief description of the nature, average
rate of production, and standard indus-
trial classification of the operation carried
out by such user. This description shall
include a schematic process diagram indi-
cating points of discharge to the city's
collection system from the regulated pro-
cesses;
(4) Information showing the measured aver-
age, daily and maximum daily flows in
gallons per day to the POTW from each of
the following:
a. Regulated process streams; and
b. Other streams as necessary to allow
use of the combined waste stream
formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(5) The industrial user shall identify the Na-
tional Categorical Pretreatment Stan-
dards applicable to each regulated pro-
cess, and shall:
a. Submit the results of sampling and
analysis identifying the nature and
§ 40-141 PORTLAND CODE
CD40:24
concentration of regulated pollut-
ants in the discharge from each reg-
ulated process. Both daily maximum
and average concentrations shall be
reported. The sample shall be repre-
sentative of daily operations.
b. A minimum of four grab samples
must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and
volatile organics. For all other pol-
lutants, 24-hour composite samples
must be obtained through flow-pro-
portional composite sampling tech-
niques where feasible. The city may
waive flow-proportional composite
sampling for any industrial user that
demonstrates that flow-proportional
sampling is infeasible. In such cases
samples may be obtained through
time-proportional composite sam-
pling techniques or through a mini-
mum of four grab samples where the
user demonstrates that this will pro-
vide a representative sample of the
effluent being discharged.
c. The user shall take a minimum of
one representative sample to com-
pile that data necessary to comply
with the requirements of this subsec-
tion.
d. Samples should be taken immedi-
ately downstream from pretreat-
ment facilities if such exist or imme-
diately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment
exists. If otherwastewaters aremixed
with the regulated wastewater prior
to pretreatment, the user shouldmea-
sure the flows and concentrations
necessary to allow use of the com-
binedwastestreamformula of 40 CFR
403.6(e) in order to evaluate compli-
ance with the pretreatment stan-
dards. Where an alternate concen-
tration or mass limit has been
calculated in accordance with 40 CFR
403.6(e) this adjusted limit along
with supporting data shall be sub-
mitted to the POTW.
(6) The industrial user shall provide a state-
ment, reviewed by an authorized repre-
sentative of the industrial user and certi-
fied by a qualified professional, indicating
whether National Categorical Pretreat-
ment Standards are being met on a con-
sistent basis and, if not, whether addi-
tional operation and maintenance
measures (O&M) or additional pretreat-
ment is required for the industrial user to
meet the National Categorical Pretreat-
ment Standards.
(7) If additional pretreatment or improve-
ments are required to meet the National
Categorical Pretreatment Standards, the
industrial user will provide the shortest
schedule which will provide such addi-
tional pretreatment or improvements. The
completion date in this schedule shall not
be later than the compliance date estab-
lished for the applicable National Cate-
gorical Pretreatment Standard. The sched-
ule shall contain increments of progress
in the form of dates for the commence-
ment and completion ofmajor events lead-
ing to the construction and operation of
additional pretreatment required for the
user to meet the applicable National Cat-
egorical Pretreatment Standards (e.g., hir-
ing an engineer, completing preliminary
plans, completing final plans, executing
contract for major components commenc-
ing construction, completing construction,
etc.).
(8) Modification of the baseline report shall
be made:
a. Where the industrial user's National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard
has been modified by a removal al-
lowance (40 CFR 403.7) or the com-
bined wastestream formula (40 CFR
403.6(e)), or net/gross calculations
(40 CFR 403.15), at the time the
industrial user submits a baseline
report, the information required in
subsections (d)(6) and (d)(7) of this
section shall pertain to the modified
limits.
UTILITIES § 40-142
CD40:25
b. If the National Categorical Pretreat-
ment Standard for the industrial user
is modified after the baseline report
is submitted, the industrial user shall
make any necessary amendments to
information provided as a response
to subsections (d)(6) and (d)(7) of this
section and submit them to the city
within 60 days after the modified
limit is approved.

Sec. 40-143. Categorical industry compli-
ance report.
Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable categorical pretreat-
ment standards (CPS) or, in the case of a new
source, following commencement of the introduc-
tion of wastewater into the city's POTW, any user
subject to CPS shall submit to the city a report
indicating the nature and concentration of all
pollutants in the discharge from the regulated
process which are limited by such standards and
the average and maximum daily flow for these
process units in the user facility which are limited
by such pretreatment standards or requirements.
Where equivalent mass or concentration limits
are established by the city for a user, this report
shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's
longterm production rate. Where a user is subject
to CPS expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production, the report shall
include the user's actual production during the
appropriate sampling period. The report shall
state whether the applicable pretreatment stan-
dards are being met on a consistent basis and, if
not,what additional improvements and/or pretreat-
ment is necessary to bring the user into compli-
ance with the applicable pretreatment standards.
This statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user, and certified
to by a qualified professional.

compliance reports.
(a) Any user subject to a categorical pretreat-
ment standard (CPS), after the compliance date of
such CPS, or, in the case of a new source, after
commencement of the discharge into the POTW,
shall submit to the city during the months of June
and December, unless required more frequently
in the CPS or by the city, a report indicating the
nature and concentration, of pollutants in the
effluent which are limited by such pretreatment
standards. In addition, this report shall include a
record of all daily flows which, during the report-
ing period, exceeded the average daily flow limits
as specified in the industrial user's wastewater
discharge permit. At the discretion of the city and
in consideration of such factors as local high or
low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the
city may agree to alter the months during which
the above reports are to be submitted.
(b) The city may impose mass limitations on
users which are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements, or in
other cases where the imposition of mass limita-
tions are appropriate. In such cases, the report
shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by
pretreatment standards in the effluent of the
user. These reports shall contain the results of
sampling and analysis of the discharge, including
the flow and the nature and concentration, or
production and mass where requested by the city,
of pollutants contained therein which are limited
by the applicable pretreatment standards.
(c) For industrial users subject to equivalent
mass or concentration limits established by the
city in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
403.6(c), the report shall contain a reasonable
measure of the user's longterm production rate.
For all other industrial users subject to CPS
expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other mea-
sure of operation), the report shall include the
user's actual average production rate for the
reporting period.
(d) Significant noncategorical industrial users
shall, at a minimum, submit to the city every six
months (on dates specified by the city) a descrip-
tion of the nature, concentration, and flow of the
pollutants as required in the users discharge
permit.

Sec. 40-145. Hazardouswaste notification re-
port.
(a) Any industrial user, except as specified in
subsection (e) of this section, which discharges to
the city's POTW any substance which, if other-
wise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 CFR 261, shall notify the city in writing
of such a discharge. 40 CFR 403.12(p)(1) also
requires that the EPA, and state hazardous waste
authorities be notified in writing.
(b) All hazardous waste notifications shall in-
clude:
(1) The name of the hazardous waste as set
forth in 40 CFR 261;
(2) The EPA hazardous waste number;
(3) The type of discharge (continuous, batch
or other); and
(4) A certification that the user has a pro-
gram in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to
the degree that it has none of the charac-
teristics described in section 40-119(a)(2).
(c) In addition to the information submitted in
subsection (b) of this section, industrial users
discharging more than 20 pounds of hazardous
waste per calendar month to the city's POTW
shall report the following information to the city:
(1) An identification of the hazardous constit-
uents contained in the waste;
(2) An estimation of the mass and concentra-
tion of such constituents in the
wastestream discharged during that cal-
endar month; and
(3) An estimation of the mass of constituents
in the wastestream expected to be dis-
charged during the following 12 months.
(d) Hazardous waste notifications shall be sub-
mitted to the city no later than 60 days from the
discharge of the waste. This notification does not
apply to pollutants already under a city self-
monitoring requirement.
(e) Industrial users are exempt from the haz-
ardous waste notification requirement during a
calendar month in which they discharge five
pounds or less of nonacute hazardous wastes.
Discharge of any quantity of acute hazardous
waste as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e) requires a one time notification.

amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR 136 does not
contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where the city deter-
mines that the 40 CFR 136 sampling and analyt-
ical techniques are inappropriate for the pollut-
ant in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods
or any other applicable sampling and analytical
procedures, including procedures suggested by
the city or other persons, approved by the city.
This sampling and analysis may be performed by
the city in lieu of the industrial user. Where the
city itself collects all the information required for
the report, the significant industrial user will not
be required to submit the report.
(b) If sampling, performed by an industrial
user, indicates a violation, the user shall notify
the city immediately upon becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling
and analysis and submit the results of the repeat
analysis to the city within 30 days after becoming
aware of the violation. The industrial user is not
required to resample if:
(1) The city performs sampling at the indus-
trial user at a frequency of at least once
per month; or
(2) The city samples the user between the
time when the user performs its initial
sampling and the time when the user
receives the results of this sampling.
(c) The reports required in sections 40-144(a)
and 40-144(d) shall be based upon data obtained
through appropriate sampling and analysis per-
formed during the period covered by the report,

erty owners that paid for their share for construct-
ing the sewer line shall get a credit of the fee for
one residential equivalent unit.
(b) For those properties located within a spe-
cial assessment district but not listed on the
original special assessment roll or paid a partial
assessment (for example a vacant lot), a connec-
tion fee will be charged in the amount of the
special assessment charges for the special assess-
ment district, or $2,700.00 per residential equiv-
alent unit, whichever is greater; provided further
that a partial special assessment shall offset any
current charges.
(c) The revenues received by the city for the
connection fees shall be set aside in a debt service
fund, improvement fund or replacement fund for
the intended repayment of debt for future capital
improvements or replacements to the POTW.

Sec. 40-157. Debt service/capacity charge.
(a) In order to defray the proportional share of
the cost of the POTW, the user shall be charged a
debt service/capacity charge of $1,500.00 per res-
idential equivalent unit required to service the
building. In the event a user modifies the use on
their premises, the user shall pay a debt service/
capacity charge of $1,500.00 per residential equiv-
alent unit with a credit of $1,500.00 per residen-
tial equivalent unit for their current or past use.
No refunds will be allowed for debt service/
capacity charges where the residential equivalent
unit use decreases.
(b) The residential equivalent unit factor rep-
resents a ratio of sewer use by such a class of a
premises to normal single-family residential use
as reflected in section 40-165.
(c) Revenues received by the city for the debt
service/capacity charges shall be set aside for use
in one or more of the following funds: debt service,
future capital improvement or sewer system re-
placement. These funds are intended for the re-
payment of debt or for future capital improve-
ments or replacements to the POTW.
(d) Users within special assessment districts
are subject to the debt service/capacity charge.
(e) For properties with existing sewer service
that renovate or add on to the existing structure
or change the use of the structure, a new debt
service/capacity charge will be due. The new charge
will be calculated as the debt service/capacity
charge for the new building size and use less the
debt service/capacity charge for the existing build-
ing size and use. Both the proposed and existing
charges will be determined according to the REU
table. If the debt service/capacity charge calcu-
lated for the existing use is greater than the
proposed use, there will be no refund to the owner.

Sec. 40-162. Administrative enforcement
remedies.
Any or all of the enforcement remedies found in
this section may be used to protect the city, the
POTW and its employees from the general dis-
charge prohibitions and requirements found in
this division.
(1) Notification of violation. Whenever the
city finds that any industrial user has
violated or is violating this division, or a
discharge permit or order issued hereun-
der, the city manager or his agent may
serve upon said user written notice of the
violation. Within ten days of the receipt
date of this notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof; to in-
clude specific required actions, shall be
submitted to the city. Submission of this
plan in no way relieves the user of liabil-
ity for any violation.
(2) Consent orders. The citymanager is hereby
empowered to enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or
other similar documents establishing an
agreement with the industrial user respon-
sible for the noncompliance. Such orders
will include compliance schedules, stipu-
lated fines or remedial actions, and signa-
tures of the city manager and industry
representatives. Consent orders shall have
the same force and effect as administra-
tive orders issued pursuant to subsection
(4) of this section.
(3) Show cause order. The city manager may
order any user, which causes or contrib-
utes to violation of this division, discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, to show
UTILITIES § 40-162
CD40:31
cause why a proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the
meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on
any principal executive, general partner
or corporate officer. Whether or not a duly
notified industrial user appears as no-
ticed, enforcement action may be pursued
as appropriate.
(4) Administrative compliance order. When
the city finds that an industrial user has
violated or continues to violate this divi-
sion or a discharge permit or order issued
thereunder, the city manager or his agent
may issue an administrative order to the
industrial user responsible for the dis-
charge, directing that, following a speci-
fied time period, sewer service shall be
discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appur-
tenances have been installed and are prop-
erly operated, and compliance is achieved.
Orders may also contain such other re-
quirements as might be reasonably neces-
sary and appropriate to address the non-
compliance, including the installation of
pretreatment technology, additional self-
monitoring, and management practices.
(5) Cease and desist orders. When the city
manager finds that an industrial user has
violated or continues to violate this divi-
sion or any permit or order issued here-
under, the city manager may issue an
order to cease and desist all illegal or
authorized discharges immediately.
a. In an emergency, the order to cease
and desist may be given by tele-
phone.
b. In nonemergency situations, the cease
and desist order may be used to
suspend or permanently revoke in-
dustrial wastewater discharge per-
mits.
c. The cease and desist order may or-
der the industrial user to take such
appropriate remedial or preventive
action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened
violation, including halting opera-
tions and terminating the discharge.
(6) Administrative fines.Notwithstanding any
other section of this division, any user
who is found to have violated any provi-
sion of this division, or permits and orders
issued hereunder, may be fined in an
amount not to exceed (the maximum al-
lowable under state law, e.g., $1,000.00)
per violation. Each day on which noncom-
pliance shall occur or continue shall be
deemed a separate and distinct violation.
Such assessments may be added to the
user's next scheduled sewer service charge
and the city shall have such other collec-
tion remedies as it has to collect other
service charges. Unpaid charges, fines,
and penalties shall constitute a lien against
the individual user's property. Industrial
users desiring to dispute such fines must
file a request for the city to reconsider the
fine within ten days of being notified of
the fine. Where the city believes a request
has merit, it shall convene a hearing on
the matter within 15 days of receiving the
request from the industrial user.
(7) Emergency suspensions.
a. The city may suspend the wastewa-
ter treatment service and/or waste-
water discharge permit of an indus-
trial user whenever such suspension
is necessary in order to stop an ac-
tual or threatened discharge present-
ing or causing an imminent or sub-
stantial endangerment to the health
or welfare of persons, the POTW or
the environment.
b. Any user notified of a suspension of
the wastewater treatment service
and/or the wastewater discharge per-
mit shall immediately stop or elimi-
nate its contribution. In the event of
a user's failure to immediately com-
ply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the city shall take steps as
deemed necessary, including imme-
§ 40-162 PORTLAND CODE
CD40:32
diate severance of the sewer connec-
tion, to prevent or minimize damage
to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The
city shall allow the user to continue
its discharge when the endanger-
ment has passed, unless the termi-
nation proceedings set forth in sub-
section (8) of this section are initiated
against the user.
c. An industrial user which is respon-
sible, in whole or in part, for immi-
nent endangerment shall submit a
detailed written statement to the
city describing the causes of the harm-
ful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occur-
rence. This statement shall be sub-
mitted to the city within five days of
becoming aware of the harmful con-
tribution.
(8) Termination of discharge permit. Signifi-
cant industrial users proposing to dis-
charge to the POTW, must first obtain a
wastewater discharge permit from the
city. Any user who violates the following
conditions of this division or a wastewater
discharge permit or order, or any applica-
ble or state and federal law, is subject to
permit termination:
a. Violation of permit conditions;
b. Failure to accurately report thewaste-
water constituents and characteris-
tics of its discharge;
c. Failure to report significant changes
in operations or wastewater constit-
uents and characteristics; or
d. Refusal of reasonable access to the
user's premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring or sampling.
Noncompliant Industrial users will be no-
tified of the proposed termination of their
wastewater discharge permit and be of-
fered an opportunity to show cause under
subsection (3) of this section why the
proposed action should not be taken.
(9) Annual publication of industrial users in
significant noncompliance. The city shall
publish, at least annually in the Review
and Observer and Sentinel Standard news-
papers, a description of those industrial
users which are found to be in significant
noncompliance, as defined in section 40-
121, with any provisions of this division or
any permit or order issued hereunder

If any user discharges sewage, industrialwastes,
or other wastes in the city's wastewater collection
system contrary to the provisions of this division
or any order or permit issued hereunder, the city,
through the city attorney, may commence an
action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief
in the county circuit court.
(1) Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has
violated or continues to violate the provi-
sions of this division or permit or order
issued hereunder, the city may petition
the court for the issuance of a preliminary
or permanent injunction or both (as may
be appropriate) which restrains or com-
pels the activities on the part of the user.

curred by the city per violation per
day for as long as the violation con-
tinues. In addition to the above de-
scribed penalty and damages, the
citymay recover reasonable attorney's
fees, court costs, and other expenses
associated with the enforcement ac-
tivities, including sampling,monitor-
ing and analysis expenses.
UTILITIES § 40-163
CD40:33
b. The city may petition the court to
impose, assess, and recover such
sums. In determining the amount of
liability, the court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances,
including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the viola-
tion, the magnitude and duration,
any economic benefit gained through
the user's violation, corrective ac-
tions by the user, the compliance
history of the user, and any other
factor as justice requires.

Supp. No. 3 CD42:4
ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
Sec. 42-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited
as the "City of Portland Zoning Ordinance."
(Ord. No. 175J, § 1.01, eff. 9-17-2004)
Sec. 42-2. Purpose.
Pursuant to the authority granted to the city
by the Public Acts of the State of Michigan, this
chapter is established for the following purposes:
(1) To promote and protect the public health,
safety, and general welfare;
(2) To protect the character and the stability
of the open space, residential, and nonres-
idential areas within the city and promote
the orderly and beneficial development of
these areas;
(3) To provide adequate light, air, privacy and
convenience of access to property;
(4) To regulate the intensity of use of land
and lot areas and determine the area of
open spaces surrounding buildings and
structures necessary to provide adequate
light and air and to protect the public
health;
(5) To lessen and avoid congestion on the
public highways and streets;
(6) To prevent the overcrowding of land and
undue concentration of buildings and struc-
tures, so far as possible and appropriate,
in each zoning district, by regulating the
use and bulk of buildings in relation to
the land surrounding them; and
(7) To conserve the expenditure of funds for
public improvements and services.
(Ord. No. 175J, § 1.02, eff. 9-17-2004)
Sec. 42-3. Legislative intent.
Zoning districts in this chapter each have a
deemed purpose and are based on the city master
plan. The districts are sized to be adequate to
accommodate longterm needs, and yet must be
monitored relative to any necessary changes and
updated as time passes. While the regulations
limit the use of properties, this chapter is in-
tended to provide landowners with a range of
choices, flexibility, and options for development.
(Ord. No. 175J, § 1.03, eff. 9-17-2004)
Sec. 42-4. Scope.
(a) Except as otherwise provided for in this
chapter, every building and structure erected;
every use of any lot, building, or structure estab-
lished; every structural alteration or relocation of
an existing building or structure; and every en-
largement of, or addition to, an existing use,
building and structure occurring after the effec-
tive date of the ordinance from which this chapter
is derived, shall be subject to this chapter.
(b) In its interpretation and application, the
provisions of this chapter shall be held to be
minimum requirements adopted for the promo-
tion of the public health, safety, comfort, conve-
nience, or general welfare. It is not intended by
this chapter to impair or interfere with any other
existing provision of law or ordinance. However,
where this chapter imposes a greater restriction
than is required by existing ordinance or by rules,
regulations, or permits, the provisions of this
chapter shall control.
(c) Except as otherwise noted in this chapter,
nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted or
construed to give rise to any permanent vested
rights in the continuation of any particular use,
district, zoning classification, or any permissible
activities therein; and all rights are hereby de-
clared to be subject to such subsequent amend-
ment, change or modification hereof as may be
necessary for the preservation or protection of
public health, safety, and welfare.
(d) The right to continue a land use or activity
or construct a building or structure which is
either permitted by this chapter or established as
a nonconformity shall be vested with the property
rather than the owner. No rights shall be termi-
nated for reasons of transfer of ownership. The
right to continue a land use or activity shall
transfer automatically upon the conveyance of the
property unless terminated pursuant to section
42-306.
ZONING § 42-4
CD42:5
(e) All land development specifically listed as a
permitted use in the table of uses for the districts
contained in this chapter shall be allowed when
determined to be in accordance with all provisions
of this chapter and all other applicable laws,
regulations or ordinances having jurisdiction over
the proposed use of land. Where not specifically
permitted, uses are listed as not permitted, un-
less construed to be similar to a use as expressly
determined by the zoning administrator.

der the heading of "Special Land Use" in the table
of uses for the districts contained in this chapter
shall be conducted in accordance with the require-
ments of article V of this chapter.

lows:

not specifically mentioned in this chapter
shall be classified by the zoning adminis-
trator. The zoning administrator shall clas-
sify the use only if he finds that the use is
similar in character to the uses listed in
this chapter.
(2) If the use is determined not to be similar
to any uses in this chapter, the applicant
may then make application to the plan-
ning commission for consideration of an
amendment to this chapter to include the
proposed use in one or more of the zoning
districts of this chapter, either as a per-
mitted use or a special land use.

The following definitions and rules of construc-
tion shall apply to this chapter and when used in

them in this section, except where the context
clearly indicates a different meaning:
(1) The particular shall control the general.
For terms used in this chapter the use of
a general term shall not be taken to be the
same as the use of any other specific term.
For example, a "truck stop," as used in
this chapter, shall not be interpreted to be
the same as a "vehicle service" establish-
ment since each is listed as a separate
and distinct use.
(2) In case of any difference of meaning or
implication between the text of this chap-
ter and any caption or illustration, the
text shall control.
(3) A building or structure includes any part
thereof.
(4) The phrase "used for" includes "arranged
for," "designed for," "intended for," "main-
tained for" and "occupied for."

contrary, where a regulation involves two
or more items, conditions, provisions or
events connected by the conjunctions "and,"

be interpreted as allows:
a. "And" indicates that the connected
items, conditions, provisions or events
apply.
b. "Or" indicates that the connected
items, conditions, provisions or events
may apply singly or in any combina-
tion.
c. "Either...or" indicates that the con-
nected items, conditions, provisions
or events apply singly but not in
combination.

pendence Day), Labor Day, Thanksgiving
or Christmas is officially celebrated or
any other holiday recognized by the city.

have the meaning customarily assigned to
them.

appointed by the council. Each member shall hold
office for a three-year term. One member may be
a member of the planning commission and one
member may be a member of the city council who
each shall serve for the same terms as provided
on the commission or council, as applicable. A

nate members for the same term as regu-
lar members of the board.

est.
(3) The alternate member having been called
shall serve on the board until a final
decision is made on the application for

ZONING § 42-70
CD42:25
Sec. 42-71. Jurisdiction, powers, and du-
ties.
(a) Appeals.
(1) An appeal may be taken from any person
or any governmental department affected
or aggrieved, and review any order, re-
quirement, decision or determinationwhere
it is alleged by the appellant that there is
error or misinterpretation in any order,
requirement, decision, grant or refusal
made by the zoning administrator or other
administrative official or body charged
with the enforcement of any article of this
chapter.
(2) An appeal shall be taken and filed with
the board within 14 days of the decision
being appealed. The filing shall specify
the grounds of the appeal. The appeal
shall be transmitted to the board together
with all the papers constituting the record
upon which the action being appealed is
taken.
(3) An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from
unless the zoning administrator certifies
to the board, after notice of appeal has
been filed, that, by reason of the facts
stated in the certificate, a stay would
cause imminent peril to life or property.
In such case, the proceedings shall not be
stayed other than by a restraining order,
whichmay be granted by a court of record.
(4) The board shall select a reasonable time
and place for hearing the appeal, give due
notice thereof to the parties, and render a
decision on the appeal without unreason-
able delay. A person may appear and tes-
tify at the hearing, whether in person or
by duly authorized agent or attorney.
(5) In deciding the appeal, the board shall be
limited to determining whether or not the
decision that was made was done so using
the proper standards and guidelines in
this chapter. The decision of the board is
limited to the information that was avail-
able to the administrative official or body
who made the decision initially. Addi-
tional testimony is not appropriate.
(6) If a determination is made that the ad-
ministrative official or body making the
decision did so improperly, the board may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify, the order, requirement, decision
or determination appealed from, and may
make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made, and to
that end shall have all the powers of the
administrative official or body from whom
the appeal was taken.
(7) The board may hear and decide appeals
from the decisions of the zoning adminis-
trator pertaining to interpretations of the
zoning map to determine the precise loca-
tion of boundary lines between zoning
districts. In making its determination of
the boundary lines, the board shall be
governed by the rules of this section and
the provisions of section 42-105.
(b) Variances. The board, after public hearing
shall have the power to decide applications for
variances filed as provided in this article.
(1) Nonuse variance. A nonuse variance may
be allowed by the zoning board of appeals
only in cases where there is evidence of
practical difficulty in the official record of
the hearing and that all of the following
conditions are met:
a. That there are exceptional or extraor-
dinary circumstances or conditions
applying to the property that do not
apply generally to other properties
in the same zoning district. Excep-
tional or extraordinary circumstances
or conditions may include:
1. Exceptional narrowness, shal-
lowness or shape of a specific
property on the effective date of
the ordinance from which this
chapter is derived or amend-
ment;
2. By reason of exceptional topo-
graphic or environmental con-
§ 42-71 PORTLAND CODE
CD42:26
ditions or other extraordinary
situation on the land, building
or structure; or
3. By reason of the use or devel-
opment of the property imme-
diately adjoining the property
in question.
b. That the variance is necessary for
the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right similar to
that possessed by other properties in
the same zoning district and in the
vicinity. The possibility that compli-
ance with this chapter may prove to
be more expensive or otherwise in-
convenient shall not be part of the
consideration of the board.
c. The variance will not be detrimental
to adjacent property and the sur-
rounding neighborhood.
d. The variance will not materially im-
pair the intent and purpose of this
chapter or the provision from which
the variance is requested.
e. That the immediate practical diffi-
culty causing the need for the vari-
ance request was not created by the
applicant.
(2) Use variances. Use variances are prohib-
ited.
(3) Planning commission, opinion. Prior to
reaching a decision on a request for a use
variance, the zoning board of appeals may
request that the planning commission,
upon presentation of the application by
the applicant, forward an opinion to the
zoning board of appeals. If the opinion is
requested, it shall be limited to the plan-
ning commission's review of the effect of
the proposal on the existing or intended
character of the neighborhood and the
ability of the property owner to use the
property for a use already permitted un-
der the existing zoning classification. The
opinion of the planning commission shall
be advisory only.
(c) Interpretations.
(1) Text. The board may hear and decide upon
requests for the interpretation of the pro-
visions of this chapter.
a. Text interpretations shall be narrow
and address only the situation to be
interpreted, be based on a thorough
reading of this chapter, and not have
the effect of amending this chapter.
b. Interpretations shall give weight to
practical interpretations by the zon-
ing administrator and other admin-
istrative officials if applied consis-
tently over a long period of time.
c. Records shall be kept of all interpre-
tations.
d. Where the intent of this chapter is
unclear and the facts cannot be read
to support only one interpretation,
the benefit of doubt shall go to the
property owner.
(2) Zoning map. Where due to the scale, lack
of detail, illegibility, or physical or natural
features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the zoning
map, or in other circumstances not cov-
ered by section 42-105, the zoning board
of appeals, upon written application or
upon its own motion, shall interpret the
district boundaries.
(3) Generally. Nothing contained in this sec-
tion shall be construed to give or grant to
the board the power or authority to alter
or change this chapter or the zoning map.
(Ord. No. 175J, § 14.03, eff. 9-17-2004; Ord. No.
175R, § 5, eff. 1-18-2007)
Sec. 42-72. Public hearings, voting, and de-
cisions.
(a) Hearings. Upon receipt of a written request
seeking an interpretation of the zoning ordinance
or an appeal of an administrative decision, a
notice stating the time, date, and place of the
public hearing shall be published in a newspaper
of general circulation within the city and shall be
sent to the person requesting the interpretation
not less than 15 days before the public hearing. In
ZONING § 42-72
CD42:27
addition, if the request for an interpretation or
appeal of an administrative decision involves a
specific parcel, written notice stating the nature
of the interpretation request and the time, date,
and place of the public hearing on the interpreta-
tion request shall be sent by first class mail or
personal delivery to all persons to whom real
property is assessed within 300 feet of the bound-
ary of the property in question and to the occu-
pants of all structures within 300 feet of the
boundary of the property in question. If a tenant's
name is not known, the term "occupant" may be
used.
(b) Voting requirements. Except for administra-
tive matters, such as approval of minutes, the
concurring vote of at least three members of the
board is necessary to decide any matter upon
which the board is authorized by this article to
render a decision, except that the concurring vote
of at least four members of the board is necessary
to grant a use variance as permitted in this
article.
(c) Decisions.
(1) In making any decision provided for in
this article, the board may attach thereto
such conditions regarding the location,
character and other features of the appli-
cation as it may deem reasonable in fur-
therance of the intent and spirit of this
chapter and the protection of the public
interest or as otherwise permitted by law.
(2) Any decision of the board shall not be-
come final until minutes of the meeting at
which final action on the request was
taken are officially approved and adopted
by the board, unless the board shall find
the immediate effect of such order is nec-
essary for the preservation of property or
personal rights and shall so certify on the
record.
(3) The decision of the board shall be final;
however, any person having an interest
affected by any such decision shall have
the right of appeal to the circuit court on
questions of law and fact.
(4) Time limitations on variances:
a. Any approval given by the board
under which the premises are not
used or work is not started within
one year, or when the use or work
has been abandoned for a period of
six months, shall lapse and cease to
be in effect.
b. The holder of the variance may, at no
cost, request up to one three month
extension of the variance from the
zoning board of appeals, if applied
for in writing prior to the expiration
of the variance approval.
c. The zoning board of appeals may
only grant an extension when the
original circumstances authorizing
the variance have not changed and
that the circumstances creating the
need for the extension were beyond
the control of the applicant.
(5) No application which has been denied
wholly or in part by the board shall be
resubmitted for a period of one year from
the date of the last denial, unless permit-
ted by the zoning administrator after a
demonstration by the applicant of a sub-
stantial change of circumstances from the
previous application.

property in the city.
(Ord. No. 175J, § 4.02, eff. 9-17-2004)
Sec. 42-105. Interpretation of district bound-
aries.
If because of the scale, lack of details, or
illegibility of the official zoning map, there is any
uncertainty, contradiction, or conflict regarding
the intended location of any district boundaries
shown on the map, interpretation concerning the
exact location of district boundary lines shall be
determined by the zoning board of appeals upon
written application. In arriving at a decision, the
board shall apply the following standards:
(1) The boundaries of zoning districts are
intended to follow centerlines of alleys,
streets, other rights-of-way, or lot lines, or
to be parallel or perpendicular thereto,
unless the district boundary lines are
otherwise clearly indicated on the official
zoning map;
(2) Where district boundaries are indicated
to approximately follow lot of record lines,
those lines shall be construed to be bound-
aries;
(3) Unless shown by dimension on the official
zoning map, where a district boundary
divides a lot of record the location of the
boundary shall be determined by use of
the scale shown on the map;
(4) Where district boundaries are indicated
as approximately following city limits,
they shall be construed as following the
city limits;
(5) Aboundary indicated as following a shore-
line shall be construed as following that
shoreline, and in the event of a naturally
occurring change in a shoreline, the bound-
ary shall be construed as following the
actual shoreline. A boundary indicated as
following the centerline of a stream, river,
or other body of water shall be construed
as following that centerline;
(6) If a district boundary is indicated as being
parallel to, or an extension of a feature
described in this section it shall be so
construed; and
(7) Where physical or natural features exist-
ing on the ground do not coincide with
those shown on the official zoning map or
in other circumstances not covered in this
section the zoning board of appeals shall
determine the district boundaries.

Sec. 42-106. Zoning of vacated areas.
If a street, alley or other public right-of-way
within the city is vacated by official governmental
action and if the lands within the boundaries
thereof attach to and become part of lands adjoin-
ing the street, alley or public right-of-way, the
lands involved shall automatically acquire and be

CD42:29
subject to the same zoning regulations applicable
to adjoining lands, and shall be governed by this
chapter.

the created land shall automatically and without
further governmental action acquire and be sub-
ject to the same zoning regulations applicable for
lands to which the land attaches or is adjacent;
and the created land shall be used for those
purposes as are permitted under this chapter for
the adjoining lands.

DIVISION 4. C-1, C-2, C-3 and C-4
COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS
Sec. 42-184. Intent and purpose.
(a) The C-1 business district is intended to
support a traditional downtown main-street at-
mosphere. District uses are intended to be primar-
ily specialty retail uses with complementary, small-
scale service businesses. The C-1 central business
commercial district is intended to promote the
consolidation of commercial activities in the ex-
isting town center by providing for a variety of
retail, office, restaurant and entertainment activ-
ities within the district. The purpose of this
district is to encourage and promote the business
use of existing residential buildings within the
district and the development and expansion of the
town center to serve the needs of the surrounding
area. The central business area of the city is
viewed as the older, traditional center of the city,
and is characterized by smaller lot sizes, more
intense land uses, mixed land uses and higher
percentages of lot coverage. This area permits the
integration of business activity, governmental func-
tions, services and residential land uses.
(b) The C-2, general business commercial dis-
trict is intended primarily for uses emphasizing
community shopping needs for the citizens of the
city which are of a higher intensity than those
found in a traditional downtown. Screening, land-
scaping and site design will be strongly consid-
ered when sites are developed to ensure they
mesh well with adjacent residential uses.
(c) The C-3 commercial district is intended to
serve as a convenience center for the traveling
public. Managing access to individual properties
will receive strong consideration during the re-
view of individual sites, especially along the Grand
River Corridor. The use of combined drives, ser-
vice drives, and well planned access points will be
stressed. Efforts will be made to discourage the
placement of loading areas, outside storage and
other unattractive features in areas clearly visi-
ble from the roadway or from neighboring resi-
dential uses. The C-3 district is further intended
to provide for uses, which, due to either size or
nature, are not well suited for locations within the
C-1 or C-2 districts.
(d) The C-4 Grand RiverAvenue Corridor Over-
lay District is intended as an overlay district to
establish development standards along the Grand
River Avenue corridor east of Cutler Road that
are consistent with the city's vision for the devel-
opment of a large tract of vacant city property and
the existing uses in the area. Managing access to
individual properties along this corridor will be a
strong consideration during the review of individ-
ual sites. The use of combined drives, service
drives, and well planned access points will be
stressed. To preserve community identity and be
a good neighbor to existing residential uses, the
city will make efforts to discourage the placement
of loading areas, dumpsters and other unattract-
ive features in areas clearly visible from the
highway or adjacent roadway or from neighboring
residential uses.

DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS*
Sec. 42-211. Description and intent.
(a) The intent of this article is to permit the
coordinated development on larger sites in order
to achieve the following:
(1) Permit flexibility in the regulation of
land development allowing for higher
quality of design through innovation in
land use, variety in design, layout, and
type of structures constructed;
(2) Provide the opportunity to mix compat-
ible uses or residential types;
(3) Allow clustering of residential units to
preserve common open space, traditional
neighborhood design, historic or
significant architectural features;
(4) Ensure compatibility of design and func-
tion between neighboring properties;
(5) Protect and preserve natural resources,
natural features and open space;
(6) Promote efficient provision of public
services, utilities and transportation facili-
ties;
(7) Provide convenient vehicular access
throughout the development andminimiz-
ing adverse traffic impacts;
(8) Provide complete nonmotorized circula-
tion to, from and within developments;
(9) Provide adequate housing and employ-
ment;
(10) Encourage development of convenient
recreational facilities as an integral part
of residential developments;
(11) Ensure various land uses and building
bulk will relate to each other and to
adjoining existing and planned uses in
*State law reference—Planned unit development, MCL
125.3503.
ZONING § 42-211
Supp. No. 2 CD42:44.1
such a way that they will be compatible,
with no material adverse impact of one
use on another;
(12) Encourage development that is consistent
with the goals stated within the city
master plan; and
(13) Eliminate or reduce the degree of
nonconforming sites, uses or structures.
(b) These planned unit development regula-
tions are not intended to be used for circumvent-
ing the more specific standards and requirements
of this chapter, or the planning upon which they
are based. Rather, these provisions are intended
to result in development that is substantially
consistent with the zoning requirements as gener-
ally applied to the proposed uses, but with
specific modifications that, in the judgment of
the city, assure a superior quality of develop-
ment. If this improved quality is not clearly
apparent upon city review, a site shall not qualify
for the modifications allowable under this article.
(Ord. No. 175J, § 8.01, eff. 9-17-2004)
Sec. 42-212. Eligibility criteria.
To be eligible for planned unit development
approval, the applicant must demonstrate that
each of the following criteria will be met:
(1) Demonstrated benefit. The PUD shall
provide one or more of the following
benefits not possible under the require-
ments of another zoning district:
a. Preservation of significant natural
or historic features;
b. A complementary mixture of uses or
a variety of housing types;
c. Common open space for passive or
active recreational use; or
d. Redevelopment of a nonconforming
site where creative design can
address unique site constraints.
(2) Unified control of property. The proposed
development shall be under single owner-
ship or control such that there is a single
entity having responsibility for complet-
ing the project in conformity with the
planned unit development regulations.

through design that foster increased in-
teraction between residents; and to mini-
mize traffic congestion, suburban sprawl,
infrastructure costs, and environmental
degradation within the city.
(2) Adaptation. The TND provisions adapt
urban conventions, normal in the United
States from colonial times until the post-
World War II era, that were historically
based on the following design principles:
a. Neighborhoods have identifiable cen-
ters and edges;
b. Edge lots are readily accessible to
retail and public spaces by
nonvehicular means;
c. Uses and housing types are mixed
and in close proximity to one an-
other;
d. Street networks are interconnected
and blocks are small; and
e. Public spaces are given prominent
sites throughout the neighborhood.
(b) Permitted densities; total number of dwelling
units. Maximum permitted densities and total
number of dwelling units shall be established
during the PUD review process but shall be
generally consistent with the master plan.
(c) General use and design standards and requirements.
(1) Included. A TND PUD may include a
mixture of permitted uses and special
land uses from all residential districts
and the central business district meeting
the following requirements:
a. The entire land area of the TND
PUD shall be divided into blocks,
streets, and lots, open space, and
optional natural or buffer strip ar-
eas;
b. Aminimum of 60 percent of the PUD
land area shall be occupied by resi-
dential uses. The list of uses allowed
shall be established in the PUD ap-
proval;
c. A minimum of 15 percent and a
maximum of 30 percent of the resi-
§ 42-214 PORTLAND CODE
CD42:46
dential uses shall be multiple-family
structures or upper story apart-
ments;
d. A minimum of 20 percent and a
maximum of 40 percent of the resi-

appropriate lot dimensions and building and yard
requirements. In no case, however, shall the over-
all lot dimensions or yard requirements be less
than 50 percent of the zoning district that the use
would be placed in without a PUD. The height
restrictions with any use shall not be increased by
more than 25 percent. The applicant shall dem-
onstrate that the proposed lot dimensions and
building and yard requirements shall result in a
higher quality of development than would be
possible using conventional zoning standards.
(c) Open space. At least 15 percent of the site

(2) Main access points shall be spaced from
existing signalized intersections to ensure
proper spacing and efficient flow of traffic
if the main access point might be signal-
ized in the future.
(3) The site design shall direct traffic flow to
use the main access points. Stacking or
queuing depth at site access points shall
be sufficient to accommodate expected peak
hour volumes without conflict to inbound
or internal circulation. Interior drives shall
provide circulation between uses.
(4) Additional right-of-way shall be provided
to accommodate improvements to the ex-
isting arterial roadway system that are
planned or required to mitigate traffic
associated with the PUD.
(e) Pedestrian accommodations. Pedestrian
gathering and seating plazas, greenways and tree
lined drives shall be within parking lots and

Sec. 42-218. Industrial PUD (IPUD).
(a) Uses. Industrial district permitted uses and
special land uses shall be allowed in an industrial
PUD. Special land uses provided for in section
42-245 shall follow the review process required
for special land uses. In addition, lodging, restau-
rants or entertainment related uses shall be per-
mitted; provided, these uses do not border any
other zoning district.
(b) Dimensional standards. All buildings, struc-
tures, accessory structures and parking areas
shall meet the minimum setback standards of the
industrial district for the perimeter of the PUD.
On interior lots, dimensions standards, setbacks
and building height shall be approved by the city
council, upon recommendation by the planning
commission, through the PUD approval. In no
case, however, shall the overall lot dimensions or
yard requirements be less than 40 percent of the
zoning district that the use would be placed in
without a PUD. The height restrictions with any
use shall not be increased by more than 30
percent.
(c) Buffer strip. There shall be a 50-foot deep
buffer strip along exterior public roads and any
adjoining residential district, either landscaped
or preserved in a natural wooded condition. The
public road buffer strip may be reduced in depth
by the planning commission if the applicant pro-
vides additional landscaping. The residential dis-
trict buffer may be reduced by the planning
commission if the applicant provides a minimum
of a five-foot masonry wall.
(d) Design standards. Buildings shall utilize
high quality architecture and landscaping that
create a research and office-park environment

with primary use of masonry material, such as
brick, stone or split face block, and glass on
buildings and landscaping along internal road-
ways and around the perimeter of the PUD. Metal
paneling and plain concrete masonry units (ce-
ment board) shall constitute no more than 25
percent of the facades of buildings visible from the
internal roadway or any adjoining public road-
way.
(Ord. No. 175J, § 8.08, eff. 9-17-2004)
Sec. 42-219. Open space requirements for all
PUDS.
All PUDs, in addition to the above require-
ments for specific types, shall meet the following
requirements, unless other, more restrictive re-
quirements are noted in the individual PUD dis-
trict, in which case the more restrictive require-
ment shall apply.
(1) Common open space. All land within a
development that is not devoted to a prin-
cipal or accessory use or road right-of-way
shall be set aside as common land for
neighborhood use, recreation, or conser-
vation.
(2) Areas not considered open space. The fol-

space shall forever remain open space,
subject only to uses on the approved site
plan. Further use of open space for other
than recreation or conservation purposes,
except for easements for utilities, shall be
strictly prohibited. Any change in use of
the open space from what is shown on the
approved site plan shall require city coun-
cil approval, and shall not diminish com-
pliance with the requirements of this ar-
ticle.
(7) Recreational or conservational use. Noth-
ing herein shall prevent the conveyance of
open space to a public agency or other
nonprofit entity for recreational or conser-
vation use.
(8) Requirements for maintenance. Require-
ments for maintenance of the open space
shall be provided. In the event that the
open space is not adequately maintained,
or is determined by the city manager to be
a public nuisance, the costs for mainte-
nance shall be assessed upon the owners
of the open space.

ted for that purpose. The city may require
conveyances or other documents to accom-
plish this;
(4) Satisfactory provisions to provide for the
future financing of any improvements
shown on the plan for site improvements,
open space areas and common areas which
are to be included within the development
and that maintenance of such improve-
ments is assured by a means satisfactory
to the city attorney. The city council may

(3) Each final site plan submission shall in-
clude a map illustrating the site or phase
in relation to previously approved plans
and the overall PUD; and
(4) Except as noted in section 42-224, any
amendment requested to the agreement
approved by the city council shall be sub-
mitted for review by the city attorney and
approved by the city council.
(Ord. No. 175J, § 8.12, eff. 9-17-2004)
Sec. 42-223. Extensions.
The two year period for preliminary PUD ap-
proval may be extended for one year, if applied for
in writing by the petitioner prior to the expiration
of the PUD preliminary plan approval, and granted
by the city council; provided, that the reasons for
the delay are beyond the general control of the
applicant.
(Ord. No. 175J, § 8.13, eff. 9-17-2004)
Sec. 42-224. Revisions to approved PUD
plans.
(a) Approval. Approval of the preliminary PUD
plan and final site plans confers upon the zoning
administrator the authority to approve certain
minor deviations when an applicant or landowner
who was granted site plan approval notifies the
zoning administrator of the proposed amendment
to the approved site plan in writing, accompanied
by a site plan illustrating the proposed change.
The request shall be received prior to initiation of
any construction in conflict with the approved
plan.
(b) Procedure. Within 14 days of receipt of a
request to amend the site plan, the zoning admin-
istrator shall determine whether the change is
major, warranting review by the planning com-
mission, or minor, allowing administrative ap-
proval, as noted in subsection (c) of this section.
(c) Minor changes. The zoning administrator
may approve the proposed revision upon finding
the change would not alter the approved design or
provisions of the agreement, would not reduce the
area devoted to open space, and all applicable
regulations of this chapter will be met. The zoning
administrator shall inform the planning commis-
sion and city council of the approval in writing.
(d) Determination considerations. The zoning
administrator shall consider the following when
determining a change to be minor:
(1) For residential buildings, the square foot-
age of structures may be reduced or in-
creased by three percent of the originally
approved area; provided, the overall den-
sity of units does not increase, the mini-
mum square footage and parking require-
ments are met, and the buildings do not
extend into any required open space or
required setback;
(2) Gross floor area of nonresidential build-
ings may be decreased; or increased by up
to three percent or 2,000 square feet,
whichever is smaller, of the originally
approved area; provided, parking require-
ments are met and the building does not
extend into any required open space or
required setback;
(3) Floor plans may be changed if consistent
with the character of the use;
(4) Relocation of a building by up to five feet,
if consistent with required setbacks, open
space and other requirements;
(5) Height of buildings may be lowered;
(6) Designated woodlands or areas not to be
disturbed may be increased;
(7) Plantings on the approved landscape plan
may be replaced by similar types of land-
scaping on an equal or greater basis; any
trees shown as preserved on the final site
plan and subsequently lost during con-
struction shall be replaced on a caliper-
per-caliper basis on the site;
(8) Improvements or slight relocation of site
access or circulation, such as inclusion of
§ 42-222 PORTLAND CODE
CD42:56
deceleration lanes, boulevards, curbing
or pedestrian/bicycle paths, where
appropriate;
(9) Changes of building materials to another
of higher quality, or a slight change in
the color of the exterior material, as
determined by the building official;
(10) Grade change of up to one foot, after
review by the city engineer;
(11) Modification of entry design, sign place-
ment or reduction in size of signs, which
is consistent with the intent of the
approved PUD plan;
(12) Internal rearrangement of parking lots
which does not affect the number of
parking spaces or alter access locations
or design;
(13) Changes to the location of accessory build-
ings and structures, when the new loca-
tion will be consistent with the building
envelope identified on the approved plan;
and
(14) Changes required or requested by the
city, county or state for safety reasons.
(e) Major changes. Where the zoning
administrator determines that a requested amend-
ment to the approved site plan is major, resub-
mittal to the planning commission shall be
required. Should the planning commission
determine that the modifications are inconsistent
with the approved preliminary PUD plan, a
revised preliminary PUD site plan shall be submit-
ted according to the procedures outlined in this
article. In all cases, a change in use to a more
intensive use than approved in the preliminary
PUD plan shall be considered major and require
resubmission of a new preliminary PUD plan.
(f) Limitations on variances from zoning board
of appeals. Decisions granting PUD approval or
any regulatory modifications are not subject to
variance approval of the zoning board of appeals.
No part of a PUD may be appealed to the zoning
board of appeals nor shall an application for
variance be accepted. This provision shall not
preclude an individual lot owner from seeking a
variance following final approval of the PUD;
provided, the variance does not involve altera-
tions to open space areas as shown on the
approved PUD site plan and otherwise meets the
applicable review standards applicable to vari-
ance in this chapter.

DIVISION 7. FP FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT
Sec. 42-271. Intent and purpose.
(a) This district is intended to control the
placement of buildings and structures and the use
of land in areas subject to periodic inundation.
The district is located as designated on the flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) as prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. As the
density of the population of the city increases and
the area develops, the importance of preserving
drainage basins and areas around drainage streams
for their intended purpose becomes acutely obvi-
ous. When the land is developed, a greatly in-
creased amount of water runoff results from the
replacement of open land with streets and build-
ing. The purpose of this district is to preserve
drainage basins in the city and to prevent build-
ing in areas subject to flooding and upon land
which exhibits unstable soil characteristics.
ZONING § 42-271
CD42:61
(b) Flood hazard areas shall be treated as a
residential overlay district, which shall:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dan-
gerous to health, safety, and property due
to water or erosion, or in flood heights or
velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods,
including facilities, which serve such uses,
be protected against flood damage at the
time of initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural
floodplains, stream channels, and natural
protective barriers, which are involved in
the accommodation of floodwaters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other
development which may increase erosion
or flood damage; and
(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of
flood barriers which will unnaturally di-
vert floodwaters or which may increase
flood hazards to other lands.

in the area as shown on the FIRM or calculated from other available official data without
material damage to the structure and without material obstruction of the floodplain to
the detriment of other properties. Permissible construction hereunder shall include,
among others, structures in which the lowest habitable floor areas (including basement
floors, mobile home floors and attached garage floor, but excluding detached garages or
storage buildings when constructed and designed in a floodproof manner) is above docu-
mented base 100-year flood elevation.

(b) This article shall apply to all land, which is
depicted on the flood hazard boundary map/flood
insurance rate map as determine by the Federal
Insurance Administration. Any map amendments
are hereby adopted by reference, as a floodplain
district.
(c) All new construction and substantial im-
provement to structures shall be constructed so
that the lowest floor, including basements, for
residential structures shall comply with section
327 of the Michigan Residential Code or for non-
residential buildings shall comply with section
1612 of the state construction code.
(d) Any new and replacement water systems
and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the system and discharge from the system
into floodwaters. On-site waste disposal systems
are to be located to avoid impairment to them, or
contamination from them during flooding.
(e) The degree of flood protection required by
this division is considered reasonable for regula-
tory purposes and is based on scientific and engi-
neering considerations. Larger floods can and will
occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be
increased by manmade or natural causes. This
division shall not create liability on the part of the
city or by any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance of this
division or any administrative decision lawfully
made as a result of administering this division.
(f) When base flood elevation data has not
been provided in accordance with subsection (b) of
this section, then the zoning administrator, shall
obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base
flood elevation date available from a federal,
state, or other source.
(g) Responsibilities of the zoning administra-
tor shall be as follows:
(1) Notify adjacent communities and theMich-
igan Department of Environmental Qual-
ity prior to any alteration or relocation of
watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Federal Insurance Ad-
ministration;
ZONING § 42-273
Supp. No. 1 CD42:63
(2) Obtain necessary engineering analysis to
assure that the flood-carrying capacity
with the altered or relocated portion of
said watercourse is maintained; and
(3) The zoning administrator shall review
the proposed development to assure that
all necessary permits have been received
from those governmental agencies from
which approval is required by federal or
state law, including section 404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act
Amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334.
(h) For the purpose of the determination of
applicable flood insurance risk premium rate, the
zoning administrator shall:
(1) Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean
sea level) of the lowest habitable floor
(including basement) of all new or sub-
stantially improved structures, and deter-
mine whether or not such structures con-
tain a basement;
(2) Obtain from a registered professional en-
gineer or architect, certification that the
floodproofing methods are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, ve-
locities, impact and uplift forces and other
factors associated with the base flood so
that the structure is watertight to the
base flood level; and
(3) Maintain a record of all such information.
(i) Where interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the areas of
special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped bound-
ary and actual field conditions) the zoning admin-
istrator shall make the necessary interpretation
and may consult the city engineer. The person
contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given reasonable opportunity to appeal the inter-
pretation as provided in this chapter.
(j) No new construction, substantial improve-
ments or other development (including fill) shall
be permitted within the zones A1-30 of the city's
flood insurance rate map (FIRM), unless it is
demonstrated to the zoning administrator that
the cumulative effect of the proposed development
will not increase the water surface elevation of
the base flood more than one foot at any point
within the city.
(k) The requirements of the underlying zoning
district shall be applied.
(l) The amount of required off-street parking
spaces for individual uses shall be determined in
accordance with the requirements of the uses
allowed in the underlying zoning district and
shall meet the dimensional requirements of arti-
cle VII of this chapter.

DIVISION 8. O-R OFFICE/RESEARCH
FORM-BASED DISTRICT
Sec. 42-280. Purpose, intent, and applica-
tion.
(a) The propose of the form-based district is to
provide specific regulations to achieve the follow-
ing:
(1) To develop a mixed-use campus-style en-
vironment with buildings that are inte-
grated with the natural environment and
that contain office, research, light indus-
trial, and incidental commercial and re-
tail uses.
(2) To create uses within the district that
complement economic development activ-
ities elsewhere in the city.
(3) To calm and control traffic, by encourag-
ing a more pedestrian-friendly environ-
ment and preventing a clustering of auto-
oriented uses.
(4) To promote the use of green building tech-
nology, long-term community sustain-
ability, and high quality design and ma-
terials.
(5) To establish clear controls on building
form and placement to achieve a unified
theme within the district and frame a
well-defined public realm of human-scale
streets and public spaces that contribute
§ 42-273 PORTLAND CODE
Supp. No. 1 CD42:64
to creating a safe, comfortable, and liv-
able environment in harmony with the
small-town atmosphere of Portland.
(b) Character areas. A form-based code is es-
tablished for land designated on the Zoning Map
for the City of Portland, which is divided into the
following character areas.
(1) CR—Cutler road character area. The Cut-
ler Road area consists of properties with
frontage on Cutler Road, a city controlled
secondary road paralleling Interstate 96.
The intent of this character area is to
provide a welcoming entrance to the dis-
trict from Cutler Road.
(2) GR—Grand river avenue character area.
The Grand River Avenue area consists of
those properties with frontage on Grand
RiverAvenue, a regional thoroughfare con-
trolled by the Ionia County Road Commis-
sion. The intent of this character area is
to manage access to the district from
Grand RiverAvenue and provide safe travel
to and from future development.
(3) CC—Central campus character area. This
character area consists of all property
within the O-R District that are not in the
GR and CR Character Areas. This charac-
ter area is the focal point of the O-R
form-based district. The intent of this
character area is to provide a central
campus or public green, similar to a uni-
versity "quad" or town square. The cam-
pus area is framed by building entrances
with parking and service areas generally
located to the rear of buildings. The area
provides a welcoming and productive en-
vironment for compatible uses, encourag-
ing a lively and economically viable em-
ployment area.
(c) Application of regulations. Within the O-R
form-based district, all requirements of this arti-
cle apply, except as modified by this division. In
applying the regulations to the form-based dis-
trict, if regulations elsewhere within this division
conflict or appear to conflict with the regulations
in this article, the regulations of this article will
apply.
(Ord. No. 175BB, § 1, eff. 1-16-2011)
Sec. 42-281. Definitions.
Campus commons perimeter street. The cam-
pus commons perimeter street provides the bor-
der of the central campus or public green as
described in section 42-280 (b)(3). The campus
commons perimeter street may also connect park-
ing lots and service areas with the primary street
or service streets.
Parking structure. A parking structure is a
multiple level parking facility, either freestand-
ing, accessory to and structurally part of a main
building, or a detached, accessory structure on
the same lot with a main building.
Primary street. The subarea master plan, ad-
opted in 2010, calls for a single major street
through the O-R district connecting Cutler Road
with Grand River Avenue. The primary street
provides the main point of access to properties
within the district because access to Cutler Road
and Grand River Avenue from individual proper-
ties is not permitted.
Required building line. The required building
line is the required location for the setback of a
building. It is a requirement, not a permissive
minimum as in a setback. The required building
line runs parallel to the front property line and
creates an even building façade line on a street. It
is also referred to as "build-to line."
Service street. Service streets provide a second-
ary level of access to properties within the O-R
district. Service streets connect parking lots and
service areas. They may have limited access to
Cutler Road and Grand River Avenue.

(Ord. No. 175BB, § 1, eff. 1-16-2011)
Sec. 42-284. General provisions.
(a) Building Requirements.
(1) Purpose and intent. By regulating the
character of buildings, facades can be
aligned to form a street edge that frames
the public realm. New buildings can be
designed to blend with existing ones to
achieve an office/research park character
for the district, as described in the Port-
land Master Plan.
(2) Roof lines.
a. Variations in roof lines should be
used to add interest and reduce the
scale of large buildings.
b. Roof features must complement the
character of the overall development
and must have one or more of the
following features:
i. Parapet walls (no more than
four feet in height) concealing
flat roofs and rooftop equip-
ment.
ii. Overhanging eaves.
iii. Exposed end gable conditions.
iv. Roof dormers.
v. Changes in roof pitch on differ-
ent sections of the building.
(3) Transparency.
a. At least 50 percent of a building
façade facing a public street must
consist of windows and doors on the
ground floor and at least 25 percent
on all other floors.
b. All buildings must have at least one
useable door facing the front lot line.
(4) Articulation.
a. Blank walls (without windows) lon-
ger than 20 feet must not face a
street.
b. Building facades should have mass-
ing changes and architectural artic-
ulation to provide visual interest and
texture in order to avoid oversimpli-
fied one-dimensional facades. Blank
walls may be no longer than 40 feet.
c. Architectural design elements may
include strong cornice lines, mate-
rial texture, punched window open-
ings, prominent corner features,
strong and simplified building en-
tries, window sills, lintels, over-
hangs, canopies or porticos, arcades,
recesses and projections, arches, out-
door patios, display windows, and
integral planters, among others.
d. Creative and unique building design
is highly encouraged.
(5) Materials.
a. All buildings must be clad in durable
and maintainable materials includ-
ing brick, decorative masonry, stone,
architectural steel and glass, and
other attractive materials that have
durability, texture, pattern, and de-
tailing, and are attractive even when
viewed up close. Building materials
and colors should be mixed to avoid
monotony and to provide visual in-
terest to the building.
b. The following materials are prohib-
ited for use as cladding:
i. Smooth, unfinished, or
untextured concrete masonry
units or concrete walls
ii. Vinyl or plastic siding
iii. Sheet metal siding
iv. Architectural foam detailing
v. EIFS
vi. Cement board
(6) Projections.
a. Except for eaves, awnings, balco-
nies, bay windows, stoops, and ADA
compliant ramps, as specified by this
division, no part of a building may
encroach into the RBL.
b. Eaves and awnings may not project
more than 2 feet from the main
building wall into the RBL.

Sec. 42-286. Departures, deviations, and variances.
(a) Departures, deviations, and variances from the form-based requirements are considered according to
the requirements of the following table:
(1)Departures. Departures are minor allowances from the
requirements of the form-based district to consider the pres-
ervation of existing natural features or to accommodate exist-
ing grades or other similar site conditions, if necessary. The
City Manager or designee may approve applications with the
following departures from the form-based requirements of the
district.
Building height, up to 5 ft.
Minimum number of parking spaces, up
to 5 percent
Required Building Line, up to 5 percent
Façade Transparency, up to 5 percent
(2)Variances. Variances are requests for
substantial relief from the requirements
of the zoning ordinance. Variances in the
OR Form-Based District follow the pro-
cedures outlined in section 42-71, b.
Siting Requirements Placement of buildings, parking areas,
driveways or projections resulting in an
RBL or setback that is less than or
greater than the above requirements,
unless an administrative departure is
granted.
All minimum lot requirements (area,
width, etc.)
Location of accessory structures

low.
All Others
(Ord. No. 175BB, § 1, eff. 1-16-2011)
Sec. 42-287. Procedures.
(a) Within the form-based district, special land
uses are considered according to the require-
ments and procedures of article V, including any
specific use requirements in section 42-341.Where
the requirements of this article conflict with any
requirements in article V, the requirements of
this article prevail.
(b) Administrative approvals. An administra-
tive approval provides an incentive to applicants
who develop projects or sites within form-based
districts that fully comply with all of the require-
ments of this article, without deviations or vari-
ances, and do not require site plan review or
special land use approval.
(1) The city manager or designee may make
an administrative approval. The cityman-
ager or designee must consult with desig-
nated representatives of other city and
county departments, or others, as deemed
necessary, before making an approval.
(2) Within 30 days of submitting a completed
application, unless a longer period is agreed
to by the applicant in writing, the city
manager or designee must administra-
tively approve the plan or must inform
the applicant in writing as to why the
administrative approval has not been
granted.
ZONING § 42-287
Supp. No. 1 CD42:70.9
(3) Permits for building or site development
may not be submitted or applied for until
administrative approval has been granted.
(4) Decisions by the city manager or designee
may be appealed to the zoning board of
appeals.
(5) The city manager or designee submit a
plan for site plan review even if it is
eligible for administrative approval when
the scale or effect of the project is deemed
significant enough to warrant planning
commission review.
(c) Variances. All variances listed in section
42-286, are considered by the zoning board of
appeals, in accordance with section 42-71 of the
zoning ordinance.
(d) Deviations fromform-based district require-
ments. A development in a form-based district
that does not qualify for administrative approval
requires site plan review.
(1) Site plan review cannot permit a lesser
building or site requirement than that
contained in this ordinance. A request for
a lesser requirement is a variance request
and may only be approved by the zoning
board of appeals per section 42-71 of the
zoning ordinance.
(2) A deviation from requirements not listed
as variances is reviewed under the require-
ments of this subsection.
(3) The planning commission may not change
part of the site plan that meets the devel-
opment requirements of the district or
one that has been properly approved as
an administrative departure.
(4) In determining if a deviation is war-
ranted, the planning commission must
consider the following:
a. Deviations are permitted when an
applicant demonstrates that the re-
sulting design is superior in terms of
compatibility with surrounding struc-
tures or natural features and better
fits the character of the area than
when it conforms to the form-based
requirements.
b. The planning commission may also
allow deviations when the applicant
shows that conformance with the
form-based requirements is imprac-
tical due to existing building or site
layouts on adjacent sites, where the
deviation has no exterior effect or
where the deviation is necessary to
meet other laws or regulations.
c. The deviation must be the least de-
viation necessary to achieve the re-
sults in either subparagraphs a. or
b., above.
d. The planning commission may grant
a lesser deviation than requested.
e. The planning commission may im-
pose conditions on the site plan when
granting a deviation, if necessary to
meet the intent of this article.
(e) Application process. The following chart
depicts the form-based application pro-
cess and the various paths to approval.

trict.
(a) Existing uses, structures, and lots that do
not conform to the requirements of the form-
based district are subject to the regulations of
section 42-306, except as follows:
(1) Any expansion of a nonconforming struc-
ture greater than 25 percent of the gross
floor area of the existing building or any
expansion or renovation greater than 50
percent of the assessed value of the struc-
ture at the time of the expansion requires
the entire structure to meet the require-
ments of the form-based district. For any
expansion, the more restrictive of these
two criteria controls.
(2) In addition, the following apply to any
expansion of a nonconforming structure:
a. Expansion of a nonconforming struc-
ture may be undertaken only one
time per structure without requiring
compliance with the code, regardless
of percentage of area or assessed
value.
b. The assessed value is determined at
the time of the proposed expansion.
c. An expansion on the front of a non-
conforming building does not in-
crease the extent of nonconformity if
the expansion is at the same or less
distance to the required build-to line
as is the existing structure.
d. Façade alterations to existing build-
ings or expansion that comply with
the required build-to line must also
comply with building elements spec-
ifications of this article.
e. Repair and maintenance work are
allowed without regard to subpara-
graph (1), above; such exempt activ-
ities include roof replacement, win-
dow replacement and maintenance,
mechanical and electrical upgrade,
interior fit out (tenant improvement
work), parking resurfacing, and other
minor site work, such as stormwater
improvements, landscaping, and site
amenities.
f. A structure destroyed by any means
by more than 50 percent of its pre-
destruction value may be replaced
only by a structure that conforms to
the requirements of the form-based
district; however, this does not pre-
clude the property owner from seek-
ing variances or deviations as pro-
vided by this article.
g. Parking lots, bicycle facilities, load-
ing areas, landscaping, screening, and
other site improvements are consid-
ered structures for the purposes of
these provisions.

street.
c. The city council, after recommenda-
tion of the planning commission and

the following conditions exists, may
permit the maximum length of the
private street to be exceeded. Upon

cil shall establish the maximum
length of the proposed private street.
1. That topography or other sig-
nificant natural features pre-
clude access to any other public
street or adjoining property on
which a public street may be
constructed. Such significant
natural features shall be clearly
identified and marked on the
proposed private street plans.

exist:
(1) That topography, soils, and/or other sig-
nificant natural features physically pre-
clude or prevent compliance with the re-
quirements of this section without
substantial alteration of such natural fea-
tures. Such natural features shall be clearly
identified and described in the applica-
tion of any such modification;
(2) That the justification of any modification
is not due solely to financial consider-
ations which, upon approval of the re-
quested modification would provide a fi-
nancial benefit;
(3) That no other reasonable private street
design alternatives are available thatwould
comply with the requirements of this sec-
tion; and
(4) That the request for modification was
reviewed by the fire chief, city engineer,

munications facilities in conformance with the
SmallWireless Communication Facilities Deploy-
ment Act, Act No. 365 of the Public Acts of 2018
(the

Act

). In doing so, the City of Portland (the

authority

) wishes to ensure the reasonable and
fair control and management of public rights-of-
way, support new technology, avoid interference
with right-of-way use, and protect the public,
health, safety, and welfare.

Act.
(c) The activities set forth in section 15(5) of
the Act are exempt from zoning review being:
(1) The replacement of a small cell wireless
facility with a small cell wireless facility
that is not larger or heavier, in compli-
ance with applicable codes.
(2) Routine maintenance of a small cell wire-
less facility, utility pole, or wireless sup-
port structure.
(3) The installation, placement,maintenance,
operation, or replacement of a micro
wireless facility that is suspended on
cables strung between utility poles or
wireless support structures in compli-
ance with applicable codes.
(d) A wireless provider may, as a permitted
use not subject to zoning review or approval,
except that an application for a permitted use is
still subject to approval by the authority pursu-
ant to section 15 of the Act, collocate small cell
wireless facilities and construct,maintain,modify,
operate, or replace utility poles in, along, across,
upon, and under the ROW. Such structures and
facilities shall be constructed and maintained so
as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel or
public safety on the ROW or obstruct the legal
use of the authority's ROW or uses of the ROW
by other utilities and communications service
providers. Both of the following apply:
(1) A utility pole in the ROW installed or
modified on or after the effective date of
this act shall not exceed 50 feet above
ground level, unless a taller height is
agreed to by the authority and is subject
to the special land use process.
(2) A small cell wireless facility in the ROW
installed or modified shall not extend
more than five feet above a utility pole or
wireless support structure on which the
small cell wireless facility is collocated.
(e) Per the Act, the authority requires zoning
approval for certain activities that take place
within or outside the public ROW that are not a
permitted use under section 13(5) of the Act and
section 42-318(d) which shall hereby be a special
land use:

used for such small cell wireless facili-
ties.
(f) Applications under section (e) shall be
submitted as required by article V of this chapter.
(g) Along with applicable zoning criteria, the
authority shall not deny an application unless
all of the following apply:
(1) The denial is supported by substantial
evidence contained in a written record
that is publicly released contemporane-
ously.
(2) There is a reasonable basis for the denial.
§ 42-318 PORTLAND CODE
Supp. No. 3 CD42:84
(3) The denial would not discriminate against
the applicant with respect to the place-
ment of the facilities of other wireless
providers.
(h) The review is also subject to the following:
(1) An applicant's business decision on the
type and location of small cell wireless
facilities, wireless support structures, or
technology to be used is presumed to be
reasonable. This presumption does not
apply with respect to the height of wire-
less facilities or wireless support
structures. The authority will consider
the height of such structures in its zoning
review, but shall not discriminate between
the applicant and other communications
service providers.
(2) The authority shall not evaluate or require
an applicant to submit information about
an applicant's business decisions with
respect to any of the following:
a. The need for a wireless support
structure or small cell wireless facili-
ties.

demand for the service, or the qual-
ity of service.
c. Any requirements regarding the
appearance of facilities, including
those relating to materials used or
arranging, screening, or landscap-
ing, shall be reasonable.
Special land use criteria shall be used in the
review of the applications under section (e)
herein. The planning commission may consider
spacing, setback, and fall zones that are
substantially similar to those of other com-
mercial structures. The planning commission
may also consider aesthetics as it relates to the
area of the proposal. The authority shall publish
reasonable aesthetics criteria within a reason-
able time in order to effectuate the consideration
of aesthetics.
(i) The application fees under this section
shall be as follows:
(1) $1,000.00 for a new wireless support
structure or modification of an existing
wireless support structure.
(2) $500.00 for a new small cell wireless
facility or modification of an existing
small cell wireless facility.
(j) Within one year after a zoning approval is
granted, a wireless provider shall commence
construction of the approved structure or facili-
ties that are to be operation for use by a wireless
services provider unless the authority and the
applicant agree to extend this period or the delay
is caused by a lack of commercial power or
communications facilities at the site. If the
wireless provider fails to commence the construc-
tion of the approved structure or facilities within
the time required pursuant to section 15(2)(l) of
the Act, the zoning approval is void, and the
wireless provider may reapply for a zoning
approval.
(k) The authority may revoke a zoning
approval, upon 30 days' notice and an opportunity
to cure, if the permitted small cell wireless
facilities and any associated wireless support
structure fail to meet the requirements of the
approval, applicable codes, or applicable zoning
requirements.
(l) If either the Act or the Order does not
become effective or becomes ineffective or is
modified due to court action or otherwise, this
section shall conform to the court order or amend-
ment or in the absence of the Act or Order the
authority may implement reasonable procedures
as the authority deems appropriate to process
applications.

or new use.
(4) Deference. The planning commission may
defer construction of the required number
of parking spaces if the following condi-
tions are met:
a. Areas proposed for deferred parking
shall be shown on the site plan, and
shall be sufficient for construction of
the required number of parking
spaces in accordance with the stan-
dards of this chapter for parking
area design and other site develop-
ment requirements;
b. Alterations to the deferred parking
area may be initiated by the owner
or required by the zoning adminis-
trator; and
c. All or a portion of such deferred
parking shall be constructed if re-
quired by the zoning administrator
upon a finding that such additional
parking is needed.
(5) Maximum parking requirement.
a. To minimize excessive areas of pave-
ment which detract fromthe aesthet-
ics of an area and contribute to high
rates of stormwater runoff, no park-
ing lot shall have parking spaces
totaling more than an amount equal
to ten percent greater than the min-
imum parking space requirements,
as determined by the parking require-
ments as noted in each zoning dis-
trict, except as may be approved by
the planning commission.
b. The planning commission, upon ap-
plication,may grant additional spaces
beyond those permitted in subsec-
tion (a)(5)a. of this section. In grant-
ing additional spaces the planning
commission shall determine that the
parking area otherwise permittedwill
be inadequate to accommodate the
minimum parking needs of the par-
ticular use and that the additional
parking will be required to avoid
overcrowding of the parking area.
The actual number of permitted
spaces shall be based on professional
documented evidence of use and de-
mand provided by the applicant.
(b) Parking, residential districts.
(1) Required. Residential off-street parking
spaces shall consist of a parking strip,
parking bay, driveway, garage, or combi-
nation thereof and shall be located on the
premises they are intended to serve. Such
parking spaces shall be constructed with
an asphalt or Portland cement binder,
graveled, or compacted earth so as to
provide a durable and dustless surface,
and shall occupy no greater than 33 per-
cent of the required front yard.
(2) Overnight parking. Overnight parking of
semitruck tractors and trailers, and com-
mercial vehicles exceeding 11/2 tons shall
be prohibited in any residential district.
(c) Parking, nonresidential districts.
(1) Location, on same lot or within 300 feet.
Off-street parking in the C-2, general com-
ZONING § 42-408
CD42:111
mercial and IND, industrial districts shall
be either on the same lot or within 300
feet of the building or use it is intended to
serve, measured from the nearest public
entrance of the building to the nearest
point of the off-street parking lot.
(2) Location, within 1,000 feet. Off-street park-
ing in the C-1, central business district
zone, may be within 1,000 feet of the
building or use it is intended to serve,
measured from the lot line. On-street or
public parking may account for up to 75
percent of the required parking.
(3) Joint recorded agreement. Two or more
buildings or uses may collectively provide
the required off-street parking; provided,
a joint recorded agreement is provided
and registered with the county register of
deeds.
(4) Common parking area.
a. The zoning administrator may ap-
prove a shared parking arrange-
ment for two or more uses to utilize
the same off-street parking facility
where the operating hours of the
uses do not significantly overlap.
b. Required parking shall be calculated
from the use that requires the great-
est number of spaces.
c. Should any use involved in the shared
parking arrangement change to an-
other use, the zoning administrator
may revoke this approval and re-
quire separate parking facilities as
required by this chapter.
(d) Off-street parking lot construction and design
requirements.
(1) Standards.Wherever the parking require-
ments of each zoning district require the
building of an off-street parking facility, it
shall be laid out, constructed and main-
tained in accordance with the standards
and regulations of this subsection.
(2) Permits.
a. No parking lot shall be constructed
unless and until the zoning admin-
istrator issues a permit.
b. Application for a permit shall be
submitted in a form provided by the
zoning administrator and shall be
accompanied with two sets of plans
for the development and construc-
tion of the parking lot showing com-
pliance with the provisions of this
article.
c. No final occupancy permit shall be
issued for a use for which the park-
ing lot is intended by the building
official until the parking lot has been
completed, or a performance guaran-
tee is in place for its completion.
(3) Minimum size of parking spaces. Parking
spaces shall be a minimum of nine feet by
18 feet, but in any case shall comply with
the parking space requirements of the

case it shall be measured from the
base of the parking lot adjacent to
the street.
g. Fire hydrants accessed from parking
areas shall not be located closer than
five feet from the back of the curb
next to any parking space, loading
area, fire lane or maneuvering aisle.
h. The off-street parking area shall be

and screening as required in this
article.
(7) Snow storage.
a. For parking lots having more than
100 spaces, where the planning com-
mission determines that snow re-
moval and storage may pose a prob-
lem to traffic circulation or reduce
the amount of required parking, the

less than five spaces, the new use shall comply
with the following:
(1) The previously approved site plan, should
one exist;
(2) All maintenance-related standards of this
chapter;
(3) Screening and landscaping requirements
of this chapter;
(4) In the C-2 and C-3 zones, for sites that
cannot meet yard setback requirements
for parking areas due to insufficient build-
ing setbacks, an area equivalent to at
least 50 percent of the required front
setback shall be landscaped. This area
may meander or include islands if
noncontiguous areas; and
(5) Sites that add more than five parking
spaces or reconfigure access points and
parking areas shall obtain site plan ap-
proval.
(f) Off-street parking requirements.
(1) Respective zoning district. Parking space
requirements for specific uses are found
in the respective zoning districts.
(2) Units of measure.
a. When units of measurements deter-
mining the number of required park-
ing or loading spaces result in the
requirement of a fractional space,
any fraction up to and including one-
half shall be disregarded, and frac-
tions over one-half shall require one
parking space.
b. Gross floor area will be used to com-
pute the number of parking spaces
required, unless otherwise noted.
Eighty-five percent of the gross floor
area shall be used to calculate us-
able floor area for parking computa-
tions when usable floor area is not
known.

specifically mentioned, the requirements
§ 42-408 PORTLAND CODE
CD42:114
for off-street parking facilities shall be in
accord with a use that is similar in type. If
there is no requirement that is reasonably
applicable to the use, the zoning adminis-
trator shall determine the number of park-
ing spaces that must be provided.
(g) Stacking spaces.
(1) Uses reliant on vehicle access. Certain
uses are greatly reliant on vehicle access
and possess characteristics that create
the need for additional area devoted to
stacking of vehicles. This subsection out-
lines requirements for stacking spaces.
(2) Shown on site plan map. Each stacking
space must be shown on a site plan. Each
stacking space shall have a minimum
dimension shown of 22 feet in length by
nine feet in width.
(3) Location. The location of stacking spaces
shall be placed to avoid undue interfer-
ence with on-site parking and to prevent
unnecessary hazards to pedestrians.

ZONING § 42-409
Supp. No. 1 CD42:115
Sec. 42-410. Access requirements.
(a) Description and intent. The intent of access
management regulations is to provide access re-
quirements that will facilitate through traffic
operations, ensure public safety along roadways,
and protect the public investment in the street
system; while providing property owners with
reasonable, though not always direct, access. The
requirements are generally designed for streets
whose primary function is the movement of
through-traffic, as opposed to local streets whose
primary function is access to adjacent properties.
(b) Scope. The requirements contained in this
subsection shall apply to all uses, except permit-
ted residential uses.
(c) MDOT requirements, in addition to. The
access requirements contained herein shall be
required in addition to, and where not in conflict
shall supersede, the requirements of the Michi-
gan Department of Transportation (MDOT).
(d) Maximum extent. For expansion and/or re-
development of existing sites where the city de-
termines that compliance with all the require-
ments of this section is unreasonable, the
requirements shall be applied to the maximum
extent possible. In these situations, suitable al-
ternatives that substantially achieve the purpose
of this section may be accepted by the planning
commission; provided, that the applicant demon-
strates that all of the following apply:
(1) The size of the parcel is insufficient to
meet the dimensional standards;
(2) The spacing of existing, adjacent drive-
ways or environmental constraints pro-
hibit adherence to the access standards at
a reasonable cost;
(3) The use will generate less than 500 total
vehicle trips per day or less than 75 total
vehicle trips in the peak hour of travel on
the adjacent street, based on the most
recent rates developed by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers; and
(4) There is no other reasonable means of
access.
(e) Number of driveways.
(1) In commercial, industrial, or multifamily
developments, access to a parcel may be
required to consist of either a single two-
way driveway or a pair of one-way drive-
ways wherein one driveway is designed
and appropriately signed to accommodate
ingress movements and the other egress
movements.
(2) Where parcel frontage is insufficient to
provide a driveway meeting the minimum
driveway width and radii, a shared drive-
way or other means of access shall be
required.
(3) Where a parcel has frontage along two
streets, access shall be provided only along
the street with the lower average daily
traffic volume, unless the planning com-
mission determines this would negatively
affect traffic operations or surrounding
land uses.
§ 42-410 PORTLAND CODE
Supp. No. 1 CD42:116
(4) Where the property has continuous front-
age of over 300 feet and the applicant can
demonstrate, using the Institute of Trans-
portation Engineers manual Trip Gener-
ation or another accepted reference, that
a second access is warranted, the plan-
ning commission may allow an additional
access point.
(5) Where the property has continuous front-
age of over 600 feet, a maximum of three
driveways may be allowed, with at least
one driveway being designed and signed
for right-turns in, right-turns out only.
(f) Shared access, frontage roads, parking lot
connections and rear service drives.
(1) Shared use of access between two or more
property owners may be required through
use of driveways constructed along prop-
erty lines, connecting parking lots and
construction on-site of frontage roads and
rear service drives, where frontage dimen-
sions are less than 300 feet, at locations
with sight distance problems, and/or along
roadway segments experiencing conges-
tion or accidents. In these cases, shared
access of some type may be the only access
design allowed.
(2) In cases where a site is adjacent to an
existing frontage road, parking lot of a
compatible use, or rear service drive, a
connection to the adjacent facility shall be
required by the planning commission,
where feasible.
(3) In cases where a site is adjacent to unde-
veloped property, the site shall be de-
signed to accommodate a future frontage
road, parking lot connection and/or rear
service drive.
(4) The applicant shall provide the city man-
ager with irrevocable letters of agreement
or access easements fromall affected prop-
erty owners.
(5) Frontage roads, rear service drives and
drives connecting two or more parking
lots shall be constructed in accordance
with the following requirements:
a. Pavement width shall be a maxi-
mum of 30 feet, measured from face
of curb to face of curb; intersection
approaches may be widened to 39
feet for a left turn lane;
b. Frontage roads shall have a setback
of at least 30 feet between the outer
edge of pavement and the right-of-
way line, with at least 60 feet of
uninterrupted stacking space at the
intersections; and
c. Parking along or which backs into a
frontage road shall be prohibited.
(g) Setback from property lines. Driveways,
frontage roads, and rear service drives shall be no
closer than ten feet from a property line, except in
the case of shared driveways along property lines.
(h) Adequate sight distance and driveway spacing.
Adequate sight distance and driveway spac-
ing from intersections for areas outside of Grand
River Avenue corridor between Bridge Street and
North Water.
(1) Requirements for minimum intersection
or corner sight distance for driveways
shall be in accordance with the American
Association of State Highway and Trans-
portation Officials (AASHTO) guidelines
defined in chapter 9 of A Policy on Geo-
metric Design of Highways and Streets.
1994.
(2) The planning commission may require
driveway locations to be adjusted where
there is a concern regarding adequate
sight distance.
(3) Driveway spacing from intersections shall
be measured from the centerline of the
driveway to the extended edge of the
intersecting street's right-of-way line.
ZONING § 42-410
CD42:117
(4) In order to preserve intersection opera-
tions and safety, the minimum distance
between a driveway and an intersecting
street right-of-way shall be based on the
following:
a. For locations in the vicinity of inter-
sections experiencing congestion
(peak hour operations below level of
service "D" for one or more move-
ments) and/or a significant number
of traffic accidents (five or more an-
nually), the city may require that
access be constructed along the prop-
erty lien furthest from the intersec-
tion and at least a minimum of 150
feet from the intersection. Where
this spacing cannot be provided, drive-
ways designed for "right-turn in,
right-turn out only" movements may
be allowed, with a minimum spacing
of 75 feet fromthe intersecting street
right-of-way;
b. For locations within 200 feet of any
signalized or four-way stop intersec-
tion, driveways shall be spaced a
minimum of 150 feet from the inter-
section. Where this spacing cannot
be provided, driveways designed for
"right-turn in, right-turn out only"
movements may be allowed, with a
minimum spacing of 75 feet from the
intersecting street right-of-way; and
c. For locations not addressed by sub-
section (h)(4)a and (h)(4)b of this
section, minimum spacing require-
ments between a proposed commer-
cial driveway and an intersection
either adjacent to the property or on
the opposite side of the street may be
set on a case-by-case basis, but in no
instance shall be less than 100 feet.
These measurements are from the
near edge of the proposed driveway,
measured at the throat perpendicu-
lar to the street, to the near lane
edge of the intersecting street or
pavement edge for uncurbed sec-
tions.
(i) Driveway spacing from other driveways.
(1) Driveway spacing from other driveways
shall be measured from the centerline of
each driveway at the point where it crosses
the street right-of-way line.
(2) Minimum driveway spacing from other
driveway along the same side of the street
shall be determined based on posted speed
limits along the parcel for each particular
frontage, as determined by the accompa-
nying table.

(3) To reduce left-turn conflicts, new drive-
ways shall be aligned with those across
the roadway, where possible. If alignment
is not possible, driveways shall be offset a
minimum of 100 feet from those on the
opposite side of the roadway. These re-
quirements may be reduced by the plan-
ning commission in cases where compli-
ance is not possible.
(j) Directional driveways, divided driveways
and deceleration tapers.
(1) Directional driveways, divided driveways,
and deceleration tapers and/or by-pass
lanes shall be required by the planning
commission where they will reduce con-
gestion and accident potential for vehicles
accessing the proposed use or site. The
city engineer shall determine the need for
acceleration and deceleration lanes.
(2) The typical driveway design shall include
one ingress and one egress lane, with a
combined maximum throat width of 30
feet, measured from face to face of curb.
§ 42-410 PORTLAND CODE
CD42:118
(3) Wherever the planning commission
determines that traffic volumes or condi-
tions will cause significant delays for
traffic exiting left, two exit lanes will be
required.
(4) For one way paired driveway systems,
each driveway shall be 15 feet wide,
measured perpendicularly.
(5) In areas with regular pedestrian traffic,
the exit and enter lanes shall be separated
by a median with a maximum width of
ten feet.
(6) Driveways shall be designed with a 25-foot
radius or a 30-foot radius where daily
semitruck traffic is expected.
(k) Driveway storage. Driveway storage shall
be determined by the city based on traffic volumes
and conditions. A minimum of 40 feet of driveway
storage shall be provided for less intense develop-
ments and a minimum of 120 feet of driveway
storage shall be required for larger develop-
ments. Driveway storage shall be measured from
the right-of-way line.

(5) Minimize the transmission from one land
use to another of nuisances associated
with noise, dust and glare;
(6) Distinguish and separate vehicular and
pedestrian traffic;
(7) Minimize visual pollution that may
otherwise occur within an urbanized area.
Minimal screening provides an impres-
sion of separation of spaces, and more
extensive screening can entirely shield
the visual effects of an intense land use
from a less intense land use;
(8) Establish a greater sense of privacy from
visual or physical intrusion of intense
land uses, the degree of privacy varying
with the intensity of the screening; and
(9) Safeguard the public health, safety and
welfare, and preserve the aesthetic quali-
ties and enhance the community character.
(b) Necessary minimum. The landscape
requirements of this section are considered the
minimum necessary to achieve the intent noted

tem, and the services to be rendered

percent (5%) of the annual local gross subscriber
revenues, revenue derived fromadvertising, leased
channels, Basic, Basic Enhanced and Premium
service charges as reviewed by the franchisee.
Franchise fees will also include, upon written
notice from the City, such other revenues as the
FCC or Congress recognize in the future as a
permissible basis for computation of Franchise
fees such as Cable Information Service. The Fran-
chise fee shall be paid in addition to any other tax
or payment owed to the City by the franchisee,
including pole rental fees. Initially the Franchise

ers, defined as user end equipment such as con-
verters and remotes, excluding the sale of the
franchisee's fixed assets or the potential sale of
the system. To the extent that Franchisee's books
of account do not reflect the source of any gross
subscriber revenue, that portion of gross sub-
scriber revenue allocable to Portland shall be
based on the ratio of the number of subscribers in
Portland to the number of subscribers outside the
City of Portland.
(C) Method of computation. Sales tax or other
taxes levied directly on a per subscription basis
and collected by Franchisee adjusted for nonpay-
ment and collection expenses shall be deducted
from the local gross subscriber revenues before
computation of sums due the City is made.
The Franchise fee will be paid each January
during the term of this agreement as a prepay-
ment for the year. Within ninety (90) days of the
end of each calendar year, a certified statement
from the company's C.P.A. or designee will be
provided to the City to certify revenues for the
prior year. This statement will be accompanied
with a check or a credit statement to reconcile the
payment made with actual revenue. All state-
ments shall reflect the total amount of local gross
subscriber revenues, and the charges provided for
in subparagraph (B) hereof, the deductions and
the computations for the period covered by the
statement.
(D) Right of recomputation. No acceptance of
any payment shall be construed as a release or as
an accord and satisfaction of any claim the City
may have for further or additional sums payable
as a Franchise fee under this Ordinance or for the
performance of any other obligation hereunder.
(E) Failure to make required payment. Failure
to pay any fee required by this section shall result
in automatic suspension of the Franchise granted,
and reinstatement thereof may be had only upon
resolution by the City Council, and payment of
the delinquent fee or fees plus any interest or
penalties as may be required by the resolution.
Interest shall be calculated at the prime lending
rate as then offered at Michigan National Bank.

see shall annually file with the City Clerk a
compiled statement of revenues received from the
operation of CATV within the City of Portland
within 60 days after the close of each calendar

vices provided for in this Franchise Ordinance,

regulation to the extent of any conflict therewith.

franchisee received refunds of any pay-
ments made for television or radio sig-
nals, it shall without delay notify the City
Council and suggest a plan for flowthrough

CDA:12
(2) If any subscriber in less than 30 days
terminates service, for reasons listed be-
low, the franchisee shall refund to such
subscriber his initial connection charges
in full. If any subscriber terminates ser-
vice because of the franchisee's failure to
render service to such subscriber of a type
and quality, and in the manner provided
for herein, or because the franchisee ceased
to operate the system authorized herein
for any reason except expiration of the
Franchise, the franchisee shall refund to
such subscriber a portion of the initial
connection charges which corresponds to
the fraction obtained by dividing the num-
ber of months of service received by the
subscriber by twelve (12).
