PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Jefferson, Missouri. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the republication were the City Code. The source of each new section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is part of the original Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this republication, the reader can locate any section of the Code, as updated. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this republication. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the republication, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this republication at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Index or Indexes 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. Within the index itself, there are numerous cross references, which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

C.  Whenever any provision of the Revised Statutes of Missouri or other statute of the state establishes a penalty differing from that provided by this section, for an offense similar to any offense established by this Code or other ordinance, rule, regulation or order of the City, the violation of such City law, ordinance, rule, regulation or order shall be punished by the fine or imprisonment established for such similar offense by such state law.

Sec. 1-14. - Prosecution where different penalties exist for same offense. 
In all cases where the same offense may be made punishable, or shall be created by different clauses or sections of the ordinances of the City, the prosecuting officer may elect under which to proceed; but not more than one recovery shall be had against the same person for the same offense.  
Sec. 1-15. - Attempts to violate Code; aiding and abetting. 
A.  It shall be unlawful for any person to attempt to commit any act which is prohibited by this Code or other ordinance or by any rule, regulation, order or notice duly promulgated or given pursuant to authority thereof; and it shall be unlawful for any person to aid or abet another in the commission or attempted commission of any act which is prohibited by this Code or other ordinance or by any rule, regulation, order or notice duly promulgated or given pursuant to authority thereof. 
B.  It shall be unlawful for any person to attempt to avoid the doing of any act which is required by this Code or other ordinance or by any rule, regulation, order or notice duly promulgated or given pursuant to authority thereof; and it shall be unlawful for any person to aid or abet another in the avoidance or attempted avoidance of any act which is required by this Code or other ordinance or by any rule, regulation, order or notice duly promulgated or given pursuant to authority thereof. 
C.  A person is guilty of such an attempt to commit an offense when, with the purpose of committing the offense, he does any act which is a substantial step towards the commission of the offense. A "substantial step" is conduct which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor's purpose to complete the commission of the offense. It is no defense to a prosecution under this section that the offense attempted was, under the actual attendant circumstances, factually or legally impossible of commission, if such offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to be. As used in this subsection, the term "offense means a violation of subsections (a) or (b).

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 
 
Sec. 3-1. - Purpose and intent. 
A.  Intent. The intent of this chapter is to: 
1.  Regulate existing and proposed signs of all types; 
2.  Protect the public health, safety and general welfare; 
3.  Protect state and federal constitutional rights to free speech; 
4.  Protect property values; 
5.  Create a more attractive economic and business climate; 
6.  Enhance and protect the physical appearance of the City of Jefferson; 
7.  Preserve the scenic and natural beauty of the City of Jefferson and provide a more enjoyable and pleasing community; and 
8.  To promote high standards in appearance and effective communication by necessary outdoor advertising while preserving residential areas, open views and vistas, and traffic safety by effective regulation 
B.  General findings. The City finds that the standards and procedures in this chapter: 
1.  Protect public health and safety by: 
a.  Minimizing visual distractions and obstructions that contribute to traffic accidents; 
b.  Prohibiting signs that constitute a traffic hazard or obstruct the visibility of motorist, bicyclists or pedestrians, or cause confusion by virtue of visual similarity to traffic control signs; 
c.  Reducing hazards that are caused by signs that overhang or project over public rights-of-way; 
d.  Providing more visual open space, and; 
e.  Preventing potential deterioration of the community's appearance and attractiveness that would create a blighting influence; 
2.  Encourage signs that are attractive and functional for the type of establishment to which they pertain, and that are in scale and architectural harmony with the project site, project buildings, adjacent buildings and development in the district or neighborhood in which they are located; 
3.  Reduce visual clutter and physical obstructions caused by a proliferation of signs that could diminish the City's image, property values and quality of life; 
4.  Keep signs within a reasonable scale with respect to the buildings to which they relate; 
5.  Encourage the upgrading, updating or removal of signs that are poorly maintained, out of character with their surroundings, or do not conform to this chapter; and 
6.  Prevent signs that are potentially dangerous to the public due to structural deficiencies and disrepair. 
C.  The City finds that the appearance, character and quality of a community are affected by the location, size, construction and graphic design of its signs. Therefore, signs should convey their messages clearly and simply to be compatible with their surroundings.  
Sec. 3-2. - Applicability. 
A.  This chapter applies to all signs that are visible from a public right-of-way, adjacent property or outdoor areas of public property. 
B.  No signs shall be erected, placed, displayed or maintained in any district within the City of Jefferson except as specifically allowed by this chapter.

In all cases the owner shall remain liable for complying with this Code and assuring that the owner's tenants do not exceed the allotted signage.

Sec. 3-21. - Rules and regulations. 
Notwithstanding provisions of any other sections of this chapter, the rules and regulations set forth in subsections A.1—13 below shall apply to off-premises billboards. All provisions of other sections of this chapter which are not inconsistent with subsections A.1—13 or with the Missouri Billboards Act shall remain in full force and effect with respect to off-premises billboards. To the extent any other section of this chapter may be inconsistent with subsections A.1—13 as applied to off-premises billboards, the rules and regulations of subsections A.1—13 shall apply. 
A.  The following rules and regulations shall specifically apply to off-premises billboards: 
1.  Lighting: 
a.  No revolving or rotating beam or beacon of light that simulates any emergency light or device shall be permitted as part of any billboard. No flashing, intermittent, or moving light or lights will be permitted. 
b.  External lighting, such as floodlights, thin line and gooseneck reflectors are permitted, provided the light source is directed upon the face of the billboard and is effectively shielded so as to prevent beams or rays of light from being directed into any portion of the main traveled way on federal and state designated routes and the lights are not of such intensity so as to cause glare, impair the vision of the driver of a motor vehicle, or otherwise interfere with a driver's operation of a motor vehicle; 
c.  No billboard shall be so illuminated that it interferes with the effectiveness of, or obscures, an official traffic sign, device or signal; 
d.  Nor shall the illumination be directed toward any residential area; 
e.  The maximum average lighting intensity level for such billboard shall be 20 foot candles at the light source. 
2.  Area of billboards: 
a.  maximum area for any one billboard shall be 600 square feet with a maximum width of 30 feet and a maximum length of 60 feet, inclusive of border and trim but excluding the base or apron, supports, and other structural members; 
b.  The maximum size limitations shall apply to each side of a billboard structure, and billboards may be placed back to back, double faced, or in V-type construction with not more than two displays to each facing, but sign structure shall be considered as one billboard. 
3.  Spacing of billboards: 
a.  Federal designated routes: No off-premises billboard shall be erected within 1,000 feet of an existing billboard on the same side of the highway; 
b.  State designated routes: No off-premises billboard shall be erected on any state designated route; 
c.  No billboard shall be located in such a manner as to obstruct or otherwise physically interfere with the effectiveness of any official traffic sign, signal, or device or obstruct or physically interfere with a motor vehicle operator's view of approaching, merging, or intersecting traffic; 
d.  The measurement in this section shall be minimum distances between billboard structures measured along the nearest edge of the pavement between points directly opposite the billboard along each side of the highway and shall apply only to billboard structures located on the same side of the highway involved. 
4.  Setbacks, safety clearances and height: 
a.  Setbacks: In order to provide a safety zone to prevent injury or property damage from collapse of billboards caused by Acts of God or other causes, each off-premises billboard shall have minimum setbacks of the following: (a) at least 90 feet from its nearest edge to the rights-of-way of any federal or state designated routes, and (b) at least 90 feet from all property lines and from all roofed structures, from all points of the off-premises billboard; 
b.  Safety: In order to further provide a safety zone to prevent injury or property damage from collapse of billboards caused by Acts of God or other causes, each off-premises billboard shall have a maximum height, measured from the ground to the bottom of sign face of such off-premises billboard, of 35 feet. In addition, the applicant for permit shall present documentation to the reasonable satisfaction of the Director of Planning and Protective Services that the applicant has secured the legally enforceable right to prevent the erection of structures within the setback zones. No City building permit shall be issued for construction of any building within the setback/clearance zone for any off-premises billboard. 
5.  Setbacks at highway interchanges and bridges: No off-premises billboard shall be located adjacent to or within 2,000 feet of any interchange, intersection at grade, safety rest area, or bridge approach. Said 2,000 feet shall be measured from the beginning or ending of the pavement widening at the exit from or entrance to the main traveled way and from the beginning of the bridge deck. 
6.  Setbacks from residential and public activity areas: No off-premises billboard shall be located within 500 feet of land zoned for residential or utilized for public activity purposes. 
7.  Landscaping, lighting and fencing: Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall receive approval for a plan for landscaping, billboard lighting and fencing around the proposed off-premises billboard to ensure that the structure will be aesthetically compatible with its surrounding and the aesthetic standard of the community and neighboring property, insofar as may be practicable, as well as safe and secure from trespassers or vandals. Such plans shall be reviewed and approved by the Director of Planning and Protective Services. In determining whether the landscaping plan is reasonably suitable, the Director of Planning and Protective Services shall take into consideration the nature of the location, the impact on surrounding properties, the safety and security of the proposed off-premises billboard, and the relative cost of the landscaping, lighting and fencing to the applicant in relationship to the overall impact upon the property values in the immediate area which would be caused by a lack of such landscaping, lighting and fencing for the proposed off-premises billboard. 
8.  Nuisances: Any off-premises billboard which, because of lack of maintenance, upkeep, vandalism, accumulation of litter, refuse or debris, or the deterioration of landscaping, lighting or fencing, becomes unsightly or unsafe is hereby declared to be a nuisance and shall be subject to abatement by the City in the same manner as all other nuisances on private property. 
9.  Service drives: Direct access to off-premises billboards from curb cuts along a state highway or service road shall be prohibited. Direct access shall be gained through paved roads and drives which are private and internal to a lot or parcel. All vehicles, equipment, and people used to build, service, maintain and repair such signs must confine their activity so as not to interfere with pedestrian or vehicular traffic on public roads. 
10.  Legal nonconforming billboards: Any billboard which was lawfully erected or affixed prior to the adoption of this article and which complied with all regulations in force at the time it was erected or affixed, but which fails to conform to all applicable regulations and restrictions of this article, shall be considered a legal nonconforming billboard. A legal nonconforming billboard may be continued and shall be maintained in good condition, but shall not be:

b.  Altered so as to increase the degree of nonconformity of the sign; 
c.  Expanded; 
d.  Re-established after damage or destruction if the estimated cost of reconstruction exceeds 75 percent of the appraised replacement costs at the time such damage occurred.

12.  Permits: 
a.  The City shall not issue a permit for any new off-premises billboard without a permit having first been issued by the Missouri Department of Transportation; 
b.  The City shall charge a permit fee equal in amount to its building permit fee for other signs or similar structures to assure compliance with the City wind load and electrical requirements when the billboard is first erected, but shall not charge any subsequent permit or inspection fee for such billboard; 
c.  Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall submit two surveys: (1) a certified boundary survey of the site showing location of the billboard and its setback/clearance zone; and (2) a billboard survey to indicate the relative vertical and horizontal distances between the proposed billboard and all other pole mounted signs within 1,000 feet. If by reason of height, size or spacing, the proposed billboard creates a significant disharmony with pole mounted signs within 1,000 feet, or unreasonably detracts from the visibility of other neighboring signs or properties, the Director of Planning and Protective Services may require reasonable modification of the billboard's dimensions to cure such deficiencies as a condition to granting a permit. 
13.  Renewal inspection and permit: Owners of all billboards erected after this date shall be required to submit an inspection report from a Missouri licensed engineer as to the billboard's structural integrity. Such certification shall be done on or before June first of each third year. Failure to submit a report shall result in the immediate revocation of the billboard's permit.

A.  Intent . It is the expectation of the Mayor and City Council that persons who have accepted the responsibility of serving on a City board or commission will attend all meetings in person unless extraordinary circumstances make an individual's in-person attendance at a meeting not possible, as the purposes of public debate and providing information to the public are best served when meetings are held in person with all participating members in attendance.

B.  Generally . It shall be necessary at any meeting of any board or commission of the City that a quorum be established by counting only voting members who are physically present at such meeting, except as provided by subsection C below. Any member of a board or commission of the City who is not physically present at a meeting may participate in discussion by electronic means, provided only members who are physically present may vote at such meeting unless voting by electronic means is specifically authorized for a particular board or commission by ordinance. 
C.  Electronic Participation . Except has provided herein, any board or commission of the City is allowed to conduct voting by electronic means when a member of such board or commission who wishes to electronically vote provides written notice to the chair of such board or commission and the City Clerk at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting. Members that fail to provide such notice may participate and vote by electronic means if the designated meeting space can accommodate such electronic participation, but only members who have provided such written notice may be counted toward calculating a quorum by their electronic attendance. All electronic participation by members of any board or commission of the City shall conform to the requirements of the Sunshine Law, Chapter 610 RSMo, as it may be amended. This paragraph shall not apply to the Planning and Zoning Commission, Board of Adjustment, Historic Preservation Commission, Parks and Recreation Commission, Police Personnel Board, Transportation and Traffic Commission, Plumbing Examiners and Review Board, Electrical Examiners and Review Board, Tax Increment Financing Commission, or Façade Improvement Committee.

ARTICLE VIII. - ABANDONED BUILDINGS 
 
Sec. 8-150. - Findings 
The City Council determines that the presence of vacant and abandoned structures creates an element of neighborhood blight. It is recognized that blight lowers property values, leads to deteriorating housing conditions, undermines the quality of neighborhood life, affects the public health, safety and general welfare and can also result in human injury and criminal activities. It is also determined that vacant and unoccupied structures occupy an inordinate amount of City administrative and ordinance enforcement resources. As such, the City Council finds the prolonged presence of vacant and abandoned structures to be unacceptable to the citizens of Jefferson City.  
Sec. 8-151. - Definitions 
As used in this chapter: 
A.  Abandoned structure means any building, including an accessory building, including buildings owned, operated, or subsidized by public or nonprofit agencies, which:

i.  Is a potential hazard or danger to persons. 
B.

C.  Director means the Director of Planning and Protective Services or his or her designee. 
D.  Owner means any person with a legal or equitable ownership interest in the structure.

b.  For a partnership, the managing partner; 
c.  For a limited liability company, the managing or administrative member;

B.  The provisions of subsection A notwithstanding, the reportable, taxable gross receipts for each utility customer per product and/or service stated in section 17-204 derived from persons engaged in manufacturing shall not exceed an amount which, when the tax is applied, results in a total tax of $15,000.00 per year per utility service per manufacturer. Manufacturing is defined for purposes of this section to be the conversion of materials into articles, substances, goods, wares, or merchandise and shall include large-scale assembly and distribution facilities. Manufacturing must be the primary activity of the entity, and the limitation of tax shall not apply to retail, wholesale or commercial facilities of the manufacturer. It shall be the duty of the City Finance Director to review applications of persons seeking status as a manufacturer under this subsection, and to issue a certificate of qualification for manufacturer. The limitation of tax shall not be effective until such certificate is delivered to the utility. The state-owned buildings comprising the capitol complex shall receive the same consideration as manufacturers for the purpose of establishing maximum tax liabilities under this article (i.e., $15,000.00 maximum annual tax liability per utility service to be administered per state fiscal year.)

Commencing July 1, 1983, for the capitol complex and manufacturers, the ceilings on tax liabilities under this section, as outlined above, shall be increased by eight percent annually on a compounded basis, unless the City Council, after a hearing, reduces the amount of the automatic increase to be imposed for a particular year. Beginning July, 1984, the ceilings on tax liabilities under this section, as outlined above, shall no longer be increased by eight percent annually, but instead shall be increased by a percent equal to the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index for All Items, as published by the United States Department of Labor, Department of Economic Analysis, between the index figure for the preceding year and the index figure for the current year. These escalations of the tax ceilings, and any potential reduction therein, shall be reviewed by Council at the public hearing required by Section 17-207 and shall become effective each November first thereafter. 
The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any taxes upon local telephone services.

A motor vehicle insurance policy, a motor vehicle liability insurance binder, or receipt which contains the name and address of the insurer, the name and address of the named insured, the policy number, the effective dates of the policy and a description by year and make of the vehicle, or at least five digits of the vehicle identification number or the word "Fleet" if the insurance policy covers five or more motor vehicles, shall be satisfactory evidence of insurance in lieu of an insurance identification card. 
B.  A certificate of the State Treasurer of Missouri of a cash deposit as provided by RSMo § 303.240.

It shall be an absolute affirmative defense to a violation charged under section 19-350 that the operator of a motor vehicle, or the owner of the vehicle, did maintain financial responsibility which covered operation of the vehicle by such operator on the date of the violation. It shall be a mitigating circumstance to a violation charged under section 19-350 that the operator, subsequent to the date of the offense, and prior to a trial or guilty plea, obtained and maintained financial responsibility which covers operation of motor vehicles by such operator.

--- (3) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 10255, § 1, adopted August 20, 1984, amended by the Code by repealing §§ 23-47—23-79, pertaining to urban redevelopment through private capital investment, which derived from Ord. No. 9752, § 1(37-1)—(37-33), adopted March 1, 1982, and enacted similar provisions which have been included as §§ 23-47—23-77. 
State Law reference— The Urban Redevelopment Corporation Laws, RSMo ch. 353. 
 
Sec. 25-47. - Determination of necessity for legislation. 
It is hereby determined and declared by the Council: 
A.  That in certain portions of the City obsolete, decadent, substandard, or blighted areas exist occasioned by inadequate planning, excessive land coverage, lack of proper light, air or open space, defective design or arrangement of buildings, or the existence of buildings which, by reason of age, obsolescence, inadequate or outmoded design, or physical deterioration, have impaired the economic value of large areas, infecting them with blight: 
B.  That such areas are characterized by depreciated values, impaired investments, reduced or negligible income and consequent tax delinquencies; 
C.  That such conditions exist in areas where obsolete, decadent, substandard, outworn or outmoded industrial, commercial, or residential buildings prevail; 
D.  That their assembly for purposes of clearance, replanning, rehabilitation, reconstruction, and redevelopment may be difficult and costly; 
E.  That the existence of such condition and the failure to clear, replan, rehabilitate, reconstruct, or redevelop these areas results in progressive deterioration, and occasions large outlays for the creation of public facilities and services elsewhere; 
F.  That it is desirable to induce private capital investments to alleviate these conditions and redevelop these areas but that sometimes it is impossible or uneconomic for individual owners to independently undertake to remedy such conditions; 
G.  That such conditions require the employment of capital on an investment basis, allowing, however, that widest latitude in the amortization of any indebtedness created thereby; 
H.  That such conditions further require the acquisition of adequate areas at fair prices, the clearance of such areas through demolition of existing obsolete, decadent, inadequate, or unsafe buildings and the redevelopment of such areas under proper supervision with appropriate planning as to land use and construction policies; 
I.  The clearance, replanning, rehabilitation, reconstruction, and land redevelopment of such areas on a large scale basis are necessary for the public welfare and are public uses and purposes for which private property may be acquired by purchase or eminent domain; and 
J.  That such obsolete, decadent, substandard, and blighted areas constitute a menace to the citizens of the City. 
Therefore, the necessity for the provisions in this article is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination to be in the public interest.

ARTICLE VII. - ECONOMIC INCENTIVE POLICY 
 
Sec. 25-300. - Purpose statement. 
The City of Jefferson is dedicated to achieving the highest quality of development, services, infrastructure, and quality of life for its citizens. One of the primary keys for achieving these goals is to enhance and expand the local economy. Competition for attracting new businesses and employers, as well as retaining the ones already in existence in the community, can be aggressive from time to time at national, regional, interstate, and intrastate levels. For this reason, the City recognizes that the appropriate use of economic development incentives may be necessary in the correct circumstances to aid the City in reaching its full economic potential. 
The purpose of these policies are two-fold: First, to establish the goals, standards, guidelines, and preferences of the City to direct the use of economic incentives to ensure that these incentives are used in a way that advances the City's economic goals. These policies allow the City to be proactive (not reactive) with respect to requests from developers and businesses to create the public-private partnerships, which are the real result of granting incentives in any instance. These policies serve as a guide to developers and businesses far and wide to attract those having concepts, ideas, and plans that closely match the development needs of the City. Conversely, these policies also inform the development and business community that incentives for businesses already supported in the City, or for which there is no longer a community need, may be more difficult to obtain. 
Second, the procedures component establishes a uniform, transparent, and well-informed path for businesses and developers to follow when seeking economic development incentives of the City. We believe that through a standard approach the expectations of applicants can be managed at reasonable levels, which leads to a more positive experience for those seeking incentives. The uniform application of these procedures ensures that the goals and needs of the City are being specifically considered for each economic development incentives request, which leads to greater long-term success of the program as a whole. Finally, these procedures address the ongoing execution of each approved incentive application thereby confirming that the applicant will be held accountable for delivering the promised investment in the community, which in turn builds confidence in the City's incentives program by its citizens and the other affected taxing jurisdictions that are the City's neighbors. 
Nevertheless, the applicability of the differing incentives programs often varies from project to project, and the City Council's decision to grant incentives is discretionary, based upon one or more of the criteria set forth in this document and other outside factors. The City Council is under no obligation to approve any requested incentives that are not required by State or local laws, and it reserves the right to deviate from these policies and procedures at its sole discretion when doing so is deemed to be in the best interests of the City.  
Sec. 25-301. - General policy and procedure guidelines. 
To implement the City's economic development incentive program, certain overarching concepts apply. These concepts, which are listed in detail below, fall into the categories of both the policy and procedural components of the City's overall program. Applicants with the highest likelihood of success will address each of these general policy issues and procedural steps in addition to the policy issues and procedural steps that apply to the specific economic incentive tool or tools applied for and described in more detail in this document. 
A.  General policy matters. 
1.  When funds exist, either from the City's budget or supplementary grants or other funding sources, or a combination thereof, the City should obtain, maintain, and update a market study designed to identify the economic development needs of the City for utilization in the review of economic development requests. 
2.  Applicants must demonstrate that the private investment (through equity, private financing, or a combination thereof) is greater than the incentives requested. The preferred ratio of investment to incentive is that the incentives request should be 50 percent or less of the total proposed project costs). 
3.  The purpose of any requested incentive is to provide additional funding for a specific City-designated economic development goal; or, if not, the applicant has provided justification and supporting documents (e.g., third-party market studies, etc.) explaining why the purpose of the request should be a City-designated economic development goal. 
4.  To ensure that the City's interests are adequately protected and that the citizens and current business partners of the City of Jefferson are not bearing the burden of the costs to review requests for public aid through economic development incentives, applicants will be required to enter into a funding agreement whereby the applicant provides funds to the City to obtain professional consultants necessary to aid in determining the appropriate levels of assistance for the proposal, project feasibility, developer's financial capacity, and a legal review of the application, the approval process, and the negotiation and implementation of applicable agreements. The City's expenses may include, but is not limited to, fees for special legal and financial consultation, market study reviews, appraisal reviews, and if applicable, bond underwriters and bond counsel. These costs may be reimbursed through the incentive program as allowed by law. 
5.  The City may at their discretion conduct, and the applicant should expect to provide, a review of its relevant business experience, financial condition, ability to carry out the proposed project, and criminal background. Applicants are notified that the level of scrutiny into the applicant's background will vary ratably with the amount of public incentives and public risk associated with the level of incentives requested in the application. 
6.  Projects utilizing funds created from the development to reimburse development costs ("pay-as-you-go") are highly encouraged. The use of public debt should be limited to only that amount absolutely necessary, which fact will be the applicant's responsibility to justify in the approval process. 
7.  Incentive requests for projects that involve property acquisition by eminent domain are highly discouraged. 
B.  General procedural requirements. 
1.  Applicants for any economic development incentive program granted by the City must schedule and attend a pre-application meeting with City staff prior to submitting an application. 
2.  The City will provide basic forms, a summary of the application, review, and consideration process, applicable statutory requirements, and an estimated timeline for the approval process, in addition to other relevant information, at the pre-application meeting. 
3.  Applicants will be expected to work with City staff and, when applicable, City consultants, while preparing the applicable "official" document to be placed on file with the City, thus triggering the applicable statutory review process. 
4.  Applicants will be required to enter into a funding agreement whereby the applicant provides funds to the City to obtain professional consultants necessary to aid in determining the appropriate levels of assistance for the proposal, project feasibility, developer's financial capacity, and a legal review of the application, the approval process, and the negotiation and implementation of applicable agreements. An initial deposit will be required before the City's staff and consultants will begin work processing the applicant's proposal. The amount of the funding agreement deposit will vary depending upon the application or applications filed, and applicants are hereby notified that the funding agreement will contain an "evergreen" clause whereby the applicant must replenish the fund as it is used to ensure the full amount of the deposit is available to the City for use in reviewing the application. Applicants are placed on notice that the costs associated with a funding agreement are not refundable in the event that the application is not approved. Payment of the associated costs does not guarantee approval of the application by the TIF Commission or City Council, whose decisions shall remain at their sole discretion. 
5.  Applicants shall consider reimbursement of the City's costs to review and consider the approval of the application, and in the event the application is approved, to administer the incentive program while it remains active, as a component of the overall project costs. Applicants also shall provide a mechanism for the prompt payment of the City's costs in its application. The City's costs associated with the consideration of the approval of an application shall be paid in full at the time of any applicable hearing or meeting to consider a recommendation of approval or the approval of the application. The City reserves the right to postpone such hearing or meeting until the necessary payments have been made.

Sec. 25-310. - Tax increment financing (TIF) incentives. 
Sections 25-310 through 25-319 shall be known as "The Policy and Procedure Guidelines For Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Incentives.  
Sec. 25-311. - TIF overview. 
Tax increment financing (TIF) is a public funding mechanism to assist private development of an area within the City. TIF may only be used: 1) when there is evidence the development would not occur without public assistance; and 2) when the project area qualifies as a blighted or conservation area in accordance with State statutes. TIF is a financial tool used to capture the increase in property taxes and sales taxes created as a result of the redevelopment of an approved area within the City. TIF by itself does not cause an increase in property or sales tax rates. One hundred percent of the incremental increase in property tax revenues (known as payments in lieu of taxes or "PILOTs") and 50 percent of the incremental increase in local sales and use tax revenues (known as economic activity taxes or "EATs") generated in an approved TIF redevelopment area as a result of the completion of a development project will be captured and directed to a TIF special allocation fund. The PILOTs and EATs may then be used to reimburse a private developer for eligible expenses or to repay principal and interest on bonds used to finance the eligible expenses for a maximum of 23 years from the date a TIF redevelopment project was activated.  
Sec. 25-312. - TIF statutory requirements. 
By law, the City must determine that certain requirements have been met before approving a tax increment financing plan filed by the applicant. These requirements are set forth under RSMo §§ 99.805 to 99.865 (the "TIF Act").  
Sec. 25-313. - TIF policy guidelines. 
A.  In addition to meeting the statutory requirements referenced above, the City has established several criteria that will be applied in the review and evaluation of applications for TIF financing. In general, applications that meet each of the evaluation criteria will be viewed most favorably. However, TIF applications that do not meet all of the criteria listed herein may be approved if the application demonstrates that the TIF plan and project or projects on the whole is of vital economic interest to the City. 
B.  The City's evaluation criteria for TIF applications are as follows: 
1.  The proposal must demonstrate a substantial and significant public benefit by eliminating blight, financing desirable public improvements, strengthening the City's economic and employment base through the creation of new jobs or retention of existing employment, positively impacts surrounding areas, creates economic stability, facilitates economic self-sufficiency, aids in the implementation of the City's comprehensive development plan and economic development strategies, and serves as a catalyst for further high quality development or redevelopment in the City. 
2.  Proposals for the redevelopment and/or infill of deteriorating areas within the City will be given more favorable consideration than projects for the redevelopment of "green field" areas. 
3.  The applicant must provide evidence that the applicant has thoroughly explored alternative financing methods and has a track record which demonstrates the financial and technical ability to complete the project. 
4.  TIF assistance to the project should generally not exceed 50 percent of total project costs. However, project assistance above 50 percent may be considered in circumstances where the developer: 
a.  Has a proven track record in completing successful projects comparable in scope and scale; and 
b.  Documents the developer's financial capacity to complete the proposed project; and 
c.  Demonstrates that tenant commitments are already in place for a significant portion of the proposed project; and 
d.  Demonstrates the need for additional assistance in order to achieve a reasonable rate of return of the proposed project. 
5.  Proposals requesting TIF assistance should have a ratio of three to one in comparing potential increased revenue to the City from all sources to the value of the incentives provided, measured over the term of the TIF project. 
6.  Generally, TIF applications which encompass a project area of less than two acres will be discouraged. 
7.  In evaluating the employment potential of a proposed redevelopment, the following shall be taken into consideration: 
a.  Number of additional employees that will be hired as a result of the project and whether they are likely to be hired from the local population; and 
b.  Skill and education levels required for the jobs expected to be created by the project; and 
c.  Range of salary and compensation for jobs expected to be created by the project; and 
d.  Potential for executive relocation. TIF projects that create jobs with wages that exceed the community average will be viewed favorably. 
8.  TIF applications for the development of commercial, office, and industrial projects that would stabilize existing commercial, office, and industrial areas that have or will likely experience deterioration will be favored. 
9.  TIF applications that include the development of business areas, or the redevelopment of existing business areas, shall include information as to the business type of the major tenants of the TIF area. In addition, a thorough market analysis should be completed that identifies: (1) the population areas from which the project will draw; and (2) the businesses of similar types that would be competing with the TIF area businesses. 
10.  TIF applications for new residential development projects (other than a limited number of residential units which are creatively integrated into commercial or retail projects) will be strongly disfavored. TIF applications for the redevelopment of existing residential areas will generally be disfavored. 
11.  Government-issued financing related to TIF applications. 
a.  If an applicant's financing plan includes a request for the City or another governmental entity at the City's request (e.g., an industrial development authority or the Missouri Economic Development Financing Board ("MDFB")) to issue notes and/or bonds to finance the project, the applicant shall enter into an agreement with the City regarding the terms of such financing prior to the consideration of the approval of the application, which financing terms shall be incorporated into a redevelopment agreement for the implantation of the redevelopment plan upon the approval of the application, as applicable. 
b.  TIF applications requesting the issuance of bonds or notes shall be required to demonstrate using a third-party revenue consultant selected by the City that the payments-in-lieu of taxes and/or economic activity taxes expected to be generated will be sufficient to provide debt service coverage of at least 1.30 times the projected debt service on any tax increment financing bonds or notes, that is to say that the development must show that there will be $1.30 of revenue produced for every $1.00 of debt service to repay debt issued. This limitation may be modified for projects that involve the redevelopment of existing structures or the assembly and clearance of land upon which existing structures are located. The debt service coverage ratio provided in this subsection is for guidance only, the actual ratio will be determined through negotiations of the parties in the context of an actual request for incentives through an application. 
c.  Applications requesting the City to issue annual-appropriation backed bonds are highly discouraged and will be considered only in extraordinary circumstances demonstrated by extreme need and extreme benefit to the City as a whole. 
12.  If the TIF application is being recommended based upon specifically delineated benefits that are projected to flow to the City as a result of the development, such as increased employment opportunities, increased ad valorem or economic activity taxes, or construction of public infrastructure, language will be included in the development agreement that stipulates that the City's assistance to the developer may be reduced if satisfactory evidence is not shown that the degree, nature and/or quality of the benefits have been generated to the City by the project in accordance with the timeline provided in the application. 
13.  Applications that include the utilization of a community improvement district (CID), transportation development district (TDD), neighborhood improvement district (NID), or other private or public financing mechanisms that result in reducing the term of the TIF project and/or reduce the burden on affected taxing jurisdictions will be viewed more favorably. 
14.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, TIF applications that, based upon the above guidelines, would not otherwise be favorably considered or do not meet any of the above referenced criteria, shall be viewed favorably by the City if the application clearly demonstrates that the project as a whole or a portion of it is of vital interest to the City and will significantly assist the City by eliminating blight, financing desirable public improvements, strengthening the City's economic and employment base through the creation of new jobs or retention of existing employment, positively impacting surrounding areas, creating economic stability, facilitates economic self-sufficiency, aiding in the implementation of the City's comprehensive development plan and economic development strategies, and serving as a catalyst for further high quality development or redevelopment in the City.  
Sec. 25-314. - TIF expenses eligible for reimbursement. 
A.  TIF proposal shall include what expenses are to be eligible for reimbursement. 
B.  Subject to the requirements of the TIF Act, expenses eligible for reimbursement under a TIF proposal may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  Studies, surveys, plans and specifications, fees incurred by either the City or the applicant, or both, for professional services such as architectural, engineering, legal, marketing, financial, and planning; 
2.  Site preparation, including demolition of structures, clearing and grading of land. 
3.  Constructing public infrastructure such as streets, sewers, utilities, parking, and lighting. 
4.  Financing costs including bond issuance. 
5.  Relocation costs if persons or businesses within the redevelopment area are displaced.  
Sec. 25-315. - TIF City application/approval process. 
A.  The applicant is required to first meet with staff in a pre-qualification conference to determine project eligibility. An application may then be submitted to the City Counselor for review and processing. A copy of the formal application may be obtained through the City Counselor's office. 
B.  Provided that the application exhibits initial feasibility in the opinion of City staff as determined by the information exchanged in the pre-qualification conference, the applicant will be required to enter into a funding agreement with the City to cover the City's expenses associated with the TIF consideration and approval process, as provided in the City's general policy and procedural guidelines. The City's expenses may include, but are not limited to, fees for special legal and financial consultation, market study reviews, appraisal reviews, and if applicable, bond underwriters and bond counsel. Applicants are placed on notice that the costs associated with a funding agreement are not refundable in the event that the application is not approved. Payment of the associated costs does not guarantee approval of the application by the TIF Commission or City Council, whose decisions shall remain at their sole discretion. 
C.  Care will be exercised in the use of TIF incentives to thoroughly evaluate each project to ensure that the benefits that will accrue from the approval of the project are appropriate in relation to the TIF incentive provided and the costs that will result from the project, and that the project, when viewed from this prospective, benefits the City as a whole. 
D.  Each project, and the location at which it is proposed, is unique and, therefore, every proposal shall be evaluated on its individual merit, including its potential economic benefit, potential impact on the City's service levels, its overall contribution to the City's economy and its consistency with the City's goals and objective as expressed in the comprehensive plan, and other adopted or City endorsed planning or strategic documents. The applicant is expected to work with the City's staff and consultants to prepare the TIF plan prior to the applicant's formal submittal of the final TIF plan for TIF Commission and City Council review and approval. 
E.  Following a public hearing before the City's TIF Commission and approval of the TIF plan by the City Council, the City and the applicant shall enter into a redevelopment agreement for the purpose of governing the implementation of the TIF plan.  
Secs. 25-316—25-319. - Reserved.  
Sec. 25-320. - Community improvement district (CID) incentives. 
Sections 25-320 through 25—321 shall be known as "The General Policy and Procedure Guidelines for the Use of Community Improvement District (CID) Incentives."  
Sec. 25-321. - CID overview. 
A community improvement district (CID) is a special purpose district in which property owners voluntarily impose a funding mechanism upon themselves to fund a broad range of public improvements and/or services to support business activity and economic development within specified boundaries. Created by an ordinance of the City Council, establishment of the CID is considered after the receipt of a petition, signed by owners of real property, representing more than 50 percent of the assessed valuation within the proposed CID boundary and over 50 percent per capita of all owners of real property. 
A CID may be established either as a separate political subdivision that is distinct from the municipality or as a not-for-profit corporation. If the CID is organized as a political subdivision, the District can impose a sales tax in 1/8 percent increments up to one percent on most retail sales and/or a real property tax. If the CID is organized as a non-profit corporation, it may only impose special assessments to finance the cost of improvements and services. The district, if desired, may issue tax-exempt revenue bonds to finance capital improvement projects for up to 20 years. 
Responsibility for repayment of CID bonds lies solely with the district. As such, the City does not pledge its full faith and credit behind the repayment of the bonds. In terms of governance, a board of directors made up of the representatives of business owner, property owners, and voters either elected or appointed by the City of Jefferson City Council oversees district activities. 
If the district is funded solely through special assessments, a not-for-profit agency can serve as the administrator. Although the CID is established with the approval of the City Council, once formed the District operates independently in accordance with the provisions set forth in the petition and Missouri State Law.  
Sec. 25-322. - CID statutory requirements. 
By law, the City must determine that certain requirements have been met before approving the establishment of a community improvement district. These requirements are set forth under RSMo §§ 67.1401—67.1571 (the "CID Act").  
Sec. 25-323. - CID policy guidelines. 
A.  In addition to meeting the statutory requirements referenced above, the City has established several criteria that will be applied in the review and evaluation of applications for the establishment of a CID. In general, applications that meet each of the evaluation criteria will be viewed most favorably. However, CID applications that do not meet all of the criteria listed herein may be approved if the application demonstrates that the CID proposal on the whole provides a substantial and significant public benefit to meet identified economic development needs in the City. 
B.  The City's evaluation criteria for CID applications are as follows: 
1.  CIDs which are established for the purpose of: (1) reducing the time a TIF project is active and/or offsetting the burden of TIF incentives on the affected taxing jurisdictions; or (2) providing all or a portion of the funding needed to construct public improvements that have been identified as a long-term goal of the City's capital improvements plan are highly favored. 
2.  The applicant should work with City staff and consultants to ensure that a proposed sales tax would not cause the cumulative sales tax rate within the proposed CID boundaries to exceed ten percent. 
3.  Perpetual CIDs having a sales tax as a funding mechanism are disfavored. 
C.  CIDs formed primarily for the purpose of funding common area maintenance costs are discouraged. 
D.  The CID petition shall be favored if it requires that at least two members of the CID Board of Directors shall be an elected or appointed official or employee of the City. 
E.  The CID petition shall be favored if it provides that the City Council must review and approve the CID's annual budget before it is presented for approval by the CID's Board of Directors. 
F.  CID petitions which provide that the CID Board of Directors will be appointed by the Mayor with the consent of the City Council are strongly favored. 
G.  A CID formed to provide sustainable funding for an organization having the purpose of promoting the City's historic downtown shopping district would be strongly encouraged. 
H.  Petitions which propose the issuance of CID bonds requiring the full faith and credit of the City are discouraged. 
I.  The use of a CID as a substitute for traditional homeowners associations is encouraged; provided that the proposed CID is established as a not-for-profit corporation.  
Sec. 25-324. - CID City application/approval process. 
A.  CID applicants are required to first meet with staff pre-qualification conferences to determine project eligibility. An application may then be submitted to the City Counselor for review and processing. A copy of the formal application may be obtained through the City Counselor's office. Applicants may be required to enter into a funding agreement with the City pursuant to the general policy and procedure guidelines provided as a component of the City of Jefferson's economic development policies and procedures. 
B.  Prior to the applicant's formal submittal of the final CID petition with the City Clerk for City Council review and approval, the applicant is expected to work with the City's staff and consultants to prepare the CID petition to ensure that it substantially complies with statutory requirements. Once the review process has been completed, the petitioner(s) may file the petition pursuant to the CID Act in the office of the City Clerk. Upon receipt of the petition, the City Clerk, upon the advice of the City Counselor, or his or her designee, shall make a final determination of whether the petition substantially complies with statutory requirements. Following confirmation that the petition complies with these requirements, a public hearing will be held by the City Council. The City Council would then consider whether to approve an ordinance to establish the CID. 
C.  Following the establishment of the CID, the City and the CID Board shall enter into a cooperative agreement for the purpose of establishing the terms of the relationship between the City and the CID Board. Once established, the CID applicant will either seek to impose a sales tax and/or a property tax within the district, or to levy a special assessment within the district in accordance with the procedures and provisions set forth in the CID Act.  
Secs. 25-325—25-329. - Reserved.  
Sec. 25-330. - Transportation development district (TDD) incentives. 
Sections 25-330 through 25-339 shall be known as "The General Policy and Procedure Guidelines for the Use of Transportation Development District (TDD) Incentives."  
Sec. 25-331. - TDD overview. 
Transportation development districts (TDD) are independent political subdivisions organized to levy sales taxes, property taxes, or special assessments to pay for the construction of roads, bridges, interchanges, intersections, parking facilities, or other transportation related improvements. Unlike CIDs, TDDs are approved and organized by order of the Circuit Court. A TDD petition is a lawsuit filed by the petitioners against the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission and the affected local transportation authority, which may include the City (provided that the City is not the petitioner). Property owners may petition for the creation of a district as large as several counties or as small as a single parcel of property. The TDD Act also allows for the governing body of local transportation (in the City's case, the City Council) to file a petition to form a TDD. As long as the TDD is proposed to construct transportation related improvements, any property is eligible to be included in a TDD. 
TDDs may generate revenues through sales taxes (up to one percent), ad valorem taxes on real and personal property (up to $0.10 per $100.00 assessed valuation), special assessments, or tolls. The TDD is authorized to issue bonds on its own behalf, utilizing these captured taxes and assessments to pay debt service on bonds issued to construct transportation projects. Either the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) or the City are required to sponsor projects and must agree to accept maintenance responsibilities for completed projects. When the project costs are paid off (or if applicable, the bonds financing the project costs are paid off), the TDD is terminated.  
Sec. 25-332. - TDD statutory requirements. 
While City approval of a TDD is not specifically required by law, it is in an applicant's best interest to coordinate the filing of a petition for the formation of a TDD for which the City is a local transportation authority with the City before doing so. The City will aid the applicant in determining whether the requirements for a valid TDD have been met before asking the City Council to adopt a resolution in support of the formation of the proposed TDD. These requirements are set forth under RSMo §§ 238.200—238.275 (the "TDD Act").  
Sec. 25-333. - TDD policy guidelines. 
A.  The City may pass a resolution endorsing (or opposing) projects prior to the time of the circuit court review of petitions filed to establish a proposed TDD. Additionally, for proposed TDDs which include the City as a local transportation authority, the City has a statutory right to file a petition in support of or opposing the formation of the TDD. The City will support the formation of a TDD only in circumstances where projects create public benefits by advancing the City's goals. 
B.  In addition to meeting the statutory requirements referenced above, the City has established several criteria that will be applied in the review and evaluation of applications for the formation of a TDD within the City's jurisdictional boundaries. In general, applications that meet each of the evaluation criteria will be viewed most favorably. However, TDD proposals that do not meet all of the criteria listed herein may be approved if the application demonstrates that the TDD proposal on the whole provides a substantial and significant public benefit to meet identified economic development needs in the City. The City's evaluation criteria for TDD applications are as follows: 
1.  TDDs which are established for the purpose of: (1) reducing the time a TIF project is active and/or offsetting the burden of TIF incentives on the affected taxing jurisdictions; or (2) providing all or a portion of the funding needed to construct public improvements that have been identified as a long-term goal of the City's capital improvements plan are highly favored. 
2.  The applicant should work with City staff and consultants to ensure that a proposed sales tax would not cause the cumulative sales tax rate within the proposed TDD boundaries to exceed ten percent. 
3.  TDD petitions requiring that at least two members of the TDD Board of Directors shall be an elected or appointed official or employee of the City are highly favored. 
4.  TDD petitions that require the City Council to review and approve the TDD's annual budget before it is presented for approval by the TDD's Board of Directors are highly favored. 
5.  Petitions which propose the issuance of TDD bonds are discouraged.  
Sec. 25-334. - TDD City application/approval process. 
A.  TDD applicants are required to first meet with staff pre-qualification conferences to determine project eligibility. An application may then be submitted to the Department of Public Works for review and processing. A copy of the formal application may be obtained through the Department of Public Works. Applicants may be required to enter into a funding agreement with the City pursuant to the general policy and procedure guidelines provided as a component of the City of Jefferson's economic development policies and procedures. 
B.  Prior to the applicant's formal submittal of the final TDD petition with the Circuit Court Clerk, the applicant is expected to work with the City's staff and consultants to prepare the TDD petition to ensure that it complies with statutory requirements and City policy. Among the issues to be resolved in this process is whether the City will be the petitioner as the local transportation authority, or whether the property owners will file the petition. Once the review process has been completed, City staff will forward the matter to the City Council, which will consider a resolution of support in favor of the formation of the TDD. 
C.  After the City Council's determination, the petitioner(s) may file the petition with the Circuit Court Clerk pursuant to the TDD Act. If the City Council has approved a resolution of support in favor of the formation of the TDD, the City will cooperate with the petitioners in the prosecution of the case, as is required by whether the City is the petitioner or a respondent. If the City Council has not approved a resolution of support in favor of the formation of the TDD, the City reserves its right to file an answer in opposition to the petition. 
D.  Once the TDD is formed by the circuit court, the City and the TDD Board shall enter into a cooperative agreement for the purpose of establishing the terms of the relationship between the City and the TDD Board of Directors.

Sec. 25-340. - Neighborhood improvement district (NID) incentives. 
Sections 25-340 through 25-349 shall be known as the "The General Policy and Procedure Guidelines for the Use of Neighborhood Improvement District (NID) Incentives."  
Sec. 25-341. - NID overview. 
Neighborhood improvement district (NID) is not an entity separate from the City, but rather the designation of a special district in which special assessments are imposed to finance public improvements, including acquisition, construction, engineering, legal and related costs. Temporary notes are issued by the municipality to pay the costs of the improvements and related costs. Once the construction of the improvements is completed, the temporary notes are paid by the NID bonds, which are in turn retired through special assessments against property owners in the area in which the improvements are made. NID bonds cannot exceed 125% of the estimated cost of the improvements established in the NID petition. The cost of the public improvements assessed against property owners in the district are apportioned in a manner commensurate to the amount of benefit received from such improvements. NID bonds are counted against the City's constitutional debt limits. 
The creation of a NID may be established by one of two methods. The first is by a favorable vote of qualified voters living within the boundaries of the proposed district. The second is through a proper petition signed by at least two-thirds of the owners of record of all real property within the proposed district. In both instances, approval by the City Council is required in order to establish the NID.  
Sec. 25-342. - NID statutory requirements. 
By law, the City must determine that certain requirements have been met before approving the establishment of a neighborhood improvement district (NID). These requirements are set forth under RSMo §§ 67.453 to 67.475 (the "NID Act").  
Sec. 25-343. - NID policy guidelines. 
The City of Jefferson is prepared to approve petitions for neighborhood improvement districts (NID) to facilitate business activity, economic development, and expedited neighborhood improvement through the participation of property owners to fund public infrastructure within Jefferson City. Because the City issues special obligation bonds that count against its constitutional debt limits, decisions to approve the establishment of a NID will be determined on a case-by-case basis and approved only where there is a clear demonstration of substantial and significant public benefit. Improvements funded by a NID must be purely public in nature, meaning that the improvement will be owned, operated, and maintained by the City after completion and must remain open for public use. At a minimum, all statutory requirements must be met.  
Sec. 25-344. - NID City application/approval process. 
A.  NID applicants are required to first meet with staff pre-qualification conferences to determine project eligibility. An application may then be submitted to the Department of Public Works for review and processing. A copy of the formal application may be obtained through the Department of Public Works. Applicants may be required to enter into a funding agreement with the City pursuant to the general policy and procedure guidelines provided as a component of the City of Jefferson's economic development policies and procedures. 
B.  Prior to the applicant's formal submittal of the final NID petition with the City Clerk for City Council review and approval, the applicant is expected to work with the City's staff and consultants to prepare the NID petition to ensure that it substantially complies with statutory requirements. Once the review process has been completed, the petitioner(s) may file the petition pursuant to the NID Act in the office of the City Clerk. Upon receipt of the petition, the City Clerk, upon the advice of the City Counselor, or his or her designee, shall make a final determination of whether the petition substantially complies with statutory requirements. Petitions that comply with the statutory requirements will be forwarded to the City Council for consideration, subject to the procedural requirements established in the NID Act. Under certain conditions a cooperative agreement may be required to establish the terms of the relationship between the City and the applicants filing the NID petition.

Sec. 25-350. - Chapter 100 industrial revenue bonds. 
Sections 25-350 through 25-359 shall be known as the "The General Policy and Procedure Guidelines for the Use of Chapter 100 Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB)."  
Sec. 25-351. - IRB overview. 
Missouri law authorizes municipalities, counties, towns and villages to issue industrial revenue bonds to finance industrial development projects for private corporations, partnerships or individual companies. Under chapter 100, the City issues bonds to finance real and/or personal property for eligible development projects. Eligible projects include warehouses, distribution facilities, research and development facilities, office industries, agricultural processing facilities, service facilities (which provide interstate commerce); and manufacturing plants. Upon the issuance of chapter 100 bonds, the municipality may provide tax abatement on the bond-financed property over the term of the bonds. Under this arrangement, the City retains ownership of the real and/or personal property and leases it back to the company under a lease-purchase agreement. Through the lease agreement, the company is responsible for making payments that are sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the bonds as they come due. Most commonly, the bonds are purchased by the company. Because title to the property is held in the name of the City during the lease term, the property acquired with the bond proceeds is tax exempt. The company then assumes ownership at the end of the term of the bonds. In addition to property tax abatement, the company also benefits from a sales tax exemption for construction materials and/or equipment for the project.  
Sec. 25-352. - IRB statutory requirements. 
According to Missouri law, the City must approve a "plan for industrial development" pursuant to RSMo § 100.050.  
Sec. 25-353. - IRB policy guidelines. 
A.  In addition to complying with the statutory requirements referenced above, the City hereby establishes several criteria that will be used to review and evaluate applications for chapter 100 financing and tax abatement. To qualify for chapter 100 tax abatement, each of the following should be satisfied: 
1.  Show a clear demonstration of public purpose and economic benefit through the advancement of the City's economic development goals, which include expanding the tax base, creating quality jobs, and spurring development in targeted City locations. 
2.  Demonstrate the project would not occur "but for" the incentives offered. The incentive should make a difference in determining the decision of the business to locate, expand or remain in the City; and would not otherwise occur without the availability of the abatement. 
3.  Include evidence provided by the business that demonstrates the company's financial stability and capacity to complete the project. 
4.  Ensure the City, County, and Jefferson City School Districts, or any other taxing jurisdiction affected by the incentive would not receive less total real and personal property tax revenue from the property than was received prior to the granting of tax abatement. 
5.  Comply with the statutory requirements set forth in RSMo §§ 100.010 to 100.200.  
Sec. 25-354. - IRB City application/approval process. 
A.  The applicant is required to first meet with staff in a pre-qualification conference to determine project eligibility. An application may then be submitted to the City Counselor for review and processing. A copy of the formal application form may be obtained through the City Counselor. 
B.  If the project meets the policy guidelines outlined above, the company will be invited to submit a "plan for industrial development" as outlined under RSMo § 100.050. The "plan for industrial development" will then be considered for formal approval by the City Council. 
C.  Following approval of the "plan for industrial development", the City and the applicant shall enter into a chapter 100 lease-purchase agreement which will govern the terms of the abatement. The agreement shall require that an annual report be submitted to the City by March 1 of each year. The report shall cover the time period of January 1 through December 31 of the previous year and include a detailed accounting of project. The agreement may include a claw-back provision requiring specified performance on issues such as new jobs created as a condition for granting and maintaining the abatement.  
Sec. 25-355. - IRB economic development contractor application/approval process. 
In lieu of section 25-354, application may be made to any entity or person with whom the City contracts for economic development and said contractor may establish forms and procedures for the approval of the an IRB, subject only to the provisions of RSMo ch. 100 and final approval by the City Council.

Sec. 29-102. - Reporting requirements. 
A.  Baseline report. Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision make upon a category determination submission under 40 CFR, 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW shall be required to submit to the Public Works Director a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs (b)(1)—(7) in 40 CFR 403.12. At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, New Sources, and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the Public Works Director a report which contains information such as listed in paragraphs (b)(1)—(5) of 40 CFR 403.12. New Sources shall also be required to include in this report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. 
B.  90-day compliance report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the Director of Public Works a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user facility which are limited by such pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are being met on a consistent basis and if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the user. 
C.  Periodic reports on continued compliance. Any user subject to a pretreatment standard after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the Director of Public Works during the months of June and December unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the Director of Public Works, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow reported in the permit application and compliance with best management practices. At the discretion of the Director of Public Works and in consideration of such factors as high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Director of Public Works may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. 
D.  The City may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user (see 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2)). This authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
1.  The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
2.  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit. 
3.  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
4.  The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed by an authorized representative of industrial user, and include the certification statement in subsection D.1 hereof (40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii)). 
5.  Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
6.  Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Director of Public Works must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the Director of Public Works for three years after expiration of the waiver. 
7.  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's permit by the Director of Public Works, the industrial user must certify on each report with the statement below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the industrial user: 
"Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the pretreatment standard for 40 CFR _____ [specify applicable National Pretreatment Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of _______ [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under Section 29-02.C." 
8.  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations, the user must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements of Section 6.4 A, or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the Director of Public Works, and notify the Director of Public Works. 
9.  This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard. 
E.  The Director of Public Works may establish mass limitations. In such cases the report required by subsection (b) shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. The report shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge including the flow, nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the Director of Public Works, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the approval authority. 
F.  If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the Director of Public Works within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also report the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Public Works Director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except the industrial user is not required to resample if: 
1.  The City performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of at least once per month, or 
2.  The City performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
G.  Hazardous waste discharge notification. The industrial user shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and the State of Missouri hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements in paragraphs A, B, and C of this section. 
H.  Notification of changed discharge. All industrial users shall promptly notify the POTW in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under paragraph F of this section. 
I.  Signatory requirements for reports. All applications, reports, or information submitted to the City of Jefferson must contain the following certification statement: 
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
This statement must be signed by the principal executive officer or director having responsibility for the overall operation of the discharging facility. A duly authorized representative may be designated to sign if approved in writing by the principal executive officer or director. 
J.  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in paragraph C or of this section or a non-identified significant user otherwise required to monitor discharge monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the control authority, using the procedures prescribed in paragraph G.5 of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
K.  The City holds the right to enter the premise of the permittee to inspect, sample, examine and copy monitoring records.

A.  Sewer service charges for residential establishments having an average monthly water consumption for the months of January, February and March of 1,500 cubic feet or less shall be billed monthly for the 12-month period beginning in June of each year on the basis of said average monthly water consumption for the immediately preceding months of January, February and March. If a residential establishment is served by a water district that provides the City with water usage data, which is not based on a calendar month, the City may use the data that most closely approximates usage in the months of January, February, and March, rather than the residential establishment's actual usage for January, February, and March, in determining monthly water consumption. 
B.  Sewer service charges for all residential establishments having an average monthly water consumption for the months of January, February and March of more than 1,500 cubic feet and sewer service charges for all commercial or industrial establishments and governmental establishments shall be billed monthly for the 12-month period beginning in June of each year on the basis of actual quantity of monthly water consumption of such establishments. If a residential establishment is served by a water district that provides the City with water usage data, which is not based on a calendar month, the City may use the data that most closely approximates usage in the months of January, February, and March, rather than the residential establishment's actual usage for January, February, and March, in determining monthly water consumption. 
C.  When a residential establishment is initially occupied and such establishment has no previous record of water consumption, or if a change of occupancy occurs in a residential establishment, the sewer service charge shall be billed monthly on the basis of the actual monthly water consumption until such time as the rate of charges for such establishment may be determined under the provisions of subsections A and B of this section; provided, however, that in the event the initial or new occupant of such residential establishment has previously established a record of water consumption under the provisions of this division, the rate of charges for such establishment may be based on such previous record until such time as the rate of charge for such establishment may be determined under the provisions of subsections A and B of this section. 
D.  For those residences served by a water district where a residential establishment is initially occupied and such establishment has no previous record of water consumption, or if a change of occupancy occurs in a residential establishment, the City may bill the residence for its monthly sewer service charges based upon the average monthly charges from the last rate study performed by the City, for a residence with three members or the actual number of members in a residence if the user provides the same. If, at the time of the next rate study, it is determined that the residential establishment has not paid the correct amount based on actual water usage, the residential establishment will be refunded any overpayment or be billed for any underpayment. 
E.  For those residences served by a private water service the City may bill the residence for its monthly sewer service charges based upon the average monthly charges from the last rate study performed by the City, for a residence with three members or the actual number of members in a residence if the user provides the same. If such user can provide proof of the actual amount of water used, the City shall bill based upon actual waters usage.

A.  The metered water consumption records of the Capital City Water Company, or its successor, as shown by its monthly water bills, shall be used to determine the amount of water consumption of all residential, commercial or industrial establishments and governmental establishments supplied with water by the Capital City Water Company, or its successor, for the purpose of computing sewer service charges under the provisions of this division. 
B.  All residential, commercial or industrial, and governmental establishments supplied with water from sources other than the Capital City Water Company, or its successor, shall furnish evidence satisfactory to the City, of the monthly quantity of water consumption by such establishments from such other sources and in such cases the monthly sewer service charges shall be based upon such evidence; otherwise the City shall estimate the monthly water consumption of such establishments, and such computation shall constitute the basis for the monthly sewer service charge for such establishments. 
(Code 1977, § 32-56; Ord. No. 9519, 10-6-80)  
Sec. 29-145. - Adjustments. 
A.  Low usage. When any residential, commercial or industrial, or governmental establishment, using in excess of 1,500 cubic feet of water per month, furnishes the City with evidence satisfactory to the City that such establishment actually discharged into the public sewers in the preceding calendar year less than 90 percent of the water used by such establishment, the City may adjust the sewer service charges of such establishment for the next subsequent calendar year by computing same either on the basis of water discharged into the public sewers or by flat rate rather than on the amount of water consumption of such establishment. 
B.  Flooding. When any residential, commercial industrial, or governmental establishment furnishes the City with evidence that it has been inundated or had a sewer backup caused by area flooding lasting more than 14) consecutive days after January 1, 1995, the City may adjust any bill on a pro-rated basis for the time sewer service was not available.

C.  Sewer services shall be deemed to be furnished to both the occupant and owner of all residential, commercial or industrial, and governmental establishments receiving sewer service, and the occupant and owner of such establishments shall be severally and jointly liable to the City for payment of the charges for such service rendered on or to premises upon which such establishments are located. If any bill for such service is not paid within 15 days from the date of such bill, the City may sue the occupant, the owner, or both, of the establishments receiving such service, or for which such service has been made available, and receive any sums due for such services plus a reasonable attorney's fees to be fixed by the court and the costs of such suit. Such suit shall be instituted by the City Counselor upon the order of the mayor of the City. In addition, the City may use such other means now or hereafter available to it under the statutes of Missouri and the ordinances of the City to effect the collection of any bill for sewer service remaining unpaid upon the expiration of 15 days from the date of such bill. 
D.  In the event either the occupant or owner of property which receives sewer service furnished by the City has reason to dispute the amount or nature of any bill, the recipient shall be permitted to make payment under protest, provided that the recipient of service provide to the City at the time of payment the following information: 
1.  The period of time for which the service is disputed;

A.  Conformance with stormwater management plan. Drainage plans submitted by developers must be developed in conformance with the stormwater management plan in effect at the time of the submission. 
B.  Restriction of runoff. The City may require that storm drainage systems for tributary areas upstream of existing storm drainage facilities include on-site stormwater detention facilities limiting the peak discharge to that which would have occurred for the existing land use type prior to a zoning change or prior to development of the area. The City may waive such requirements for detention facilities when the developer makes satisfactory arrangements to improve or provide a downstream drainage system of adequate hydraulic capacity for peak rates of discharge to the system, including discharge from the developer's site, to a point downstream where the rate of total runoff from the site is ten percent or less of the total runoff rate conveyed by the downstream system measured at the time of system peak rate. The City at its option may allow downstream system improvements, detention and/or fees in-lieu-of construction that provide the same level of control. 
C.  Stormwater management plan facilities. Drainage plans and facilities constructed by developers for developments encompassing more than 43,560 square feet in total area, including areas not directly subject to improvements, must include any improvements not previously constructed, which are planned as part of the stormwater drainage system on the affected property pursuant to the stormwater management plan. For purposes of this paragraph, the stormwater management plan in effect at the time of submission of the drainage plan shall govern. Also for purposes of this paragraph, the affected property shall include any adjacent property under common ownership with, and within 100 feet of the limits of, the parcel of property being developed. Where the cost of such stormwater-related improvements exceeds ten percent of the total cost of the development, excluding the cost of land, the developer may petition for City participation in financing and/or contribution to the funding of the improvements. 
D.  Alternative improvements. In reviewing petitions for variances from the requirements of this section, the City will consider alternative improvements or types of improvements proposed by developers which the City deems to be equivalent for the purpose of stormwater management.  
Sec. 31-230. - Construction requirements. 
A.  Location of structures. In addition to any other requirements set forth by ordinance for construction in designated flood hazard areas, the following restrictions for construction adjacent to all watercourses and other drainage facilities shall apply: 
1.  No house or building and no other structure shall be constructed within 30 feet of the ordinary high water mark of a watercourse or other drainage facility nor shall any such structure be constructed with openings at an elevation below four feet above the highest bank of a watercourse or top of other drainage facilities which traverse or are adjacent to the parcel being developed. 
2.  The Director may vary the above requirements upon visiting the building site for low-density residential construction or reviewing plans for any other construction should such revisions not diminish the overall intent of this chapter. 
B.  Existing storm drains. No cuts shall be made nor fill deposited over existing storm drains nor shall existing storm drains be altered without the approval of the Director.  
Sec. 31-240. - Easements and maintenance. 
A.  Easements. Whenever improvements to land are made, easements for the stormwater drainage system including structural facilities, engineered channels and overflow paths, shall be provided across private property. Easements through existing developments may be obtained as deemed necessary by the Director. Drainage easements shall include access from a convenient public street or parking lot. The minimum width of easements for stormwater drainage shall be 15 feet. Where a storm drain consists of a closed conduit, the width shall be the greater of 15 feet or the sum of the conduit diameter and twice the cover depth over the conduit. Where the drainage system consists of an engineered channel, easements shall be as wide as the top of bank width plus ten feet each side. 
B.  Maintenance. 
1.  Public stormwater improvements. Maintenance of stormwater sewers, lined drainage channels, detention facilities and related facilities located within public drainage easements shall be the responsibility of the City. 
2.  Natural channels. The City may undertake all maintenance activities, deemed necessary by the Director, of natural watercourses and other unlined drainage channels located within public drainage easements; however, assumption of such maintenance activities does not relieve the property owner of the responsibility for normal maintenance including debris removal, cutting of vegetation, repair of erosion and removal of silt. 
3.  Private stormwater improvements. Maintenance of stormwater facilities located on private property and not within any public drainage easements shall be the responsibility of the property owners and shall include debris removal and cleaning, cutting of vegetation, repair of erosion, removal of silt and maintenance of structural facilities.

The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This article does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This article shall not create a liability on the part of the City of Jefferson City, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 10796, § 2, 3-16-87; Ord. No. 13972, § 1, 11-21-2005; Ord. No. 15017, § 2, 9-17-2012 )  
Sec. 31-301. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact and purposes. 
A.  Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of Missouri has in RSMo 89.020 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Jefferson City, Missouri, ordains as follows: 
1.  Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of Jefferson City, Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
2.  General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
3.  Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps. 
a.  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for Cole County dated November 2, 2012, as amended, and any future revisions thereto. 
b.  Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood. 
c.  Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point. 
d.  Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height. 
e.  Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood. 
B.  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in subsection 31-301.A; to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this article to: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; and 
2.  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
3.  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.  
Sec. 31-302. - Compliance. 
No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations.  
Secs. 31-303—31-309. - Reserved.  
Sec. 31-310. - Administration. 
A.  Designation of the local administrator. The Director of Public Works, or his/her designee, hereinafter referred to as the floodplain administrator is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this article by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
B.  Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. Duties of the Floodplain Administrator or his or her designee shall include, but not be limited to:

(Ord. No. 15758, § 1, 1-3-2018)  
Sec. 31-311. - Floodplain development permits. 
A.  Floodplain development permit required. A floodplain development permit shall be required for all proposed construction or other development within any area of special flood hazard established in section 31-300. No person, firm, corporation, or unit of government shall initiate any development or substantial improvement or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a separate floodplain development permit for each structure or other development. 
B.  Application for floodplain development permit. To obtain a floodplain development permit, the applicant shall first file an application in writing on a form furnished by the Director of Public Works for that purpose. Every floodplain development permit application shall: 
1.  Describe the land on which the proposed work is to be done by lot, block and tract, house and street address, or similar description that will readily identify and specifically locate the proposed structure or work; 
2.  Identify and describe the work to be covered by the floodplain development permit; 
3.  Indicate the size and use or occupancy for which the proposed work is intended; 
4.  Indicate the assessed value of the structure and the fair market value of the improvement; 
5.  Specify whether development is located in designated flood fringe or floodway; 
6.  Identify the existing base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed development; 
7.  Provide such other information as reasonably may be required by the floodplain administrator; 
8.  Be accompanied by plans and specifications for proposed construction; and 
9.  Be signed by the permittee or his authorized agent who may be required to submit evidence to indicate such authority. 
C.  Additional documentation. The particular circumstances of a development may require the submission of additional documentation and may include one or more of the following: 
1.  An NFIP elevation certificate signed and sealed by a professional engineer, surveyor, or architect is required. 
2.  A "no-rise" certificate signed and sealed by a professional engineer if the work being proposed lies within the regulatory floodway. This certificate must be completed before a floodplain development permit can be issued by the City. 
3.  Wet floodproofing certificates for accessory structures used solely for parking, building access, or limited storage that have been designed for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater, and constructed of flood resistant materials. 
4.  If dry floodproofing is utilized for non-residential structures, a dry floodproofing certificate must be signed and sealed by a professional engineer. 
5.  Cost analysis for substantial damages/substantial improvements. 
D.  Review process. Floodplain development permit application review will examine the submitted documentation and technical data and determine the compliance/non-compliance and approve or deny the application. The review process shall be as follows: 
1.  Floodplain permit application package. 
a.  Review submitted documentation for completeness and required signatures. 
b.  Examination of plans including site information and elevation data. 
c.  Inspection of technical documents including building design plans and construction materials. 
d.  Identify/acknowledge other applicable permits. 
2.  Approval/denial of permit. 
a.  Permit approval. If the permit is found to be in compliance the permit will be approved allowing the applicant to proceed in conformance to the information set forth in the application. 
b.  Conditional approval. The floodplain manager may approve a permit with conditions. The conditions will be clearly indicated on all records associated with the approval as will the methods used to verify the conditions. 
c.  Permit denial. If the permit does not comply with the floodplain regulations then it will be denied. The Floodplain Administrator may indicate the major areas of non-compliance or indicate where clarification may be required. 
E.  On-site inspection process. Specific and periodic inspections will be performed to confirm that the construction and development are in accordance with the approved permit. These inspections will be performed by the Floodplain Administrator or his or her designee. The timing of these inspections are as follows: 
1.  Initial site inspection. This inspection will take place prior to permit approval. It will verify that the conditions presented in the permit application are consistent with the actual ground conditions. 
2.  Final inspection. This inspection will take place at or near the completion of the project. It will serve as a final check that all construction and development are in accordance with the approved permit including grading and encroachments, and all building foundations, openings, elevations, and anchoring systems. 
3.  Periodic inspections. Periodic inspections have no set time or frequency. These inspections will serve to ensure that properties remain in compliance with floodplain regulations, to guard against unpermitted development, and to identify unpermitted substantial improvements. 
F.  Enforcement actions. Upon recognitions of a violation the violator will receive a verbal notification of the violation and will be given a timeframe in which to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within the allotted timeframe a written notification will be sent by certified mail and the violator will be allotted a prescribed time in which to correct the violation. Should the violation remain unabated, penalties including issuance of a stop work order, revocation of the permit, fines or a combination of these remedies will be used, consistent with City Code. 
(Ord. No. 15758, § 1, 1-3-2018)  
Sec. 31-312. - Variances. 
A.  Variance procedures. Where an application for a floodplain development permit or request for a variance from the floodplain management regulations is denied by the Floodplain Administrator, the applicant may apply for such floodplain development permit or variance directly to the Board of Adjustment. 
1.  The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
2.  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustment may appeal such decision to the circuit court as provided in RSMo ch. 89. 
3.  In passing upon such applications for variances, the Board of Adjustment shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this article, and: 
a.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
b.  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
c.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
d.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
e.  The necessity to the facility to a waterfront location, where applicable; 
f.  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
g.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
h.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
i.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
j.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and, 
k.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
B.  Conditions for variances. 
1.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial-improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items 2 through 6 below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
2.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation. 
3.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
4.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
5.  Variances shall only be issued upon (a) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (c) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
6.  A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this article. 
C.  Upon the granting of a variance. 
1.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given a written notice that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
2.  The Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. 
3.  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency upon request. 
D.  Conditions for approving variances for accessory structures. 
1.  Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as those other criteria and conditions set forth in this article. 
2.  In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for accessory structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed. 
3.  Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM). 
4.  For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with this article. 
5.  The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure in accordance with this article. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces. 
6.  Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with subsection 31-322.B. 
7.  The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in accordance with this article. 
8.  The accessory structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway encroachment provisions of this article. No variances may be issued for accessory structures within any designated floodway, if any increase in flood levels would result during the 100-year flood. 
9.  Equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage. 
10.  No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any Federal agency shall be paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures. 
11.  A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this article. 
12.  Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the community and prepared by a registered professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for construction.

Sec. 32-103. - Sidewalks required. 
A.  No permit shall be issued for the reconstruction or construction of a new building, or a building addition, or a new or expanded parking lot, unless a sidewalk exists adjacent to the property or unless the plans for the building or parking lot provide for the construction of such a sidewalk. The requirements of this section shall apply to reconstruction, cumulative building additions and parking lot expansions following adoption of this ordinance, but shall not apply to the rehabilitation or renovation of existing buildings or parking lots, or the construction of accessory buildings. Applicants may request a deferral of the requirement to construct sidewalks in accordance with paragraph C below provided however that the obligation of owners of tracts with street frontages of 350 linear feet or more shall be limited to either (1) expending at least 5% of the total project cost (i.e., site development and building costs) toward public sidewalks; or (2) constructing at least 50 linear feet of sidewalk, whichever is greater in cost, with the remaining obligation deferred. For this purpose, project costs shall be estimated using the R.S. Means construction cost data services. In the event that the application of this subsection A of this section would result in the construction of a sidewalk which is too short to have any practical use, the Director may reduce or eliminate the requirement, or extend the requirement to such an extent that a practical sidewalk can be built. 
B.  Sidewalks shall be constructed in new minor subdivisions, as defined by chapter 33, Subdivision Code. 
C.  Sidewalk deferral, application. 
1.  Any property owner required to construct sidewalks under the provisions of subsections A and B, above, may request a deferral of the requirement to construct sidewalks in accordance with this subparagraph C. 
2.  Upon application by the owner, the Director of Planning and Protective Services (referred to hereinafter in this chapter as "Director") may approve a deferral of sidewalks otherwise required by subsections A and B above, as provided herein. 
a.  Applications for sidewalk deferral shall be completed on forms prescribed by the Director at the time of submittal of the site plan, when site plan approval is required, or if no site plan is required, with the building permit application. A copy of an application for a sidewalk deferral shall be provided to each member of the City Council immediately upon its submission. 
b.  A decision on the deferral will be made within ten days of application submittal. If the Director fails to act on the application within ten days, the application will be deemed to have been approved. The Director's decision will be transmitted, in writing, to the owner of the property, to each member of the City Council, and lead project consultant, if applicable. The Director shall be entitled to request additional information from the applicant as well as to extend the time period for a decision with the consent of the applicant. 
c.  Appeals of the decision of the Director's decision shall be governed by paragraph E. 
3.  Deferrals may be applied retroactively to developments previously required to construct sidewalks, or to new developments, when the criteria for such deferral is met. 
4.  Sidewalk deferrals granted for one project or time frame do not guarantee that that sidewalk will never be required in a specific location. A location may be included in an amended sidewalk master plan or otherwise required to construct sidewalks, as the area develops, or as conditions change. 
5.  If the City has adopted a sidewalk master plan and the location is shown on the sidewalk master plan, at the time the application is submitted, as not having sidewalks required, no sidewalks shall be required and no deferral shall be necessary, provided that if no plan has been adopted then all areas shall be considered to have been designated as having sidewalks required. 
6.  Deferrals shall be granted when the Director finds that the location is designated to have sidewalks in the sidewalk master plan and one or more of the following conditions exist: 
a.  The City has plans to construct sidewalks to serve the development, or plans to widen or reconstruct the adjacent street which would require replacement of the sidewalk within five years of the application for waiver deferral; or 
b.  No curbs and gutters exist, and it is impossible to a reasonable degree of certainty to accurately predict the line and grade of future curbs and gutters; or 
c.  The location is within an area zoned industrial and there currently are no sidewalks or pedestrian generators in the area, or 
d.  An engineering analysis accepted by the Director demonstrates the terrain or other natural or geographic features of the location are such that it is not reasonable to construct sidewalks; or 
e.  An engineering analysis accepted by the Director demonstrates an alternate pedestrian way within the site provides an acceptable alternative; or 
f.  The development is proposed as very low residential density, consisting of single family dwellings on lots of one acre of more, provided such lots have street frontages of 350 feet or more; or 
g.  The frontage is along (i) a State or federally designated route with a permitted speed in excess of 49 mph or (ii) a local street with a permitted speed in excess of 49 mph. 
h.  The development was required to construct sidewalks under the terms of previously existing ordinances and did not comply with that requirement, but would not be required to construct sidewalks if the event which triggered the original requirement to build sidewalks had instead occurred at the time the present application was made. 
i.  If the requirement of constructing a sidewalk as provided in this section would cause a property to lose all value, or construction of a sidewalk will make the property unusable for any practical purpose, or if the construction of a sidewalk would create an unusual hardship for the owner (that is a hardship which would not be incurred by similarly situated property owners) the Director may, upon the consent of the Public Works and Planning Committee, grant a deferral. 
7.  Procedures for, and effect of, deferral. 
a.  If a deferral is granted, the landowner shall not be required to install sidewalks at the present time, but shall be required to install sidewalks within 12 months of notice from the City that sidewalks are now to be constructed and that the deferral has been terminated. 
b.  Construction specifications shall be those applicable at the time the notice is issued. 
c.  If the landowner does not construct sidewalks within 12 months of the notice, the City shall construct such sidewalk and shall bill the landowner for the full amount of the City's costs in doing so. If the landowner fails to pay the bill within 60 days the amount owed shall constitute a lien against the property. 
d.  If a deferral is granted, the owner may as a condition of the deferral be required to grade the area in which the sidewalk would be located in preparation for a future sidewalk. 
e.  If a deferral is granted, the deferral shall be considered to run with the land and any subsequent owner shall be entitled to rely on the same as well as assuming the same obligation to construct a sidewalk when requested to do so as provided in this chapter. The City Clerk shall record a notice, substantially similar to the noticed set forth below, with the County Recorder for each deferral: 
Notice of Deferral 
The real estate described in this Notice of Deferral was granted a deferral of the sidewalk requirements of the City of Jefferson, Missouri on _______, 20___. This deferral is subject to the conditions set forth in the City Code and are subject to change from time to time. The granting of a deferral of the sidewalk requirements is not a permanent waiver of sidewalk requirements for this real estate and does not mean that the sidewalk requirements will never be imposed for this real estate. This real estate may subsequently be included in an amended Sidewalk Master Plan or otherwise required to construct sidewalks, as the area develops, or as conditions change. The property affected is more particularly described as: 
[set forth legal description here]

c.  The burden of proof at the hearing shall be upon the applicant to show that the applicant is eligible for the relief requested. 
2.  This decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be final. 
E.  Major Subdivisions. The preceding subparagraphs notwithstanding, sidewalks shall be constructed in new Major Subdivisions (as defined by Chapter 33 Subdivision Code) as follows, unless the owner requests, the Planning and Zoning Commission reviews and the Council approves, a variance under (1) or (2) below. For the purposes of this Chapter, the term "new Major Subdivision" shall mean any subdivision approved by the Council after November 20, 2007. 
1.  When the Council determines in a Major subdivision that, through submission of an engineering study that includes appropriate details such as cross-sections, grading plans, and requirements for sidewalks because of the presence of unusual circumstances or conditions, including without limitation, topographical conditions, and that the strict application of the requirements for sidewalks would either prevent, or present a serious obstacle to the formation of a plat for the reasonable use and development of land, the Council may permit the owner to vary from the requirements for sidewalks or the location thereof. 
2.  The Council may permit a developer to vary from the requirement for sidewalks if the Commission determines that an Alternate Pedestrian Way Plan submitted by the developer with the preliminary plat provides adequate access throughout the subdivision. Such a plan must provide a continuous system of paved walkways located within easements dedicated as pedestrian ways. The Council may require such width not to exceed ten feet and such illumination as may be appropriate to assure safety. 
F.  Construction Standards. 
1.  Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the following street classifications. Street classifications and location of sidewalks on local or cul-de-sac streets shall be determined by the Director: 
Street Type 	Sidewalk Requirement 	Sidewalk Width 
Arterial 	Both sides 	5 feet 
Collector 	Both sides 	5 feet 
Local commercial or commercial cul-de-sac 	Both sides 	5 feet 
Residential cul-de-sac or local street 	One side 	4 feet 
 
2.  Sidewalks shall be located a minimum of three feet from the back of the curb where possible, or other location as approved by the Director. 
3.  Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the latest edition of the City of Jefferson Standards on file in the Department of Planning and Protective Services. 
G.  Time for Construction 
1.  The developer shall install all sidewalks, as required by this section, or by the Council pursuant to a variance as allowed by this section, not later than two years after the date when the abutting street is accepted or not later than five years after the first building permit is issued, whichever comes first; provided however, that the sidewalk for each lot within a subdivision shall be completed and approved before an occupancy permit for a structure on the lot is issued. 
2.  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any building or parking lot for which a sidewalk is required unless the sidewalk has been constructed or the property owner has provided a bond, cash escrow or letter of credit or other instrument acceptable to the Director of Planning and Protective Services guaranteeing construction of the sidewalk within not more than six months of issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
H.  Enforcement 
1.  If the sidewalks required by this section, or alternate paved walkways required by the Council pursuant to a variance as allowed by this section, are not completed within two years from the date abutting streets are accepted, or within five years after the first building permit is issued, whichever comes first, the building official shall decline to issue any further permits of any type to the developer in conjunction with the subdivision where the violation is occurring, or in conjunction with any other activity at any location requiring permits by the building official, until the violation is cured. In addition, the Council may impose a penalty on the developer, in an amount not to exceed One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per day for each day the violation persists. 
2.  Cause the sidewalks to be completed at the City's expense, and may cause a special tax bill to issue as to each lot within the subdivision for which the City has incurred the expense of constructing sidewalks, in an amount of two times such expense incurred, together with the amount of any penalties accrued under subsection a, above. Any special tax bill issued pursuant to this subsection may be enforced in the same manner as a tax bill issued for the improvement of a sidewalk within the City. 
a.  Other Recourse. Nothing within this section shall impair the ability of the City or a property owner to seek any other recourse against a developer for failing to install sidewalks as required by this section.

3.  The permit holder shall notify the Director of the time the excavation is to be commenced at least two hours before commencement of excavation. 
4.  For work involving closing a roadway to traffic, five working days' notice shall be required. The Director may require that street closings be advertised by the permit holder. If the work involved is due to a need for immediate repair or other good cause, the Director may reduce or waive the required notice. No roadway shall be closed to traffic without prior approval of the Director. When conditions warrant closing a street to traffic, the permit holder shall notify the communications division of the Police Department of the time the roadway will be closed and at the time the roadway is reopened to traffic. 
5.  The permit holder shall provide, erect and maintain such barricades, signs, flags, torches, lanterns or lighting at the excavation area as may be required by the most recent edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
B.  All excavations in any roadway shall conform with the following additional procedures: 
1.  The outer edges of all cuts through paved surfaces shall be sawed to a depth of not less than one-third of the pavement thickness by use of a power driven concrete saw to obtain a smooth and square cut. If an excavation is made in a roadway with a surface deficiency, the pavement removal shall be expanded to a point where a smooth straight edge can be maintained. If the contractor fails to saw the pavement, the City shall perform this operation or have this operation performed, and the cost thereof shall be charged to the contractor. 
2.  Where surface exists, the roadway pavement shall be removed to a minimum width of six inches beyond each edge of the excavated trench or area except where a four to six inch trenching machine is used. Where deemed necessary by the Director, a width of up to 12 inches beyond either edge may be required. 
3.  In the event the entire width of a roadway is to be excavated, the excavation and backfill shall be completed within one-half of the width of the roadway prior to any excavation commencing in the remaining half of the roadway if practical as determined by the Director. 
4.  No open cuts will be permitted across arterial streets unless undue hardship is imposed. Previous agreement from the Director must be obtained prior to an open cut being made across an arterial street. 
5.  For the three years following resurfacing of a roadway, no open cuts will be permitted on that roadway for any work that could have been planned. 
6.  In the event an excavation crosses a curb or curb and gutter, the curb or curb and gutter must be removed and replaced a minimum width of six inches beyond the edge of the underlying excavation. If a bore under curb or curb and gutter is made and material sloughs off the embankment creating a void under the curb or curb and gutter, the entire width of curb or curb and gutter shall be removed and replaced in accordance with the above guidelines. All curb and curb and gutter to be removed and replaced shall be doweled to the existing curb or curb and gutter.

Crushed stone aggregate shall be placed within three inches of the bottom of the pavement to be placed. 
5.  Excavations not in driveways, sidewalks, or roadways and not within three feet of a roadway shall be backfilled in a manner that will minimize settlement of the backfill. The original backfill shall be left flush with the adjacent area. It shall be the permit holder's responsibility to repair any settlement that occurs within six months after placement of the original backfill. In addition, in areas that are seeded, the permit holder shall be responsible for obtaining a stand of grass equal to or better than that of the surrounding yard area.

Shot rock in compacted six-inch lifts may be used to stabilize the bottom of excavations. The excavation shall be backfilled with a crushed stone aggregate material having a maximum diameter of one inch. Upon request, the Director may approve the use of excavated material for backfill. 
2.  All backfill material shall be placed in the excavation in lifts not exceeding eight inches. Each lift shall be compacted with a flat plate tamper appropriate for the material being used before any additional material is placed in the excavation. 
3.  Crushed stone aggregate shall be placed within one foot of the bottom of the pavement repair. The aggregate shall be placed in a maximum of six-inch lifts and compacted with a vibratory tamper before any additional material is placed in the excavation. 
4.  Except as provided in this subsection, backfill of excavations, including the area of where additional width of pavement was removed in paved roadways, shall be topped with an eight-inch thickness of concrete pavement on arterial streets; six-inch thickness of concrete pavement on all other roadways. At no point shall the concrete thickness vary more than one-half inch from that specified. In traffic lanes high early strength concrete, eight bags of concrete and four percent calcium per yard of concrete, shall be used. In other areas a minimum of 6½ bags of cement per yard of concrete shall be used. All concrete shall be air entrained. In bituminous pavements, the top of the concrete pavement shall be held 1½ inches below the top of the existing pavement. In Portland cement concrete pavements, the concrete shall be made flush with the adjacent pavement. The concrete shall be protected from traffic until it develops adequate strength and the asphalt surface course, if needed, is placed. Plates to protect the excavation may be obtained at the street division of the Public Works Department. 
5.  In bituminous pavements that are not classified as arterial, backfill of excavations that have a minimum width of ten feet and a minimum length of 100 feet may be topped with asphalt base course in lieu of concrete. The asphalt base course shall be seven inches in thickness, and shall meet the standard specification for asphalt base. The asphalt shall be placed in two lifts by a self-propelled mechanical laydown machine. Each lift shall be compacted by a steel wheeled vibratory roller before any additional material is placed on top of it. The top of the asphalt base shall be held 1½ inches below the top of the existing pavement. 
6.  In bituminous pavements, surface restoration shall be a 1½ inch compacted asphalt surface course. The asphalt shall meet standard specifications and be of the grade determined appropriate by the Director. 
7.  No concrete pavement will be required over excavations in crushed stone roadways. 
(Ord. No. 11955, § 1, 9-7-93)  
Sec. 32-136. - Maintenance and resurfacing. 
A.  The permit holder shall maintain the excavation until the surface is restored and the permit is closed out by the Director. This responsibility includes keeping the cut flush with the street at all times, providing barricades as needed and keeping the cut square. In addition, the permit holder shall be responsible for repair of any damage due to vandalism, accident, act of God or other means, and shall perform all work necessary to prevent further damage. 
B.  The permit holder shall restore unimproved portions of any right-of-way with material identical to that of the surrounding right-of-way surface. 
C.  The permit holder shall completely restore any excavation made in Portland cement concrete pavements and any excavation in asphalt pavement in excess 100 square feet in surface area. The Department of Public Works will restore the asphalt surface (not concrete base) in bituminous paved surfaces of 100 square feet or less if desired and paid for by the permit holder.

(Ord. No. 13986, § 3, 12-19-2005)  
Sec. 33-11. - Streets and alleys; rights-of-way, design. 
A.  The widths of right-of-way for streets and alleys and the improved width of roadways within such rights-of-way, unless modified by the Commission because of unusual conditions or circumstances, are established as follows: 
1.  Arterial street. The right-of-way shall be at least 80 feet wide and the improved roadway shall be at least 37 feet wide (face-to-face of curb). No parking shall be designed for either side of the street. 
a.  Purpose and applicability. This section establishes the requirements for the approval, construction, maintenance and operation of private streets including gated entrances across private streets or drives. All private streets and gated entrances shall adhere to these requirements whether the subdivision or development is new or existing if the private street or gated entrance serves more than one residential dwelling unit. 
b.  Eligibility criteria. Private streets shall only be permitted when they satisfy all of the following criteria and conditions: 
(1)  Private streets shall only be allowed in an approved planned unit development containing not more than 50 residential dwelling units; 
(2)  Private streets shall not cross or interfere with an existing or future collector or arterial street shown on the City's major thoroughfare plan; 
(3)  Private streets shall serve an area generally isolated by natural barriers (e.g., creeks, flood plains, steep bluffs) or man-made barriers (e.g., golf course, cemetery or park); 
(4)  Private streets shall not provide the only means of access to public streets from an adjacent development or undeveloped land not served by the private streets; 
(5)  Private streets shall not cross or interfere with an existing or future public pedestrian pathway, greenway trail or park as shown on the City's parks and recreation master plan. 
c.  Property association required. All developments with private streets shall have a mandatory property (homeowners) association which includes all property served by the private streets. The association shall own and be responsible for the maintenance of private streets and appurtenances. The association documents must establish a reserve fund for the maintenance of streets and other improvements. The association documents shall be reviewed and approved by the City Counselor to ensure that they conform to this and other applicable City regulations. The documents shall be filed of record in conjunction with recording of the final plat. Property deeds must convey membership in the association, and must provide for the payment of dues and assessments required by the association. The association may not be dissolved and no portion of the association documents pertaining to the maintenance of private streets, and assessments therefore, may be amended without the written consent of the City. 
d.  Private street designation. Private streets shall be constructed within a separate tract of land designated as common area and owned by the property owners association. This tract must conform to the City's standards for public street rights-of-way. An easement covering the entire street tract shall be granted to the City providing unrestricted use of the property for construction and maintenance of public utilities. This right shall also extend to all public utility providers and public telecom companies operating within the City. The easement shall also grant the City the right of access to provide any governmental service or function, including but not limited to, fire and police protection, inspection and code enforcement. The easement shall permit the City to remove any vehicle or obstacle within the street tract that may impair emergency access. 
e.  Construction and maintenance. All private streets shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the City's improvement standards for publicly dedicated streets. The City shall not pay for any portion of the cost of constructing or maintaining a private street. The property association documents shall give the City the right to inspect private streets and require any repairs at the sole expense of the association necessary to ensure efficient emergency access and/or to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents. After giving written notice, the City shall also have the right to perform such repairs and place a lien upon the lots within the association to recover the cost thereof. 
f.  Infrastructure/utilities. All storm sewer facilities, sidewalks, street lights, and traffic control devices (e.g., stop signs) placed within the private street tract shall be installed to City standards and maintained by the property association. Utilities (e.g., electric, gas, telephone, cable TV, water, and sanitary sewer lines) installed to established standards in proper dedicated public utility easements may be accepted and maintained by the respective utility provider. 
g.  Plans and inspections. Developments with private streets must include the same plans and engineering information required for public streets, sidewalks, and sanitary and storm sewers. City requirements pertaining to the review, inspection and approval of these improvements, as well as fees charged for these services, shall apply equally as if they were public facilities. 
h.  Signage. The entrances to all private streets must be clearly marked with a sign, placed in a prominent and visible location, stating that the streets within the subdivision are private, and that they are not maintained by the City. 
i.  Gated private streets. The City Council shall have sole discretion to determine when a gate may be permitted across any private street or drive and whether to grant any variance from the provisions of this section. The City Council may deny the creation of any gated private street if, in their sole judgment, the gate would adversely affect traffic circulation on public streets, impair access to the subject or adjacent property; impair access to or from public facilities including schools or parks; or cause possible delays in the response time of emergency vehicles. Approval of the gate or variance shall be by approval of a preliminary plat or PUD site plan for a new development, or the passage of a resolution when the subdivision or development pre-exists the request for a gate. 
j.  Access control gate standards. All gates across private streets or drives must meet the requirements and standards established by the Director of Planning and Protective Services as well as applicable building, fire and other City Codes. Only gates that swing open horizontally in the direction of travel or slide open perpendicular to the direction of travel will be permitted. The installation shall be completed and tested prior to issuance of any occupancy permits. All access control gates must be manned 24 hours every day, or they must provide an automatic access system, approved by the City, allowing quick access to the development by 911 emergency vehicles. The City shall have the right to designate the type of automatic access system which it deems to be appropriate. A reliable mechanical or electronic gate opening device shall also be installed to allow efficient access by other public service providers (e.g., postal carriers, utility companies, building inspectors, etc.). If the association fails to maintain reliable access as required herein, the City may remove any gate or device which is a barrier to access at the sole expense of the property association. The association documents shall contain provisions in conformity with this Section which may not be amended without the written consent of the City Council. 
k.  Entrance design standards. Any private street with restricted access must have a minimum pavement width of 24 feet at the location of the access control gate. If the entrance incorporates a median or guard house which necessitates a divided arrangement, the pavement width of each lane shall not be less than 14 feet. If an overhead barrier is used, it must be a minimum of 13.5 feet in height above the road surface. A turn-around space must be located in front of any gated access entrance to allow vehicles denied access to safely exit onto public streets without having to back up into the street. The design of such turn-around shall accommodate smooth, single-motion U-turn movements by large passenger vehicles (e.g., vans, pick-up trucks, etc.); passenger vehicles with short trailers (e.g., small flatbed, or box-type moving trailers); and the types of service vehicles that typically visit or make deliveries to residential developments (e.g., utility vehicles, parcel delivery trucks, two- to three-axle trucks used by contractors and moving companies). The design of all proposed entrances, including sidewalk connections, gate houses, and entrance lights, must be submitted for review by the Planning and Zoning Commission along with the construction plans for the subdivision, and must be approved by the City Council along with approval of the final plat. 
l.  Waiver of services. The subdivision final plat, property deeds and property association documents shall note that certain City services shall not be provided on private streets. Among the services which will not be provided are: routine law enforcement patrols, enforcement of traffic and parking regulations, and preparation of accident reports. Depending upon the characteristics of the development and access limitations, other services may not be provided. 
m.  Petition to convert to public streets. The property association documents shall allow the association to petition the City to accept private streets and any associated facilities (e.g., storm sewers, street lights, traffic control devices) as public streets and right-of-way upon written notice to all association members and upon the favorable vote of a majority of the membership. However, in no event shall the City be obligated to accept said streets as public. Should the City elect to accept the streets as public, then the City has the right to inspect the private streets and associated facilities and to assess the property owners for the expense of needed repairs concurrent with the City's acceptance of the streets. The City shall be the sole judge of whether repairs are needed. The City may also require, at the association's expense, the removal of any guard houses, access control devices, landscaping and/or other aesthetic amenities located within the street tract. The association documents shall grant the City the right to provide such removal and assessment. Those portions of the association documents pertaining to the subject matter contained in this Section shall not be amended without the written consent of the City. 
n.  Hold harmless. The property owners association, as owner of the private streets and appurtenances, and the individual lot owners shall agree to release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless from liability imposed by law, the City, any other governmental entity, and any medical services provider or public utility entity for damages and injury (including death), arising from the existence, condition or use of private streets or restricted access gate across private streets by the City, governmental entity, medical services provider or public utility entity. The indemnifications contained in this paragraph apply regardless of whether or not such damages and injury (including death) are caused by the negligent act or omission of the City, governmental entity, medical services provider or public utility. The above language shall be contained in the recorded final plat, property deeds and the deed restrictions and covenants and shall run with the land and shall not be altered without the written consent of the City.

Sec. 33-13. - Variations from provisions. 
A.  When the Director of Planning and Protective Services determines that in a particular instance an owner cannot possibly or practically observe the requirement of any provision or provisions of this chapter, except in regards to construction of sidewalks, because of the presence of unusual circumstances or conditions, and that the strict application of the requirements of such provisions would either prevent, or present a serious obstacle to the formulation of a plat for the reasonable use and development of land in subdivision form, the Director shall make a written recommendation to the Commission that a variation from the requirements of such provisions be permitted and state the facts upon which the recommendation is made.

(Ord. 13879, § 2, 5-16-2005)  
Sec. 35-27. - Planned unit development district. 
A.  Purpose. To provide land use and design flexibility in exchange for long term community benefits where streets and utilities are adequate and where proposed development is compatible with existing and planned development on adjacent property. The PUD District generally will require simultaneous subdivision and rezoning, as well as the execution of a development agreement to provide for the installation and continued maintenance of public and private facilities. 
The PUD District requires review pursuant to subsection 35-74.C to ensure that development flexibility results in high quality developments providing amenities for district residents and long-term benefits for the community as a whole. 
B.  Establishment of allowed uses. The following uses may be authorized within the PUD District at the discretion of the Council: 
1.  Any use specifically authorized within a district that implements the development plan land use plan pursuant to this ordinance. 
2.  Any other use that the Council finds compatible with the existing and planned uses in the development and on adjacent properties. 
3.  Manufactured home subdivision development in conformance with article IV, section 35-41. 
C.  Adoption and modification of authorized uses. The Council, at the time of adoption of an ordinance establishing the PUD district, shall list the uses that are authorized. All authorized uses shall be subject to applicable approval processes established in article VII, subsection 35-74.C of this ordinance. Modification of the authorized use lists for any planned development shall be processed pursuant to the rezoning process established in article VII, subsection 35-74.C of this ordinance. 
D.  Special conditions. 
1.  Generally. Planned developments shall comply with the standards of this ordinance, except when the City finds that public or private amenities provided by the proposed development exceed those that would be achieved through development that strictly complies with the minimum standards of this ordinance. 
2.  Minimum district size. A minimum of ten acres shall be required for the establishment of the PUD District, unless the Planning and Zoning Commission recommends and the Council finds that a PUD District is appropriate for the development or redevelopment of a smaller infill site. 
3.  Location and access standards. 
a.  Location. The PUD plan shall be compatible with existing and planned development on adjacent property. The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend extension of the PUD District to include additional area, including those areas where a previously approved PUD District abuts land of a different zoning. 
b.  Access. The PUD plan shall include provisions to coordinate with existing and proposed transportation systems, including streets, transit facilities, bikeways or pedestrian trails. 
4.  Residential density. Gross residential densities, as defined in article IX, shall be established at the time of preliminary plan approval. Densities greater than those designated in the adopted development plan land use plan shall be based on the compatibility of the proposed development with adjacent uses, the adequacy of facilities and services and the amenities provided for users of the development. 
5.  Non-residential intensity. For non-residential development, a maximum floor area ratio (FAR) shall be established at the time of the planned development approval process. In determining the maximum FAR, the Planning and Zoning Commission and Council shall consider: 
a.  The intensity of adjacent development; 
b.  Demands for the non-residential development proposed in the PUD; 
c.  The mix of residential and non-residential development in the vicinity; 
d.  The adequacy of transportation facilities, including streets, parking, transit facilities and bicycle/pedestrian facilities; and 
e.  The adequacy of utilities and public facilities and services. 
6.  Setback. Building setbacks shall be not less than the minimum setback standards established in article V for the district that implements the designated development plan land use category unless the applicant can demonstrate that: 
a.  Buildings can be designed safely and compatibly with smaller setbacks; 
b.  Reduced setbacks are offset by the provision of readily accessible private or common open space; 
c.  Modified setbacks provide for the protection of steep hillsides, wetlands or other environmentally sensitive natural features; and 
d.  All buildings are provided with adequate emergency access for fire protection. 
7.  Community amenities. Deviation from the standards may be recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission and approved by the Council subject to the provision of the following community amenities. 
a.  Transportation amenities, including additional trails, bike or pedestrian amenities, and/or transit-oriented improvements (including school bus shelters); 
b.  Park land dedication and facilities for active or passive recreation; 
c.  Open space or agricultural land reservation; 
d.  Community facilities for provision of public services beyond those required for development within the PUD; or 
e.  Other provisions in excess of minimum standards that the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Council find provide sufficient community benefit to offset the proposed deviation from strict development standards. 
8.  Landscape buffers. The placement and extent of landscape buffers shall be depicted upon the PUD plan and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, however, the standards for such buffers shall not be less than those contained in section 35-59 and landscape buffers in a PUD shall in no case be less than the landscape buffer required by exhibit 35-59A and exhibit 35-59B. 
9.  Conformance with Neighborhood Conservation Overlay Districts. Planned unit development plans located within a neighborhood conservation overlay district shall be compatible, in terms of exterior design of building, size and scale of building, and other standards contained within the neighborhood conservation overlay district. Deviations from the standards of the neighborhood conservation overlay district may be recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission and approved by the Council provided it is found that there is sufficient community benefit to offset the proposed deviations. 
E.  Traffic impact analysis. In the case of large or complex developments, the Commission may recommend and the Council may require that a traffic impact analysis be prepared pursuant to section 35-60. 
F.  Approval of PUD by adoption of PUD ordinance. Approval of the PUD, by adoption of an ordinance that sets forth the conditions for development of the PUD, allows the development and use of a parcel of land under certain specific conditions. No use of the parcel, nor construction, modification, or alteration of any use or structures within the PUD project shall be permitted unless such construction or use complies with the terms and conditions of the approved plan as evidenced by the adopting ordinance. Each subsequent owner and entity created by the development (such as property owner's associations or an architectural review committee) shall comply with the terms and conditions established in the adopting ordinance. At the option of the City, a development agreement may be drawn up between the parties. 
G.  Coordination with subdivision. 
1.  Conformance with subdivision review. Subdivision review, in accordance with chapter 33, the subdivision regulations, shall be carried out simultaneously with the review of the PUD zoning in conformance with article VII, subsection 35-74.C of this ordinance. 
2.  Conformance with subdivision requirements. The development plans submitted under article VII shall satisfy the requirements of the subdivision regulations for preliminary plat and final plat in chapter 33. 
3.  Final plat not required, when. The requirements of this Section and those of chapter 33 shall apply to all PUD projects, provided, however, that when the PUD is proposed in an existing subdivision and no changes are proposed to existing lot boundaries, rights-of-way, or public or private easements, no new final plat shall be required. 
H.  Relationship to building codes. In no case shall the requirements of any adopted building or fire codes be varied as a part of the approval process of a PUD. 
I.  Planned unit development district designation. The Director shall show the approved PUD district on the official zoning map by specifying the official development file number. 
J.  Amendment of the plan. A PUD plan may be amended in conformance with article VII, subsection 35-74.C.

Sec. 35-28. - Matrices of permitted, conditional and special exception use land uses and classification of uses not listed. 
A.  Land uses authorized in zoning districts. Exhibit 35-28 lists the principal uses allowed within the zoning districts. The categories of uses listed below are subject to all other applicable standards of this ordinance. The exhibit lists use categories and an abbreviated definition of each respective use category. In some cases, "specific use types" are listed in the second column of the table. If a specific use type is listed in the table, that use type is allowed only within the districts indicated, not within the districts that allow the broader use category. See also section 35-41 for specific use standards. 
P  Permitted uses. A "P" indicates that the listed use is allowed by-right within the respective zoning district. 
SE  Special exception uses. An "SE" indicates that the listed use is allowed within the zoning district only after review and approval of a special exception use permit by the Commission and Council, in accordance with the review procedures of article VII, subsection 35-73.D. 
C  Conditional uses. A "C" indicates that the listed use is allowed within the zoning district only after review and approval of a conditional use permit by the Board of Adjustment, in accordance with the review procedures of article VII, subsection 35-73.A. 
-  Prohibited uses. A "-" indicates that the listed use type is not allowed within the respective zoning district, unless it is otherwise expressly allowed by other regulations of this ordinance. 
B.  Uses not provided for in zoning districts. In the case where a use is not specifically listed in table 35-28, the Director shall determine the appropriate district or districts where such use shall be allowed based on a comparison of other uses which most closely resemble the unlisted use. Classification of a use may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment.

Sec. 35-29. - Reserved.  
ARTICLE III. - OVERLAY DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
 
Sec. 35-30. - Redevelopment overlay district. 
A.  Purpose. The primary purpose of the Redevelopment Overlay District (ROD) is to: 
1.  Eliminate a trend toward blight in specific areas of the City; 
2.  Encourage redevelopment of areas highlighted by the Development Plan without creating non-conforming use status for existing properties; 
3.  Reduce redevelopment risk by pre-zoning land eliminating lengthy approval processes and certain discretionary review processes; and 
4.  Reduce market uncertainty by offering redevelopment alternatives. 
The ROD development standards offer methods to redevelop existing buildings and vacant parcels while establishing standards for compatible development within the affected areas. 
B.  Effect of application. The ROD shall be applied in combination with the underlying zoning district classification. Existing property may continue to be used as permitted by the underlying zoning. Properties that are proposed to be redeveloped shall be in conformance with the standards provided in this section and those of the district. In the case of conflict between the standards of the underlying classification and the ROD, the ROD standards shall control. 
C.  Procedures. The applicant for redevelopment of a property located in an ROD shall submit a site plan in conformance with section 35-71 and an application for a special exception use permit in conformance with subsection 35-73.D. The Planning and Zoning Commission and the Council shall consider the standards in subparagraph D of this section as part of the review criteria. 
D.  Property development standards. 
1.  Conversion of existing residential dwellings to non-residential uses in areas which have underlying residential zoning is prohibited except: 
a.  Where the building to be converted abuts a commercial district; or 
b.  If the conversion is the most feasible way to preserve a historically or architecturally significant building. The conversion shall be considered the most feasible way to preserve a building if: 
(1)  The applicant demonstrates that residential units are not economically feasible and demonstrates that the use of the building for single family or multi-family dwellings will not yield a reasonable economic return. 
(2)  The applicant demonstrates that the buildings are not physically suitable for residential use; and 
(3)  Not less than 51 percent of abutting properties are devoted to non-residential uses. 
2.  Conversion of existing buildings and new infill development in underlying residential districts shall be done so that the redevelopment complements the existing adjacent buildings and area. 
a.  Buildings shall be designed to be compatible with adjacent residential dwellings and shall incorporate the architectural style of existing adjacent buildings. 
b.  New development or redevelopment of existing buildings, additions and conversions shall be compatible with the existing surrounding architecture and character of the area so that the exterior of the building appears to have been constructed at the same time as the existing buildings. 
c.  Parking for office use or multi-family residential shall be provided on-site and located in the rear of the building. Parking shall be screened from view of abutting residences and residential districts with a type A bufferyard located between the parking and the property line in conformance with section 35-59. 
d.  Multi-family development in ROD. Vacant lots may be developed as multi-family residential and existing large residential dwelling units may be converted to multi- family residential provided that the proposed multi-family use is located adjacent to existing multi-family dwellings such as an apartment building, provided, however, in no case shall a multi- family unit be permitted where said use abuts a single-family residence. For purposes of this subsection, a building shall be considered "abutting" if it lies on property which (1) shares a common property line; or (2) is immediately across a street designed as a local or collector street. 
e.  Setbacks of new construction shall be in conformance with the underlying district. However, in the case where adjacent buildings were constructed prior to the adoption of the zoning ordinance and the setbacks vary, then the setback for the new construction shall be the average of the abutting existing buildings that either share common property lines or are immediately across a local or collector street. In the case where the infill development abuts vacant lots and/or other buildings of varying front yard and side yard setbacks, the setbacks shall be established in accordance with section 35-51. 
f.  The building or structure heights shall conform to the underlying district. However, where adjacent buildings were constructed prior to the adoption of the zoning ordinance and the height of the abutting buildings exceed the height allowed in the underlying zoning district, then the height for the new construction may not exceed the average height of the abutting existing buildings.  
Sec. 35-31. - Airport Overlay District. 
The Airport Overlay District (AOD) special height regulations, as mandated by the Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Aviation Regulations, 14 C.F.R. Part 77,1996, which are incorporated by reference hereto, shall apply to any land airport, other than a helicopter landing facility, owned and operated by a public agency, and shall be applied in combination with the underlying zoning district classification. The location of the AOD boundaries are generally shown on the zoning map. The airport layout plan (ALP), on file at the Jefferson City Memorial Airport, shall be referred to for the exact location of AOD boundaries, and all development shall be in compliance with the ALP and the applicable Federal Aviation Regulations.  
Sec. 35-32. - Flood hazard overlay district. 
Development within the Flood Hazard Overlay District (FHOD) shall be in conformance with chapter 8, article VI of the Code, which is incorporated by reference hereto. These standards shall be applied in combination with the underlying zoning district classification. The FHOD boundaries are generally shown on the zoning map. The exact location of the flood hazard boundaries for a lot or parcel shall be as indicated on the current flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for the area in which the particular lot or parcel is located.

Sec. 35-42. - Specific use standards for telecommunications facilities. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the placement, construction and modification of telecommunication towers, support structures, and antennas in order to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public, while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in the City of Jefferson. Specifically, this section is intended to: 
1.  Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities and systems to serve the citizens and businesses of the City of Jefferson; 
2.  Minimize adverse visual impacts of communications antennas and support structures through the careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
3.  Maximize the use of existing and new support structures so as to minimize the need to construct new or additional facilities; 
4.  Maximize the co-location of facilities on any new support structures and facilitate the fewest and least visible new support structures capable of achieving these objectives; 
5.  Ensure that any new telecommunications tower or support structure is located in an area compatible with the neighborhood or surrounding community to the extent possible; and 
6.  Ensure that regulation of telecommunications towers and structures does not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and does not unreasonably discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  All towers, antenna support structures and telecommunications facilities, any portion of which are located within the City of Jefferson, are subject to this section. All towers within the City of Jefferson, Missouri at the time of passage of this section shall be registered with the Director within 60 days from the effective date hereof, together with the height, width and location thereof, and a registration fee of $50.00. Failure to register an existing tower shall raise a presumption that said tower was not a legal nonconforming use on the date of passage of this section. However, this section shall not apply to tower structures used, or to be used, solely for services provided pursuant to a broadcast radio or television license issued by the Federal Communications Commission or to towers and antennas used solely for private telecommunications services when the equipment is located on the premises of the entity using said private telecommunication service, or the towers and antennas, support structure, or masts are located on the primary business premises of a provider of communications services if used solely to monitor the provider's services and the equipment used by the broadcaster. Provided the private telecommunicator or provider is in compliance with any federal, state, or local laws, and does not encroach on the public rights-of-way. 
2.  Notwithstanding any provisions contained in this section, any current legal use being made of an existing tower or antenna support structure on the effective date of this section shall be allowed to continue as a non-conforming structure. Any tower site that has received city approval in the form of either a conditional use permit or building permit, but has not yet been constructed or located within six months of the date of the permit, shall be considered a non-permitted structure. 
3.  The term "telecommunications facilities" shall not include: 
a.  Any satellite dish two meters in diameter or less which is located in an area zoned and used for industrial or commercial; 
b.  Any satellite earth station antenna one meter or less in diameter, regardless of zoning category; 
c.  Any satellite earth station in excess of two meters in diameter which is utilized for the reception of broadcast television, video or radio signals and which is an ancillary use to a structure on the premises of the holder of the broadcast license. 
4.  The term "this section" throughout section 35-42 refers to section 35-42 in its entirety. 
C.  Legislative findings. 
1.  On February 8, 1996, congress enacted the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 P.L. No. 104-104. The purpose of the Act included deregulation of the telecommunications industry and providing a more competitive environment for wired and wireless telecommunication services in the United States. 
2.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 preserves the authority of the City to regulate the placement, construction and modification of towers and antenna support structures and to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public. 
3.  The City has been granted the authority to enact legislation to regulate the construction, placement and operation of telecommunications towers and antennas pursuant to its zoning powers established in RSMo ch. 89 and additionally pursuant to its general and specific police powers established by statute authorizing the regulations herein to protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
4.  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has exclusive jurisdiction over (1) the regulation of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions from telecommunications facilities, and (2) the regulation of radio signal interference among users of the radio frequency spectrum. 
5.  Consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the regulations of this section will not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and do not unreasonably discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service. The regulations also impose reasonable restrictions to protect the public safety and welfare and ensure opportunities for placement of antennas with prompt approval by the City. This section does not attempt to regulate in areas within the exclusive jurisdiction of the FCC. 
6.  The uncontrolled proliferation of towers in the City of Jefferson is threatened without adoption of new regulations and would diminish property values, the aesthetic quality of the city, and would otherwise threaten the health, safety, and welfare of the public. 
D.  Timing. Applications for telecommunication facility permits or conditional use permits pursuant to this section shall be subject to the supplementary procedures in this section. Applications shall be submitted to the City as a complete application. A "complete application" shall be an application submitted on the forms provided by the City, fully executed by the applicant, identifying the specific approval sought, and containing all attachments, fees and information as required thereon or by the City, consistent with this section. Applications for telecommunication facility permits shall be accompanied by a building permit application and other applicable forms. Applications shall include application fees as may be established to reimburse the City for its inspection and review costs. 
1.  Co-location requests. A final decision on applications to co-locate wireless communication facilities on an existing telecommunication tower shall be made no later than 90 days after receipt of a complete application from an applicant, unless extended by the City for good cause or by consent of the applicant. 
2.  Other applications and new support structures. A final decision on all other applications under this section, including but not limited to applications for new telecommunication towers, shall be made no later than 150 days after receipt of a complete application from an applicant, unless such period is extended by the City for good cause or by consent of the applicant. 
3.  Incomplete applications. Within 30 days after receipt of an incomplete application, the Director shall provide notice to the applicant stating that the application is incomplete and generally identifying the code provisions or application requirements not satisfied or information not provided that the applicant must satisfy for a complete application commencing the City's review process. Nothing in this procedure shall alter the affirmative obligation of each applicant to review the applicable code and satisfy all applicable provisions as may apply to the applicant's specific submission. 
E.  General requirements. The requirements set forth in this section shall be applicable to all towers, antennas and other telecommunication facilities installed, built, or modified after the effective date of this section to the full extent permitted by law.

In addition to any other approvals required by this section, no antenna or tower shall be erected or expanded prior to receipt of a certificate of zoning authorization and the issuance of a building permit. 
5.  Regulatory compliance. All antennas and towers shall meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, FCC and any other state or federal agency with the authority to regulate communications antennas and towers. Should such standards or regulations be amended, then the owner shall bring such devices and structure into compliance with the revised standards or regulations within the time period mandated by the controlling agency. No approval for any placement, construction or modification of any antenna or structure permitted by this section shall be granted for any applicant having an uncured violation of this section or any other governmental regulatory requirement related to such antenna or structures within the City. 
6.  Excess capacity and planned future use. Any applicant for a building permit to install, build or modify any tower shall furnish the Director a statement of the excess capacity of the tower and plans, if any, for anticipated growth. In addition, the applicant must design the tower and indicate on the application that the tower will accommodate at least one additional antenna similar to the principal antenna. 
F.  Co-location. 
1.  Co-location of facilities on new towers. New towers constructed within the City shall be capable of accommodating at least one additional carrier or telecommunications facility for one other provider of communications services (hereinafter referred to as "additional capacity"). A report describing the tower's ability to support additional capacity shall be submitted with the application. Technical limitations regarding disguised support structures shall include limitations as are necessary to maintain the requirements of a disguised support structure. The willful knowing failure of the owner of a tower built for shared use to negotiate in good faith with potential wireless service provider users shall be unlawful and shall be a violation of this section and, among other remedies of the City, shall be cause for the withholding of future permits to the same owner or applicant to install, build or modify wireless communications facilities within the City. The approval authority may waive this requirement for disguised support structures if the applicant submits a written request demonstrating that compliance cannot be achieved without violating one or more of the definitional requirements of a disguised support structure. 
2.  Co-location on existing towers. Owners of existing towers shall make such support structures available for use by other wireless service providers subject to reasonable technical limitations and reasonable financial terms. Technical limitations regarding disguised support structures shall include limitations as are necessary to maintain the requirements of a disguised support structure. The willful and knowing failure of a structure owner to agree to shared use or to negotiate in good faith with potential users shall be unlawful and shall, among other remedies of the City, be cause for the withholding of future permits to the same owner to install, build, or modify telecommunication facilities within the City. 
3.  Shared use violations. Any party believing that the applicant has breached its duty to negotiate in good faith for shared use shall immediately notify the applicant and the Director in writing. The Director may reject the application upon a finding that shared use has been improperly denied. A notice of breach of duty shall explain the precise basis for the claim and shall be accompanied by payment of the telecommunication facility permit review fee, as outlined in appendix Y, to the City to be used to offset the cost of review. After the applicant's receipt of the notice, the applicant shall have ten calendar days to provide a written submission to the Director responding to the alleged violation of the shared use requirement. If deemed necessary by the Director, he/she may engage, at the cost of the party alleging the violation, a neutral, qualified technical consultant to provide an opinion on feasibility or costs of the shared use request. If the Director receives a notice alleging a violation of the shared use requirement, the time for a decision on an administrative permit is automatically extended for up to 30 days or until the Director has determined that the applicant has complied. Nothing herein shall be deemed to create a cause of action for relief against the City or entitlement to any relief, process or enforcement other than review by the City as provided herein. An application for a new telecommunication tower shall not be deemed complete for acceptance until all information necessary for a decision on compliance has been provided by the applicant. 
G.  Tower inventories. Prior to the issuance of any permit to install, build or modify any support structure, such applicant shall furnish the Director an inventory of all support structures owned or controlled by the applicant and by proposed antenna user (if the proposed antenna user is different from the applicant), and all towers owned by any person located within one and one-half miles of the proposed structure. The inventory shall include the structure or antenna reference name or number, the street location, latitude and longitude, structure type, height, type and mounting height of existing antennas, assessment of available space for mounting of additional antennas and an assessment of available ground space for the placement of additional equipment shelters. 
H.  Notice of tower applications. Prior to any application for the construction of a new telecommunication tower, a copy of the application or a summary containing the height, design, location and type and frequency of antennas shall be delivered by certified mail to all known potential tower users within the City, including but not limited to all companies providing wireless internet and commercial mobile radio services in the City, and such other potential users, if any, identified on a schedule maintained by the Director. Proof of such delivery shall be documented by the applicant with the application to the City. The Director may establish a form required to be used for such notifications and establish other procedures consistent with and as may facilitate compliance with this section. Any party seeking shared use of a telecommunication tower subject to this provision shall, after responding to notice of an application, negotiate with the applicant for such use. The applicant may on a legitimate and reasonable business basis choose between multiple requests for shared use on the same tower, and may reject any request where legitimate technical obstacles cannot be reasonably overcome or where the party requesting shared use will not agree to reasonable financial terms. The Director shall, before deciding on the application or forwarding it to the Approval Authority for review, allow all persons receiving notice at least 15 calendar days to respond to the City and the applicant and request that the party receiving notice be permitted to share the proposed tower or locate within one mile of such area. The failure of the receiving party to use this process or respond to any such notice shall be considered cause for denying requests by such party for new telecommunication towers. 
I.  Exception from maximum height and bufferyards. 
1.  Where, as determined by the director, additional co-location opportunities on an existing tower constructed prior to September 8, 1997, are not practical without an increase in the height of the tower, a permittee of an existing tower may modify the height of its tower to accommodate co-location of additional telecommunications facilities as long as the total height of the tower and telecommunications facilities attached thereto does not exceed ten percent of the height of the existing tower or 20 feet, whichever is greater. 
2.  Permission to exceed the maximum permitted height pursuant to this subsection shall not require an additional distance separation as set forth in exhibit 35-42A and exhibit 35-42B, nor additional bufferyards or landscaping above that required for the original tower. The tower's premodification height shall be used to calculate such distance separations. 
J.  Same tower type. A tower which is modified to accommodate the co-location of additional telecommunications facilities shall be of the same tower type as the existing tower. However, a different type of tower may be permitted by the approval authority pursuant to subsection 35-72.G. 
K.  Movement of tower. 
1.  A tower which is being replaced to accommodate the co-location of additional telecommunications facilities may be moved on the same premises as it was constructed on, or to an adjacent premises, within 50 feet of its existing location as long as required setbacks and bufferyards are maintained. 
2.  A tower that is relocated pursuant to this subsection shall continue to be measured from the original tower site for the purpose of calculating the separation distances between towers pursuant to exhibit 35-42B. 
3.  Prior to the relocation of a tower within a residential area, notice shall be given to adjacent property owners within 185 feet of the proposed tower site. 
L.  Location on government property.

Any telecommunications facilities and antennas located on the roof or sides of a building shall comply with setbacks required by the City's adopted building code, if any, and shall not extend more than 50 inches in the horizontal plane from the side of such structure unless the purpose of said protrusion is to permit signal coverage in an area that will not receive such coverage but for an extension beyond 50 inches. Any extension beyond 50 inches must be approved by the Director prior to construction of said antenna and such approval shall be dependent upon a showing that coverage is unavailable but for the extension, that the extension does not violate any other building code of the city, state or federal law that is applicable, encroach upon public rights-of-ways, and the extension does not pose any danger to the traveling public. 
d.  The telecommunications facility will be side-mounted to an antenna support structure so as to exhibit a minimal profile or will utilize camouflaging techniques in order that the telecommunications facility will harmonize with the character and environment of the area in which it is located. Antennas and support structures shall be painted to blend with the color of the building if such painting will not interfere with functioning of the antenna or support structure. Antennas and support structures shall meet the design and construction standards of subsection 35-42.Q. 
e.  All requirements of section 35-42, the zoning code, and the City Code shall be met. 
f.  Facilities located within a National Register Historic Overlay District shall obtain a special exception permit in accordance with subsection 35-42.P.1. 
N.  Telecommunication facilities as a conditional use. 
1.  The placement of telecommunication facilities is a conditional use in several districts as set forth in exhibit 35-28 and this section. All proposals to install, build or modify an antenna or support structure as a conditional use shall require the approval of a conditional use permit following a duly advertised public hearing by the Board of Adjustment, subject to the following. 
a.  Applications. Applications for conditional use permits shall be filed and processed subject to and in the manner and timeframe as established in subsection 35-73.A of the Zoning Code and, in addition to such other requirements, shall be accompanied by the applicable fee for a conditional use permit application and a deposit of funds, as outlined in appendix Y, for reimbursement of professional service and staff review costs, or such other deposit amount as may be established by the approval authority reasonably necessary to reimburse the City for such anticipated costs and fees for legal, engineering, contractual or other consultant services determined by the City to be needed in review or action on the application. Any amount not used by the City shall be refunded to the applicant upon written request after a final decision. 
b.  Additional minimum requirements. No conditional use permit shall be issued unless the applicant has clearly demonstrated by substantial evidence that placement of a telecommunication facility as a permitted or accessory use pursuant to exhibit 35-28 or subsection 35-42.M is not technologically or economically feasible. The City may consider current industry standards and practices, among other information, in determining feasibility. 
c.  Decision. A decision by the approval authority shall be accompanied by substantial evidence supporting the decision, which shall be made a part of the written record of the meeting at which a final decision on the application is rendered. Evidence may be submitted with the application or thereafter, or presented during the public hearing by the applicant or others. 
d.  Findings required. In addition to the determinations or limitations specified herein and by subsection 35-73.A for the consideration of conditional use permits, no conditional use permit shall be approved by the governing body unless findings in the affirmative are made that the following conditions exist: 
(1)  No existing towers, structures or buildings within the necessary geographic area for the applicant's tower meet the applicant's necessary engineering requirements considering: (a) height; (b) structural strength; (c) resulting signal interference; (d) feasibility of retrofitting; (e) feasibility of redesigning the applicant's tower network; or (f) other limiting conditions that render existing towers, structures or buildings within the applicant's required geographic area unsuitable. 
(2)  That the design of the tower or structure, including the antenna, shelter and ground layout maximally reduces visual degradation and otherwise complies with the provisions and intent of this section. New towers shall be of a monopole design, unless it is shown that an alternative design would equally or better satisfy this provision. 
(3)  That the proposal minimizes the number and/or height, size, and visibility of towers or structures that will be required in the area. Where alternate technology or design exists or is reasonably available that would satisfy the general need for the proposal, this factor is ordinarily not satisfied. 
(4)  That the applicant has not previously failed to take advantage of reasonably available co-location opportunities or procedures provided by this section or otherwise. 
(5)  That no land owned by any agency of the federal or state government, or by any political subdivision of the state, is available for locating the structure or tower. 
e.  If any one of the findings is not satisfied, approval may be granted only on a finding of unique circumstances otherwise necessitating approval to satisfy the purposes of this section. 
f.  Additional limitations. 
(1)  No tower shall be approved at a height exceeding 150 feet AGL unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that such height is required for the proper function of the applicant's system. Such showing must also be supported by the opinion of a telecommunications consultant hired by the City at the expense of the applicant. The opinion of the consultant shall include a statement that no available alternatives exist to exceeding the height limit including but not limited to the use of two or more telecommunication towers, and the reason why such alternatives are not viable. 
(2)  A conditional use permit shall not be issued for any telecommunication facility that the Board of Adjustment determines would create a significant negative visual impact or otherwise have a significant negative impact on the historical character and quality of any property within a historic preservation district or such district as a whole. 
(3)  A decision by the Board of Adjustment shall be accompanied by substantial evidence supporting the decision which shall be made a part of the written record of the meeting at which a final decision on the application is rendered. Evidence shall be under oath and may be submitted with the application or thereafter or presented during the public hearing by the applicant or others. 
O.  Telecommunication facilities within a PUD district. 
1.  Applications for telecommunication facilities located on property zoned PUD Planned Unit Development shall be processed in accordance with subsection 35-74.C with review by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council (rather than the Board of Adjustment). 
2.  Findings required. When considering applications for telecommunication facilities greater than 70 feet in height in PUD Districts, the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council shall base their decisions upon, and shall make findings as to, the existence of the required findings and conditions contained within subsection 35-42.N and subsection 35-73.A. 
3.  Towers located in districts zoned PUD shall adhere to the standards and requirements of section 35-42. Variations from the standards and requirements may be approved by the City Council upon finding that such variations would: 
a.  Not eliminate an adequate supply of light or air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion in the public street, increase the danger of fire, or endanger the safety of the public; 
b.  Not be unduly injurious to the use and enjoyment of adjacent property nor substantially diminish property values in the neighborhood; and 
c.  Be in keeping with the general spirit and intent of this chapter. 
P.  Telecommunication facilities located within a National Register Historic Overlay District and small wireless facilities located within a Single Family Residential District. 
1.  Telecommunication facilities located within a National Register Historic Overlay District shall be a special exception use and subject to the requirements of subsection 35-73.D.

31 to 45 feet 	30 feet 	40 
 
e.  Transition area between public and semi-public buildings in a Residential District. A minimum side yard width of 30 feet shall be maintained between a school, library, church, community building and other public and semi-public building and a Residential District. Outside recreational structures shall be set back a minimum of 30 feet from any abutting residential district line. 
f.  Frontage on lot split by districts. Where a frontage is divided among two or more different zoning districts with different front setback requirements, the deepest front setback required shall apply to the entire frontage. 
g.  Measurement of front/side setback depth. Where an official line has been established for the future widening or opening of a street or major thoroughfare upon which a lot abuts, then the depth of a front or side setback shall be measured from such official line to the nearest line of the building. 
h.  Minimum setback from all streets. A front yard shall be provided adjacent to all streets, including corner lots, double frontage lots and other lots with multiple street frontages, as required in exhibit 35-51A. 
i.  Establishment of front setback in blocks with varied front setback depths. Where, on the effective date of this ordinance, 40 percent or more of a frontage was occupied by two or more buildings, then the front setback shall be established in the following manner: 
(1)  Where the furthest building from the street provides a front setback not more than ten feet deeper than the building closest to the street, then the front setback for the frontage is and remains an average of the then existing front setbacks (see exhibit 35-51B-2). 
(2)  Where (1) is not the case and a lot is within 100 feet of a building on each side, then the front setback is a line drawn from the closest front corners of these adjacent buildings. 
(3)  Where neither (1) nor (2) is the case, and the lot is within 100 feet of an existing building on one side only, then the front setback is the same as that of the existing adjacent building. 
(4)  Garage entries which face a street shall be set back a minimum of 25 feet from the property line regardless of adjacent building setbacks. 
j.  Establishment of side setback in districts in blocks with varied side setback depths. If 40 percent or more of a frontage is occupied by two or more buildings, then the minimum width of a side setback shall be established in the following manner: 
(1)  The minimum side setback width shall be and remains the average of the then existing side setbacks included in a frontage, provided, however, that existing side setbacks having a width greater than ten feet shall be deemed to have a width of ten feet for purposes of computing the average. Side setbacks for vacant lots shall not be included in computing the average. 
(2)  If the computed average side setback is less than ten feet, and the existing side setback of the applicant's building is less than ten feet, an existing building may be enlarged provided that front and rear yard requirements are observed and the widths of the existing side setbacks of the applicant's building are not diminished. 
k.  Setback of gasoline service station pumps. Gasoline station pumps and pump islands may occupy required yards provided that they are not less than 20 feet from all lot lines. Centrally supported canopies which extend above and cover filling station pump islands may occupy required yards provided they are not less than 15 feet from all lot lines. 
6.  Lot coverage. All buildings hereafter designed or erected and existing buildings which may be reconstructed, altered, moved or enlarged shall not exceed the maximum building coverage regulations of the district in which they may be located. Lot coverage is measured as the percentage of the total lot area covered by buildings and other impervious surfaces and is calculated by dividing the square footage of impervious cover by the square footage of the lot.

Sec. 35-54. - Cluster subdivision and compact housing provisions. 
A.  Purpose and intent. Cluster subdivisions and compact housing developments may be authorized according to the provisions of this section to preserve environmentally-sensitive areas, open space and agricultural lands. The intent of this section is to authorize a developer to decrease lot sizes and leave the land "saved" by so doing as open space or conservation areas, thereby lowering development costs and increasing the amenity of the project without increasing the density beyond what would be permissible if the land were subdivided into the size of lots required by the underlying zoning district. 
B.  Applications. 
1.  Cluster subdivision. (Where subdivision of land is involved; processed concurrently with major or minor subdivision). Applications for cluster subdivision shall be simultaneously processed as a (i) special exception use permit under the zoning code in conformance with subsection 35-73.D, and (ii) according to the requirements for major or minor subdivision, as appropriate. All such submissions shall be labeled "Cluster Subdivision." 
2.  Compact housing development. (Where subdivision of land is not involved). Applications for compact housing developments shall be processed as a special exception use permit in conformance with subsection 35-73.D. All such submissions shall be labeled "Compact Housing Development." 
C.  Permitted zoning districts. A developer may create a cluster subdivision or compact housing development in a standard residential zoning district which includes lots that are smaller and arranged differently than those required by the underlying zoning district regulations if the application conforms to this section. 
D.  Housing types. Housing types within a cluster subdivision or compact housing development shall be as authorized by the underlying zoning district, shown in exhibit 35-28, Land use matrix; and subject to exhibit 35-54A and the additional standards of this section. 
E.  Project size and density. There is no minimum or maximum acreage limitation for a cluster subdivision. The maximum allowable residential density shall not exceed the maximum density allowed in the underlying zoning district. Maximum allowable residential density shall be calculated by using exhibit 35-51A, units/acre. 
F.  Lot dimension and setback requirements. 
1.  There are no prescribed minimum lot dimensions. Lot widths and depths shall be sufficient to accommodate the use and minimum building setbacks required for the housing type. 
2.  Zero lot line development may transfer all or part of the side setback to one side; such that one side may be zero if the opposite side setback is 20 feet. No mechanical equipment, roof overhang, or object attached to or associated with the dwelling unit may overhang the lot line. 
3.  No side setback is required on the interior or "attached" side of an attached dwelling. 
4.  For buildings containing more than one dwelling unit, the front, side and rear yard setbacks listed in exhibit 35-54A shall be measured from the perimeter of the building. 
5.  A minimum of 20 feet must be provided between multiple family buildings on the same parcel or lot. 
6.  The preliminary and final subdivision plats shall indicate all setback lines for all proposed buildings and upon all proposed lots, including designation of all "zero" lot lines.

5 See subsection 35-54.F for setbacks required between multiple family buildings on the same parcel. 
G.  Required open space, how calculated. The amount of open space or conservation area which must be set aside shall be determined as follows: 
1.  Cluster subdivisions. The amount of open space or conservation area which must be set aside in cluster subdivisions shall be based on the difference between the total area contained within all cluster lots and the total area which would have been contained within an equivalent number of standard lots based on the minimum lot requirements of exhibit 35-51A according to the zoning district in which the project is located. All lot reductions shall be compensated for by an equivalent amount of land in open space or common area to preserve and maintain in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
2.  Compact housing development. All land within a compact housing development not covered by buildings, parking lots or streets shall be reserved as common land and open space. 
H.  Open space standards.

2.  Measurement method. The meter sensor shall be mounted not more than six inches above ground level in a horizontal position. Readings shall be taken only after the cell has been exposed long enough to provide a constant reading. Measurements shall be made after dark when the light source in question is turned on, then when it is turned off. The difference between the two readings shall be compared to the maximum permitted illumination and property line at ground level. This procedure eliminates the effects of moonlight and other ambient light. 
I.  Lighting curfews. 
1.  On all nonresidential properties which contain four or more parking lots or display lot light poles, maximum outdoor lighting levels shall be reduced by at least 50 percent of the permitted level after the close of business, or after 11:00 p.m., whichever is later, by dimming parking lot lighting levels or by turning off 50 percent of the parking lot lights. 
(Ord. No. 14982, § 3, 6-18-2012)  
Sec. 35-58. - Off-street parking and loading. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of required parking spaces is to provide enough off-street parking to accommodate the majority of traffic generated by the range of uses permitted by the site development plan. The application of these standards will improve compatibility and the appearance of such facilities, provide relief from unshaded paved areas and reduce heat gain associated with parking areas. 
B.  Off-street parking requirements. This section sets minimum standards for off-street parking requirements for land uses and developments including new construction and expansion of or changes to existing land uses. A site plan shall be required for new construction, and changes to an existing parking lot, in conformance with section 35-71. The parking lot site plan may be incorporated with the development plans for a building or project. The site plan shall include the details indicating compliance with the standards in this section. 
1.  Land uses for which parking must be provided. Exhibit 35-58A shows the off-street parking requirements for various land uses and developments.

a.  Uses not identified. The Director shall determine the parking requirement for uses which do not correspond to the categories listed in Exhibit 35-58A. In such instances, the applicant shall provide adequate information by which the proposal can be reviewed, which includes but may not necessarily be limited to the following: 
(1)  Type of uses; 
(2)  Number of employees; 
(3)  Building design capacity; 
(4)  Square feet of sales area, service area, etc.; 
(5)  Parking spaces proposed on-site; 
(6)  Parking spaces provided elsewhere; and 
(7)  Hours of operation. 
b.  Minimum number of spaces required. The minimum number of parking spaces required for vehicle parking shall be as indicated in exhibit 35-58A, however, if the adopted fire code has a more restrictive requirement based on the fire code occupancy rating, the number of parking spaces shall be in conformance with the adopted fire code/occupancy requirements. 
c.  Computation. Parking spaces computed for the primary use of the site shall take precedence over the computation of parking spaces based on floor area. 
d.  Multiple uses within the building. When more than one type of use that has a parking requirement is located within the building and at least 20 percent of the gross floor area is devoted to that use, the parking needs for that use shall be calculated separately from the other uses. For example, a 20,000 square foot building with 5,000 square feet of office space and 15,000 square feet of warehouse space would require 17 parking spaces for the office and 15 parking spaces for the warehouse space for a total of 32 parking spaces. 
e.  Shared parking facilities. Off-street parking requirements of a given use may be met with off-site or off-street parking facilities of another use when and if, all of the following conditions are met: 
(1)  The location shall comply with the provisions of subsection 35-58.B.4; 
(2)  The parking demands of the individual uses, as determined by the Director based upon parking demand information supplied by the applicant or other sources, are such that the total parking demand of all the uses at any one time is less than the total parking stalls required; and 
(3)  A written agreement between the owners and lessees is executed for a minimum of five years, approved by the Director, recorded, and a copy maintained in the project file. Should the lease expire or otherwise terminate, the use for which the off-site parking was provided shall be considered a violation. Any and all approvals, including special exception use or conditional use permits, shall be subject to revocation. Continuation or expansion of the use shall be prohibited unless the use is brought into compliance with the parking regulations of this ordinance. 
f.  Temporary use of unpaved parking facilities. The use of an unpaved off-street parking lot may be authorized for a maximum of six months, provided the location, construction and design of same shall be first approved by the Director. 
2.  Exceptions to required number of spaces. 
a.  Reduced parking for uses near municipal parking lots. Where there is a municipal parking lot within 500 feet, the parking spaces required for non-residential uses and mixed uses may be reduced by ten percent of the total spaces in the municipal lot or lots. Where ten percent of the municipal spaces are equal to or exceed the spaces required for the use, the parking requirements are satisfied. 
b.  Reduced parking for uses with adjacent on-street parking. 
(1)  Where on-street parking exists on a street adjacent to a new or expanded use located within the Old Town District, as defined in chapter 25, the required number of off street parking spaces for the new or expanded use may be reduced by one space for each 25 feet of frontage on the street, with a maximum reduction for a single parcel as follows: 
(a)  For single-family and multi-family residential uses: one space per unit up to a maximum reduction for a single parcel of five spaces. 
(b)  For non-residential uses: a maximum reduction of five spaces for a single parcel. Where the five space reduction is equal to or exceeds the spaces required for the use, the parking requirements are satisfied. 
(2)  Reduction of required parking granted by this subsection shall not grant exclusive use or ownership of adjacent on-street parking spaces nor shall prevent the City from eliminating or otherwise modifying on-street parking. 
c.  Reduced on-site parking with parking management plan. The Director may reduce the number of required parking spaces up to 25 percent when the applicant provides a parking management plan. The parking management plan shall include transportation alternatives such as shared-ride programs, carpooling and vanpooling programs, transit and commuter use, shared parking and other off-site parking that reduce the need for parking spaces. Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or approval of a business license, the applicant shall provide evidence that such parking management plans exist. The evidence must include copies of any contracts, lease agreements, purchase agreements and other documentation showing that such transportation alternatives have occurred or are about to occur. The evidence shall report the number of participants involved, the percentage of the maximum work force participating in the parking management plan, the number and types of vehicles used and the percentage of parking spaces normally used by the employees. The applicant shall record a covenant, the content and form of which shall be approved by the Director, which binds all successors in title to the commitments approved and the applicant shall include a clause in all leases which binds all tenants to this commitment made by the applicant. No change in the approved plans shall take place without a review by the Director. Approval of the parking management plan does not relieve the applicant of an ongoing requirement to provide off-street parking spaces if demand increases. 
d.  Variance in parking requirements. The Director shall have the authority to vary the parking requirement, by up to 20 percent of the required parking, if one or more of the following circumstances exists: 
(1)  Expected automobile ownership or use patterns of employees, tenants, or other users varies from what is typical in the community or typical for the use. 
(2)  The parking demand varies throughout the day in relation to parking supply. 
(3)  The nature of operational aspects of the use warrants unique parking arrangements. 
(4)  Actual parking practice in the community demonstrates that the parking standard may be too high. 
3.  Parking in C-3 Central Commercial District, Large Office Buildings. Structured parking rather than surface parking shall be required for office buildings or other uses in the C-3 district that exceed 75,000 square feet for office use. 
4.  Location. 
a.  The parking area shall be provided on the same parcel as the principal use or structure wherever practicable. 
b.  Off-site parking for non-residential uses shall be located within 450 feet of the site, on land which is zoned for parking lot use as shown in exhibit 35-28. 
c.  Parking for multi-family dwellings shall be located on the same lot as the main building, or within 100 feet thereof, on land which is zoned for parking lot use as shown in exhibit 35-28. 
d.  Parking for single-family and two-family dwellings shall be located on the same lot with the building, 
e.  All off-street parking spaces shall be located off the City right-of-way and parked vehicles shall not overhang onto the City right-of-way or abutting property. 
5.  Parking lot landscaping. The minimum landscaping requirements of this section are intended to improve air quality, to reduce heat and glare, and add to the aesthetic quality of our living environment. Trees appreciably reduce the dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air, are proven producers of oxygen, and play a vital role, through transpiration and otherwise, in purifying the air we breathe. Trees are valuable physical and aesthetic community assets in that they provide cooling shade, reduce noise levels and glare, and break the monotony of large parking areas and other human developments. A variety of species of trees is encouraged to reduce the impact of potential disease or insect infestations, and to provide variety in shape, texture and seasonal color. 
a.  Relationship to other required landscaping, screening and buffering. Bufferyard and perimeter landscaping may also be required, in accordance with section 35-59 or other applicable sections of this ordinance. Parking lot landscaping shall not be counted toward the satisfaction of bufferyard or screening required by section 35-59 and other applicable sections of this ordinance. Where specific parking lot landscaping provisions exist, such as applicable to big box/superstore developments in section 35-41, those provisions shall prevail. 
b.  General requirements. Landscape plantings shall be installed on any parking lots containing more than ten spaces. Such plantings may, with a permit issued by the City Forester, be in public right-of-way adjacent to the parking lot. Such plantings shall consist of the number of standard canopy trees from the approved planting list needed to shade at least 35 percent of the parking lot when the trees are mature (see definition in article IX and approved tree lists in appendix A). The amount of shade provided by a mature tree shall be the area contained within the perimeter of the tree's leaf canopy projected vertically to the ground. The canopy diameter of a mature specie of tree shall be based on the Manual of Woody Landscape Plants, Michael A. Dirr, 4th Edition, published by Stipes Publishing Company, Champaign, Illinois, 1990, or latest edition. The required trees shall not be concentrated in a few areas but shall be distributed throughout the entire lot. 
c.  Protection from vehicular encroachment. All landscaped areas shall be protected from vehicular encroachment by curbing or anchored wheel stops. Planting islands shall be at least four feet wide and 100 square feet to protect trees and vegetation from bumper overhang and swinging doors. Plantings shall be located to minimize damage caused by door or bumper overhang. 
d.  Areas between trees. Land between trees shall be covered with shrubs, grass or other living groundcover, or non-living groundcover. 
e.  Large parking lots containing 150 spaces or more. 
(1)  Maximum lot size. No parking area shall contain more than 150 spaces. If a greater number is required, separate parking spaces of not more than 150 spaces shall be provided and shall be separated by a landscaped area at least ten feet in width. The use of berms and evergreen trees in the landscaped strip is encouraged but not mandated. Up to ten percent of the length of the strip may be opened to permit pedestrian and vehicular access between parking areas. 
(2)  The amount of shade provided by mature parking lot trees in large parking lots may be reduced to 25 percent in cases where the landscape plan makes effective use of berms, landscaped strips or landscaped areas within the interior of the parking lot. 
(3)  A minimum of three different species of trees is required in large parking lots to reduce the impact of potential disease or insect infestations, and to provide variety in shape, texture and color. 
f.  Plan required. Trees shall be installed in accordance with the plan approved by the appropriate approval authority and in accordance with the standards of this section. A plan shall not be approved unless it is directed toward the attainment of the purposes stated in subsections 5 and 5a above. The plan shall include a set of standard notes which indicates the planting detail and type of trees to be planted, including the Latin species and variety, cultivar and common name. 
g.  Planting detail. Trees shall be planted in accordance with the standard tree planting detail in appendix B-1 or B-2 as site conditions dictate. 
h.  Variance provision. If the property owner can prove that for reasons of rock or other unusual characteristics, such planting is not possible, this requirement may be varied by the Board of Adjustment. A variance, if granted, shall be limited to the minimum variance necessary to resolve, in whole or in part, the particular problem of the applicant. 
i.  Maintenance of plantings; and enforcement. 
(1)  Trees and shrubs shall be maintained in good condition and replaced where necessary to ensure the continuation of the planting or landscape plan as approved. Failure to maintain required trees in good condition and replace them when necessary shall be pursued as a violation of this ordinance. The Director shall have the power to prohibit parking until maintenance or replacement is completed provided that at least 45 days has elapsed since the notice of violation was sent. 
(2)  The landscape plantings shall be considered as an element of a project in the same manner as paved parking, building construction and materials, storm water drainage, and other elements. A building permit shall not be issued prior to the approval of the planting plan, except a building permit for only the footings and foundations of a structure may be issued prior to the approval of the planting plan, provided however, no parking lot paving shall be accomplished under said footing and foundation permit and, further provided, all plantings called for in the approved planting approval planting plan shall be installed prior to the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy. If, at the time of the request for the certificate the plantings cannot be installed or would be jeopardized by weather, an instrument signed by the owner specifying the materials will be installed in the next planting season may be accepted to allow the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy. 
6.  Minimum improvements and maintenance standards. Parking areas, automobile and truck sales lots, parking garages and driveways serving these areas shall conform with the following improvements and maintenance standards: 
a.  Paving requirement and classification. 
(1)  Exhibit 35-58B shows the paving classification and the type and thickness of paving material by general land use. 
(2)  Those parts of parking areas which may be subject to frequent heavy truck traffic area required to meet the standards for the heavy classification. Heavy truck traffic areas may include, but are not necessarily limited to, trash disposal areas, loading and unloading areas, and drives leading to such areas. 
(3)  A final decision on the need for light, medium or heavy classification will be made by the Director at the time an application for a building permit is filed.

(b)  Driveways serving overflow or seasonal parking lots or low traffic storage yards shall be paved from their intersection with the public street a minimum length of 25 feet beyond the right-of-way line. 
(c)  An existing driveway with less than the required width which serves an existing residential structure containing one or two dwelling units may nevertheless be paved. Where existing curb cuts or driveways are less than 12 feet they may be paved or rebuilt without increasing the width with approval from the Director. 
(4)  Driveways serving parking lots for multiple family units and non-residential uses shall be designed for either one-way or two-way traffic. Direction of traffic shall be indicated upon the site plan. 
(5)  Driveways and their driving lanes shall be subject to the additional standards of exhibit 35-58C. 
(6)  No part of a private drive approach or radius shall encroach upon the adjacent property. 
(7)  Abutting and common driveways. 
(a)  One- and two-family residential lots may abut their respective driveways, provided that each maintains the minimum width required, as measured from the property line in common to the edge of each respective driveway. 
(b)  Multiple family residential and commercial properties may abut driveways or may provide common driveways, upon approval by the Director. Adequate access and circulation must be ensured for each affected property, evidenced by access agreements and easements, to be submitted and approved with the site plan and recorded in the office of the Cole County Recorder of Deeds upon approval of the site plan.

Likewise, any walls, trees and shrubbery, as well as surfacing of the parking lot or garage, shall be maintained in good condition throughout its use for parking purposes and the Director shall prohibit the use of the area for parking purposes unless and until proper maintenance, repair or rehabilitation is completed. 
12.  Violation of standards. The Director shall prohibit parking in areas where the paving and landscape improvements do not meet the minimum improvement requirements which were in effect at the time the improvements were installed. Before prohibiting parking on any area, the Director shall notify the owner, in writing, of the work that shall be required to bring the area into compliance with the minimum improvement standards for off-street parking. Such improvements shall be completed within six months of such notification in conformance with Article VIII. 
C.  Off-street loading. 
1.  General. Site plans for proposed business, commercial or industrial uses shall show provisions for loading/unloading areas on the premises. These areas shall be reviewed for their impact on the site, the adjacent streets and the adjacent land uses. 
2.  Number and size of loading spaces. Loading spaces, a minimum size of 14 feet wide by 50 feet long with a minimum vertical clearance of 18 feet, shall be provided for new buildings and uses and expansions or modifications of existing uses as shown in exhibit 35-58G. 
3.  Standards for C-3 Central Commercial District. The Director shall have the authority to reduce the off-street loading requirements for a land use in the C-3 Central Commercial District by one space if acceptable alternatives exist which are consistent with current practice in the area.

Sec. 35-59. - Screening and bufferyard standards. 
A.  Purpose and intent. The intent of this section is to establish standards to protect and enhance community appearance with the installation of appropriate landscaping and screening materials within the City; to maintain and increase the value of land by incorporating a minimum amount of landscaping into development; to encourage prudent and skilled workmanship for the installation and maintenance of all plant materials; and to establish procedures and standards for the administration and enforcement of this ordinance. Developments shall comply with the requirements of all applicable sections. Parking lot landscaping required by section 35-58.B.5 shall not be counted toward the satisfaction of other landscaping and buffering required by this ordinance. 
B.  Landscape plans. Landscape plans for parking lot landscaping, screening and bufferyards shall accompany the site plan. Required landscape areas shall be designated as such on site development plans. Landscaping shall be installed as shown on the approved site plan. All changes shall be approved by the Director, unless otherwise specified in this ordinance. The landscape plans shall be drawn to the same scale as the site plan, and shall indicate the plant locations and schedule of the type, size, number and species of the plant material and the time for planting. 
C.  General landscape standards. All landscaping required by this ordinance shall comply with the following minimum standards. 
1.  Plant types. 
a.  Trees and shrubs shall be hardy and of a species common to or adapted to mid-Missouri, shall be matched to the site, and shall not be of nuisance type species. Trees that release fruit, nuts, large seed pods or similar materials are discouraged from being used where they abut the right-of-way and in parking lots. The applicant shall ensure that a mix of species, color, texture, and form are used. 
b.  Required landscaping shall be selected from the approved planting list, included as appendix A. Updates to the approved planting list shall be adopted by the Planning and Zoning Commission, and shall be reviewed from time-to-time by the City Forester to ensure the continued viability of listed plants. Manual of Woody Landscape Plants, Michael A. Dirr, 4th Edition, published by Stipes Publishing Company, Champaign, Illinois, 1990, or the latest edition, shall be referred to for size and characteristics of trees and shrubs. 
c.  Alternative varieties of trees and shrubs may be approved by the Director, subject to review of plant characteristics to ensure that the general landscape standards are met. 
2.  Use of existing landscaping. Existing landscaping may be used to meet the requirements of this ordinance provided it meets the purpose and intent of this ordinance and is included on the approved landscape plan. Such landscaping shall be protected during all phases of site development. 
3.  Minimum plant size at time of planting. The following minimum requirements shall apply to parking lot landscaping and plantings within required bufferyards: 
a.  Canopy trees: Canopy trees shall be deciduous, two inch caliper, measured six inches above the ground. 
b.  Conifer/evergreen trees: Five feet tall 
c.  Hedges/live barrier features: Shall be evergreen, one gallon container. 
d.  Understory plantings and deciduous shrubs: One gallon container 
e.  Groundcover: Living or non-living groundcover shall be spaced or applied according to nurseryman's specifications. 
f.  Turf grass: Seed, sod or plug, spaced or applied according to nurseryman's specifications. 
4.  Installation. Plants shall be installed in accordance Standard Tree Planting Detail or Standard Tree Planting Detail for Compacted Soils, promulgated by the Urban and Community Forestry Division of the Missouri Department of Conservation, included as Appendix B. All plant materials shall be installed prior to issuance of certificate of occupancy. A temporary certificate of occupancy (TCO) may be issued prior to installation of plant materials provided that a written assurance and a financial guarantee is furnished to the Director to insure the installation of required materials within six months of the issuance of the TCO. The financial guarantee shall be equal to two times the cost of the materials, estimated by the applicant's landscape architect, architect, land planner or nurseryman, and may be in the form a letter of credit, bond or cash. 
5.  Maintenance of landscape areas and plants. Areas not covered by vegetation shall be covered with gravel, cobble, rocks, mulch, wood chips, barks chips or similar natural materials three inches in depth to prevent weed growth, erosion and blowing dust. All plants shall be maintained in a healthy condition in accordance with generally accepted professional horticultural and arboricultural standards and practices such as recommended in ANSI Standard A-300. Plants which die or are unhealthy shall be replaced in accordance with the approved landscape plan. Regular pruning and trimming shall be applied to maintain health and to permit the plants to achieve their intended form and height. 
6.  Use of the public right-of-way. 
a.  Unless specifically permitted, no portion of the public right-of-way shall be used to meet the landscape requirements of this ordinance. 
b.  The Department of Parks and Recreation Forestry Division shall approve any and all trees authorized for planting on public right-of-way. 
c.  Irrigation systems on public right-of-way shall be approved by the Director prior to installation. 
7.  Use of utility easements. No utility easement may be used for required landscaping or bufferyard barrier feature unless approved in writing by the appropriate official of each affected utility. Evidence of such approval shall be (1) indicated by signature block upon the landscape plan or (2) by letter submitted with the landscape plan. Where specifically permitted to be used for the required landscaping, the plantings on utility easements shall be limited to small canopy trees, shrubs and hedges, ground covers and turf grass. Each medium or large canopy tree required by this section may be replaced by two small canopy trees if required by the utility company official. 
8.  Visual clear zones. Landscaping and buffering height shall comply with the provisions of section 35-55, Visual clear zones. 
9.  Parking or storage within landscaped areas prohibited. No parking, storage, or outdoor display shall occur within a required bufferyard area. 
10.  Multiple landscaped areas or buffers. Where multiple landscape areas or buffers are required in the same general location (e.g. parking lot perimeter landscaping and zoning district boundary buffering), the more stringent bufferyard and screening standard shall prevail. 
D.  Bufferyard and screening standards. 
1.  Purpose. The purpose of the bufferyard and screening standards is to provide visual separation of intensive uses from less intensive uses; to preserve and enhance property values by ensuring that yards, open spaces, and parking lots are constructed and maintained with plants and landscape materials; and to provide flexibility in the provision of required landscape materials and designs. It is the intent of this section to require all new development and redevelopment to install bufferyards based on the zoning and use of the adjacent property as required by exhibit 35-59A. 
2.  Applicability. Bufferyards shall be provided wherever specifically required within the text of this ordinance or by exhibit 35-59A. 
a.  Bufferyards with specific planting criteria may be required by the approving body during the course of review of a conditional use permit or special exception permit if it is found that a specific type of bufferyard or screening is required for the proposed use or for the protection of adjacent properties. 
b.  New single-family residential development in any zoning district is not required to install bufferyards, unless specifically required by the provisions of section 35-27, Planned unit development, or section 35-54, cluster subdivision and compact housing provisions. 
3.  Buffering requirements for parking lots. Parking lots with 50 or more spaces shall provide a type B bufferyard along all street frontages and along all property lines which abut residential uses located in RS-1, RS-2, RS-3, RS-4, RD, PUD and N-O zoning districts. A bufferyard between parking lots and buildings located on the same lot or within a complex is not required 
4.  Bufferyard orientation. Unless specified otherwise at the time of development approval, to ensure proper maintenance of the plant materials the buffer area space and vegetation shall be provided on the inside of any barrier feature (i.e. on the side of the property required to provide the buffer regardless of which property the barrier is located). 
5.  Bufferyard location. Bufferyards may be located adjacent to or within required yards, subject to the restrictions of section 35-55, Visual clear zone, and subsection 35-59.C.7, Use of utility easements. 
6.  Bufferyard types, options. The types of bufferyards and their features are described below and in exhibit 35-59B, Bufferyard types and options. The minimum bufferyard required to be installed is indicated by option 1 under each bufferyard type. The remaining options present bufferyards which may be established at the owner's discretion based on the available space. In each option, mature tree sizes were matched to the bufferyard width. A combination of plantings matched to the available space shall be selected. Areas between trees and shrubs shall be planted with groundcover, turf grasses or mulched to prevent erosion and weeds. Exhibit 35-59C generally illustrates bufferyard types and features. In the event of a conflict between exhibit 35-59B and exhibit 35-59C, exhibit 35-59B shall control. 
a.  Type A bufferyard: The type A bufferyard is intended to provide landscape beautification and screening between developments. No barrier feature is required. 
b.  Type B bufferyard: The type B bufferyard is intended to provide buffering and screening to shield neighboring properties from adverse effects of adjacent parking lots and moderately incompatible land uses. A barrier feature providing solid screening from the ground to a minimum height of three feet is required. 
c.  Type C bufferyard: The type C buffer is intended to separate highly incompatible uses using a combination of space, dense vegetation or barriers. A barrier feature providing solid screening from the ground to a minimum height of six feet is required. 
d.  Redevelopment situations. In redevelopment situations, where pre-existing structures preclude the installation of a bufferyard in the width required, the Director may approve the following: 
(1)  The bufferyard may be reduced by up to 50 percent of the minimum required width for the situation, however, the remaining features shall not be reduced and the intent of the bufferyard type shall be preserved. 
(2)  In extreme situations which cannot meet the standards of paragraph d(1) above, a fence, wall, hedge or shrub border meeting the height requirements may be authorized, however, the intent of the bufferyard shall be preserved. 
e.  Use of natural undisturbed or natural forested bufferyard areas. Existing natural forested and natural undisturbed areas may be used as bufferyards, in accordance with the following standards: 
(1)  A natural bufferyard may be used along all property lines which require a buffer, however, a natural undisturbed bufferyard shall be located at least 25 feet from the street right-of-way. 
(2)  Natural undisturbed bufferyard, where used to meet a bufferyard requirement of this chapter, shall remain undisturbed during development and construction and shall remain undisturbed until such time as it is replaced with another bufferyard option from exhibit 35-59B. 
(3)  Natural forested bufferyard, where used to meet the bufferyard requirement of this chapter, may be enhanced through trimming, brush removal and addition of trees, shrubs or other plantings. 
(4)  A natural bufferyard shall possess the minimum width as shown in exhibit 35-59B. 
f.  Use of open space bufferyard areas. Open space may be used as bufferyards in accordance with the following standards: 
(1)  An open space bufferyard may be used along all property lines required to meet the type A and type B bufferyard requirements of exhibit 35-59A, except that where parking lot screening is required, a planted bufferyard shall be installed in accordance with one of the options outlined in exhibit 35-59B. 
(2)  An open space bufferyard shall possess the minimum widths as shown in exhibit 35-59B in order to satisfy the requirements of this section. 
E.  Use of fences, walls and berms in required bufferyards. Where used in combination with a bufferyard, fences, walls and berms shall comply with the following standards: 
1.  Berms. 
a.  Minimum height. Two and one-half feet. 
b.  Minimum width of crest. One foot. 
c.  Maximum slope. Three horizontal feet for each one vertical foot. 
d.  Planting area. Required trees and shrubs shall be planted on the crest. The remainder of crest and side slopes shall be planted with groundcover and/or sod. 
2.  Fences. Fences used as a barrier feature in a required bufferyard shall consist of concrete, natural-finished wood, maintenance-free vinyl, or combination, shall be solid and of a two-sided design. Such fence shall be located within three feet of the property line. 
3.  Walls. Walls used as a barrier feature in a required bufferyard shall be constructed of solid masonry finished on both sides. Finish may consist of stucco, brick, stone, versa-lock; and other materials as approved by the Director; minimum six inches thick. Unfinished concrete block is not permitted. The wall shall be located within three feet of the property line. 
4.  Combined height. Where a fence or wall is combined with a berm, the maximum height of the fence shall be reduced by the additional height of the berm. 
5.  Back-to-back placement. Nothing in this ordinance shall require the "back-to-back" placement of fences or walls where an existing fence or wall on an adjoining property substantially meets the requirements of this section. An existing, solid fence which meets all of the above requirements, except for type, may be substituted for the required wall provided the width of the landscape strip is increased such that at the time of development approval an equivalent amount of buffering between properties is provided. 
6.  Exception due to topography. Where topography results in a required bufferyard fence providing little or no screening, the Director may waive the screening fence requirement, however, required trees shall still be installed. 
F.  Standards for fences and walls. 
1.  Standards in all districts. No fence shall be erected without a permit. At a minimum, unless specified otherwise at the time of development approval, fences and walls erected shall comply with the following: 
a.  Visual clear zone. Fences and walls shall comply with the provisions of section 35-55, Visual clear zone. 
b.  Fences and walls erected by public entities exception. Fences and walls erected by public entities for public recreational and other public purposes, including but not necessarily being limited to fencing for tennis courts and baseball fields, shall be exempt from the fence height regulations provided that the fence is more than 25 feet from the nearest property line. 
c.  Fences and walls erected for public utilities exception. Public utilities may erect fences and walls up to a maximum of 10 feet in height for public utility sites including but not necessarily limited to water towers, telecommunication towers, and electrical substations, provided that the fence is located 25 feet from the nearest property line. Barbed wire may be used provided the lowest strand of barbed wire shall be located at least six feet above the ground. No concertina wire shall be permitted. Design standards for fences for public utility purposes may be established by the Board of Adjustment when ruling on a conditional use permit. 
d.  Maintenance and design standards. 
(1)  The property owner shall repair or replace rotted, fire damaged, or broken wooden slats and support posts. Broken or severely bent metal posts or torn, cut, or ripped fencing materials shall be repaired or replaced. Loose brick, stone, rock, mortar, or similar materials on masonry walls shall be rebounded or similarly repaired. Peeling, flaking, and chipped paint shall be eliminated and surfaces repainted. 
(2)  No more than two different types of fencing material (such as wood and chain link or two types of wood) are permitted. Missing boards, pickets, or posts shall be replaced with material of the same type. 
(3)  Permitted fencing materials shall include wood, brick, composite, vinyl, chain link, and decorative metal. Other materials manufactured for permanent fencing and compatible with the character of the area may be approved by the Director. 
(4)  No fence shall be made of, in whole or in part, cloth, canvas, or sheet metal, plywood, rolled plastic, debris, junk, or any other materials not specifically manufactured for permanent fencing. Barbed wire, chicken wire, and hog wire is permitted only when associated with a legal nonconforming or permitted agricultural activity or in conformance with subsection 35-59.F.3.b below. Concertina wire is prohibited in all districts. 
(5)  The finished side of the fence shall face outward. Posts and support beams must face in toward the subject property or shall be designed as an integral part of the finished surface. 
2.  Standards for fences and walls in the RU, RC, RS, RA, MU, and N-O Districts. 
a.  Except as modified by section 35-55, Visual clear zone, fences and walls having a height of four feet or less may be located on any part of the lot. 
b.  Except as modified by section 35-55, Visual clear zone, fences and walls having a height of six feet or less may be erected on those parts of a lot that are as far back or farther back from the street than the front plane of the main building. 
c.  For through lots (as defined in section 35-92 and as distinguished from corner lots) fences and walls having a height of six feet or less may extend into the yard area at the rear of the building subject to a minimum ten-foot setback from the right-of-way line or, where houses front said right-of-way, at a setback equal to or greater than houses on adjacent lots, whichever is greater. 
3.  Standards for fences and walls in the C and M Districts. 
a.  Except as modified by Section 35-55 Visual Clear Zone, fences and walls having a height of four feet or less may be erected on any part of a lot and fences and walls having a height of ten feet or less may be erected on those parts of a lot that are as far back or farther back from the street than the front plane of the main building or the front setback line, whichever is less. 
b.  Barbed wire may be used on fences or walls provided the lowest strand of barbed wire shall be located at least six feet above the ground. 
4.  Standards for fences and walls in the PUD Planned Unit Development District. Height of fences and walls shall be determined under the plan review procedures set forth in subsection 35-74.C.

EXHIBIT 35-59C: SAMPLE BUFFERYARDS 
(Refer to exhibit 35-59B for Specific Requirements) 
(See Approved Planting List in the Appendix) 
 
(Ord. No. 14982, § 1, 6-18-2012; Ord. No. 15434, §§ 1, 2, 3, 9-21-2015)  
Sec. 35-60. - Traffic impact analysis. 
A.  Purpose. Traffic impact analysis (TIAs) are specialized studies of the transportation needs and traffic impacts of a development. A TIA is specifically concerned with site traffic generation, directional distribution and assignment of site traffic onto available or future streets, public safety requirements and the determination of transportation needs of the site and surrounding street system. In all cases, access plans for a development must be integrated with access to adjacent developments, and must consider the impacts of other developments that are under construction, have received land use approvals or have submitted applications. 
B.  Applicability. An applicant or developer shall submit a traffic impact analysis for the following types of developments unless specifically waived by the Director: 
1.  All developments expected to generate more than 100 new peak-hour vehicle trips on the adjacent street, except that residential developments with fewer than 75 single-family lots or 50 two-family units shall not be required to submit a TIA. 
2.  A development which will change the site traffic generation by more than 15 percent, where at least 100 new peak-hour trips are involved; 
3.  Necessary development agreements to determine "fair share" contributions to major roadway improvements. 
C.  Traffic impact analysis report content. The TIA shall be performed under the supervision of a registered, professional engineer qualified and experienced in transportation engineering. The TIA shall follow standard transportation engineering practices and methods and shall include the following minimum information: 
1.  Analysis of existing conditions and issues; 
2.  Analysis of forecasted traffic conditions. Trip generation and pass-by trip estimates for proposed developments may be obtained from the Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation (6th edition, 1997) or the most recent edition. 
3.  Analysis of alternatives where appropriate; 
4.  Findings, conclusions, and recommendations.  
ARTICLE VI. - NONCONFORMING USES OR SITUATIONS. 
 
Sec. 35-61. - Purpose. 
It is the purpose of this article to provide for the regulation of uses, buildings, structures or lots which legally existed prior to the effective date of this ordinance but which fail to comply with one or more of the applicable regulations or standards established by this ordinance or subsequent amendment of this ordinance, or which have been rendered nonconforming due to circumstances which were not self-created. This ordinance recognizes that nonconforming uses or situations that are otherwise lawful, have a vested property right so long as they remain lawful otherwise. It is the intent of these regulations to specify those circumstances and conditions under which such nonconformities shall be permitted to continue and expand.  
Sec. 35-62. - Applicability. 
A.  These regulations apply to nonconforming uses or situations which were originally allowed and have been maintained over time. These uses or situations have legal nonconforming status and may continue so long as they are legal otherwise. Land uses or situations that were not permitted when they were established and have been maintained over time have no legal right to continue and shall be terminated, unless granted legal nonconforming status by the procedure outlined in section 35-63. 
B.  In certain cases, nonconformities may be permitted to be upgraded when it can be shown that such action will not be harmful and will be beneficial to the surrounding properties, the neighborhood, or the community; and that the goals of the comprehensive plan and other local plans will not be impeded by the continuation of the nonconformity. Nonconforming uses or situations that have a lesser impact on the immediate area have fewer restrictions than those with greater impacts. For instance, nonconforming uses in residential zones pose greater impacts and the expansion of such are regulated more strictly to ensure the protection of continuing residential neighborhood livability and character. In contrast, expansion of nonconforming residential developments in residential zones are treated more liberally because they do not represent a major disruption to the neighborhood and they provide needed housing opportunities.  
Sec. 35-63. - Determination of legal nonconforming status review. 
A.  Purpose, review and determination. This section provides information on how legal nonconforming status is determined for a use, site or situation. The current legal use will be identified based on the classifications of permitted land use for the particular district as shown in exhibit 35-28. 
B.  Evidence. If the Director determines that evidence is insufficient or unsatisfactory, a determination of legal nonconforming status review shall be required in accordance with this section. 
1.  Evidence required—Use or situation allowed when established. 
a.  Building, land use or development permits; or 
b.  Zoning codes or maps. 
2.  Evidence required—Use or situation maintained over time. 
a.  Building, land use or development permits; 
b.  Income tax records; 
c.  Utility bills; 
d.  Business licenses; 
e.  Listings in telephone, business or Polk directories or similar publications; or 
f.  Advertisements in dated publications. 
C.  Procedure. 
1.  Application by owner or staff initiated. The determination of legal nonconforming status review may be initiated by staff or may take place upon application by the property owner, who shall provide copies of evidence to the Director. The review shall be conducted by the Director or the Director's designee. The report, including evidence, documentation and findings, shall be transmitted to the applicant, with a copy maintained in the Department office. 
2.  Status report, certificate. After the review has been completed, the Director or the Director's designee shall issue a report, including evidence and findings, which shall be transmitted to the applicant, with a copy maintained in the Department office. If the Director determines that the nonconforming use or situation was permitted at the time and has been maintained over time, the Director will issue a certificate of nonconforming use or situation status to the applicant. 
3.  Appeals. The applicant may appeal the Director's determination to the Board of Adjustment in conformance with the procedures in subsection 35-73.C.  
Sec. 35-64. - Regulations that apply to all nonconforming uses or situations. 
A.  Ownership. Changes in ownership shall not affect the nonconforming status. 
B.  Change to a legal conforming situation. A nonconforming use or situation may be changed by right to a legal conforming status. Such change shall terminate nonconforming rights. 
C.  Change to a conditional use. A nonconforming use may be changed to a conditional use in conformance with the procedures and standards of subsection 35-73.A. Conversion to a conditional use shall terminate nonconforming rights. 
D.  Maintenance and repair. 
1.  Routine maintenance/repair. The maintenance and minor repair of a nonconforming use or nonconforming structure is permitted. 
2.  Restoration and repair due to damage. 
a.  A nonconforming use, other than a one-family or two-family dwelling, damaged to less than 75 percent of the current fair market value may be restored in compliance with adopted building, fire and life safety codes provided the work is commenced within six months from the date of damage, and all portions of the structure being restored are not and were not on or over a property line and the certificate of occupancy is issued within one year from the date of damage. If damage exceeds 75 percent, restoration or repair shall not be permitted unless the restoration brings the use into conformance with this ordinance and applicable adopted codes. 
b.  A nonconforming, one- or two-family dwelling, damaged by more than 75 percent of its current fair market value, may be restored or repaired only if: 1) such restoration or repair work complies with applicable building, fire and life safety codes; and 2) the restoration or repair work is substantially commenced within 365 days from the date of damage; and 3) the square footage of the residence is not expanded or increased, except as provided in this section. The Director may extend the deadlines for commencement of completion of such restoration or repair work upon showing that the applicant, due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control, cannot comply despite the exercise of reasonable diligence. 
c.  For purposes of this section, fair market value shall mean the most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is consummation of a sale as of a specified date and passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: 
(1)  Buyer and seller are typically motivated; 
(2)  Both parties are well-informed or well-advised, and each acting in what he or she considers his or her own best interest; 
(3)  A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; 
(4)  Payment is made in terms of cash in US dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; 
(5)  The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale. 
The value of the lot or parcel shall be excluded for purposes of this section.  
Sec. 35-65. - Continuation of nonconformity and completion of nonconforming development. 
A.  Continued operation. Except as otherwise provided in this section, any nonconforming use, structure, lot of record, sign or landscaping or parking existing on the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendment thereto may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful. All nonconformities shall be encouraged to convert to conformity whenever possible. Additionally, any structure currently under construction that has been classified as a nonconforming use shall be allowed to continue so long as 50 percent of the structure has been completed. 
B.  Change of use. Any use of land or structure may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same nature or less intensive nature if no structural alterations are involved and if it is found that the relation of the structure and proposed use to surrounding property is such that adverse effects on occupants and neighboring property will not be greater than if the original nonconforming use continued. Approval for such a change shall be processed through a special exception use permit review procedure in conformance with subsection 35-73.D. 
The following factors shall be used to determine if the use may be changed: 
1.  The character and history of the use and of development in the surrounding area. 
2.  The comparable degree of noise, vibration, dust, odor, fumes, glare or smoke detectable at the property line. 
3.  The comparative numbers and kinds of vehicular trips to the site. 
4.  The comparative amount and nature of outside storage, loading, and parking. 
5.  The comparative visual appearance. 
6.  The comparative hours of operation. 
7.  The comparative effect on existing vegetation. 
8.  The comparative effect on water drainage. 
9.  Other factors which tend to reduce conflicts of incompatibility with the character or needs of the area. 
C.  Improvements and restoration of nonconformities. A nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged or altered in any way which increases its nonconformity except under the following conditions: 
1.  Alteration is for the express purpose of converting the structure to a conforming use. 
2.  Alteration will ensure compliance with the health and safety requirements of the City, but such alteration shall only be permitted to the extent minimally necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the health and safety regulations. 
3.  A building containing one or more dwelling units, in districts where such occupancy is a nonconforming use, may be altered in ways which will enhance the livability of the dwelling unit or to ensure compliance with the health and safety regulations of the City. Under no circumstances shall these alterations result in an increase in the number of dwelling units in the building, or the bulk of the building. 
4.  Repairs and non-structural alterations may be made to a nonconforming building in conformance with subsection 35-64.D. 
5.  A parking area on a lot with a nonconforming building may be paved in accordance with the provisions of section 35-58. 
6.  A fence may be erected in accordance with the provisions of section 35-59 on a lot with a nonconforming building. 
7.  Nothing contained in exceptions 1 through 6 above shall be construed to permit an enlargement of a nonconforming building. 
D.  Discontinuance of nonconformity. 
1.  Illegal use. Any use or situation that was not established or constructed in conformance with this ordinance or a previous zoning ordinance is an illegal use and shall be brought into conformance with this ordinance, subject to determination of legal nonconforming status review in accordance with section 35-63. 
2.  Discontinuance of use. Any nonconforming use or situation, the use of which has been discontinued for a period of 270 consecutive calendar days, shall be presumed to be abandoned and shall not thereafter be re-established except in full compliance with this ordinance. Evidence of abandonment of the nonconforming use is not required. 
3.  Discontinuance due to accidental destruction. No building which has been accidentally damaged by fire or other causes, to the extent of more than 75 percent of a non-residential building in a residential district and 75 percent of a nonconforming residential building in a residential district immediately prior to damage, of its fair market value, based on an appraisal performed by a certified real property appraiser, shall be restored except in conformity with the regulations of this section, and all rights as a nonconforming use are terminated. 
4.  Discontinuance due to intentional destruction. A building or structure which has been intentionally damaged by fire or other causes within the control of the applicant shall not be permitted to be rebuilt or re-established. 
E.  Nonconforming lots. 
1.  When a non-conforming lot can be used in conformity with all applicable regulations except minimum lot sizes or dimensions, the lot may be used as if it conformed to district regulations. 
2.  The Board of Adjustment may authorize the development of a non-conforming lot that cannot be developed in conformance with required setbacks upon finding that: 
a.  The property cannot reasonably be developed for authorized uses without a variance. 
b.  Variances are necessitated by the size, shape or configuration of the non-conforming lot. 
c.  The property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impacts on the adjacent properties or upon the public health or safety. 
d.  The proposed variances are the least required to allow reasonable use of the property.

2.  Structural expansion. Structural expansion shall not exceed 20 percent of the gross floor area of the structure or building in existence on May 6, 2002, provided that the business must provide adequate parking for the existing and expanded business area. 
3.  Expansion of nonconforming use in structure or building. Where a nonconforming use occupies a portion of an existing structure or building, expansion shall be limited to 20 percent of the square footage occupied by the use on May 6, 2002, provided that the business must provide adequate parking for the existing and expanded business area. No such use shall be extended to land outside of the building or structure. 
C.  Nonconforming telecommunications facilities. Certain telecommunications facilities that were in existence on or before September 8, 1997, shall be allowed to be expanded to provide for co-location of telecommunication antennas or other facilities in conformance with the provisions of subsection 35-41.B.26 and subsection 35-73.D of this ordinance. 
D.  Application for expansion required. Application for expansion shall be submitted to the Director, in writing, together with a site plan showing the existing uses, detailing the type and amount of the proposed expansion. 
E.  Notification of expansion and protest. Upon receipt of the application, mailed notification of the proposed expansion shall be provided to all owners of property within 185 feet (excluding streets and public rights-of-way) of the nonconformity. If protests are received from 30 percent or more of the property owners within the 185 feet limit within 20 days of the mailing, the requested expansion shall require processing in accordance with special exception use procedures.  
Sec. 35-67. - Nonconforming off-street parking lot. 
An off-street parking lot which contains more than 20 spaces and which lawfully existed prior to November 21, 1972, but which does not conform to the minimum off-street parking requirements, paving or landscape planting requirements of this article is nonconforming. The structures served by the lot shall not be enlarged nor structurally altered nor shall any new structure be located on the premises until: (1) the minimum number of off-street parking spaces is provided; or (2) the off-street parking lot is paved in conformance with section 35-58; or (3) the nonconforming lot conforms to the landscape requirements in section 35-59, as applicable. If the property owner can prove that the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces cannot be provided due to lack of sufficient land or that the minimum landscape requirements would cause an unusual economic hardship, the requirements may be varied by the Board of Adjustment. A variance, if granted, shall be limited to the minimum variance necessary to resolve, in whole or in part, the particular problem of the applicant.  
Sec. 35-68. - Exemptions. 
All structures and locations listed on the National Register of Historic Places, or as a state historical site shall not be considered to be nonconforming for the purposes of article VI, but shall comply with these regulations to the extent possible.

2.  Submittal requirements defined. Submittal requirements are typical. The type, scope, or location of any specific development application may require different types or levels of information. At the pre-application conference, the Director shall determine what information shall be submitted to provide for an adequate assessment of the project. At any time during the processing of any application, additional information may be required to respond to issues or concerns that may not have been evident at the pre-application conference. Requirements and information from the pre-application conference shall be recorded on a form supplied by the Planning and Protective Services Department and made part of the development file upon submittal of an application. 
D.  Application requirements. 
1.  Materials. Current application materials, including forms, checklists and schedules for submittal may be obtained during normal business hours from the Office of the Director.

Sec. 35-73. - Administrative approval—Development permits. 
A.  Conditional use permit. 
1.  Purpose. The purpose of conditional use review is to allow the City to exercise some control over the extent of certain activities which, although desirable in limited quantities, could have a detrimental effect on the community if the uses were permitted to exist in large numbers or in certain locations. Therefore, these regulations provide for restrictions or conditions that may be imposed to reduce or mitigate the potential problems associated with the use or its location in relation to the neighboring properties. A conditional use is not a use by right. 
Exhibit 35-73A
Conditional Use
Permit Process
 
2.  Applicability. 
a.  A conditional use, once approved, goes with the land for the approved use only, unless the permit is revoked due to violations enumerated in subsection 35-73.A.7. The designation of a use in a zoning district as a conditional use does not constitute an authorization or assurance that such use will be approved. 
b.  An established use which has been reclassified from a permissive to a conditional use by this ordinance shall be permitted to expand onto contiguous land under the ownership of the established use on the effective date of this ordinance. Such expansion may include, but is not limited to, new buildings, building additions, parking lots, and other projects related to and associated with the established use. Such expansion shall be subject to site plan review by staff, outlined in section 35-71. Expansion of the use onto land acquired after May 6, 2002 shall be subject to the conditional use permit process outlined in this section. 
3.  Application and review procedures. 
a.  The application shall be submitted with a site plan in conformance with section 35-71. The Director shall forward a copy of the complete application and site plans to the Director of Public Works for review. If a zoning amendment is required or requested, such application shall accompany the application for a conditional use permit. 
b.  Once the Director has determined that the application is complete, it shall be forwarded with the site plan to the Board of Adjustment for review at a public hearing. 
4.  Findings of fact. No conditional use shall be approved unless the Board of Adjustment finds the following: 
a.  The proposed use is consistent with the goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan; and 
b.  The proposed use complies with all applicable provisions of the zoning district regulations and shall conform to the general intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance; and 
c.  The proposed use complies with all fire, health, building, plumbing, electrical and stormwater drainage regulations of the City and regulations of County, state and federal agencies; and 
d.  The proposed conditional use is not materially detrimental to the public health, safety, convenience and welfare, or results in material damage or prejudice to other property in the vicinity; and 
e.  The proposed use is compatible with and preserves the character and integrity of adjacent development and includes improvements to mitigate adverse development-related impacts, such as traffic, noise, odors, visual nuisances, or other similar adverse effects to adjacent development and neighborhoods; and 
f.  The proposed use does not generate pedestrian and vehicular traffic which will be hazardous to the existing and anticipated traffic in the neighborhood; and 
g.  Adequate utilities exist to serve the proposed conditional use.

a.  No conditional use shall be enlarged, extended, increased in intensity or relocated unless an application is made for a new conditional use permit in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. 
b.  Development of the use shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all the permits and approvals required. 
c.  Signage for the use may be limited to protect the neighborhood character. A residence in which one or more home occupations has been permitted shall be limited to one sign, attached to the building, with a maximum size of one square foot, regardless of the number of home occupations operated from the residence. 
d.  Due to the operational intensity and nature of the proposed use and the physical development characteristics, the height, bulk and lot coverage, shall be as specified in the permit. 
e.  The building materials and architectural style of the building and related structures shall be consistent with and similar to those of adjacent buildings and as specified in the permit. 
f.  The Board may determine the type and extent of the bufferyard, and whether a bufferyard is required to mitigate impacts of a proposed conditional use upon adjacent properties, using section 35-59 as a guide. 
6.  Decision-maker. The Board of Adjustment shall review the conditional use permit application and any other proposed action related to the permit at a public hearing in conformance with section 35-70, and shall approve, conditionally approve or deny approval of the permit after its hearing. The minutes of the hearing shall reflect the findings of fact demonstrating the reason for the Board's decision. Upon approval of the request, the Board shall authorize the Director to issue the conditional use permit which shall state the conditions and restrictions so that reasonable control may be exercised over the use. 
7.  Revocation of a conditional use permit. Any permit by the Board is subject to revocation for any or all of the following reasons. 
a.  Non-compliance with any conditions imposed on the conditional use; or

a.  Applicant's responsibilities. When requesting a variance, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to show how the premises or particular circumstance fully meets all of the findings the Board is required to make. 
b.  Required findings, general. Before granting any variance, the Board shall find the proposed variance, if granted, would: 
(1)  Not eliminate an adequate supply of light or air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion in the public street, increase the danger of fire, or endanger the safety of the public; and 
(2)  Not be unduly injurious to the use and enjoyment of adjacent property nor would it substantially diminish property values in the neighborhood; and 
(3)  Be in keeping with the general spirit and intent of this chapter. 
c.  Specific findings. In addition to the general findings, the Board shall also apply the following specific findings, as applicable: 
(1)  Variance to density and dimensional standards of section 35-51. The Board shall also find, before granting a variance to any density or dimensional standard that there are practical difficulties associated with the premises which under strict and literal adherence to the provisions of this chapter would cause the applicant an unnecessary hardship. 
(2)  Variance to the height regulations. In addition to the general findings, the Board shall also find that the height of the proposed building or structure will not violate any air space height restrictions. In the case of an amateur radio antenna or support structure, the Board in its decision-making process shall make a concerted effort to: 
(a)  Strike a balance between the federal interest promoting amateur radio communications and the city's legitimate interest in regulating zoning matters; and 
(b)  Make a reasonable accommodation between the federal and city interest. 
(3)  Variance to the fence height regulations. The Board shall find, before granting a variance to the fence height regulations, that the applicant has conclusively demonstrated that: 
(a)  The specific use of the fence requires a height greater than permitted by this chapter, and 
(b)  The variance, if granted, would be the minimum necessary for the fence to serve its purpose. 
(4)  Variance to the number of required off-street parking spaces; required specific findings and maximum permitted reductions. In addition to the general findings, the Board shall also find, before granting a variance to the number of off-street parking spaces required by this chapter, that the applicant has conclusively demonstrated that the specific use of a building does not necessitate the total number of required off-street parking spaces. The reduction in the number of spaces which may be authorized by the Board shall not be more than five spaces or 50 percent of the usual requirement, whichever is greater. 
(5)  Variance to the location of required off-street parking spaces. In addition to the general findings, the Board shall also find, before granting a variance to the location requirements for off-street parking, that the applicant has conclusively demonstrated that: 
(a)  Strict compliance with the location requirements would create an unnecessary hardship, or 
(b)  The use associated with the parking does not necessitate close proximity between the parking and the use. 
(6)  Variance to the requirements of a neighborhood conservation overlay district. In addition to the general findings, the Board shall also find, before granting a variance to the requirements of a neighborhood conservation overlay district that the applicant has conclusively demonstrated that the variance, if granted, would: 
(a)  Not be unduly injurious to the character and visual appearance of the neighborhood. 
(b)  Be in keeping with the general spirit and intent of the neighborhood conservation overlay district. 
5.  Extent of variance limited and conditions which may be imposed. 
a.  Extent of variance limited. A variance, if granted, shall be limited to the minimum variance necessary to resolve, in whole or in part, the particular problem of the applicant. 
b.  Minimum practical regulation. The Board's decision, including conditions imposed, if any, shall represent the minimum practicable regulation needed to carry out the intent of this chapter. 
c.  Conditions. In granting a variance, the Board may impose such conditions upon the premises receiving the variance as may be necessary to ensure that the variance will not: 
(1)  Be unduly injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity. 
(2)  Have a significant adverse affect on property values in the neighborhood. 
(3)  Endanger or be detrimental to the public health, safety or general welfare of the citizens of the city. 
6.  Decision-maker. The Board of Adjustment may grant variances after a public hearing held in conformance with section 35-70. 
7.  Rehearing procedures. Rehearing requests shall be processed in accordance with section 35-70. 
8.  Validity. A variance shall run with the land after approval. If after one year of issuance of the variance the construction or use has not commenced, revocation proceedings shall be commenced, using the procedure outlined in section 35-70. 
C.  Appeals from administrative decisions. Any person, including any officer or agency of the City of Jefferson City, aggrieved by an interpretation of this ordinance by the Director may request appeal of the decision in accordance with this section. 
1.  Approval criteria. In granting an appeal to an administrative interpretation, the Board of Adjustment shall determine whether the decision or interpretation by the Director was in accordance with the intent and requirements of this ordinance. 
2.  Decision-maker and decision. The Board of Adjustment shall affirm, reverse or remand the decision. In reversing or remanding the decision back to the Director, the Board shall state the rationale for its decision.

2.  Applicability. 
a.  The designation of a use in a zoning district as a special exception use does not constitute an authorization or assurance that such use will be approved. 
b.  Approval of a special exception use permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use for which the permit is issued. 
c.  No use authorized by a special exception use permit shall be enlarged, extended, increased in intensity or relocated unless an application is made for a new special exception use permit in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.

a.  More efficient infrastructure. 
b.  Reduced traffic demands. 
c.  More usable public or private open space. 
d.  Recreational amenities. 
e.  Needed housing choices. 
The Planned Unit Development District process, as shown in exhibit 35-74C, involves three phases described in this section. 
Exhibit 35-74C: Planned Unit Development District Approval Process
 
2.  PUD concept plan. 
a.  The purpose of a PUD concept plan is to reduce conflict and address City plans and projects in the vicinity of the proposed PUD. 
b.  A PUD concept plan is an optional, but encouraged first step prior to an application for Planned Unit Development District zoning. The purpose of a concept plan is to demonstrate conformance with the comprehensive plan, compatibility of land use and coordination of improvements within and among individually platted parcels, sections, or phases of a development prior to the approval of a preliminary plan. An applicant may apply to the Director for approval of the concept plan. 
If the applicant requests approval of a concept plan, the application shall include a PUD concept plan for the entire property or tract. The applicant may file a combined PUD concept plan with a PUD preliminary plan or final PUD plan for a portion of the property, as determined applicable by the Director at a preapplication conference. The Council reserves flexibility in making determinations regarding PUD rezoning applications. Depending upon the detail of the submittal attached to the rezoning petition, and the amount and type of impact potentially created by the concept plan, the Council may: 
(1)  Approve a specific density and land use mix at the concept plan stage. 
(2)  Approve only a "design density" at the concept plan stage, which sets the maximum density, fully contingent upon approval of the subsequent submittal. The design density does not constitute a commitment to approve subsequent submittals. The specific density shall then be established at the time of the subsequent submittal. 
c.  Application requirements and processing procedures shall comply with those described in section 35-70. The concept plan shall be valid for one year; however, the Planning and Zoning Commission may approve extensions upon finding that conditions have not substantially changed since the original approval. 
d.  A concept plan application and submittal shall be reviewed based on criteria established in section 35-27 as well as the criteria for zoning changes, subsection 35-74.B.4, and the criteria for a preliminary plan in subsection 35-74.C.3. 
e.  The Planning and Zoning Commission shall approve, conditionally approve or deny approval of all applications for a concept plan. 
3.  PUD preliminary plan. 
a.  A PUD preliminary plan constitutes a major step in the review process. A rezoning application shall be submitted with the PUD preliminary plan application. The accepted "design" density indicated in the concept plan approval cannot be presumed as a matter of right from the PUD zoning designation, but shall be justified at the preliminary stage through site and structure design. The Council may limit the density on all or any portion of a PUD if it determines that the design fails to fulfill the purposes of this ordinance and section. All required perimeter rights-of-way shall be dedicated at the time the preliminary plan is approved. 
b.  Application requirements and processing procedures shall comply with those described in section 35-70 and section 35-71, with the following modifications: 
(1)  If the PUD preliminary plan proposes multiple phases, specific densities shall be assigned to each phase. Density at each preliminary phase shall be justified by specific design. Density from one phase may be shifted to another phase subject to Council approval. The Council, in approving the PUD preliminary plan, may conduct the first reading of the rezoning ordinance for the area described in the PUD preliminary plan. 
(2)  If a PUD preliminary plan is approved, the applicant shall submit a final PUD plan and subdivision plat application in accordance with the approved development schedule. 
(3)  The City may require that a homeowners association or corporation be created to maintain and administer the project's lands or facilities. Articles of incorporation and restrictive covenants shall be recorded at, or prior to, the recording of the final PUD plan and plat. The homeowners' association shall be required to maintain all common space in reasonable order and condition on a timely, consistent basis. 
c.  The preliminary plan for the Planned Unit Development District shall show:

(9)  The location of existing and proposed sanitary sewers. 
(10)  The proposed size, location, height, use and arrangement of all buildings except single-family dwellings; the location and capacity of off-street parking areas, entrance and exit driveways and their relationship to existing and proposed streets; building lines; easements; common land and open space; and proposed streets, alleys and pedestrian ways. 
(11)  Proposed landscaping and buffer zones. 
(12)  Provide for the dedication of any right-of-way for the widening, extension or connection of major streets as shown in the thoroughfare plan. 
(13)  Date and signature lines for execution by the Commission Chairman and the Director of Planning and Protective Services to show the date of plan approval.
