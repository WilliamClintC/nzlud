To provide for the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, and to ensure the integrity of its
streets and the appropriate use of the rights-of-way, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state
of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances.
§ 93.02 ELECTION TO MANAGE THE PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
(A) Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this new chapter of this code relating to right-of-way
permits and administration. This chapter imposes reasonable regulation on the placement and
maintenance of facilities and equipment currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at
some future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies.
Under this chapter, persons excavating and obstructing the rights-of-way will bear financial
responsibility for their work. Finally, this chapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket and
projected costs from persons using the public rights-of-way.
(B) This chapter shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 Session Laws, Chapter 123,
substantially codified in M.S. §§ 237.16, 237.162, 237.163, 237.79, 237.81, and 238.086 (the
“Act”), as they may be amended from time to time, and the other laws governing applicable rights
of the city and users of the right-of-way. This chapter shall also be interpreted consistent with Minn.
Rules parts 7819.0050 through 7819.9950 where possible. To the extent any provision of this chapter
cannot be parts interpreted consistently with the Minnesota Rules, that interpretation most consistent
with the Act and other applicable statutory and case law is intended. This chapter shall not be
interpreted to limit the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general
ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.
(C) Pursuant to the authority granted to the city under state and federal statutory, administrative
and common law, the city hereby elects, pursuant M.S. § 237.163, subd. 2(b), as it may be amended
from time to time, to manage rights-of-way within its jurisdiction.

payment of excavation or obstruction permit fees. The city may allow applicant to pay such fees
within 30 days of billing.
(D) Non refundable. Permit fees that were paid for a permit that the city has revoked for a
breach as stated in § 93.21 are not refundable.
(E) Application to franchises. Unless otherwise agreed to in a franchise, management costs may
be charged separately from and in addition to the franchise fees imposed on a right-of-way user in the
franchise.
§ 93.13 RIGHT-OF-WAY PATCHING AND RESTORATION.
(A) Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the patching and restoration
of the right-of-way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified in the permit,
increased by as many days as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of
the permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under § 93.15.
(B) Patch and restoration. Permittee shall patch its own work. The city may choose either to
have the permittee restore the right-of-way or to restore the right-of-way itself.
(1) City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, permittee shall pay the costs
thereof within 30 days of billing. If, following such restoration, the pavement settles due to

Right-of-Way Management
costs associated with correcting the defective work.
(2) Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way itself, it shall at the time
of application for an excavation permit post a construction performance bond in accordance with the
provisions of Minn. Rule part 7819.3000.
(3) Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way restoration, a
right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee. However, the right-of-way user shall remain
responsible for patching and the degradation fee shall not include the cost to accomplish these
responsibilities.
(C) Standards. The permittee shall perform excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration
according to the standards and with the materials specified by the city and shall comply with Minn.
Rule part 7819.1100.
(D) Duty to correct defects. The permittee shall correct defects in patching or restoration
performed by permittee or its agents. The permittee upon notification from the city, shall correct all
restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Said work shall be
completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the city, not including days
during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when
work is prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable under § 93.15.
(E) Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the
condition required by the city, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by
the city, the city at its option may do such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to the city,
within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If permittee fails to pay as required,
the city may exercise its rights under the construction performance bond.
§ 93.14 JOINT APPLICATIONS.
(A) Joint application. Registrants may jointly apply for permits to excavate or obstruct the
right-of-way at the same place and time.
(B) Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same obstruction or excavation,
which the city does not perform, may share in the payment of the obstruction or excavation permit
fee. In order to obtain a joint permit, registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each

43

43

Right-of-Way Management
will pay and indicate the same on their applications.
(C) With city projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled obstruction or excavation performed
by the city, whether or not it is a joint application by two or more registrants or a single application,
are not required to pay the excavation or obstruction and degradation portions of the permit fee, but a
permit would still be required.
§ 93.15 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
(A) Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area of the right-of-way
specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work outside the area specified in the permit,
except as provided herein. Any permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in
the permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area (i) make
application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required thereby, and (ii) be granted a
new permit or permit extension.
(B) Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates specified in the permit.
No permittee may begin its work before the permit start date or, except as provided herein, continue
working after the end date. If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must
apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit or an extension of
the old permit before working after the end date of the previous permit. This supplementary
application must be submitted before the permit end date.
§ 93.16 OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
(A) Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not relieve permittee of
its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all fees required by
the city or other applicable rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of
local, state and federal laws, including but not limited to M.S. §§ 216D.01 through 216D.09, as it
may be amended from time to time (Gopher One Call Excavation Notice System) and Minn. Rules
Chapter 7560. A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and
established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to
its permit, regardless of who does the work.
(B) Prohibited work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval of the city, no right-of-way
44

44

44

44
Right-of-Way Management
obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are
unreasonable for such work.
(C) Interference with right-of-way. A permittee shall not so obstruct a right-of-way that the
natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be interfered
with. Private vehicles of those doing work in the right-of-way may not be parked within or next to a
permit area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The loading or unloading of
trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area unless specifically authorized by the
permit.
(D) Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits, permittees employing
trenchless excavation methods, including but not limited to Horizontal Directional Drilling, shall
follow all requirements set forth in M.S. Chapter 216D, as it may be amended from time to time,
and Minn. Rules Chapter 7560, and shall require potholing or open cutting over existing
underground utilities before excavating, as determined by the director.
§ 93.17 DENIAL OF PERMIT.
The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements and conditions of this chapter or
if the city determines that the denial is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use.
§ 93.18 INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS.
The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other work performed in the
right-of-way shall be done in conformance with Minn. Rules parts 7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and
other applicable local requirements, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the M.S. §§ 237.162
and 237.163, as they may be amended from time to time. Installation of service laterals shall be
performed in accordance with Minn. Rules Chapter 7560 and these ordinances. Service lateral
installation is further subject to those requirements and conditions set forth by the city in the
applicable permits and/or agreements referenced in § 93.22(B).

(A) Notice of completion. When the work under any permit hereunder is completed, the
permittee shall furnish a completion certificate in accordance Minn. Rule part 7819.1300.
(B) Site inspection. Permittee shall make the work-site available to the city and to all others as
authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution of and upon completion
of the work.
(C) Authority of Director.
(1) At the time of inspection, the director may order the immediate cessation of any work
which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety or well-being of the public.
(2) The director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that does not conform to
the terms of the permit or other applicable standards, conditions, or codes. The order shall state that
failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after
issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the director that the violation has been
corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the director may revoke the
permit pursuant to § 93.22.
§ 93.20 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
(A) Emergency situations.
(1) Each registrant shall immediately notify the director of any event regarding its facilities
that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are
necessary to respond to the emergency. Excavators' notification to Gopher State One Call regarding
an emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees
associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance
with this chapter for the actions it took in response to the emergency.
(2) If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's facilities, the city
will attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by
the emergency. In any event, the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the
emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the
emergency.

(B) Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having
obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a right-of-way must subsequently obtain a
permit and, as a penalty, pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees
required by the city code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the
right-of-way, and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
§ 93.21 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION.
If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends sooner than the date
given on the permit, permittee shall notify the city of the accurate information as soon as this
information is known.
§ 93.22 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
(A) Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any
right-of-way permit without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of the terms and conditions
of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial
breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
(1) The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit;
(2) An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-of-way permit, or the
perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens;
(3) Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a right-of-way permit;
(4) The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a permit extension is
obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to reasons beyond the permittee's control; or
(5) The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition
indicated on an order issued pursuant to § 93.19.
(B) Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee has committed a
47
47
Health and Sanitation; Nuisances
47
Animals
47
Public Parks
47
Right-of-Way Management
substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition
of the permit, the city shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The
demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A substantial
breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to place additional or revised conditions
on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach.
(C) Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving notification of the breach,
permittee shall provide the city with a plan, acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach.
Permittee's failure to so contact the city, or permittee's failure to timely submit an acceptable plan,
or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate
revocation of the permit. Further, permittee's failure to so contact the city, or permittee's failure to
submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall
automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year.
(D) Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list of conditions of the
permit, which if breached will automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year, such
as, but not limited to, working out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly
outside of the permit authorization.
(E) Automatic revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a breach as outlined
above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and permittee will not be allowed further
permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs.
(F) Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the
city for the city's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such revocation.

(A) Information required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide mapping information
required by the city in accordance with Minn. Rules parts 7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Within 90 days
following completion of any work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide the director
accurate maps and drawings certifying the “as-built” location of all equipment installed, owed and
maintained by the permittee. Such maps and drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical
location of all facilities and equipment and shall be provided consistent with the city's electronic
mapping system, when practical or as a condition imposed by the director. Failure to provide maps
and drawings pursuant to this subsection shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder's
registration.
(B) Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of service laterals, other
than minor repairs as defined in Minn. Rules part 7560.0150 subpart 2, shall require the permittee's
use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals, and the
service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the director reasonably requires it. Permittees
or their subcontractors shall submit to the director evidence satisfactory to the director of the
installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this division (B) and with applicable Gopher
State One Call law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after December 31,
2005, shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for 1) payments to contractors working on a
public improvement project including those under M.S. Chapter 429, as it may be amended from
time to time, and 2) city approval of performance under development agreements, or other
subdivision or site plan approval under M.S. Chapter 462, as it may be amended from time to time.
The director shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of providing such information to the
city. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals installed may result
in the revocation of the permit issued for the work or for future permits to the offending permittee or
its subcontractors.
§ 93.24 LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
(A) Placement, location and relocation; compliance with Act. Placement, location, and
relocation of facilities must comply with the Act, with other applicable law, and with Minn. Rules
parts 7819.3100, 7819.5000 and 7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise
available to cities.
(B) Corridors.
(1) The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or any particular segment
49

49

Right-of-Way Management
thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities that is or, pursuant to current technology, the
city expects will someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other
permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the
proper corridor for the facilities at issue.
(2) Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position at variance with the
corridors established by the city shall, no later than at the time of the next reconstruction or
excavation of the area where the facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position
within the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause shown, upon
consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer
service needs and hardship to the registrant.
(B) Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any facilities found in a right-of-way
that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies
or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or talcing
possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a useable condition.
(C) Limitation of space. To protect health, safety, and welfare, or when necessary to protect the
right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of
new or additional facilities within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to
the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for the particular utility
service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the
protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements and
development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest.
§ 93.25 PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION.
In addition to complying with the requirements of M.S. §§ 216D.01 through 216D.09, as it may
be amended from time to time, (“One Call Excavation Notice System”) before the start date of any
right-of-way excavation, each registrant who has facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated
shall mark the horizontal and vertical placement of all said facilities. Any registrant whose facilities
are less than 20 inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work closely with the
excavation contractor to establish the exact location of its facilities and the best procedure for
excavation.

§ 93.26 DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES.
When the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move
a registrant's facilities to protect it, the city shall notify the local representative as early as is
reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be paid
within 30 days from the date of billing. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing
any facilities in the right-of-way which it or its facilities damage. Each registrant shall be responsible
for the cost of repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant caused during the city's
response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant's facilities.
§ 93.27 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION; RESERVATION OF RIGHT.
If the city vacates a right-of-way that contains the facilities of a registrant, the registrant's rights
in the vacated right-of-way are governed by Minn. Rules part 7819.3200.
§ 93.28 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
By registering with the city, or by accepting a permit under this chapter, a registrant or
permittee agrees to defend and indemnify the city in accordance with the provisions of Minn. Rules
part 7819.1250.
§ 93.29 ABANDONED AND UNUSABLE FACILITIES.
(A) Discontinued operations. A registrant who has determined to discontinue all or a portion of
its operations in the city must provide information satisfactory to the city that the registrant's
obligations for its facilities in the right-of-way under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by
another registrant.
(B) Removal. Any registrant who has abandoned facilities in any right-of-way shall remove it
from that right-of-way if required in conjunction with other right-of-way repair, excavation, or
construction, unless this requirement is waived by the city.

§ 93.30 APPEAL.
A right-of-way user that: (1) has been denied registration; (2) has been denied a permit; (3) has
had a permit revoked; (4) believes that the fees imposed are not in conformity with M.S. § 237.163,
subd. 6, as it may be amended from time to time; or (5) disputes a determination of the director
regarding § 93.22(B) of this chapter may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition, or decision
reviewed, upon written request, by the city council. The city council shall act on a timely written
request at its next regularly scheduled meeting, provided the right-of-way user has submitted its
appeal with sufficient time to include the appeal as a regular agenda item. A decision by the city
council affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and supported by written
findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.

time.
(B) False statements. It is unlawful for any applicant to intentionally make a false statement or
omission upon any application form. Any false statement in the application, or any willful omission
to state any information called for on the application form, shall, upon discovery of the falsehood,
work an automatic refusal of license or, if already issued, shall render any license issued pursuant
thereto void and of no effect to protect the applicant from prosecution for violation of this chapter, or
any part thereof.
(C) Investigation. The Council shall investigate all facts set out in the application. Opportunity
shall be given to any person to be heard for or against the granting of the license. After the
investigation and hearing, the Council shall, in its discretion, grant or refuse the application. Any

investigation fee. Upon rejection of any application for a license, or upon withdrawal of an
application before consideration by the Council, the license fee shall be refunded to the applicant.

license pursuant thereto in the form prescribed by the City or the Commissioner, as the case may be.
All licenses shall be on a fiscal year basis, 12:00 a.m on July 1 to 11:59 p.m on June 30, unless
otherwise specified herein. For licenses issued and which are to become effective other than on the
first day of the licensed year, the fee to be paid with the application shall be a pro rata share of the
annual license fee. Licenses shall be valid only at one location and on the premises therein described.
Subject to the approval of the Council, any license fee in excess of an amount as set by City Council
by resolution may be made in quarterly or semi-annual payments. A charge in an amount as set by
City Council by resolution shall be added to each partial payment of a license.
(3) Refundment. A pro rata share of an annual license fee for a license to sell alcoholic
beverages, either on-sale or off-sale, shall be refunded to the licensee, or to his or her estate, if:
(a) The business ceases to operate because of destruction or damage; or
(b) The licensee dies.
(4) Refusal and termination. The Council may, in its sole discretion and for any reasonable
cause, refuse to grant any application. No license shall be granted to a person of questionable moral
character or business reputation. Licenses shall terminate only by expiration or revocation.
(5) Revocation or suspension. The Council shall revoke or suspend, for a period not to
exceed 60 days, a license granted under the provisions of this chapter, or impose a civil fine not to
exceed $2,000, for each violation on a finding that the licensee has failed to comply with a statute,
regulation or provision of the city code relating to alcoholic beverages. The Council shall revoke the
license upon conviction of any licensee or agent or employee of a licensee for violating any law
relating to the sale or possession of beer, wine or liquor upon premises of the licensee, or if the
revocation is mandatory by statute. If it shall be made to appear at the hearing thereon that the
violation was not willful, the Council may order suspension; provided that, revocation shall be
ordered upon the third violation or offense. No suspension or revocation shall take effect until the

licensee has been afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the Council, a committee of the
Council or a hearing under the Administrative Procedures Act, as may be determined by the Council
in action calling the hearing. The hearing shall be called by the Council upon written notice to the
licensee served in person or by certified mail not less than 15, nor more than 30, days prior to the
hearing date, stating the time, place and purpose thereof. As additional restrictions or regulations on
licensees under this chapter, and in addition to grounds for revocation or suspension stated in the city
code or statute, the following shall also be grounds for the action:
(a) The licensee suffered or permitted illegal acts upon licensed premises unrelated to
the sale of beer, wine or liquor;
(b) The licensee had knowledge of the illegal acts upon licensed premises, but failed to
report the same to police;
(c) The licensee failed or refused to cooperate fully with police in investigating the
alleged illegal acts upon licensed premises; or
(d) The activities of the licensee created a serious danger to public health, safety or
welfare.
(6) Corporate applicants and licensees. A corporate applicant, at the time of application,
shall furnish the city with a list of all persons that have an interest in the corporation and the extent
of the interest. The list shall name all shareholders and show the number of shares held by each,
either individually or beneficially for others. It is the duty of each corporate licensee to notify the
City Administrator in writing of any change in legal ownership, or beneficial interest in the
corporation or in the shares. Any change in the ownership or beneficial interest in the shares entitled
to be voted at a meeting of the shareholders of a corporate licensee, which results in the change of
voting control of the corporation by the persons owning the shares therein, shall be deemed
equivalent to a transfer of the license issued to the corporation, and any such license shall be revoked
30 days after any such change in ownership or beneficial interest of shares unless the Council has

been notified of the change in writing and has approved it by appropriate action. The Council, or any
officer of the city designated by it, may at any reasonable time examine the stock transfer records
and minute books of any corporate licensee in order to verify and identify the shareholders, and the
Council or its designated officer may examine the business records of any other licensee to the extent
necessary to disclose the interest which persons other than the licensee have in the licensed business.
The Council may revoke any license issued upon its determination that a change of ownership of
shares in a corporate licensee or any change of ownership of any interest in the business of any other
licensee has actually resulted in the change of control of the licensed business so as materially to
affect the integrity and character of its management and its operation, but no action shall be taken
until after a hearing by the Council on notice to the licensee.
(E) Duplicate licenses. Duplicates of all original licenses under this chapter may be issued by
the City Administrator without action by the Council, upon licensee’s affidavit that the original has
been lost and upon payment of a fee in an amount as set by City Council by resolution for issuance of
the duplicate. All duplicate licenses shall be clearly marked “DUPLICATE”.
(F) Posting. All licensees shall conspicuously post their licenses in their places of business.
(G) Resident manager or agent.
(1) Before a license is issued under this chapter to an individual who is a non-resident of the
city, to more than one individual whether or not they are residents of the city, or to a corporation,
partnership or association, the applicant or applicants shall appoint in writing a natural person who is
a resident of the city as its manager or agent. The resident manager or agent shall, by the terms of
his or her written consent:
(a) Take full responsibility for the conduct of the licensed premises; and
(b) Serve as agent for service of notices and other process relating to the license.

(2) The manager or agent must be a person who, by reason of age, character, reputation
and other attributes, could qualify individually as a licensee. If the manager or agent ceases to be a
resident of the city or ceases to act in a capacity for the licensee without appointment of a successor,
the license issued pursuant to the appointment shall be subject to revocation or suspension.
(H) Persons disqualified.
(1) No license under this chapter may be issued to:
(a) A person not a citizen of the United States or a resident alien;
(b) A person who within five years of the license application has been convicted of a
willful violation of a federal or state law, or local ordinance governing the manufacture, sale,
distribution or possession for sale or distribution, of alcoholic beverages;
(c) A person who has had an alcoholic beverage license revoked within five years of
the license application, or to any person who at the time of the violation owns any interest, whether
as a holder of more than 5% of the capital stock of a corporate licensee, as a partner or otherwise, in
the premises or in the business conducted thereon, or to a corporation, partnership, association,
enterprise, business or firm in which any such person is in any manner interested;
(d) A person under the age of 21 years; or

suspension or revocation by the City Council or its designee should the licensed owner or his or her
duly authorized resident agent fail to operate or maintain the licensed rental dwelling and units
therein in compliance with the provisions of the ordinances of the city and the laws of the state. In
the event that an operating license is suspended or revoked by the City Council or its designee for
just cause, it shall be unlawful for the owner or the duly authorized agent to thereafter permit any
new occupancies of vacant or thereafter vacated rental units until such time as an operating license
may be restored by the City Council or its designee.
(2) When a rental license is revoked or suspended, the property shall be vacated as of the
effective date of the revocation or suspension and remain vacated until restoration of the license. In
the case of a suspension, restoration shall occur automatically at the end of the suspension period. In
the case of revocation, restoration of the license shall occur only after the owner of the premises has
made application for a new license and paid a new application fee. The new license may then be
issued upon completion of the revocation period.
(3) No suspension or revocation of a rental license shall occur until the licensed owner has
been afforded an opportunity for a hearing to be conducted pursuant to M.S. §§ 14.50 to 14.69, as
they may be amended from time to time. This hearing shall be evidentiary in nature and conducted
before the City Council or designee which shall determine whether an ordinance or statutory
violation did occur warranting revocation or suspension of the rental license. The determination of
the City Council or designee shall be final and subject only to any rights of review or appeal to the
state court as is provided by statute. The licensed owner must affirmatively request an evidentiary
hearing by writing to be received by the City Administrator no later than seven days prior to the date
on which the Council or designee is to consider the matter. If request is not made, the right to an
evidentiary hearing is deemed waived and the City Council or designee may presume the truth and
accuracy of the matters alleged and proceed to disposition at the time of the hearing.
(4) Where the City Council or designee determines that an ordinance or statutory violation
has occurred warranting suspension or revocation, the rental license shall be suspended or revoked
for a period of not less than two months nor more than 12 months. Execution of the suspension or

revocation may be stayed by the Council or designee on such reasonable conditions as established by
the Council or designee including, but not limited to, the payment of a civil penalty not to exceed
$1,000. Upon the completion of one-half of the period of revocation or suspension imposed by the
City Council or designee, the licensed owner may petition the City Council or designee for early
restoration of the rental license. Upon receipt of the petition, the licensed owner’s request shall be
heard by the City Council or designee at the next regular scheduled meeting, (but at least seven days
from receipt of the request). At that time, the City Council or designee may order a restoration of the
rental license if the licensed owner establishes by clear and convincing evidence that one of the
following two circumstances then exist:
(a) The property has been sold since the occurrence of the original violation to a party
unrelated to the original owner. The sale must be for a fair consideration, negotiated at arm’s length,
and by deed duly filed for record at the office of the County Recorder. A sham or paper transfer of
title of the property to a related party or another party acting in cooperation with the owner for the
purpose of circumventing the license revocation shall not constitute a transfer for purposes of this
chapter; and/or
(b) The licensed owner demonstrates to the City Council or designee that he or she has
properly responded to the revocation or suspension, that measures have been taken to successfully
correct the violation which originally resulted in suspension or revocation, and that additional steps
have been taken to assure that similar violations not occur in the future. Factors to be considered by
the Council or designee, may include: improvements and repairs to the premises; modification of the
relevant lease provisions; selection of future tenants; response to citizens complaints; provision for
future supervision of the premises by the licensed owner; the licensed owner’s compliance with the
revocation/suspension; and such other criteria as the Council or designee considers relevant to each
individual case.
(5) Where the licensed owner is able to establish by clear and convincing evidence grounds
for restoration, the Council or designee may stay the execution of the remainder of the suspension or
revocation period for a period of up to one year and place reasonable terms and conditions upon the

5
5
General Offenses
5
Curfew
persons or property in the vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in
determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon appearance of a
police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or
herself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a
police officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an
opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by requesting the person to
identify himself or herself and to explain his or her presence or conduct. No person shall be
convicted of an offense under this section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding
sentence, or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if it had been
believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm. Any police officer may
arrest any person suspected of being a loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears
that the delay in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the suspect's
escape.
(B) It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a police officer, or where a
“no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or
quasi-public sidewalk, street, curb, cross-walk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private
property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the free passage of
pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any person to block, obstruct, or prevent
free access to the entrance to any building open to the public.
(C) For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following definition unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning: an area generally visible to public view,
including streets, sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including those which serve food
or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and entrances to buildings or dwellings and the
grounds enclosing them.

§ 153.009 CONDITIONS.
Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable conditions to land
subdivision is an exercise of valid police power delegated by the state to the city. The developer has
the duty of compliance with reasonable conditions laid down by the Planning and Zoning
Commission for design, dedication, improvement and restrictive use of land so as to conform to the
physical and economical development of the city and to the safety and general welfare of the future
lot owners in the subdivision and of the community at large.
(Prior Code, § 12.01)
§ 153.010 RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
For any change in a map of an approved or recorded subdivision plat, if the change affects any
street layout shown on the map, or area reserved thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it
affects any map or plan legally reached prior to the adoption of any regulations controlling
subdivision, the parcel shall be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission by the same
procedure, rules and regulations as for a subdivision.
(Prior Code, § 12.01)
§ 153.011 VARIANCES.

(2) The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property
rights;
(3) The authoring of the variance will not be of substantial detriment to the community and
will not materially impair the purposes of the subdivision regulations or the public interest; and
(4) The intended use and conditions of the property forming the basis for granting a
variance are not of so general or recurrent a nature as to cause the formulation and adoption of a
general subdivision regulation for similar uses and conditions.
(B) Conditions. In approving variances, the Zoning Adjustment Board may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objective of the standards or requirements
of these regulations.
(C) Procedures. A petition for any variance shall be submitted in writing by the subdivider at
the time when the preliminary plat is filed for the consideration of the Planning and Zoning
Commission. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all of the facts relied
upon by the petitioner.

circumstances, a frontage road may be needed. Additional right-of-way would be required for the

through traffic, at relatively high speeds. A standard design feature of a FREEWAY is a divided
roadway with full control of access by the use of ramps.

from floodplain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in error or that the area has been
filled to or above the elevation of the regional flood and is contiguous to lands outside the floodplain.
Special exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the Commissioner of Natural Resources if he or
she determines that, through other measures, lands are adequately protected for the intended use.
Also, all amendments to this chapter or the Official Zoning Map that deal with the floodplain in any
way must be submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of Natural Resources prior to adoption.
Changes in the Official Zoning Map must meet the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s
(FEMA) Technical Conditions and Criteria and must receive prior FEMA approval before adoption.

§ 154.024 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
(A) Criteria for granting conditional use permits. In granting a conditional use permit, the
Council shall consider the advice and recommendations of the Planning Commission and the effect of
the proposed use on the Comprehensive Plan and upon the health, safety and general welfare of

where applicable:
(1) The use will not create an excessive burden on existing parks, schools, streets and other
public facilities which serve or are proposed to serve the area;
(2) The use will be sufficiently compatible or separated by distance or screening from
adjacent residentially zoned or used land so that existing homes will not be depreciated in value and
there will be no deterrence to development of vacant land;
(3) The structure and site shall have an appearance that will not have an adverse effect upon
adjacent residential properties;
(4) The use, in the opinion of the Council, is reasonably related to the overall needs of the
city and to the existing land use;

however, failure of any property owner to receive the notification shall not invalidate the
proceedings.
(4) The Zoning Administrator shall set the date for a public hearing and shall have notice of

application to determine possible adverse effects of the proposed conditional use and to determine
what additional requirements may be necessary to reduce the adverse effects and recommend one of
three actions to the Council within 30 days after holding the public hearing: approval; denial; or
conditional approval.
(6) The Council shall take appropriate action on the request for a conditional use permit
within 30 days of receiving the recommendations by the Planning Commission. If it grants the
conditional use permit, the Council may impose conditions it considers necessary to protect the
public health, safety and welfare and such conditions may include a time limit for the use to exist or
operate.

months.
(8) In the event that the applicant violates any of the conditions set forth in this permit, the
Council shall have the authority to revoke the conditional use permit.
(9) No application of a property owner for a conditional use shall be considered by the

Planning Commission may permit a new application if, in its opinion, new evidence or a change in
circumstances warrant it.

§ 154.025 VARIANCES.
(A) Criteria for granting variances.
(1) A variance to the provisions of this chapter may be issued by the Board of Adjustment

to provide relief to the landowner in those cases where this chapter imposes undue hardship or
practical difficulties to the property owner in the use of this land. No use variances may be issued. A
variance may be granted only in the event that all the following circumstances exist:
(a) Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances apply to the properties which do not
apply generally to other properties in the same zone or vicinity and result from lot size or shape,
topography or other circumstances over which the owners of property since the effective date of this
chapter have had no control;
(b) The literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the
applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this
chapter;
(c) The special conditions or circumstances do not result from the actions of the
applicant;
(d) Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special
privilege that is denied by this chapter to owners of other lands, structures or buildings in the same
district;
(e) The variance requested is the minimum variance which would alleviate the
hardship. Economic conditions alone shall not be considered a hardship; and
(f) The variance would not be materially detrimental to the purpose of this chapter or

§ 154.193 FLOODWAY DISTRICT (FW).
(A) Permitted uses. The following uses have a low flood damage potential and do not obstruct
flood flows. These uses shall be permitted within the Floodway District to the extent that they are not
prohibited by any other city code provision and provided they do not require structures, fill or
storage of materials or equipment. In addition, no use shall adversely affect the capacity of the
channels or floodway or any tributary to the main stream or of any drainage ditch or any other
facility or system:

any height where the intent is to protect individual structures and levees or dikes where the intent is
to protect agricultural crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the ten-year frequency
flood event.
(C) Standards for floodway conditional uses.
(1) All uses. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and
levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a
conditional use which, acting alone or in combination with existing or reasonably anticipated future
uses, adversely affects the capacity of the floodway or increases flood heights. In addition, all
floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the standards contained in § 154.199 of this chapter and
the following standards.
(2) Fill. Any fill deposited in the floodway shall be no more than the minimum amount
necessary to conduct a conditional use listed in § 154.199 of this chapter. Generally, fill shall be
limited to that needed to grade or landscape for that use and shall not in any way obstruct the flow of
flood waters. Spoil from dredging or sand and gravel operations shall not be deposited in the

§ 154.194 FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF).
(A) Permitted uses. No use shall be permitted which will adversely affect the capacity of the
channels of floodways or any tributary to the main stream, of any drainage ditch or any other
drainage facility or system. Any use permitted in § 154.193 of this chapter is permitted in the Flood
Fringe District.
(B) Conditional uses. Other uses are permitted only upon application to the Zoning
Administrator and the issuance of a conditional use permit as provided in § 154.024 of this chapter
and subject to the following provisions.
(1) Residence. Where existing streets, utilities, and small lot sizes preclude the use of fill,
other methods of elevating the first floor (including basements) above the regulatory flood protection
elevation may be authorized; provided that, the residence is flood-proofed in accordance with the
state’s Building Code.
(2) Non-residential structures. Commercial, manufacturing and industrial structures shall
ordinarily be elevated on fill so that their first floor (including basements) is above the regulatory
flood protection elevation, but may in special circumstances be flood-proofed in accordance with the
state’s Building Code. Structures that are not elevated to above the regulatory flood protection

(C) Standards for flood fringe permitted uses.
(1) All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest
floor, including basement floor, is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished
fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection
elevation, and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the
structure erected thereon.
(2) As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal
investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet for the outside dimension at ground level may be
internally flood-proofed.
(3) The cumulative placement of fill where, at any one time, in excess of 1,000 cubic yards
of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowed only as a conditional use, unless the fill is specifically
intended to elevate a structure in accordance with division (C)(4) below.
(4) The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory
flood protection elevation.
(5) The provisions in division (E)(5) below shall also apply.
(D) Standards for flood fringe conditional uses.
(1) (a) Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a
structure’s lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These alternative methods
may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls and the like or above-grade, enclosed areas such
as crawl spaces or tuck-under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered
above grade and not a structure’s basement or lowest floor if:
1. The enclosed area is above grade on at least one side of the structure;
2. Is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood-resistant materials;

3. Is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage.
(b) The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following
additional standards.
1. Design and certification. The structure’s design and as-built condition must be
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance with the general
design standards of the state’s Building Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or
accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
2. Specific standards for above-grade and enclosed areas. Above-grade, fully
enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck-under garages must be designed to internally flood, and
the design plans must stipulate:
a. The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to
be used as a flood-proofing technique. When openings are placed in a structure’s walls to provide for
entry of flood waters to equalize pressures, the bottom of the openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or
devices; provided that, they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters; and
b. The enclosed area will be designed of flood-resistant materials in
accordance with the FP-3 and FP-4 classifications in the state’s Building Code and shall be used
solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage.
(2) Basements/cellars, as defined in this chapter, shall be subject to the following.
(a) Residential basement/cellar construction shall not be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation.
(b) Non-residential basements/cellars may be allowed below the regulatory flood
protection elevation; provided that, the basement/cellar is structurally dry flood-proofed in
accordance with division (D)(3) below.

(3) All areas of non-residential structures, including basements/cellars, to be placed below
the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be flood-proofed in accordance with the structurally
dry flood-proofing classifications in the state’s Building Code. Structurally dry flood-proofing must
meet the FP-1 or FP-2 flood-proofing classifications in the state’s Building Code, and this shall
require making the structure water-tight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures flood-proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications shall
not be permitted.
(4) When, at any one time, more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material is
located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations,
landfills, roads dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood-control works, an
erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted. The plan must clearly specify methods to be
used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or regional flood
event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or other
qualified individual acceptable to the governing body. The plan may incorporate alternative
procedures for removal of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
(5) (a) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable,
explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited.
(b) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from
the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by
the governing body.
(6) The provisions in division (E) below shall also apply.
(E) Standards for all flood fringe uses.
(1) General. All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an
elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. If a variance to this
requirement is granted, the Board of Adjustment must specify limitations on the period of use or
occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood

warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
(2) Commercial uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks and parking lots,
may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, a permit for the
facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a
flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a
depth greater than two feet or be subject to flood velocities greater than four feet per second upon
occurrence of the regional flood.
(3) Manufacturing and industrial uses. Measures shall be taken to minimize interference
with normal plant operations, especially along streams having protracted flood durations. Certain
accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements
set out in division (E)(2) above. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given
to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in floodplain areas.
(4) Fill. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the
use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for
certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation - FEMA’s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for
multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the
initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
(5) Hydraulic capacity. Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system
where a floodway or other encroachment limits have not been specified on the Official Zoning Map.
(6) Manufactured homes. All manufactured homes (mobile homes) must be securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or
frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring
requirements for resisting wind forces.

(7) The natural drainage system shall be used as far as is feasible for storage and flow of
runoff. Storm water drainage shall be discharged to marshlands, swamps, retention basins or other
treatment facilities. Diversion of storm water to marshlands or swamps shall be considered for
existing or planned surface drainage. Marshlands and swamps used for storm water shall provide for
natural or artificial water level control. Temporary storage areas or retention basins scattered
throughout developed areas shall be encouraged to reduce peak flow, erosion damage and
construction cost.
(8) Public and private properties adjacent to the development site shall be protected from
the effects of sedimentation. Any violations of this provision must be corrected by the owner to the
satisfaction of the city within five days of receiving notification of such. If the violation is not
remedied within the time period specified, the city may correct the problem and assess the costs
incurred to the property owner.
(B) Exposed slopes. The following control measures shall be taken to control erosion during
construction.
(1) No exposed slopes should be steeper in grade than four feet horizontal to one foot
vertical.
(2) At the foot of each exposed slope, a channel and berm should be constructed to control
runoff. The channelized water should be diverted to a sedimentation basin (debris basin, silt basin or
silt trap) before being allowed to enter the natural drainage system.
(3) Along the top of each exposed slope, a berm should be constructed to prevent runoff
from flowing over the edge of the slope. Where runoff collecting behind the berm cannot be diverted
elsewhere and must be directed down the slope, appropriate measures shall be taken to prevent
erosion. The measures should consist of either an asphalt paved flow apron and drop chute laid down
the slope or a flexible slope drain. At the base of the slope drain or flow apron, a gravel energy
dissipater should be installed to prevent erosion at the discharge end.
(4) Exposed slopes shall be protected by whatever means will effectively prevent erosion
considering the degree of the slope, soils, material and expected length of exposure. Slope protection
shall consist of mulch, sheets of plastic, burlap or jute netting, sod blankets, fast growing grasses or

temporary seedings of annual grasses. Mulch consists of hay, straw, wood chips, corn stalks, bark or
other protective material. Mulch should be anchored to slopes with liquid asphalt, stakes and netting,
or should be worked into the soil to provide additional slope stability.
(5) Control measures, other than those specifically stated above, may be used in place of
the above measures if it can be demonstrated that they will as effectively protect exposed slopes.

§ 154.225 PRESERVATION OF NATURAL DRAINAGEWAYS.
(A) Waterways.
(1) Every effort shall be made to retain the natural drainage systems in the city including
existing wetlands and ponds. The natural drainage system shall be maintained by the city.
Above-ground runoff disposal waterways may be constructed to augment the natural drainage
system.
(2) The widths of a constructed waterway shall be sufficiently large to adequately channel
runoff from a ten-year storm. Adequacy shall be determined by the expected runoff when full
development of the drainage area is reached.
(3) No fences or structures shall be constructed across the waterway that will reduce or
restrict the flow of water.
(4) The banks of the waterway shall be protected with a permanent vegetation.
(5) The banks of the waterway should not exceed four feet horizontal to one foot vertical in
gradient.

(6) The gradient of the waterway bed should not exceed a grade that will result in a velocity
that will cause erosion of the banks of the waterway.
(7) The bend of the waterway should be protected with turf, sod or concrete. If turf or sod
will not function properly, riprap may be used. Riprap shall consist of quarried limestone, fieldstone
(if random riprap is used) or construction materials of concrete. The riprap shall be no smaller than
two inches square, nor no larger than two feet square. Construction materials shall be used only in
those areas where the waterway is not used as part of a recreation trial system.
(8) If the flow velocity in the waterway is such that erosion of the turf side wall will occur
and the velocity cannot be decreased via velocity control structures, then other materials may replace
turf on the side walls. Either gravel or riprap would be allowed to prevent erosion at these points.
(B) Sediment control of waterways.
(1) To prevent sedimentation of waterways, pervious and impervious sediment traps and
other sediment control structures shall be incorporated throughout the contributing watershed.
(2) Temporary pervious sediment traps could consist of a construction of bales of hay with
a low spillway embankment section of sand and gravel that permits a slow movement of water while
filtering sediment. The structures would serve as temporary sediment control features during the
construction state of development. Development of housing and other structures shall be restricted
from the area on either side of the waterway required to channel a 25-year storm.
(3) Permanent impervious sediment control structures consist of sediment basins (debris
basins, desilting basins or silt traps) and shall be utilized to remove sediment from runoff prior to its
disposal in any permanent body of water.
