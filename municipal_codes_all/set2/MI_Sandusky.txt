Chief of Police, who shall cause such investigation of the applicant’s business and
moral character to be made as he deems necessary for the protection of the public
good.

application to the City Clerk, who shall notify the applicant that his application is

as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce. In any case where a
license fee is believed by a licensee or applicant for license to place an undue
burden upon such commerce, he may apply to the Mayor for an adjustment of the
fee so that it shall not be discriminatory, unreasonable, or unfair as to such
commerce. Such application may be made before, at, or within six months after
payment of the prescribed license fee. The applicant shall, by affidavit, and
supporting testimony, show his method of business and the gross volume or
estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the Mayor may
deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden on
such commerce. The Mayor shall then conduct an investigation, comparing
applicant’s business with other businesses of like nature and shall make findings
of fact from which he shall determine whether the fee fixed by this chapter is
unfair, unreasonable or discriminatory as to applicant’s business and shall fix as
the license fee for the applicant, an amount that is fair reasonable, and nondiscriminatory,
or, if the fee has already been paid, shall order a refund of the
amount over and above the fee so fixed. In fixing the fee to be charged, the
Mayor shall have the power to base the fee upon a percentage of gross sales, or
any other method which will assure that the fee assessed shall be uniform with
that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not
exceed the fees as prescribed by Section 5 (a) of this chapter. Should the Mayor
determine the gross sales measure of the fee to be the fair basis, he may require
the applicant to submit, either at the time of termination of applicant’s business in
the City of Sandusky or at the end of each three month period, a sworn statement
of the gross sales and pay the amount of fee therefore, provided that no additional
Sandusky Code/Ord 128/*010182 Chapter 22 – Page 4 Peddlers

paid an amount equal to the annual license as prescribed in Section 5 (a) of this
chapter.

the amount of $1,000.00, with surety acceptable to and approved by the Mayor,
conditioned that the said applicant shall comply fully with all the provisions of the

and concerning the business of solicitor and guaranteeing to any citizen of the City of
Sandusky doing business with said solicitor. Action on such bond may be brought in the
name of the City to the use or benefit of the aggrieved person.

badge which shall contain the words “Licensed Peddler” or “Licensed Solicitor” as the
case may be, the period for which the license is issued and the number of the license in
letters and figures easily discernible from a distance of ten feet. Such badge shall, during

of any citizen.

seen peddling, soliciting, or canvassing, and who is not known by such officer to be duly
licensed, to produce his peddler’s solicitor’s, or canvasser’s license and to enforce the
provisions of this chapter against any person found to be violating the same.
22.10.00 Records.
The Chief of Police shall report to the City Clerk all convictions for violation of this
chapter and the City Clerk shall maintain a record for each license issued and record the
reports of violation therein.

C.08.01 Imposition of Cost Recovery Charge
In the event industrial wastes are introduced into the public sewer system,
a system of Industrial Cost Recovery shall be imposed.
C.08.02 Cost Recovery Liability, Exclusions, Assessment, Computation,
Appeal, Monitor Disbursal
A) Liability
Industrial users which are liable for Industrial Cost Recovery, as
defined, shall include the following:
1. Any nongovernmental, non-residential user of a publicly
owned treatment works which discharges process wastes
which are more than the equivalent of 25,000 gallons per
day (gpd) of normal strength sewage wastes, as defined,
and which is identified in the Standard Industrial
Classification manual, 1972, Office of Management and
Budget, as amended, and supplemental, under one of the
following divisions:
Division A. Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing
Division B. Mining
Division D. Manufacturing
Division E. Transportation, Communications, Electric,
Gas, and Sanitary Services
Division I. Services
2. Any nongovernmental users of a publicly owned Treatment
Works which discharges wastewater to the Treatment
Works which contains toxic pollutants or poisonous solids,
liquids, or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by
interaction with other wastes, to contaminate the sludge of
any municipal systems, or to injure, or to interfere with any
sewage treatment process, or which constitutes a hazard to
humans or animal, creates a public nuisance, or creates any
hazard in, or has an adverse effect on, the waters receiving
any discharge from the Treatment Works.
B) Exclusion
For purposes of Industrial Cost Recovery Charge calculations,
computations of amounts of industrial wastes shall exclude
amounts of domestic wastes and/or wastes from human sanitary
conveniences, normally a part of a given industrial waste stream.
Sandusky Code Appendum C-19 Sewer Use
C) Assessment
Each industrial use which is subject to Industrial Cost Recovery,
will be assessed an Industrial Cost Recovery Charge for use of
Public Sewage Works which are funded in part by U.S. EPA
Construction Grants received after March 1, 1973. The charge will
be levied in accordance with Federal Regulation in force after July
1, 1980 and will be based on waste volume, delivery flow rate, and
pollutant loadings as they may affect the capacity of eligible
Sewage Works. The City shall reserve the right to adjust said
Industrial Cost Recovery Charges to any sewer user that
significantly alters its waste volume or delivery flow rate.
Affected users shall only be required to pay charges for those years
that they use the system and only at an annual rate in proportion to
the length of the entire recovery period. The Industrial Cost
Revelry period is the time period that is provided to allow
industrial users to pay their total Industrial Cost Recovery Charge
and shall be equal to thirty (30) years.
D) Calculation & Payment
The Industrial Cost Recovery Charge for each affected industrial
user shall be a portion of the Federal construction grant amount
equal in proportion to said user’s proportionate share of the total
capacity of the system in terms of strength, volume and delivery
flow rate. Specifically, the total Industrial Cost Recovery Charge
shall be determined by the sum of the four following calculations:
1) Industrial volume contribution per unit of time * EPA grant
/ (divided by) Plant design per unit of time portion allocable
-plus- To volume
handling per unit
of time
2) Industrial BOD contribution per unit of time * EPA grant
/ (divided by) Plant BOD design capacity per portion
allocable
unit of time To BOD
-plus- handling per unit
of time
3) Industrial suspended solids contribution / unit * EPA grant
of time portion allocable
/ (divided by) Plant suspended solids design to suspended
Capacity/unit of time solids handling
-plus- per unit of time
4) Industrial phosphorus contribution per unit of time * EPA grant
/ (divided by) Plant Phosphorus design capacity portion allocable
Per unit of time to phosphorus
handling per unit
of time
Sandusky Code Appendum C-20 Sewer Use
Industrial Cost Recovery Charges shall be calculated and paid
annually in an amount equal to the total Industrial Cost Recovery
Charge for an industrial user divided by thirty (30) years.
E) Appeal of Cost Recovery Charge
Any industrial user can appeal the Industrial Cost Recovery
Charge by submitting such appeal in writing addressed to the City
Council who shall review such charges.
F) Monitoring of Industrial Waste Stream
For purposes of Industrial Cost Recovery calculations, the affected
industrial user shall monitor its industrial waste stream(s), as
directed by the City, and no less than quarterly and at the user’s
expense. The City hall reserve the right to request split samples
from the user and analyze the wastes independently, the costs of
which shall be borne by the user.
G) Disbursal of costs recovered (amd Ord 09-01)
Costs recovered from industrial users shall be deposited by the
City in a separate account indentified as the “industrial Cost
Recovery Account.” Funds shall be distributed from the
“industrial Cost Recovery Account” in accordance with U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency Rules and in the following
manner:
i) In the event that the system is currently funded by USEPA
grant, the City shall retain fifty percent of the total
recovered amount. The remainder, together with any
interest earned thereon, shall be returned to the U.S.
Treasury on an annual basis. If the system is not currently
funded by USEPA grant, the City shall retain the entire
amount.
ii) Eighty percent of the retained amount, together with
interest earned thereon, shall be used solely for the eligible
costs of expansion or reconstruction of the Treatment
Works and only upon written approval of the EPA
Administrator, Region V. The remainder of the retained
amount may be used as the City so desires.
iii) Pending use, the City shall invest the retained amounts for
expansion and reconstruction in: (1) obligations of the U.S.
government; (2) obligations guaranteed as to principal and
interest by the U.S. Government or any agency thereof; or

Section 2.103 Single-Family Residential (R), District.
The Single-Family Residential (R) District is hereby established for the purpose of providing a
range of housing choices and limiting uses that would adversely impact residential
neighborhoods. The intent of this district is to provide for an environment of predominantly
single-family detached dwellings, along with other associated uses and facilities that serve
residents in the district.
It is the further intent of the district to prohibit or restrict any land use that would substantially
interfere with development or continuation of single-family detached dwellings, would generate
traffic on minor or local streets in excess of normal traffic serving the residences on those
streets, or would, because of its character or size, create requirements and costs for public
services (such as fire, police protection, water supply or sewerage), substantially in excess of
such requirements and costs if the district were developed solely for single-family dwellings.
Finally, it is the intent to encourage the discontinuance of existing uses that would not be
permitted as new uses under the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 2.104 Multiple-Family Residential (RM) District.
The, Multiple-Family Residential (RM) District is hereby established to promote a harmonious
mixture of higher density housing options (such as apartments, townhouses, condominiums and
stacked flats) at planned locations in the community to meet the various needs of different
residents. Associated uses and facilities that serve the residents in the district shall also be
provided within a primarily residential environment.
The Multiple Family Residential District is further intended to serve as a transition zone between
non-residential districts and the lower density Single-Family Residential District. Uses in this
district should be located near streets with adequate planned capacity to accommodate the
traffic volumes typically generated by higher density development, and shall be served by public
water and sewerage systems and other appropriate utilities and services.
Development in the Multiple Family Residential District shall be subject to appropriate design,
density and development standards (including density, bulk, setback and separation standards,
and provisions for sufficient light, air, privacy and recreation areas) that are intended to prevent
congestion on public streets, reduce hazards to life and property, provide adequate recreation
areas and basic amenities, and ensure compatibility with the adjacent Single-Family Residential
District.
Section 2.105 Manufactured Housing Park (MHP) District.
The Manufactured Housing Park (MHP) District is hereby established to provide for the location
and regulation of manufactured housing parks (formerly known as “mobile home parks”), as
defined by the Mobile Home Commission Act, P.A. 96 of 1987 (as amended), and the
Manufactured Housing Commission General Rules. It is intended that manufactured housing
parks be provided with necessary community services and other associated uses and facilities
that serve the residents in the district in a setting that provides a high quality of life for residents.
In accordance with the purpose of this district, manufactured housing parks shall be located in
areas where they will be compatible with adjacent land uses.
Article 2
Zoning Districts and Map
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 2 - 3
The regulations and rules established by the Mobile Home Commission Act (P.A. 96 of 1987, as
amended) and the Manufactured Housing Commission govern all manufactured housing parks.
Where regulations in this Article and Ordinance exceed the state law or general rules, they are
intended to promote the health, safety and welfare of the City's residents, and to insure that
manufactured housing parks are developed and maintained in a manner equivalent to the
standards established by this Ordinance for comparable residential developments in the City.
Further, the district is intended to meet the needs of the different age and family groups in the
community, prevent congestion on the public streets, minimize hazards to life and property, and
ensure sufficient provisions for light, air, privacy, recreation areas and basic amenities to serve
the residents of the district.
Section 2.106 Neighborhood Business (NB) District.
The Neighborhood Business (NB) District is hereby established to provide for local service and
convenience shopping facilities to meet the day-to-day needs of persons residing in nearby
residential areas. The district is intended to serve as a buffer between more intensive
commercial districts and abutting residential neighborhoods. This district is intended for areas
not suitable for low-density residential development or desirable for high intensity commercial
uses. Building sizes for permitted uses are limited to promote such appropriately scaled
business development in the district.
Uses which would create hazards, loud noises, vibration, smoke, glare, heavy traffic or late
hours of operation are prohibited, unless otherwise specified, automotive-related services and
other uses that would typically interfere with the continuity of retail frontage hinder pedestrian
circulation and disrupt the functioning of this district shall also be prohibited.
Section 2.107.1. Community Business (CB1) District.
The Community Business (CB1) District is hereby established to provide for various types of
office, convenience, and comparison-shopping goods to meet the day-to-day needs of City
residents and visitors and surrounding rural areas for convenience and durable goods, personal
services, food, entertainment, shopping and related activities. It is the intent of the Community
Business (CB1) District to encourage commercial and business facilities around the Community
Business (CB2) District so as to economically, efficiently, and effectively serve the general City
area with a wide variety of commercial retail uses. It is further the intent of the Community
Business (CB1) District to allow the same uses as permitted in the Community Business (CB2)
District, but subject to the dimensional standards of the Neighborhood Business (NB) District.
It is the intent of the Community Business (CB1) District to preserve the existing downtown
character, strengthen and extend the historic development pattern, and promote a highly
concentrated and pedestrian-accessible mix of complementary retail, restaurant, entertainment,
office, and service uses. Building owners in the Community Business (CB1) District are
encouraged to provide retail or personal service uses at the street level. In buildings without
such uses, other active uses of visual interest to pedestrians should be displayed, including
office or lobby areas, showrooms, classrooms, kitchens or similar activities. Building sizes for
permitted uses are limited to promote such appropriately scaled business development in the
district.
Article 2
Zoning Districts and Map

prohibited. Parking facilities in the district shall be designed to serve the area rather than
individual businesses. Unless otherwise specified, automotive-related services and other uses
that would typically interfere with the continuity of retail frontage, hinder pedestrian circulation,
and disrupt the functioning of this district shall also be prohibited.
Section 2.107.2. Community Business (CB2) District.
The Community Business (CB2) District is hereby established to provide for various types of
office, convenience, and comparison-shopping goods to meet the day-to-day needs of City
residents, visitors, and surrounding rural areas for convenience and durable goods, personal
services, food, entertainment, shopping, and related activities. It is the intent of the Community
Business (CB2) District to encourage commercial and business facilities in the centralized
business district so as to economically, efficiently, and effectively serve the general City area
with a wide variety of commercial retail uses.
It is the intent of the Community Business (CB2) District to preserve the existing downtown
character, strengthen and extend the historic development pattern, and promote a highly
concentrated and pedestrian-accessible mix of complementary retail, restaurant, entertainment,
office, and service uses. Building owners in the Community Business District are encouraged
to provide retail or personal service uses at the street level. In buildings without such uses,
other active uses of visual interest to pedestrians should be displayed, including office or lobby
areas, showrooms, classrooms, kitchens or similar activities. Building sizes for permitted uses
are limited to promote such appropriately scaled business development in the district.
Uses that would create hazards, loud noises, vibration, smoke, glare or heavy traffic shall be
prohibited. Parking facilities in the district shall be designed to serve the area rather than
individual businesses. Unless otherwise specified, automotive-related services, and other uses
that would typically interfere with the continuity of retail frontage, hinder pedestrian circulation,
and disrupt the functioning of this district shall also be prohibited.
Section 2.108 General Business (GB) District.
The General Business (GB) District is hereby established to provide sites for more diversified
business types which would often be incompatible with the pedestrian movement in the
Community Business District and which are oriented to serving the needs of "passer-by" traffic
within the City and surrounding region. This district is further intended to provide opportunities
for automobile-related businesses, uses that generate large traffic volumes or require
substantial off-street parking facilities, and other uses incompatible with the pedestrian-oriented
character, scale, and mix of permitted uses in the Community Business or Neighborhood
Business Districts. Accordingly, this district should be generally located near major streets and
thoroughfares to prevent potential nuisances and use conflicts.
Because of the types of uses permitted in the General Business District, detailed attention shall
be focused on relationships with adjacent areas, site layout, building design, and vehicular and
pedestrian circulation. Development in the district shall be compatible in design with the overall
City character, designed in coordination with adjoining sites, and buffered from or located away
from residential areas.

City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 2 - 5
Section 2.109 Industrial-Research (I-1) District.
The Industrial-Research (I-1) District is hereby established for the purpose of permitting certain
industries of a light manufacturing, research, warehousing or wholesaling character to locate in
planned areas of the City where such uses will not have a detrimental impact on surrounding
neighborhoods. This district is not intended for the processing of raw materials for bulk
shipment or use in industrial operations at other locations.
It is further intended that the Industrial-Research District provide specific use and site
development standards designed to promote the creation of high quality office, research,
warehousing, wholesaling, and manufacturing facilities. To meet the purpose and intent of this
district, certain land uses are prohibited, including, but not limited to uses that would create
excessive or unusual danger of fire, explosion, toxicity, or exposure to radiation or other
unusually noxious, offensive, unhealthy and harmful odors, fumes, dust, smoke, light, waste,
noise or vibration.
Section 2.110 General Industrial (I-2) District.
The General Industrial (I-2) District is hereby established for the purpose of permitting a wide
range of manufacturing, assembling, and fabrication activities including large scale or
specialized industrial operations in planned areas of the City where such uses and facilities
would have very limited detrimental impacts on surrounding neighborhoods or the City as a
whole. The intent of the General Industrial District is to promote the creation of high quality
industrial, research, and manufacturing jobs and permit more intensive, large-scale or
specialized industrial operations requiring special sites or public and utility services. It is so
structured as to permit the manufacturing, processing, and compounding of semi-finished or
finished products from raw materials as well as from previously prepared material. Reasonable
regulations and limitations apply to these more intense uses to minimize any adverse effects on
other areas of the City.
To meet the purpose and intent of this district, certain land uses are prohibited, including, but
not limited to uses that would create excessive or unusual danger of fire, explosion, toxicity, or
exposure to radiation or other unusually noxious, offensive, unhealthy and harmful odors,
fumes, dust, smoke, light, waste, noise or vibration.

Planning Commission in accordance with the procedures and conditions defined in Section
12.02 (Special Uses).
Section 2.202 Prohibited Uses.
Uses that are not specifically listed as a principal or special use permitted by this Ordinance in a
zoning district, or otherwise determined to be similar to a listed and permitted use, shall be
prohibited in the district.

The boundaries of zoning districts, as shown on the map accompanying and made a part of this
Ordinance, unless otherwise shown, are lot or tract lines or the center lines of streets, roads or
alleys or the extension thereof, railroad right-of-way lines, and the corporate limits of the City of
Sandusky.
If the Zoning Administrator finds these standards inadequate to interpret the location of a zoning
district boundary or if a property owner wishes to dispute the Zoning Administrator’s
interpretation, the Zoning Board of Appeals may interpret the Zoning Map under the provisions
of Section 18.08 (Interpretations of Zoning District Boundaries).
Section 2.205 Street, Alley and Railroad Rights-of-Way.
All streets, alleys, and railroad rights-of-way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be
deemed to be in the same zone as the property immediately abutting upon such streets, alleys

a pubic hearing and recommendation from the Planning Commission, per
Section 12.04 (Amendments).

City boundaries, the adopted Master Plan recommendations, and planned future
land use designations for the land area or adjacent areas within the City.
Section 2.207 Zoning of Vacated Areas.
Any street, alley, railroad right-of-way or other public way or portion thereof within the City of

Article 8
Screening and Land Use Buffers
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 8 - 1
ARTICLE 8
SCREENING AND LAND USE BUFFERS
Section 8.01 Purpose.
Screening and land use buffers are necessary for the protection and enhancement of the
environment and to ensure reasonable compatibility between land uses of differing intensity or
impacts. Screening elements enhance the visual environment; preserve natural features;
protect property values; alleviate the impact of noise, traffic, and more intensive land uses; and
minimize visual impacts of parking lots, loading areas and storage areas. Screening and
buffering also contribute to a healthy development pattern and increase the level of privacy for
residential uses in the City.
The purposes of this Article is to establish minimum standards for the design, installation, and
maintenance of screening elements and plant materials; to establish reasonable standards for
the screening of uses of a significantly different scale or character; and buffering of parking lots,
storage areas, and similar activities from street rights-of-way and adjacent lots. It is the intent of
this Article that required screening and buffering elements shall be immediately effective in
achieving the purpose of this Article, and shall maintain that effectiveness as the plant materials
mature.
Section 8.02 Scope.
The standards of this Article shall apply to all uses, lots, and sites altered, developed or
expanded after the effective date of this Ordinance that are subject to review per Section 12.01
(Site Plan Review), condominium site plan approval per Article 13 (Condominium Regulations)
or planned unit development approval per Article 14 (Planned Unit Developments). Uses and
activities exempt from site plan approval per Section 12.01 (Site Plan Review) shall be exempt
from the requirements of this Article.
The standards of this Article shall be considered the minimum necessary to achieve the
purposes of this Article and Ordinance. No provision of this Article shall preclude a developer
and the City from agreeing to more extensive landscaping or screening. Where existing sites
have been developed without adequate screening or buffering, the purposes of this Article shall
be achieved through improvements that are in reasonable proportion to the scale and
construction cost of proposed building improvements, expansions, or other site improvements.
Section 8.03 General Standards.
The following standards shall apply to all landscaping and screening elements required by
provisions of this Ordinance or determined necessary by the Planning Commission as part of
site plan approval:

property owner from the Zoning Administrator prior to any delimbing, root
pruning, or similar work.
4. Protective fencing shall be placed at the drip-line of existing trees, and around
the perimeter of other preserved plant materials, with details of protective
measures noted on the site plan. No vehicle or other construction equipment
shall be parked or stored within protected areas.
5. In the event that trees or other plant materials identified to be preserved on an
approved site plan are destroyed or damaged, as determined by the Zoning
Administrator, the owner, developer or contractor shall replace the plant material
with a comparable size, amount, and species.
Section 8.04 Methods of Screening.
Where required by this Ordinance or otherwise determined necessary by the Planning
Commission in accordance with the purposes and scope of this Article, screening and buffering
elements shall satisfy the purpose and objectives of this Article, and shall be accomplished by
one (1) or more of following five (5) methods that the Planning Commission determines to be
best suited for the existing conditions:
A. Greenbelt Buffer.
The purpose of this method is to establish a buffer between adjacent land uses, or
between uses and adjacent street rights-of-way. This method is intended to provide a
partial visual screen, particularly where the adjacent uses (including uses that are
adjacent across a street right-of-way) are less intense than the use of the subject site.
Greenbelt buffers shall consist of the following (see illustration):
1. Greenbelts shall have a minimum width of ten (10) feet and may be interrupted
only to provide for pedestrian or vehicular access.
2. Greenbelts shall be sodded, hydro-seeded, or planted with appropriate
groundcovers.
3. A mixture of deciduous shade trees, ornamental trees, evergreen trees, and
shrubs shall be planted along the greenbelt buffer at a minimum concentration of
one (1) tree and three (3) shrubs per 15 linear feet of greenbelt length along a
property line or street frontage.
a. Such required plant materials may be placed at uniform intervals, at
random or in groupings.
b. The greenbelt length shall be measured along the centerline of the
greenbelt for its entire length, inclusive of all driveways.
Article 8
Screening and Land Use Buffers
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 8 - 5
B. Fence.
The purpose of this method is to visually screen parking lots, outdoor storage areas, and
similar uses where the predominant impacts are at or below eye level. This method
shall consist of an ornamental, rail or privacy fence constructed along the lot or zoning
district boundary, or around the perimeter of the area to be screened, subject to the
following (see illustration):
1. Required fences shall have a minimum height of three (3) feet, and shall not
exceed six (6) feet in height above grade unless a higher fence height is
determined by the Planning Commission to be necessary to provide adequate
screening.
2. Such fences shall conform to the standards of Section 15.102 (Fences).
3. The fence materials, height, location, and design shall be consistent with existing
fences on adjacent lots, and shall be subject to Planning Commission approval.
C. Berm.
The purpose of this method is to effectively screen visual and noise impacts using
natural-appearing landforms. This method is intended to provide an obscuring screen to
block noise and light from adjacent uses or street rights-of-way, or to create a buffer
between developed and undeveloped areas of a site. Berms shall consist of a
combination of a sculpted earth mound and plantings, which shall meet the following
standards (see illustration):
1. Berms shall have side slopes no steeper than four (4) feet horizontal to one (1)
foot vertical (4:1 ratio).
2. Berms shall have a minimum height of three (3) feet above the grade elevation.
Overall berm height shall be adequate for the intended screening function.
Grade elevation shall be the ground elevation at the nearest lot line adjacent to
the proposed berm.
3. The interior face of the berm may be constructed as an earthen slope, or may be
retained by means of a wall, terrace or similar means acceptable to the Planning
Commission.
4. The berm shall be designed and graded to blend with existing topography and
sodded, hydro-seeded or planted with appropriate groundcovers.
5. The Planning Commission may require greenbelt plantings on the berm, per
Section 8.04A (Greenbelt Buffer). For the purpose of determining any required
plant materials, the length of any required berm shall be measured from one toe
of the berm (the farthest point at one end of the berm’s long dimension where the
berm height equals the surrounding grade level) along the berm’s centerline to
the toe at the opposite end of the berm.
Article 8
Screening and Land Use Buffers
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 8 - 6
D. Evergreen Screen.
The purpose of this method is to create a dense obscuring screen that meets the
objectives of this Article. This method is intended to establish a year-round screening
barrier between land uses of differing intensities, to effectively block noise and light, or to
completely separate developed and undeveloped portions of a site.
This method shall consist of closely spaced evergreen trees with year-round screening
characteristics. Such trees shall be planted a maximum of 15 feet apart in at least two
(2) staggered rows (see illustration).
E. Masonry Wall.
The purpose of this method is to create a solid, year-round barrier and obscuring screen
to effectively block noise, light, and other impacts between land uses of differing
intensities. Such walls shall be subject to the following (see illustration):
1. Masonry walls shall have a minimum height of two (2) feet, and shall not exceed
six (6) feet in height above grade unless a higher wall height is determined by the
Planning Commission to be necessary to provide adequate screening.
2. Walls shall be solid in character, and capped with a stone or concrete cap.
3. Wall materials shall be coordinated with the principal building materials on the
site. The Planning Commission may require that decorative masonry (brick,
stone, or decorative block) materials be incorporated into the wall design and
construction.

Article 9
Signs
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 9 - 1
ARTICLE 9
SIGNS
Section 9.01 Purpose.
The primary function of signage, as it relates to this Ordinance, is to identify a particular use or
business occupying a zoning lot or building in the City. The City further finds that reasonable
use of signage promotes commerce in the City. However, unrestricted signage does not benefit
individual businesses or property owners, or the community as a whole, because a proliferation
of signs in the City would unduly distract or endanger motorists and pedestrians; cause the
deterioration of business or residential areas; obstruct vision; negatively impact property values;
and reduce the effectiveness of both business signage and signs needed to direct and warn the
public.
The provisions of this Article shall be considered to be the minimum necessary to promote and
protect the public health, safety, comfort, morals, and convenience. The further purposes of this
Article are to:
1. Encourage free expression of ideas and dissemination of messages, regardless
of content, using signs that are compatible with their surroundings and legible
under the circumstances in which they are designed to be seen.
2. Regulate the construction, alteration, repair, and maintenance of all signs with
respect to safety, location, dimensions, height, and method of illumination.
3. Permit such signs as will not, by reason of their size, location, or manner of
display, endanger public health or safety; confuse or mislead traffic; or obstruct
vision necessary for traffic and pedestrian safety.
4. Minimize the proliferation of visual clutter and preserve the appearance of the
City by preventing the placement of oversized signs that are out of scale with
surrounding buildings and uses.
5. Seek the removal of unlawful and abandoned signs, and encourage the
replacement or removal of nonconforming signs that are incompatible with the
purpose of this Article.
Section 9.02 General Standards.
The following general standards shall apply to signs in all zoning districts:
A. Standards of Measurement.
Dimensional standards and measurements for signs shall be subject to the following
(see illustration):
Article 9
Signs
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 9 - 2
1. Sign height. The distance from the average level of the ground or pavement
directly below the sign to the highest point of the sign structure, including any
supportive or decorative elements (see illustration).
2. Sign setback. Setbacks shall be measured from the closest street right-of-way
or front lot line to the nearest edge of the sign.
3. Sign area. The surface area of a sign shall include the total area within any
regular geometric figure (circle, triangle, rectangle, etc.) enclosing the extreme
limits of letters, symbols or other material forming an integral part of the display
or used to differentiate the sign from the background against which it is placed
(see illustration).
a. Where two (2) sign faces with identical sign areas are placed back to
back no more than two (2) feet apart, then the sign area shall equal the
area of one (1) face.
b. Where two (2) sign faces with different sign areas are placed back to
back no more than two (2) feet apart, then the sign area shall equal the
area of the larger face.
c. Where two (2) sign faces are placed more than two (2) feet apart at any
point, then the sign area shall equal the total area of all sign faces.
d. Where a sign has more than two (2) sign faces, then, the sign area shall
equal the total area of all sign faces.
4. Signable area. The signable area of a building shall equal the area of the
building’s street level façade (see illustration).
a. Multiple uses. Where more than one business or use occupies space on
the street level façade, the total signable area allowed for the building
shall be divided among the businesses or uses in proportion to the size of
each occupied space.
b. Corner lots. Where a building has two (2) or more street level facades
(such as on a corner lot), the signable area shall equal the area of the
largest street level façade.
B. Construction and Maintenance.
All signs shall be constructed or installed in compliance with the State Construction
Code, and other applicable building, fire, and electrical codes enforced by the City; shall
be maintained in good repair and working order; and shall present a neat and orderly
appearance. Non-galvanized or corrosion-prone materials shall be painted as
necessary to prevent corrosion.
All sign faces shall be smooth and no nails, tacks or wires shall be permitted to protrude
from any sign. This shall not exclude the use of block letters, decorative elements or
other devices that may extend over the top or in front of the sign structure.
Article 9

Signs shall not be designed or maintained in a manner that would confuse or mislead
motorists or pedestrians, create traffic or pedestrian hazards, obstruct free and clear
vision or interfere with any traffic control device. No sign shall be erected or maintained
so as to prevent ingress or egress from any door, window or fire escape. No sign of any
kind shall be attached to a standpipe, fire escape or other means of ingress or egress.
E. Use.
All signs shall be accessory to the principal use of the lot where the sign is located, and
shall not impair the use of adjacent properties. Any sign permitted by this Article may
contain a non-commercial message.

replacement would comply with the provisions of this Article.
Section 10.08 Exceptions.
It is recognized by the City that certain uses or circumstances may have special exterior lighting
requirements not otherwise addressed by this Article. The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) may
waive or modify specific provisions of this Article for a particular use or circumstance, upon

Administrator or designated City consultant shall make a determination whether
there is reasonable cause to suspect the operation is indeed in violation of the
Article 11
Special Development Provisions
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 11 - 19
performance standards. The Zoning Administrator may initiate an official
investigation in order to make such a determination.
Upon initiation of an official investigation, the Zoning Administrator is empowered
to require the owner or operator of the facility in question to submit data and
evidence deemed necessary to make an objective determination regarding the
possible violation. Failure of the owner or operator to supply requested data shall
constitute grounds for taking legal action to terminate the use or deny or rescind
any permits required for continued use of the land. Data which may be required
includes, but is not limited to the following:
a. Plans for existing/proposed facilities, buildings, and equipment.
b. Descriptions of existing/proposed machinery, processes, and products.
c. Specifications for mechanisms and techniques used or proposed to control
emissions regulated under the provisions of this Section.
d. Measurement of the amount or rate of emissions of materials purported to
be in violation.
2. Method and cost of determination. The Zoning Administrator or designated City
consultant shall take measurements and complete investigation necessary to make
an objective determination concerning the purported violation. Where required
measurements and investigation can be accurately using equipment and personnel
normally available to the City without extraordinary expense, such measurements
and investigation shall be completed before notice of violation is issued. If
necessary, skilled personnel and spec equipment or instruments shall be secured
to make the required determination.
If the alleged violation is found to exist in fact, the costs of making such
determination shall be charged against those responsible, in addition to such other
penalties as may be appropriate. If it is determined that no substantive violation
exists then such costs shall be paid by the City.
3. Appropriate remedies. If, after appropriate investigation, the Zoning
Administrator or designated City consultant determines that a violation does exist,
the Zoning Administrator shall provide written notice of the violation to the owners
or operators of the facility deemed responsible and shall request that the violation
be corrected within a specified time limit.
a. Correction of violation within time limit. If the alleged violation is
corrected within the specified time limit, the Zoning Administrator shall note
“violation corrected” on the City’s copy of the notice, which shall be retained
on file.
b. Violation not corrected and no reply from owner or operator. If there is
no reply from the owner or operator within the specified time limits and the
alleged violation is not corrected, then the Zoning Administrator shall take
such action as may be warranted to correct the violation, in accordance
with the regulations set forth in this Section.
Article 11
Special Development Provisions
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 11 - 20
c. Reply requesting time extension. If a reply is received within the
specified time limit indicating that an alleged violation will be corrected, but
that more time is required, the Zoning Administrator may grant an extension
upon determining that the extension is warranted because of the
circumstances in the case and will not cause imminent peril to life, health or
property.
d. Reply requesting technical determination. If a reply is received within
the specified time limit request further review and technical analysis even
though the alleged violations continue, then the Zoning Administrator may
call in properly qualified experts to complete such analysis and confirm or
refute the initial determination of violation.
4. Costs and penalties incurred. If expert findings indicate that violations do exist in
fact, the costs incurred in making such a determination shall be paid by the
persons responsible for the violations in addition to other applicable penalties
under this Ordinance. Such costs shall be billed to those owners or operators of
the use deemed responsible for the violation.
If the bill is not paid within 30 days, the City may take necessary action to recover
such costs or may charge such costs against the property where the violation
occurred.

Article 12
Procedures and Standards
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 12 - 7
1. To ensure compliance with this Ordinance, the approved site plan, and any
conditions of site plan approval, the Planning Commission or Zoning
Administrator may require that a irrevocable performance guarantee be
deposited with the City Treasurer, subject to the standards of Section 1.08 (Fees
and Performance Guarantees). The amount of the performance guarantee shall
be sufficient to ensure faithful completion of the improvements associated with a
project for which site plan approval is sought, as determined by the Zoning
Administrator.
2. The Zoning Administrator or designee shall make periodic investigations of
developments for which site plans have been approved. Noncompliance with the
requirements and conditions of the approved site plan shall be considered a
violation of this Ordinance and shall constitute grounds for the Planning
Commission to rescind site plan approval.
L. Standards for Site Plan Approval.
The following criteria shall be used as a basis upon which site plans will be reviewed and
approved, approved with conditions or denied:
1. Adequacy of information. The site plan includes all required information in a
complete and understandable form, provides an accurate description of the
proposed uses, and complies with all applicable Ordinance requirements.
2. Site appearance and coordination. The site is designed in a manner that
promotes the normal and orderly development of surrounding lands, and all site
design elements are harmoniously organized in relation to topography, adjacent
facilities, traffic circulation, building orientation, and pedestrian access.
3. Preservation of site features. The site design preserves and conserves
natural, cultural, historical, and architectural site features, including architecturally
or historically significant buildings, archeological sites, wetlands, topography,
tree-rows, hedgerows, woodlands, and significant individual trees, to the extent
feasible.
4. Pedestrian access and circulation. Existing and proposed sidewalks or
pedestrian pathways connect to existing public sidewalks and pathways in the
area, are insulated as completely as possible from the vehicular circulation
system, and comply with applicable regulations regarding barrier-free access.
5. Vehicular access and circulation. Drives, streets, parking, site access, and
other vehicle-related elements are designed to minimize traffic conflicts on
adjacent streets and promote safe and efficient traffic circulation within the site.
6. Building design and architecture. Building design and architecture relate to
and are harmonious with the surrounding neighborhood with regard to scale,
mass, proportion, and materials.
7. Parking and loading. Off-street parking lots and loading areas are arranged
and located to accommodate the intensity of proposed uses, minimize conflicts
with adjacent uses, and promote shared-use of common facilities where feasible.
Article 12
Procedures and Standards
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 12 - 8
8. Screening. Landscaping and screening are provided in a manner that
adequately buffers adjacent land uses and screens off-street parking, mechanical
appurtenances, loading and unloading areas, and storage areas from adjacent
residential areas and public rights-of-way.
9. Exterior lighting. All exterior lighting fixtures are designed, arranged, and
shielded to minimize glare and light trespass, prevent night blindness and vision
impairments, and maximize security.
10. Impact upon public services. The impact upon public services (including utilities,
streets, police and fire protection, and public sidewalks and pathways) will not
exceed the existing or planned capacity of such services.
11. Drainage and soil erosion. Adjoining land and uses, public rights-of-way, and

relation to the welfare of adjacent land, uses, and residents; and the community as a
whole. Special uses include those uses that:
1. Serve an area, interest or purpose that extends beyond the borders of the City;
2. Create particular problems of control in relation to adjoining uses or districts;
3. Have detrimental effects upon public health, safety or welfare; or
4. Possess other unique characteristics that prevent such uses from being permitted
without special approval in a particular zoning district.
This Section is intended to provide a consistent and uniform method for review of special
use applications, ensure full compliance with the standards contained in this Ordinance,
achieve efficient use of land, prevent adverse impacts on neighboring properties and
districts, and facilitate development in accordance with the objectives of the Master Plan.
B. Application Requirements.
Special use applications shall be submitted in accordance with the following:
1. Eligibility. The application shall be submitted by the operator of the use or owner
of an interest in the land or structure(s) for which special use approval is sought, or

scheduled review meetings. Applications that are found by the Zoning
Administrator to be incomplete or inaccurate shall be returned to the applicant.
2. Application. Special use applications submitted to the City shall include the
following information:
a. Names, addresses and telephone numbers for the applicant and property
owner and proof of ownership.

subject to conditions or deny the special use as follows:
a. Tabling. Upon determination by the Planning Commission that a special
use application is not sufficiently complete for approval or denial, failure of
the applicant to attend the meeting, or upon request by the applicant, the
Planning Commission may postpone consideration until a later meeting.
b. Denial. Upon determination that a special use application is not in
compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance, including Section 12.02H
(Standards for Special Use Approval), or would require extensive
modifications to comply with said standards and regulations, the special
use shall be denied. If a special use is denied, a written record shall be
provided to the applicant listing the reasons for such denial. Failure of the

1. Public hearing. Such action may be taken only after a public hearing has been
held in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 12.03 (Public Hearing
Procedures), at which time the operator of the use or owner of an interest in the
land or structure(s) for which special use approval was sought, or the owner’s
designated agent, shall be given an opportunity to present evidence in opposition
to rescission.
2. Determination. Subsequent to the hearing, the decision of the Planning
Commission with regard to the rescission shall be made and written notification
provided to said owner, operator or designated agent.
H. Standards for Special Use Approval.
Approval of a special use shall be based upon the determination that the proposed use
complies with all applicable requirements of this Ordinance, and all of the following
standards as deemed applicable to the use by the Planning Commission:
1. Compatibility with adjacent uses. The special use is compatible with adjacent
uses and the existing or intended character of the zoning district and area. The
use will not have an adverse impact upon or interfere with the development, use
or enjoyment of adjacent properties or the orderly development of the
neighborhood.
2. Compatibility with the Master Plan. The special use location and character is
consistent with the general principles, goals, objectives, and policies of the
adopted Master Plan.
3. Compliance with applicable regulations. The proposed special use is in
compliance with all applicable Ordinance provisions.
4. Impact upon public services. The impact of the special use upon public services
will not exceed the existing or planned capacity of such services; including utilities,

Article 12
Procedures and Standards
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 12 - 15
the special use will not be detrimental or injurious to the environment or the
public health, safety, and welfare by reason of traffic, noise, vibration, smoke,
fumes, odors, dust, glare, light, drainage or other adverse impacts.
7. A documented need exists for the proposed use. A documented need exists
for the proposed use within the community.
8. Isolation of existing uses. Approval of the special use location will not result in
a small residential or non-residential area being substantially surrounded by
incompatible uses.
I. Compliance with Special Use Approval.
It shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property and the operator of the use for
which special use approval has been granted to develop, improve, operate and maintain
the use, including the site, structures, and all site elements, in accordance with the
provisions of this Ordinance and all conditions of special use approval until the use is
discontinued. Failure to comply with the provisions of this Section shall be a violation of
the use provisions of this Ordinance and shall be subject to the same penalties
appropriate for a use violation.
The Zoning Administrator or designee may make periodic investigations of
developments for which a special use has been approved. Noncompliance with
Ordinance requirements or conditions of approval shall constitute grounds for the
Planning Commission to rescind special use approval.

ARTICLE 13
CONDOMINIUM REGULATIONS
Section 13.01 Purpose.
The purpose of this Article is to regulate projects that divide real property under a contractual
arrangement known as a condominium. New and conversion condominium projects shall conform
to the requirements of this Ordinance, all other applicable City regulations, and the Condominium
Act (P.A. 59 of 1978, as amended). Each condominium project shall be reviewed in a manner
consistent with equivalent projects within the zoning district.
Pursuant to the authority conferred by the Condominium Act (P.A. 59 of 1978, as amended),
condominium subdivision plans shall be regulated by this Ordinance as site condominiums, and
shall be considered equivalent to a platted subdivision for the purposes of enforcing the City’s
site development standards. It is the intent of this Article to ensure that:
1. Review of condominium subdivision (site condominium) plans be accomplished,
aside from procedural differences, with the objective and intent of achieving the
same results as if the site were to be developed under the Land Division Act
(P.A. 288 of 1967, as amended), except that nothing in this Article shall be
construed to require a site condominium development to obtain plat approval.
2. Condominium subdivisions are developed in compliance with all applicable
standards of this Ordinance and the Land Division Act (P.A. 288 of 1967, as
amended), except that the review procedures of this Article and Ordinance shall
apply.
Section 13.02 Condominium Unit Requirements.
The following regulations shall apply to all condominium units:
A. Types of Permitted Condominium Units.
The following types of condominium units shall be permitted under this Article, subject to
conformance with the use and zoning district standards of this Ordinance:
1. Single-family detached units. In the case of a condominium project in which
the condominium units are intended for detached single-family residential
purposes (site condominium), not more than one (1) single-family dwelling unit
and permitted accessory structure shall be proposed or constructed on a
condominium lot. No dwelling unit may be located on a condominium lot with any
other approved principal use. The condominium unit shall be considered a lot
under this Ordinance.
2. Attached residential or multiple-family residential units. Condominium
buildings and units created by the construction of multiple or attached residential
units containing individually owned condominium units, or by conversion of
Article 13
Condominium Regulations
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 13 - 2
existing multiple-family or attached units or an existing building into residential
condominium units shall conform with all requirements of this Ordinance and the
applicable zoning district.
3. Non-residential condominium units. A non-residential condominium project
consisting of either new building construction or the conversion of an existing
building into individual condominium units shall conform to all requirements of
this Ordinance for the zoning district.
B. Condominium Unit or Site Condominium Lot.
For purposes of this Article and Ordinance, each detached condominium unit or site
condominium lot shall be considered the equivalent of a platted lot of record as defined
in the Land Division Act (P.A. 288 of 1967, as amended), and shall comply with the
dimensional standards of the zoning district.
C. Area Computation.
The minimum area of the site condominium unit and the surrounding limited common
element shall be equivalent to the minimum lot area and lot width requirements for the
zoning district where the project is located. Areas within a public or private street rightof-
way or equivalent easement or dedication shall not be included in the calculation of
minimum condominium lot area or determination of dwelling density for a site.
D. Relocation of Lot Boundaries.
The relocation of boundaries or any other change in the dimensions of a condominium
unit or site condominium lot shall be considered an amendment to the condominium
documents and condominium site plan. Relocation of condominium lot boundaries, as
permitted in Section 48 of the Condominium Act (P.A. 59 of 1978, as amended), shall
comply with the requirements of Article 4 (Dimensional Standards), and shall be subject
to the review procedures specified in Section 12.01C (Site Plan Review Procedure).
Any property remaining after the formation of a new unit lot by the relocation of an
existing condominium lot boundary, as permitted by Section 49 of the Condominium Act
(P.A. 59 of 1978, as amended), shall comply with the requirements of Article 4
(Dimensional Standards) or shall be placed into common areas within the project.
Section 13.03 Review Requirements.
A condominium project shall be subject to the site plan review procedures specified in Section
12.04 (Site Plan Review Procedure), and the following:
A. Conceptual Review.
To minimize time, costs, and interpretation of City development requirements, applicants
are encouraged to meet informally with the Zoning Administrator and other City officials
to discuss a conceptual condominium site plan, site issues, and application of Ordinance
standards prior to submitting plans for formal review.
Article 13
Condominium Regulations
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 13 - 3
1. Any person may also request that a conceptual condominium site plan be placed
on a regular Planning Commission meeting agenda as a discussion item for
review and comment. The conceptual plan shall include the minimum
information required by Section 13.04A (Conceptual Condominium Plan
Requirements).
2. Comments and suggestions by the City regarding a conceptual plan shall
constitute neither an approval nor a disapproval of the plan, nor shall the City be
bound in any way by such comments or suggestions in preparing for formal
submittal or review of a condominium site plan.

Article 16
Nonconformities
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 16 - 1
ARTICLE 16
NONCONFORMITIES
Section 16.01 Intent.
It is the intent of this Section to provide for the regulation of legally nonconforming structures,
lots of record, sites, and uses; and to specify those circumstances and conditions under which
such nonconformities shall be permitted to continue. It is necessary and consistent with the
regulations prescribed by this Ordinance that those nonconformities that adversely affect orderly
development and the value of nearby property shall not be permitted to continue without
restriction.
The regulations of this Ordinance are designed to protect the public health, safety, and general
welfare by regulating the future use of land through appropriate groupings of compatible and
related uses. The continued existence of nonconformities is inconsistent with the purposes of
which such regulations are established, so the gradual elimination of such nonconformities is
generally desirable.
The regulations of this Article and Ordinance are intended to permit such nonconformities to
continue without specific limitation of time, while restricting extensive further investments that
may make them more permanent. This Article is further established to:
1. Regulate the use and development of nonconforming lots; the completion,
alteration, and reconstruction of nonconforming structures; the redevelopment
and improvement of nonconforming sites; and the maintenance, extension, and
substitution of nonconforming uses.
2. Specify the limited conditions and circumstances under which nonconformities
shall be permitted to continue.
3. Establish standards for determining whether a use is nonconforming and whether
a nonconforming use has ceased to occupy a particular zoning lot.
4. Recognize that certain nonconformities may not have a significant adverse
impact upon nearby properties or the public health, safety, and welfare.
Accordingly, this Article establishes a “preferred class” of nonconforming uses
that distinguishes between nonconforming uses that are not desirable and should
be eliminated, and those that may be perpetuated and improved in a manner that
protects adjacent properties and the character of the district.
Section 16.02 Scope.
Except as otherwise provided in this Article, any nonconforming lot, use, site or structure
lawfully existing on the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment thereto may
be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful. All nonconformities shall be encouraged to
convert to conformity wherever possible and shall be required to convert to conforming status as
required by this Article.
Article 16
Nonconformities
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 16 - 2
Section 16.03 Nonconforming Structures.
Nonconforming structures shall be allowed to continue after the effective date of this Ordinance
or amendments thereto, subject to the following conditions:
A. Expansion Restricted.
A nonconforming structure may be altered in a manner that does not increase or
intensify its nonconformity. Alterations to a nonconforming structure that would increase
or intensify nonconformity shall be prohibited.
B. Normal Repairs and Maintenance.
Normal repair, maintenance or replacement of interior non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring,
plumbing or heating and cooling systems in nonconforming structures may be permitted
in accordance with applicable code requirements, provided that the cost of such
improvements does not exceed one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the state equalized
value of the structure at the time such work is proposed.
1. If a nonconforming structure becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to a lack
of repairs and maintenance or is declared by the Chief Building Official of Sanilac
County to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not
thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
2. This Article shall not prevent work required for compliance with the provisions of
the State Construction Code enforced by the Sanilac County.
C. Buildings under Construction.

cost exceeds the state equalized value of the property, the nonconformity shall be
deemed removed. All subsequent uses shall conform to the use provisions of this
Ordinance.
Section 16.07 Preferred Class Designations.

2. Public hearing. A public hearing shall be held for all requests for a preferred class
nonconforming designation in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section

c. The use does not adversely impact the purpose of the district where it is
located.
d. No useful purpose would be served by the strict application of Ordinance

plan be submitted for review per Section 12.01 (Site Plan Review), which
Article 16
Nonconformities
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 16 - 6
addresses the site improvement priorities listed in Section 16.05 (Nonconforming
Sites).

approval to assure that the use does not become contrary to the purpose of this
Article and Ordinance; or to the public health, safety, and welfare.

occupied by a preferred class nonconforming use is permanently removed or when a
preferred class nonconforming use is replaced by a conforming use. All subsequent
uses shall conform to the use provisions of this Ordinance.
F. Rescinding Approval of a Preferred Class Designation.
Failure of the owner, operator or person having beneficial use of a lot occupied by a
preferred class nonconforming use to maintain or improve the site in accordance with
the provisions of this Section, an approved site plan or any conditions of approval shall
be grounds for the Planning Commission to rescind the preferred class designation.
Such action shall be subject to the following.
1. Public hearing. Such action may be taken only after a public hearing has been
held in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 12.03 (Public Hearing

5. The ZBA may impose additional conditions or limitations upon the proposed use
necessary to satisfy the intent and purposes of this Ordinance, to protect the
health, safety or welfare or to preserve the social and economic well being of
adjacent residents and landowners or the City, as a whole.
Section 18.10 Variances.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the authority to grant variances from specific
requirements of this Ordinance in accordance with the City and Village Zoning Act (Public Act
207 of 1921, as amended) and the provisions of this Article.
The ZBA shall state the grounds upon which it justifies the granting or denying of a variance and
may consider lesser variances than that requested by an applicant. In granting a variance, the
ZBA may impose conditions or limitations as it may deem reasonable in furtherance of the intent
and purposes of this Ordinance.
A. Dimensional Variances.
The granting of a variance from particular area, setback, frontage, height, bulk, density
or other dimensional (non-use) standards of this Ordinance shall require a finding of
practical difficulties. To grant a variance, the ZBA shall determine that request meets
one (1) or more of the following criteria:
1. Practical difficulties. Strict compliance with the specified dimensional
standard(s) will deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
property owners in the same zoning district, create an unnecessary burden on
the applicant or unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a
permitted purpose.
2. Substantial justice. The variance will do substantial justice to the applicant, as
well as to other property owners, and a lesser variance than requested will not
give substantial relief to the applicant or be consistent with justice to other
property owners.
3. Unique circumstances. The need for the variance is due to unique
circumstances peculiar to the land or structures involved, that are not applicable
to other land or structures in the same district.
Article 18
Zoning Board of Appeals
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 18 - 6
4. Preservation of property rights. The variance is necessary for the
preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right also possessed by
other property owners in the same zoning district.
5. Public safety and welfare. The requested variance or appeal can be granted in
such fashion that the spirit of this Ordinance will be observed and public safety
and welfare secured.
6. Not self-created. The problem and resulting need for the variance has not been
self-created by the applicant or the applicant’s predecessors.
7. More than mere inconvenience. The alleged hardship and practical difficulties
that will result from a failure to grant the variance include substantially more than
mere inconvenience, or an inability to attain a higher financial return.
8. Additional considerations. The ZBA shall consider all of the following when
reviewing a variance to ensure that the proposed variance is the minimum
necessary to meet the requirements of the applicant under the Ordinance and
may impose condition upon any variance granted based upon its findings under
this subsection:
a. The granting of a lesser variance will not provide reasonable relief and
substantial justice to the applicant.
b. The granting of a variance will not increase the hazard of fire or otherwise
endanger public safety.
c. The granting of a variance will not unreasonably diminish or impair the
value of surrounding properties.
d. The granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood or surrounding properties.
e. The granting of a variance will not impair the adequate supply of light and
air to any adjacent property.
B. Use Variances.
The granting of a variance from the use provisions of Article 3 (Land Use Table) shall
require a finding of unnecessary hardship, based upon the following criteria:
1. The current zoning ordinance prohibits the property owner from securing
any reasonable economic return or making any reasonable use of the
property. Under this standard, the ZBA shall find that the property (land,
structures and other improvements) is not suitable for uses permitted in the
zoning district.
2. The landowner’s plight is due to unique circumstances peculiar to the
property and not to general neighborhood conditions. Circumstances
common to the larger neighborhood may reflect the unreasonableness of the
Article 18
Zoning Board of Appeals
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 18 - 7
zoning itself, which should be addressed through a rezoning or other legislative
action.
3. The use variance, if granted, would not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood. This standard requires consideration of whether the intent and
purpose of the Ordinance and zoning district will be preserved and the essential
character of the area will be maintained.
4. The hardship is not the result of the applicant’s actions. Under this standard,
the ZBA shall determine that the hardship that led to the use variance request
was not self-created by the applicant. Purchase of a property with a pre-existing
hardship does not constitute a self-created hardship. Financial hardships that
would prevent reasonable use of the property shall be considered, but shall not
be the only determining factor in granting a use variance.
Section 18.11 Temporary Uses.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to grant permits authorizing the following
temporary uses:
A. Application and Submittal Requirements.
The application for a temporary use permit shall be accompanied by plans and
specifications including a plot plan, in triplicate, drawn to scale, showing the following:

3. The anticipated automobile traffic flow to and from the lot and any adjacent
thoroughfares, loss of off-street parking spaces, if any, as well as the anticipated

similar temporary uses shall be restricted to nonresidential zoning districts;

or more in any residential district.

3. Standards for approval. A temporary use permit for a temporary sales event or

b. Provide adequate automobile and pedestrian traffic flow and provide
adequate off-street parking.

regulations for the district in which the temporary special use is to be
located, including all requirements pertaining to lot size, height, setback,
maximum lot coverage, and off-street parking.
C. Temporary Building and Uses in Undeveloped Areas of the City.
The ZBA may permit the location of temporary building and uses for periods not-toexceed

Article 18
Zoning Board of Appeals
City of Sandusky Zoning Ordinance Page 18 - 9
1. The use shall be in harmony with the general character of the area.

is permitted.
3. The granting of the temporary use shall be granted in writing, stipulating all
conditions as to time, nature of development permitted, and arrangements for

4. All setbacks, land coverage, off-street parking, lighting, and other requirements to
be considered in protecting the public health, safety, peace, morals, comfort,
convenience, and general welfare of the inhabitants of the City shall be made at

prior to the taking of any action.
6. In no instance shall a permit be extended when the property surrounding the

D. Temporary Uses That Do Not Require Any Capital Improvement.
The ZBA may permit uses that do not require the erection of any capital improvement of
a structural nature and are not otherwise permitted in any district (such as art fairs,
carnivals, and civic festival events). Such permits may be granted for a period of up to
365 calendar days, subject to the following conditions:
1. In classifying uses as not requiring capital improvement, the ZBA shall determine
