record is not granted immediately, the custodian shall give a detailed explanation of the cause for
further delay and the place and earliest time and date that the record will be available for
inspection. This period for document production may exceed three (3) days for reasonable cause.

statement of the grounds for such denial. Such statement shall cite the specific provision of law
under which access is denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later than the end of the

the place and within the time specified in an agreement in writing providing for the leasing or
renting of such personal property. In addition, any person who has leased or rented personal
property of another, who conceals the property from the owner or who otherwise sells, pawns,
loans, abandons or gives away the leased or rented property is guilty of the offense of failing to
return leased or rented property. The provisions of this Section shall apply to all forms of leasing
and rental agreements including, but not limited to, contracts which provide the consumer options
to buy the leased or rented personal property, lease-purchase agreements and rent-to-own
contracts. For the purpose of determining if a violation of this Section has occurred, leasing
contracts which provide options to buy the merchandise are owned by the owner of the property
until such time as the owner endorses the sale and transfer of ownership of the leased property to
the lessee.
It shall be prima facie evidence of the offense of failing to return leased or rented property when a
person who has leased or rented personal property of another willfully fails to return or make
arrangements acceptable with the lessor to return the personal property to its owner at the
owner's place of business within ten (10) days after proper notice following the expiration of the
lease or rental agreement, except that if the motor vehicle has not been returned within seventytwo
(72) hours after the expiration of the lease or rental agreement, such failure to return the
motor vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of the intent of the offense of failing to return leased or
rented property. Where the leased or rented property is a motor vehicle, if the motor vehicle has
not been returned within seventy-two (72) hours after the expiration of the lease or rental
agreement, the lessor may notify the local law enforcement agency of the failure of the lessee to
return such motor vehicle, and the local law enforcement agency shall cause such motor vehicle
to be put into any appropriate State and local computer system listing stolen motor vehicles. Any
Law Enforcement Officer which stops such a motor vehicle may seize the motor vehicle and notify
the lessor that he/she may recover such motor vehicle after it is photographed and its vehicle
identification number is recorded for evidentiary purposes. Where the leased or rented property is
not a motor vehicle, if such property has not been returned within the ten (10) day period
prescribed in this Subsection, the owner of the property shall report the failure to return the
property to the local law enforcement agency, and such law enforcement agency may within five
(5) days notify the person who leased or rented the property that such person is in violation of this
Section, and that failure to immediately return the property may subject such person to arrest for
the violation.
This Section shall not apply if such personal property is a vehicle and such return is made more
difficult or expensive by a defect in such vehicle which renders such vehicle inoperable if the

registered mail to the lessee at the address given at the time of making the lease or rental
agreement. The notice shall contain a statement that the failure to return the property may subject
the lessee to criminal prosecution.
Any person who has leased or rented personal property of another who destroys such property so
as to avoid returning it to the owner shall be guilty of property damage pursuant to Section
215.300 in addition to being in violation of this Section.
Venue shall lie in the County where the personal property was originally rented or leased.
Note — Under certain circumstances this offense can be a felony under state law.
Section 215.420. Passing Bad Checks.
A person commits the offense of passing a bad check when:
With purpose to defraud, the person makes, issues or passes a check or other similar sight
order or any other form of presentment involving the transmission of account information for
the payment of money knowing that it will not be paid by the drawee or that there is no such
drawee; or
The person makes, issues or passes a check or other similar sight order or any other form of
presentment involving the transmission of account information for the payment of money,
knowing that there are insufficient funds in or on deposit with that account for the payment of
such check, sight order or other form of presentment involving the transmission of account
information in full and all other checks, sight orders or other forms of presentment involving
the transmission of account information upon such funds then outstanding, or that there is no
such account or no drawee and fails to pay the check or sight order or other form of
presentment involving the transmission of account information within ten (10) days after
receiving actual notice in writing that it has not been paid because of insufficient funds or
credit with the drawee or because there is no such drawee.
As used in Subparagraph (2) of Subsection (A) of this Section, "actual notice in writing" means
notice of the non-payment which is actually received by the defendant. Such notice may include
the service of summons or warrant upon the defendant for the initiation of the prosecution of the
check or checks which are the subject matter of the prosecution if the summons or warrant
contains information of the ten (10) day period during which the instrument may be paid and that
payment of the instrument within such ten (10) day period will result in dismissal of the charges.
The requirement of notice shall also be satisfied for written communications which are tendered to
the defendant and which the defendant refuses to accept.
Note — Under certain circumstances this offense can be a felony under state law.

A person commits the offense of abandoning a motor vehicle, vessel or trailer if he/she abandons
any motor vehicle, vessel or trailer on the right-of-way of any public road or State highway or on or
in any of the waters in this State or on the banks of any stream, or on any land or water owned,
operated or leased by the State, any board, department, agency or commission thereof, or any
political subdivision thereof or on any land or water owned, operated or leased by the Federal
Government or on any private real property owned by another without his/her consent.
For purposes of this Section, the last owner of record of a motor vehicle, vessel or trailer found
abandoned and not shown to be transferred pursuant to Sections 301.196 and 301.197, RSMo.,
shall be deemed prima facie to have been the owner of such motor vehicle, vessel or trailer at the
time it was abandoned and to have been the person who abandoned the motor vehicle, vessel or
trailer or caused or procured its abandonment. The registered owner of the abandoned motor
vehicle, vessel or trailer shall not be subject to the penalties provided by this Section if the motor
vehicle, vessel or trailer was in the care, custody or control of another person at the time of the
violation. In such instance, the owner shall submit such evidence in an affidavit permitted by the
court setting forth the name, address and other pertinent information of the person who leased,
rented or otherwise had care, custody or control of the motor vehicle, vessel or trailer at the time
of the alleged violation. The affidavit submitted pursuant to this Subsection shall be admissible in a
court proceeding adjudicating the alleged violation and shall raise a rebuttable presumption that
the person identified in the affidavit was in actual control of the motor vehicle, vessel or trailer. In
such case, the court has the authority to terminate the prosecution of the summons issued to the
owner and issue a summons to the person identified in the affidavit as the operator. If the motor
vehicle, vessel or trailer is alleged to have been stolen, the owner of the motor vehicle, vessel or
trailer shall submit proof that a police report was filed in a timely manner indicating that the vehicle
or vessel was stolen at the time of the alleged violation.
Abandoning a motor vehicle, vessel or trailer is an ordinance violation.
Any person convicted pursuant to this Section shall be civilly liable for all reasonable towing,
storage and administrative costs associated with the abandonment of the motor vehicle, vessel or
trailer. Any reasonable towing, storage and administrative costs in excess of the value of the
abandoned motor vehicle, vessel or trailer that exist at the time the motor vehicle or vessel is
transferred pursuant to Section 304.156, RSMo., shall remain the liability of the person convicted
pursuant to this Section so long as the towing company, as defined in Chapter 304, RSMo.,
provided the title owner and lienholders, as ascertained by the Department of Revenue records, a
notice within the time frame and in the form as described in Subsection (1) of Section 304.156,

completely enclosed within a locked building or locked fenced area and not visible from adjacent public
or private property, nor to any vehicle upon the property of a business licensed as salvage, swap, junk
dealer, towing or storage facility so long as the business is operated in compliance with its business
license and the property is in compliance with applicable zoning ordinances.

information telephone number by which the owner of the abandoned property or property
parked in a restricted or assigned area may call to receive information regarding the
location of such owner's property.

Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right
or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such
signal is exhibited.
Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by
such arrow or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the
same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within
an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.070,

movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.
Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian
control signal as provided in Section 315.070, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian
shall then start to cross the roadway.
Steady red indication.
Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and
shall remain standing until a green indication is shown except as provided in paragraph
(b) of this Subsection.
The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the
intersection in obedience to a red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to make a
right turn but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as
directed by the signal at the intersection, except that the State Highways and
Transportation Commission with reference to an intersection involving a State highway,
and local authorities with reference to an intersection involving other highways under
their jurisdiction, may prohibit any such right turn against a red signal at any intersection
where safety conditions so require, said prohibition shall be effective when a sign is
erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in Section 315.070,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this Section shall be applicable except as to those provisions
which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any
such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

center lane except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway ahead is
clearly visible and such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or in preparation
for a left turn, or where such center lane is at the time allocated exclusively to traffic moving in
the direction the vehicle is proceeding and is signposted to give notice of such allocation.
Upon all highways any vehicle proceeding at less than the normal speed of traffic thereon

Section 340.180. No Passing Zones.
[R.O. 2010 §340.260; CC 1970 §16-66; Ord. No. 1333 §§1 — 5, 3-30-1964; Ord. No. 09-00 §1, 12-4-
2000]
The Chief of Police is hereby authorized and directed to determine those portions of any highway,
road or street, where overtaking and passing, or driving a vehicle to the left of the roadway would
be especially hazardous and shall declare the same as a "no passing zone"; provided that no "no
passing zones" shall be established on a roadway having a speed limit of thirty (30) miles per hour
where the minimum "no passing zone" would be less than ninety (90) feet. "No passing zones"
shall be established on such roadway where the minimum sight distance is less than five hundred
(500) feet.
The section of roadway involved shall be held a "no passing zone" and the Department of Streets
of the City, under the direction of the Chief of Police, shall immediately mark the "no passing zone"
by painting a solid yellow line on the roadway surface just to the right of the centerline of the
roadway. Thereafter, the Street Department, under the direction of the Chief of Police, shall, by
appropriate signs, indicate the beginning and end of the "no passing zone". When the aforesaid
yellow painted line and signs are in place so as to be clearly visible, it shall be unlawful for a
vehicle to cross the solid yellow lines and pass another vehicle in any "no passing zone". A
violation of this Section shall be a misdemeanor.
The Chief of Police shall keep a record of all such "no passing zones" and the approximate
locations thereof and such records shall be public records and subject to public inspection.
In any prosecution for the violation of such "no passing zones," proof that the roadway was
marked with a solid yellow line and signs posted at the beginning and end of such zones as herein
provided, shall constitute a prima facie presumption that such "no passing zone" was properly and
lawfully marked and designated as herein provided.
Section 340.190. Hand and Mechanical Signals.
No person shall stop or suddenly decrease the speed of or turn a vehicle from a direct course or
move right or left upon a roadway unless and until such movement can be made with reasonable
safety and then only after the giving of an appropriate signal in the manner provided herein.
An operator or driver when stopping, or when checking the speed of the operator's vehicle if
the movement of other vehicles may reasonably be affected by such checking of speed, shall
extend such operator's arm at an angle below horizontal so that the same may be seen in the
rear of the vehicle.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the right shall extend such operator's arm
at an angle above horizontal so that the same may be seen in front of and in the rear of the
vehicle and shall slow down and approach the intersecting highway as near as practicable to
the right side of the highway along which such operator is proceeding before turning.
An operator or driver intending to turn the vehicle to the left shall extend such operator's arm
in a horizontal position so that the same may be seen in the rear of the vehicle and shall slow
down and approach the intersecting highway so that the left side of the vehicle shall be as
near as practicable to the centerline of the highway along which the operator is proceeding
before turning.
The signals herein required shall be given either by means of the hand and arm or by a signal
light or signal device in good mechanical condition of a type approved by the State Highway
Patrol; however, when a vehicle is so constructed or loaded that a hand and arm signal would
not be visible both to the front and rear of such vehicle, then such signals shall be given by
3/5/2020 City of Glendale, MO Ecode360

such light or device. A vehicle shall be considered as so constructed or loaded that a hand
and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear when the distance from the
center of the top of the steering post to the left outside limit of the body, cab or load exceeds
twenty-four (24) inches, or when the distance from the center of the top of the steering post to
the rear limit of the body or load thereon exceeds fourteen (14) feet, which limit of fourteen
(14) feet shall apply to single vehicles or combinations of vehicles. The provisions of this
Subsection shall not apply to any trailer which does not interfere with a clear view of the hand
signals of the operator or of the signaling device upon the vehicle pulling such trailer; provided
further, that the provisions of this Section as far as mechanical devices on vehicles so
constructed that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear of such
vehicle as above provided shall only be applicable to new vehicles registered within this State
after the first (1st) day of January, 1954.
Section 340.200. Stopping for School Bus.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway upon meeting or overtaking from either direction any
school bus which has stopped on the highway for the purpose of receiving or discharging any
school children and whose driver has in the manner prescribed by law given the signal to stop
shall stop the vehicle before reaching such school bus and shall not proceed until such school bus
resumes motion or until signaled by its driver to proceed.
Every bus used for the transportation of school children shall bear upon the front and rear thereon
a plainly visible sign containing the words "School Bus" in letters not less than eight (8) inches in
height. Each bus shall have lettered on the rear in plain and distinct type the following: "State Law:
Stop While Bus is Loading and Unloading". Each school bus subject to the provisions of Sections
304.050 to 304.070, RSMo., shall be equipped with a mechanical and electrical signaling device
approved by the State Board of Education which will display a signal plainly visible from the front
and rear and indicating intention to stop.
Every school bus operated to transport students in the public school system which has a gross
vehicle weight rating of more than ten thousand (10,000) pounds, which has the engine mounted
entirely in front of the windshield and the entrance door behind the front wheels, and which is used
for the transportation of school children shall be equipped with a crossing control arm. The
crossing control arm, when activated, shall extend a minimum of five (5) feet six (6) inches from
the face of the front bumper. The crossing control arm shall be attached on the right side of the
front bumper and shall be activated by the same controls which activate the mechanical and
electrical signaling devices described in Subsection (B) of this Section. This Subsection may be
cited as "Jessica's Law" in commemoration of Jessica Leicht and all other Missouri school children
who have been injured or killed during the operation of a school bus.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the driver of a school bus in the process of loading
or unloading students upon a street or highway shall activate the mechanical and electrical
signaling devices, in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to communicate to
drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or unloading. A public school district has the
authority pursuant to Section 304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy which provides that the driver of a
school bus in the process of loading or unloading students upon a divided highway of four (4) or
more lanes may pull off of the main roadway and load or unload students without activating the
mechanical and electrical signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for other drivers to
stop and may use the amber signaling devices to alert motorists that the school bus is slowing to a
stop; provided that the passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner which indicates that drivers
should proceed with caution and, in such case, the driver of a vehicle may proceed past the
school bus with due caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or discharge passengers at
any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes of traffic, whether or not divided
by a median or barrier, in such manner as to require the passengers to cross more than two (2)
lanes of traffic; nor shall any passengers be taken on or discharged while the vehicle is upon the

road or highway proper unless the vehicle so stopped is plainly visible for at least five hundred
(500) feet in each direction to drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder
and a speed limit greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three hundred (300) feet in
each direction to drivers of other vehicles upon other highways, and on all highways, only for such
time as is actually necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need not stop upon meeting or
overtaking a school bus which is on a different roadway, which is proceeding in the opposite
direction on a highway containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or which is stopped in a loading
zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or controlled access highway at a point where
pedestrians are not permitted to cross the roadway.
Section 340.210. Right-of-Way at Intersection — Signs at
Intersections.
The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall yield the right-of-way to a vehicle which
has entered the intersection from a different highway, provided however, there is no form of traffic
control at such intersection.
When two (2) vehicles enter an intersection from different highways at approximately the same
time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the driver of the vehicle on
the right. This Subsection shall not apply to vehicles approaching each other from opposite
directions when the driver of one (1) of such vehicles is attempting to or is making a left turn.
The driver of a vehicle within an intersection intending to turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way
to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is within the intersection or so close
thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard.
The driver of a vehicle intending to make a left turn into an alley, private road or driveway shall
yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction when the making of
such left turn would create a traffic hazard.
The City may, on any section of road where construction or major maintenance operations are
being effected, fix a speed limit in such areas by posting of appropriate signs, and the operation of
a motor vehicle in excess of such speed limit in the area so posted shall be deemed prima facie
evidence of careless and imprudent driving and a violation of Section 340.160.
State Law Reference — This section has additional penalties based on certain circumstances,
§304.351, RSMo.
Section 340.220. Distance at Which Vehicle Must Follow.
The driver of a vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonably safe and
prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicle and the traffic upon and the condition of the
roadway. Vehicles being driven upon any roadway outside of a business or residence district in a
caravan or motorcade, whether or not towing other vehicles, shall be so operated, except in a funeral
procession or in a duly authorized parade, so as to allow sufficient space between each such vehicle
or combination of vehicles as to enable any other vehicle to overtake or pass such vehicles in safety.
This Section shall in no manner affect Section 304.044, RSMo., relating to distance between trucks
traveling on the highway.

operate the vehicle, or authorize any other person to operate the vehicle registered, or maintain
registration of a motor vehicle, or permit another person to operate such vehicle upon the streets
or the alleys of this City unless the owner maintains the financial responsibility as required in this
Section which conforms to the requirements of the laws of this State. No non-resident shall
operate or permit another person to operate in this State a motor vehicle registered to such nonresident
unless the non-resident maintains the financial responsibility which conforms to the
requirements of the laws of the non-resident's State of residence. Furthermore, no person shall
operate a motor vehicle owned by another with the knowledge that the owner has not maintained
financial responsibility unless such person has financial responsibility which covers the person's
operation of the other's vehicle. However, no owner or non-resident shall be in violation of this
Subsection if he/she fails to maintain financial responsibility on a motor vehicle which is inoperable
or being stored and not in operation.
For purposes of this Section, the term "financial responsibility" shall mean the ability to respond in
damages for liability on account of accidents occurring after the effective date of proof of said

commercial vehicle inspector who lawfully stops such operator or investigates an accident while
that officer or inspector is engaged in the performance of the officer's or inspector's duties.

the time the Peace Officer wrote the citation.

shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more

Penalty — Confiscation of False Evidence.
No person shall display evidence of insurance to a Law Enforcement Officer knowing there is no valid
liability insurance in effect on the motor vehicle as required pursuant to this Article or knowing the
evidence of insurance is illegally altered, counterfeit or otherwise invalid as evidence of insurance. If
the Law Enforcement Officer issues a citation to a motor vehicle operator for displaying invalid
evidence of insurance, the officer shall confiscate the evidence for presentation in court. Any person
convicted of violating this Section is guilty of an ordinance violation.
Section 380.160. Alteration, Production or Sale of Invalid
Insurance Card.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (A)(3) and Subsection (B)(2) and Subsection (D) of
Section 400.190, in any City block where more than fifty percent (50%) of the lots on the same

Chapter, a lot of record which does not comply with the area requirements for the Class "R-2"
Single-Family Dwelling District regulations, shall be brought into compliance with the minimum
area requirements and width requirements for this zone if the owner of such lot shall at any time,
after April 24, 1963, also own:
An adjoining lot or other unplatted or unsubdivided property sufficiently large in area that if
combined with the non-conforming lot it would bring the non-conforming lot into conformance
and compliance with the requirements in this zone, even though such combining of such
property would result in fewer buildable lots.
A lot with an improvement or building on it, whether a lot of record or an unsubdivided
property adjacent to the non-conforming lot of record, which, if transferred to, combined with
and made a part of the lot of record would bring the lot of record into compliance and would
not render the lot or property containing the improvements and remaining after such transfer a
non-conforming lot.
Before any building permit shall issue or before any such property or any portion of it may be sold
or transferred, the owner of such non-conforming lot shall bring it into compliance. Any owner of
property from and after April 24, 1963, who shall own a non-conforming lot and adjacent property
to it that would enable him/her to bring it into compliance in accordance with the terms of this
Section and who transfers any portion of such property so as to make it impossible for him/her to
comply with the provisions of this Section, shall not nor shall any successor in title thereto be
granted a building permit to use the remaining portion of the lot or to use the lot of record

Section 400.815. Telecommunications Towers.
[R.O. 2010 §400.815; Ord. No. 14-97 §1, 12-1-1997; Ord. No. 01-02 §1, 1-21-2002]
Purposes. The general purpose of this Section is to regulate the placement, construction and
modification of telecommunications towers, support structures, and antennae in order to protect
the health, safety and welfare of the public, while at the same time not unreasonably interfering
with the development of the competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in Glendale.
Specifically, this Section is intended to:
Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities and
systems to serve the citizens and businesses of the City of Glendale;
Minimize adverse visual impacts of communications antennae and support structure through
careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
Maximize the use of existing and new support structures so as to minimize the need to
construct new or additional facilities;
Maximize the co-location of facilities on any new support structures;
Ensure that any new telecommunications tower or structure is located in an area compatible
with the neighborhood or surrounding community to the extent possible; and
Ensure that regulation of telecommunications towers and structures does not have the effect
of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and does not unreasonably
discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service.
The Legislative Findings.
On February 8, 1996, Congress enacted the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 P.L.
No. 104-104. The purpose of the Act included deregulation of the telecommunications
industry and providing a more competitive environment for wired and wireless
telecommunication services in the United States.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 preserves the authority of the City to regulate the
placement, construction, and modification of towers and antenna support structures and to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.
The City has been granted the authority to enact legislation to regulate the construction,
placement, and operation of telecommunications towers and antennae pursuant to its zoning
powers established in Chapter 89, RSMo., and additionally pursuant to its general and
specific Police powers established by Statute authorizing the regulations herein to protect the
public health, safety and welfare.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has exclusive jurisdiction over:
The regulation of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions from
telecommunications facilities; and
The regulation of radio signal interference among users of the radio frequency spectrum.
Consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the regulations of this Section will not
have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and do not
unreasonably discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service. The

C.
regulations also impose reasonable restrictions to protect public safety and welfare and
ensure opportunities for placement of antennae with prompt approval by the City. This Section
does not attempt to regulate in areas within the exclusive jurisdiction of the FCC.
The uncontrolled proliferation of towers in the City of Glendale is threatened without adoption
of new regulations, and would diminish property values, the aesthetic quality of the City, and
would otherwise threaten the health, safety and welfare of the public.
Definitions. As used in this Section, the following terms shall have the meanings and usages
indicated:
AGL
Above ground level. Ground level shall be determined by the average elevation of the natural
ground level within a radius of fifty (50) feet from the center location of measurement.
ANTENNA
Any device that transmits and/or receives radio waves for voice, data or video
communications purposes including, but not limited to, television, AM/FM radio, microwave,
cellular telephone and similar forms of communications. The term shall exclude satellite earth
station antennae less than two (2) meters in diameter (mounted within twelve (12) feet of the
ground or building-mounted) and any receive-only home television antennae.
CABINET
A structure for the protection and security of communications equipment associated with one
(1) or more antennae where direct access to equipment is provided from the exterior and that
has a horizontal dimension that does not exceed four (4) feet by six (6) feet, and vertical
height that does not exceed six (6) feet.
CITY ADMINISTRATOR
The City Administrator of the City of Glendale or his/her designee.
COMMUNICATION TOWER MULTI-USE INTEREST AREA
An area as designated by the plan entitled Southwest (St. Louis) County Consortium Master
Plan indicating locations in which more than one (1) wireless service provider may potentially
seek to locate an antenna facility in which the construction of co-locatable towers will be
required. The map may be periodically revised in response to new information received
regarding tower sites sought by wireless providers. A "multi-use interest area" shall be
designated as appropriate for towers within one (1) mile of each other, unless the applicant
demonstrates to the contrary.
DISGUISED SUPPORT STRUCTURE
Any freestanding, manmade structure designed for the support of antennae, the presence of
which is camouflaged or concealed as an appropriately-placed architectural or natural feature.
Depending on the location and type of disguise used, such concealment may require
placement underground of the utilities leading to the structure. Such structures may include
but are not limited to clock towers, campaniles, observation towers, water towers, light
standards, flag poles and artificial trees.

the issuance of a building permit.
Regulatory compliance. All antennae and support structures shall meet or exceed current
standards and regulations of the FAA, FCC and any other State or Federal agency with the
authority to regulate communications antennae and support structures. Should such
standards or regulations be amended, then the owner shall bring such devices and structure
into compliance with the revised standards or regulations within the time period mandated by
the controlling agency. No approval for any placement, construction, or modification of any
antenna or structure permitted by this Section shall be granted for any applicant having an
incurred violation of this Section or any other governmental regulatory requirement related to
such antennae or structures within the City.
Security. All antennae and support structures shall be protected from unauthorized access by
appropriate security measures. A description of proposed security measure shall be included
as part of any application to install, build or modify antennae or support structures. Additional
measures may be required as a condition of the issuance of a building permit or
administrative permit as deemed necessary by the City Administrator or by the Board of
Aldermen in the case of a conditional use permit.
Lighting. Antennae and support structures shall not be lighted unless required by the FAA or
other State or Federal agency with authority to regulate, in which case a description of the

Advertising. Unless a disguised antenna support structure in the form of an otherwise lawfully
permitted pole sign, the placement of advertising on structures regulated by this Section is
prohibited.
Design.
Towers shall maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to the requirements of the FAA
or any applicable State or Federal agency, be painted a neutral color consistent with the
natural or built environment of the site.
Equipment shelters or cabinets shall have an exterior finish compatible with the natural or
built environment of the site and shall also comply with any design guidelines as may be
applicable to the particular zoning district in which the facility is located.
Towers shall not exceed the height limitation of any airport overlay zone as may be
adopted by the City.
Antennae attached to a building or disguised antenna support structure shall be of a color
identical to or closely compatible with the surface to which they are mounted.
All towers shall be surrounded by a minimum six (6) foot high decorative wall constructed
of brick, stone or comparable masonry materials and landscape strip of not less than ten
(10) feet in width and plated with materials which will provide a visual barrier to a
minimum height of six (6) feet. The landscape strip shall be exterior to any security wall.
In lieu of the required wall and landscape strip, an alternative means of screening may be
approved by the City Administrator in the case of a permitted use or use permitted by
administrative permit, or by the Board of Aldermen in the case of a conditional use
permit, upon demonstration by the applicant that an equivalent degree of visual
screening will be achieved.
All towers shall be separated from any off-site single- or two-family residential structure a
distance equal to the height of the tower. Towers on parcels adjacent to residentially
zoned property shall meet the set backs of the applicable zoning district as are required
for a principal structure along the adjoining property line(s). Where adjacent to nonresidentially
zoned property, towers shall maintain set backs as are required for
accessory structures.
Ground anchors of all guyed towers, if permitted, shall be located on the same parcel as
the tower and meet the set backs of the applicable zoning district.
Vehicle or outdoor storage on any tower site is prohibited, unless otherwise permitted by
the zoning.
On-site parking for periodic maintenance and service shall be provided at all antenna or
tower locations consistent with the underlying zoning district.
Shared use.
Prior to the issuance of any permit to alter or modify any tower existing on January 5,
1998, the owners shall provide to the City a written and notarized agreement committing
to make said tower available for use by other subject to reasonable technical limitations
and reasonable financial terms. The willful and knowing failure of a tower owner to agree
to a shared use or to negotiate in good faith with potential users shall be unlawful and
shall, among other remedies of the City, be cause for the withholding of future permits to
the same owner to install, build or modify antennae or towers within the City.
Prior to the issuance of any permit to install, build or modify any tower, the tower owner
shall furnish the City Administrator an inventory of all that owner's towers in or within one3/

half (½) mile of the City limits of Glendale. The inventory shall include the tower's
reference name or number, the street location, latitude and longitude, structure type,
height, type and mounting height of existing antennas and an assessment of available
ground space for the placement of additional equipment shelters.
Any new tower approved at a height of sixty (60) feet AGL (above ground level) or higher
shall be designed and constructed to accommodate at least one (1) additional user
unless a larger number is indicated by the response to the notification provisions herein.
A written agreement committing to shared use as required by Subparagraph (a) shall be
submitted by the tower applicant. The willful and knowing failure of the owner of a tower
built for shared use to negotiate in good faith with potential users shall be unlawful and
shall, among other remedies of the City be cause for the withholding of future permits to
the same owner to install, build or modify antennae or towers within the City.
Any new tower approved within a communication tower multi-use interest area as
designated by the map of the same title, shall be designed and constructed to
accommodate the number of users indicated by the plan to the extent feasible. The willful
and knowing failure of the owner of a tower built for shared use to negotiate in good faith
with potential users shall be cause for the withholding of future permits to the same
owner to install, build or modify antennae or towers within the City.
Prior to any application for the construction of a new tower or disguised support structure,
a copy of the application or a summary containing the height, design, location and type of
frequency of antennae shall be delivered by certified mail to all known potential tower
users as identified by a schedule maintained by the City Administrator. Proof of such
delivery shall be submitted with the application to the City. The City Administrator may
establish a form required to be used for such notifications. Upon request, the City
Administrator shall place on a list the name and address of any user of towers or
prospective user to receive notification of applications. The City Administrator shall,
before deciding on the application or forwarding it to the Board of Aldermen for
consideration, allow all persons receiving notice at least ten (10) business days to
respond to the City and the applicant that the party receiving notice be permitted to share
the proposed tower or locate within one (1) mile of such area. Where two (2) or more
parties seek to locate within one (1) mile of each other, or such other distance as is
demonstrated to the Director to be reasonable, the Director shall designate such area as
a multi-use interest area on the map. The failure of the receiving party to use this process
or respond to any such notice shall be considered cause for denying requests by such
party for new towers or structures.
Any party seeking shared use of a tower subject to this provision shall after responding to
notice of an application, negotiate with the applicant for such use. The applicant may on
a legitimate and reasonable business basis choose between multiple requests for shared
use on the same tower or structure, and may reject any request where legitimate
technical obstacles cannot be reasonably overcome or where the party requesting
shared use will not agree to reasonable financial terms. Any party believing that the
applicant has breached its duty to negotiate in good faith for shared use shall
immediately notify the applicant and the City Administrator in writing. The City
Administrator may reject the application upon a finding that shared use has been
improperly denied. A notice of breach of duty shall explain the precise basis for the claim
and shall be accompanied by payment of an administrative review fee of five hundred
dollars ($500.00) to the City to offset the cost of review. After the applicant's receipt of the
notice, the applicant shall have ten (10) calendar days to provide a written submission to
the City Administrator responding to the alleged violation of the shared use requirement.
If deemed necessary by the City Administrator, he/she may engage, at the cost of the
party alleging the violation, a neutral, qualified technical consultant to provide an opinion
on feasibility or costs of the shared use request. If the City Administrator receives a
notice alleging a violation of the shared use requirement, the time for a decision on an

requiring the enlargement of the existing tower compound area as long as all other
requirements of this Section and the underlying zoning district are met.
The one (1) time replacement of any tower existing on January 5, 1998, or subsequently
approved in accordance with these regulations so long as the purpose of the
replacement is to accommodate shared use of the site or to eliminate a safety hazard.
The new tower shall be of the same type as the original except that a guyed or selfsupporting
(lattice) tower may be replaced by a monopole. If the guyed or lattice tower to
be replaced is one hundred eighty (180) feet or less in height, it shall only be replaced
with a monopole. The height of the new tower may exceed that of the original by not
more than twenty (20) feet. Subsequent replacements shall require the approval of the
conditional use permit.
The construction of a disguised support structure provided that all related equipment
shall be placed underground or concealed within the structure when the structure is
located in any district other than a district authorizing industrial uses. Equipment may be
placed in a cabinet if the disguised support structure is incidental to an industrial,
commercial, institutional or other non-residential use.
The placement of dual polar panel antennas on wooden or steel utility poles not to
exceed forty (40) feet in height provided that all related equipment is contained in a
cabinet.

structure not permitted by Subsections (E) or (F) above, shall require the approval of a conditional
use permit following a duly advertised public hearing.
Applications for conditional use permits. Applications shall be filed and processed subject to
and in the manner and time frame as established in Section 400.810 of the Zoning Code. A
decision by the Board of Aldermen shall be made only after a public hearing has been held
and the applicant has been referred to the City Plan Commission for their reports and
recommendations.
Additional minimum requirements. No conditional use permit shall be issued unless the
applicant has clearly demonstrated by substantive evidence that placement of an antenna or
support structure pursuant to Subsection (E) "Permitted Uses" or Subsection (F)
"Administrative Permits" of this Section is not technologically or economically feasible. The
Board of Aldermen may consider current or emerging industry standards and practices,
among other information, in determining feasibility.
Findings required. In addition to the determinations or limitations specified herein and by
Section 400.810 for the consideration of conditional use permits, the Board of Aldermen shall
also base its decision upon, and shall make findings as to, the existence of the following
conditions:
The proposed tower is not and cannot be located within a communications tower multiuse
interest area as designated by such map, or if so located, meets the co-locations
requirements of this Section.
No existing towers, structures or buildings within the necessary geographic area for the
applicant's tower meet the applicant's necessary engineering requirements considering:

Feasibility of redesigning the applicant's tower network, or
Other limiting conditions that render existing towers, structures or buildings within the
applicant's required geographic area unsuitable.
The design of the tower or structure, including the antennae, shelter and ground layout
maximally reduces visual degradation and otherwise complies with the provisions and
intent of this Section. New towers shall be of a monopole design, unless it is shown that
an alternative design would equally or better satisfy this provision.
The proposal minimizes the number and/or size of towers or structures that will be
required in the area.
The applicant has not previously failed to take advantage of reasonably available shared
use opportunities or procedures provided by this Section or otherwise.
No land owned by any agency of the Federal or State Government, or by any political
subdivision of the State, is available for locating the structure or tower.
If any one (1), but not more than one (1), of the first (1st) six (6)
determinations is not satisfied, approval may be granted only on a finding of
unique circumstances otherwise necessitating approval to satisfy the
purposes of this Section.
Additional limitations.
No tower shall be approved at a height exceeding one hundred fifty (150) feet AGL
unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that such height is required for the proper
function of the applicant's system or that of a public safety communications system of a
governmental entity sharing the tower. Such showing must also be supported by the
opinion of a telecommunications consultant hired by the City at the expense of the
applicant. The opinion of the consultant shall include a statement that no available
alternatives exists to exceeding the height limit or the reason why such alternatives are
not viable.
If the City has by order agreed to participate in a multi-municipality commission to
coordinate new tower or structure applications, an application made pursuant to this
Section shall also be submitted to such commission simultaneous with the filing of the
request with the City. The Plan Commission may consider any comments from such
Commission, but shall not allow a delay in receiving such comments to significantly delay
a decision on the conditional use permit.
Obsolete Non-Complying Tower Structures. Any upper portion of a tower which is not occupied by
active antennae for a period of twelve (12) months, and any entire tower which is not so occupied
for a period of six (6) months, shall be removed at the owner's expense. Removal of upper
portions of a tower manufactured as a signal unit shall not be required. Failure to comply with this
provision shall constitute a nuisance that may be remedied by the City at the tower or property
owner's expense. Any application for a new tower or disguised structure not built as disguised part
of another existing or permitted structure shall place a bond or other security with the City prior to
any final approval for the purpose of removing any tower or disguised structure as required herein

for a governmental entity to operate or construct a tower or structure, it shall be unlawful for any
person to erect or operate for any private commercial purpose any new antenna, tower or

application as in the case of other building permits, considering in addition the question of public
safety on the location of the sign and danger to traffic. All other departments of the City that may
be involved in any questions concerning the sign shall also pass upon such application before it is
issued.
Before issuing such permit the City shall require that the trustees furnish a policy of liability
insurance with the City as one named insured with the policy liability limits of one hundred

appearance point of view and also from a safety point of view; will further agree that the policy of
insurance in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) for each person and three
hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) for each accident shall be maintained in full force and

furnish a liability policy or renewal of it, or fail to keep the sign in good repair and maintenance and
the City shall give them notice of such default and the trustees shall fail to correct such default
within fifteen (15) days, that the City shall then have the right to remove the sign and structure at
the subdivision's expense. In the event that any portion of this sign is on private property the
contract shall further provide that there shall be an agreement from the private property owner
duly acknowledged and recorded authorizing and agreeing to the right of the City to remove the
sign in the event of such breach by the trustees. The contract shall further provide that the City
assumes no responsibility for maintenance of the sign, for failure of the trustees to keep it in good
repair and further that in the event that the City shall at any time desire to make a use of the
easement on which the sign is placed that shall require removal of the sign that the City shall
notify the trustees to remove the sign and in the event that the trustees shall fail within a period of
fifteen (15) days, that the City shall have a right to remove the sign at the subdivision's expense
and in the event it is necessary for the City to expend any money in connection with the sign that
the trustees will be obligated to reimburse the City for such expenditures and if the trustees do not
make some such reimbursement within thirty (30) days after date of billing that the City may
enforce this liability in a court of law and may recover in addition to its regular expense the court
costs and reasonable attorney's fees.
In the event that any private subdivision should make a request for such sign which does not have
a Board of Trustees such request shall be denied until such time as a restrictive indenture is filed

Chapter 415. Flood Hazard Prevention
Article I. Findings of Fact, Purpose and Objectives
Section 415.010. Findings of Fact.
The flood hazard areas of the City of Glendale are subject to periodic inundation which results in
loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
These flood looses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in flood plains causing
increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses
vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Section 415.020. Statement of Purpose.
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed:
To protect human life and health;
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in flood plains;

To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone
areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas;
To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area; and
To insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for
their actions.
Section 415.030. Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this Chapter includes methods and provisions for:
Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to
water or erosion or to flood heights or velocities.
Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective
barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters.
Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other developments which may increase erosion or
flood damage.
Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
floodway waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.
Article II. Definitions

building permit was issued, provided that the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first (1st) placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of
piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of
a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation,
such as clearing, grading and filling; the installation of streets and/or walkways; excavation for a
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds, not occupied as dwelling units or part
of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual "start of construction" means the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

set out in Section 500.010 of this Code.
Section 415.140. Variance Procedures.
The Board of Adjustments as established by the City of Glendale shall hear and decide appeals
and requests for variances from the requirements of this Chapter.
The Board of Adjustments shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in
any requirements, decision, or determination made by the Code Enforcement Officer in the
enforcement or administration of this Chapter.
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustments or any taxpayer may appeal
such decision to the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, as provided in Chapter 536,
RSMo.
In passing upon such applications, the Board of Adjustments shall consider all technical
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other Sections of this Chapter, and:
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
The susceptibility of proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such
damage on the individual owner;
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the
proposed use;
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain management
program for that area;
The safety of access to the property use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain
management program for that area;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood
waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and
water systems, and streets and bridges.
Conditions For Variances.
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided in Subsections (2 — 6)
below, have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (½) acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to
the applicant; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given a written notice that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced
lowest floor elevation.
Article V. Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction
Section 415.150. General Standards.
In all areas of special flood hazards (Zones A, AE, A1-30, AO, AH) the following provisions are

entity other than the grantee where necessary to prevent evasion or avoidance of the obligations
under this Code or a franchise to pay the applicable cable franchise fees. Revenues which are not
directly attributable to specific cable subscribers including, but not limited to, leased access fees,
advertising revenues and home shopping commissions shall be allocated among the franchising
jurisdictions served by the grantee's cable system on a per subscriber or other equitable basis
measured in a consistent manner from period to period. "Gross revenues" shall not include:
To the extent consistent with GAAP, bad debt; provided however, that all or part of any such

The grantor specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional agreements or other
rights to use the rights-of-way for any purpose and to any other person, including itself, as it deems
appropriate, subject to all applicable law.

[R.O. 2010 §461.130; Ord. No. B2-01 §2.3, 2-19-2001]
Agreements shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the rights-of-way and shall give only the right to
occupy rights-of-way for the purposes and for the period stated in this Code and as may be further
limited by the agreement. No agreement shall grant the right to use facilities owned or controlled by the
City or a third (3rd) party without the consent of such party, nor shall it excuse licensee from obtaining
appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating on the facilities controlled or owned
by the City or a third (3rd) party. All agreements shall be deemed to incorporate and be limited by the
provisions of this Code and shall create rights solely applicable to licensee.

negotiation and administration of any application filed under this Code. On request of the City, the
applicant shall provide such additional information that is deemed necessary or appropriate to the City
in reviewing the application and proposed use of the rights-of-way. Licensee shall be responsible for
payment of any reasonable costs incurred by City in processing these applications or in adapting or
executing the agreement for use by licensee to the extent such costs exceed the application fees paid.
The City may provide for the waiver of these application fees and/or of use fees for use of the rights-ofway
by other governmental entities where such waiver is deemed by the City to be lawful and in the
public interest. The information provided by licensee shall be certified as true and correct and licensee
shall be responsible to certify to the City any material changes to the information provided in such
completed application during the term of any agreement.
Section 461.150. Standard for Approval or Renewal of
Agreements.
[R.O. 2010 §461.150; Ord. No. B2-01 §2.5, 2-19-2001]
The City shall authorize agreements or renewals to any eligible licensee for the right and privilege to
construct, operate and maintain facilities in, through and along the City's rights-of-way for the purposes
of supplying communications services on a non-exclusive basis within the City subject, however, to the
standards, terms and conditions herein set forth within this Code, which shall be deemed incorporated
therein and any special conditions as may be provided for in the agreement. All licensees shall be
required to obtain and maintain any necessary and lawful permit, license certification, grant,
registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity including, but
not limited to, the City, the FCC or the Missouri Public Service Commission. In reviewing an
application, the City may consider prior conduct of the licensee in performance of its obligations or
compliance with the City's ordinances in the past or the existence of any outstanding violations or
deficiencies. The City may deny or condition any agreement where the proposed use would interfere
with the public use of the rights-of-way or otherwise conflict with the legitimate public interests of the
City or as otherwise provided by law. The City may establish standard agreements setting forth the
minimum requirements for all licensees. Applications for agreements may be approved, denied or
approved with conditions consistent with applicable requirements of the Telecommunications Act or
other applicable requirements as may be necessary to fulfill the requirements and objectives of this
Code.
Section 461.160. Cable Service and Open Video Systems (OVS)
— Separate Franchise or Agreement Required.
[R.O. 2010 §461.160; Ord. No. B2-01 §2.6, 2-19-2001]
An agreement for communications service shall not provide licensee the right to provide cable service
as a cable operator (as defined by 47 U.S.C. Section 522(5)) within the City. Upon licensee's request
for a franchise to provide cable service as a cable operator (as defined by 47 U.S.C. Section 522(5))
within the City, the City shall timely negotiate such cable television services franchise in good faith with
licensee. A communications services agreement shall also not permit licensee to operate an open
video system, except where otherwise expressly provided in the agreement or by separate agreement,
and licensee remits the maximum fees permitted by 47 U.S.C. Section 573(c)(2)(B) and where
licensee otherwise complies with FCC regulations promulgated pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 573.
Absent such applicable agreement from the City, licensee shall be prohibited from offering OVS
service and any such service shall be considered a breach of the agreement. Unless otherwise
specified, any such new agreement or amendment to an agreement shall obligate licensee to pay a
use fee of five percent (5%) on all gross revenues directly or indirectly attributable to the provision of
OVS service within the City. The City may, at its option, negotiate with licensee to exchange all or a
part of the use fees for capacity or facilities used for City or other public purposes. Any such exchange
shall be negotiated based on the licensee's cost of providing capacity or facilities to the City and shall
be credited towards the calculation of applicable use fees.

Section 461.170. Use of Rights-of-Way — Police Powers —
Licensee's Use Subordinate.
[R.O. 2010 §461.170; Ord. No. B2-01 §2.7, 2-19-2001]
The licensee shall construct and maintain its facilities in accordance with all applicable Federal, State
and local laws, including all permit requirements and fee payments, and all other City Codes and
ordinances in effect as of the date of an agreement or hereinafter adopted to the extent not in
contravention of State or Federal law. The grant of an agreement does not in any way impact the
continuing authority of the City through the proper exercise of its home rule or statutory powers to
adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public. The
City makes no express or implied representation or warranty regarding its rights to authorize the
installation or construction of facilities on any particular segment of rights-of-way. The burden and
responsibility for making all such determinations in advance of construction or installation shall be
entirely upon the licensee. The use of the rights-of-way authorized by any agreement shall in all
matters be subordinate to the City's use and rights therein.
Section 461.180. Term.
[R.O. 2010 §461.180; Ord. No. B2-01 §2.8, 2-19-2001]

reasonably determines that a shorter term is warranted under the circumstances.
Section 461.190. Use Fees.
[R.O. 2010 §461.190; Ord. No. B2-01 §2.9, 2-19-2001]
Licensee shall pay to the City as monthly compensation for the use of the rights-of-way pursuant
to an executed agreement a use fee equal to seven percent (7%) of monthly gross receipts, if any,
but in no event shall the use fee be less than the sum of:
One dollars ninety cents ($1.90) per linear foot for underground facilities and one dollar
seventy cents ($1.70) per linear foot for above ground facilities located within the public
rights-of-way, on the close of the calendar year for which payment is calculated, with a
minimum fee of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per quarter. Said annual fee shall be paid
on a quarterly basis on the twenty-fifth (25th) day of the month immediately following the
close of the calendar quarter for which payment is made. In the event any quarterly payment
is made after the close of business on the date due, licensee shall pay compound interest at
twelve percent (12%) annual percentage rate of the total amount past due. On January 1,
2002, and each year thereafter, the amount of the required annual payment shall be
recalculated by the City of Glendale in accordance with the latest available price changes
reflected in the latest Consumer Price Index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the
United States Department of Labor as follows: The Index number shown for the City of St.
Louis, Missouri, titled "ALL ITEMS" and under the heading of "CPI-U" for the month of March,
2001, shall be the base index number, and the corresponding index number for the latest
available month prior to the recalculation date shall be the current index number. From the
quotient thereof there shall be subtracted the integer one (1) and any resulting positive
number shall be multiplied by one hundred (100) and then deemed to be the percentage
increase in the cost of living. Said percentage shall then be multiplied by the previous annual
payment rate and the resultant figures shall constitute the applicable payment rate. All such
adjustments shall be made to the nearest foot. No adjustment shall be made hereunder so as
to reduce the payment rate. If the designated Consumer Price Index is not available for use
as a "current index number" for the months hereinabove provided, it is agreed that said index,
as issued and published for the most recent preceding month, be used to determine such cost
of living adjustments; however, in the event that at any time prior to the termination of this

then issued and available with a preference to be given to an index published under the
auspices of the U.S. Government.

Section 461.200. Bundled Services.
[R.O. 2010 §461.200; Ord. No. B2-01 §2.10, 2-19-2001]
To the extent licensee markets "bundled" services, including combinations of services that may be
subject to an agreement and also a cable services franchise, licensee shall fairly reflect to the City an
appropriate and reasonable division of services among the various services offered based on the
actual value of each separate service. Whether or not licensee separates services on a subscriber's
bill, it will provide to the City the amounts upon which it will pay the communications services use fee
and any applicable taxes or fees based on the provision of communications service and the amounts
upon which it will pay the franchise fee. Should licensee engage in billing practices that, in the
determination of the City, do not fairly reflect an appropriate split of communications services and cable
services, the City will notify licensee in writing of its determination. The parties will meet and discuss in
good faith whether the billing practices result in an unfair payment of fees to the City. If the parties do
not agree on an appropriate method of determining which charges are subject to communications
services use fees and which are subject to the franchise fee, the parties may subject the dispute to
arbitration or may resort to other methods of dispute resolution, including litigation. Fees or taxes which
are not paid on the appropriate division of bundled services receipts, when ultimately paid, will be
subject to all interest and penalties provided by the applicable agreements. If licensee holds a cable
service franchise, any fee that could be lawfully attributed to gross receipts or alternatively "gross
revenues" under this Code shall be deemed to be subject to the higher fee.
Section 461.210. Timing of Payment of Use Fees.
[R.O. 2010 §461.210; Ord. No. B2-01 §2.11, 2-19-2001]

sixty (60) calendar days of the close of each month for which the payment applies (the "due date").

Payments.
[R.O. 2010 §461.220; Ord. No. B2-01 §2.12, 2-19-2001]

thereon shall accrue from the due date until received at the rate of one and one-half percent (1½%) per
month unless such other maximum rate is established by law.
Section 461.230. Fee Statement.
[R.O. 2010 §461.230; Ord. No. B2-01 §2.13, 2-19-2001]
Each use fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the manner in which the use fee
was calculated and in such format as my be required by the City. If any fee statement is determined to
understate the fee owed, then such additional amount owed shall be made with a corrected statement,
including interest on said amount as provided herein. Within ninety (90) calendar days following the
end of the calendar year, each licensee shall submit a statement, certified as true, setting forth its
gross revenues, the amount of linear foot and antennae within the facilities, and describing what

[R.O. 2010 §461.240; Ord. No. B2-01 §2.14, 2-19-2001]
No acceptance by the City of any use fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in
fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any use fee payment be construed as a release of any
claim of the City.

[R.O. 2010 §461.250; Ord. No. B2-01 §2.15, 2-19-2001]
Licensee shall at all times maintain complete and accurate books of account and records of the
business, ownership and operations of the licensee with respect to the system in a manner that allows
the City to determine whether the licensee has properly calculated its use fee in compliance with this
Chapter. Should the City reasonably determine that the records are not being maintained in such
manner, the licensee shall correct the manner in which the books and/or records are maintained so
that the licensee comes into compliance with this Section. All financial books and records which are
maintained in accordance with FCC regulations and the regulations of any governmental entity that
regulates utilities in Missouri and generally accepted accounting principles shall be deemed to be
acceptable under this Section. Such books and records shall be maintained for a period of at least
three (3) years. The failure to provide information or maintain records as required herein shall be
grounds for forfeiture or revocation of an agreement.
Section 461.260. Right of Inspection.

this Section, shall have the right to inspect, examine and copy records at a location acceptable to the
City during normal business hours and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to
be payable under this Code, whether the records are held by the licensee or any other person that
collects or receives funds related to the use fee obligations or the provision of communications
services over a licensee's communications system in the City. Licensee shall also provide reasonable
access to records necessary to verify compliance with the terms of the agreement. The franchisee or
licensee shall pay the City's audit expenses, costs or travel charges, including an advance payment of
such costs estimated by the City, provided that the frequency of such audits shall not exceed one (1)
per year. In addition to the annual audit, a franchisee or licensee shall make such records available for
review upon reasonable notice by the City, provided that the City agrees to bear its own costs for any
such additional review of records. In addition to other relevant information, the City reserves the right to
request information showing circuit account ID, billing account ID, City of origination, City of termination
within Greater St. Louis area, monthly recurring revenue, non-recurring revenue, turn-up dates,
common language location identifier (CLLI) codes for all Greater St. Louis customers, names of

shall include:
The certification of the applicable regulatory approval necessary to undertake such service or

The name of the provider(s) owning the facilities within the City through which the
communications shall be transmitted. It shall be unlawful for any provider or reseller service

that does not have a valid franchise or agreement with the City authorizing the use of such
facilities.

forced or voluntary sale or by ordinary sale, consolidation or otherwise, an agreement or any of the
rights or privileges granted by an agreement without the prior written consent of the City; provided that
such transfer may occur without written consent of the City to a wholly owned parent or subsidiary, or
between wholly owned subsidiaries, upon thirty (30) days' prior notice to the City. Such consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. The City reserves the right to be reimbursed for its reasonable costs

Section 461.330. Forfeiture of Agreement and Privilege.
[R.O. 2010 §461.330; Ord. No. B2-01 §2.23, 2-19-2001]
In case of failure on the part of the licensee, its successors and assigns to comply with any of the
provisions of this Code or an agreement, or if the licensee, its successors and assigns should do or
cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of this Code or the terms of an
agreement, the licensee, its successors and assigns shall forfeit all rights and privileges permitted by
this Code and any agreement, and all rights hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and
void, provided that said forfeiture shall not take effect until the City shall carry out the following
proceedings: Before the City declares the forfeiture or revocation of an agreement, it shall first serve a
written notice upon the company setting forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and the
company shall have thirty (30) days thereafter, or such other reasonable period established by the
Governing Body, in which to cure the default by complying with the conditions of an agreement and
fully remedying any default or violation. If at the end of such thirty (30) day period the City determines
that the conditions have not been complied with, and that the company did not reasonably and in the
public interest require more than thirty (30) days to cure the default, the City shall take action by an
affirmative vote of the Governing Body present at the meeting and voting to terminate the agreement
setting out the grounds upon which said agreement is to be forfeited or revoked. Nothing herein shall
prevent the City from invoking any other remedy or from declaring immediate forfeiture where the
default is incapable of being cured by licensee, including where such defaults or violations have
repeatedly occurred.
Article III. Cable Services
Section 461.340. Cable Franchise Requirements.
[R.O. 2010 §461.340; Ord. No. B2-01 §3.1, 2-19-2001]
General Findings Regarding Cable Services. The City finds that cable service has become an
integral part of its citizens' lives and that evolving cable systems have the potential to play an even
more dramatic role in the future, providing great benefits and advanced capabilities to residents of
the City. At the same time, the rapidly emerging role of cable systems as an integrated broadband
communications platform necessitates a finding that the local government has a legitimate and
vital role to play in regulating cable services in a manner that ensures high quality customer
service while at the same time fostering competition to the extent permitted under law. The
Governing Body further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be
served by establishing regulatory powers that are vested in the City.
Unlawful To Operate Without A Franchise. It shall be unlawful for any person to construct, operate
or maintain a cable system or to provide cable service or other competing multi-channel video
services in the City without a franchise, unless otherwise specifically authorized under applicable
Federal or State law. Consistent with Article V any such person shall be subject to a fine of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) per day. The payment of such fine notwithstanding, all such violators
shall be subject to all other applicable provisions of this Code to the fullest extent allowed by law

including, but not limited to, the payment of a franchise fee. This Section shall not apply to a
grantee who has properly asserted its intent and is diligently pursuing renewal of the franchise
pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 546.
Franchise Not Exclusive.
Any franchise granted pursuant to this Chapter shall be non-exclusive. The grantor
specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable
television system or any component thereof to any other person including itself as it deems
appropriate, subject to this Code and applicable Federal and State law.
The terms and conditions of any cable franchises granted or renewed pursuant to this
Chapter shall be, when taken as a whole, no less burdensome or more beneficial than any
other cable franchises granted or renewed pursuant to this Chapter, when taking into
consideration the context in which the earlier terms were adopted. Provided however, that
nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the use of identical terms or conditions or limit
the enforceability of conditions that are freely negotiated.
Nothing in this Subsection shall be deemed to create any cause of action or claim of breach
for any franchisee or third (3rd) party.
Franchise Territory. Every cable franchise shall apply to the entire territorial area of the City, as it
exists now or may later be configured.
Federal, State And City Jurisdiction.
This Chapter and Code shall be construed in a manner consistent with all applicable Federal
and State laws.
In the event that the Federal or State Government discontinues pre-emption in any area of
cable communications over which it currently exercises jurisdiction in such manner as to
expand rather than limit municipal regulatory authority, City may, if it so elects, adopt rules
and regulations in these areas to the extent permitted by law and the reasonable exercise of
the City's Police powers.
The provisions of this Chapter and Code shall apply to all cable franchises granted or
renewed after or simultaneously with the effective date of this Chapter. This Chapter and
Code shall also apply to all existing franchises to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of
any such franchise or applicable law and to the extent that it does not impose additional
material burdens on such grantee. A cable franchise (including all of grantee's particular
rights, powers, protections, privileges, immunities and obligations associated therewith as the
same exist on the date hereof) shall constitute a legally binding contract between the City and
grantee and as such cannot be amended, modified or changed by the grantor without the
consent of grantee in any manner whatsoever, whether by ordinance, rule, regulation or
otherwise, to impose on grantee more stringent or burdensome requirements or conditions. In
the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of a franchise and the provisions of
this Chapter or Code and other generally applicable regulatory ordinances of the City, the
specific terms of the franchise shall control; provided however, that nothing herein contained
shall preclude the City from the proper exercise of its Police powers.

Consideration Of Initial Applications.
Upon receipt of any application for an initial franchise, the City Administrator or other
designated administrative official shall prepare a report and make his/her recommendations
respecting such application to the Governing Body.
A public hearing shall be held prior to any initial franchise grant at a time and date approved
by the Governing Body. Within thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing, the Governing
Body shall make a decision based upon the evidence received at the hearing as to whether or
not the franchise(s) should be granted and, if granted, subject to what conditions.
Franchise Renewal. Franchise renewals shall be in accordance with applicable law including, but
not necessarily limited to, the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended. The City
and a grantee, by mutual consent, may enter into renewal negotiations at any time during the term
of the franchise.
Grant Of Additional Franchise And Competing Service. Since competing or overlapping cable
franchises may have an adverse impact on the public rights-of-way, on the quality and availability
of services to the public, and may adversely affect an existing provider's ability to continue to
provide the services it is presently providing under a franchise, the City may issue a franchise in
an area where another grantee is operating only following a public hearing to consider the
potential impact which the grant of an additional franchise may have on the community. In
considering whether to grant one (1) or more additional franchises, the City shall specifically
consider and address in a written report the following issues:
The positive and/or negative impact of an additional franchise on the community.
The ability and willingness of the specific applicant in question to provide cable services to the
entire franchise area which is served by the existing cable provider. The purpose of this
Subsection is to ensure that any competition which may occur among grantees will be on
terms which when taken as a whole do not give a competitive advantage to one grantee over
another.
The amount of time it will take the applicant to complete construction of the proposed cable
system and activate cable service in the entire franchise area; and whether the applicant can
complete construction and activation of its cable system in a timely manner.
The financial capabilities of the applicant and its guaranteed commitment to make the
necessary investment to erect, maintain and operate the proposed cable system for the
duration of the franchise term. In order to ensure that any prospective grantee does have the
requisite current financial capabilities, the City may request equity and debt financing
commitment letters, current financial statements, bonds, letters of credit or other
documentation to demonstrate to the City's satisfaction that the requisite funds to construct
and operate the proposed cable system are available.
The quality and technical reliability of the proposed cable system, based upon the applicant's
plan of construction and the method of distribution of signals, and the applicant's technical
qualifications to construct and operate such cable system.
The experience of the applicant in the erection, maintenance and operation of a cable system.
The capacity of the rights-of-way to accommodate one (1) or more additional cable systems
and the potential disruption of those rights-of-way and private property that may occur if one
(1) or more additional franchises are granted.
The disruption of existing cable service and the potential that the proposed franchise would
adversely affect the residents of the City.

The likelihood and ability of the applicant to continue to provide competing cable service to
subscribers within the entire franchise area for the duration of the franchise.
Such other information as the City may deem appropriate to be considered prior to granting
any competing or overlapping franchise.
Permits For Non-Franchised Entities. The City may issue a license to a person other than the
grantee to permit that person to traverse any portion of a grantee's franchise area within the City
in order to provide cable service outside, but not within, the City. Such license or easement,
absent a grant of a franchise in accordance with this Chapter, shall not authorize nor permit said
person to provide cable service of any type to any home or place of business within the City. Such
license shall be granted pursuant to the requirements of Article II of this Code.

hours of the originally scheduled service call. The subscriber does not need to be home for
outside plant and line repairs.
A grantee may interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time reasonably
possible, including interruption for system upgrade, maintenance and repair. Subject to the
reasonable safety precautions for the benefit of the grantee's employees and agents, routine
maintenance shall occur at times that affect the fewest number of subscribers, generally
between 12:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M. To the extent that specific neighborhoods will be affected
by a planned outage, such as during an upgrade, the grantee shall provide advance notice
through telephone calls, door hangers and/or other reasonable means.
A grantee shall provide a credit equivalent to a pro rata of the monthly cable rate for each
service interruption exceeding four (4) hours in any twenty-four (24) hour period, unless it is
demonstrated that the subscriber caused the outage or the outage was planned as part of an
upgrade or other work that occurred between the hours of 12:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M., of which
the City and the subscriber received appropriate prior notification. A subscriber is entitled to a
full refund for any cable system or disruption to a pay-per-view event. These credits and

advance notice, provided that a grantee shall immediately notify the subscriber with door tags
and/or telephone calls or other reasonable means. If the source of the signal leakage is
remedied, and the subscriber was not the cause of such leakage, the grantee shall reconnect
the subscriber at no charge. If the subscriber was the cause of the signal leakage, the grantee
may charge a reasonable reconnection fee. For purposes of this Section, use of FCC
approved navigation devices does not in and of itself constitute subscriber caused signal
leakage.
Subscribers may request disconnection or a downgrade of cable service at any time. A
grantee may not impose any charge for service delivered after the requested date of
disconnection. As provided under Federal law, subscribers may request a downgrade at no
charge if made within thirty (30) days of a rate increase.
Nothing in this Chapter or Code shall limit the right of a grantee to deny cable service to any
household or individual which has a negative credit or cable service history with the grantee,
which may include non-payment of bills, theft or damage to the grantee's equipment,
outstanding balances; or threats or assaults on employees of the grantee in the course of
their employment. In the event cable service is denied, the grantee will give notice to the
subscriber of the right to contact the appropriate authority as designated by the City.
Communications Between Grantee And Subscribers.
Notifications to subscribers.
Every grantee shall provide written information to subscribers on each of the following
topics at the time of installation, at least annually to all subscribers, and at any time upon
request of a subscriber:
Product and services offered;
Prices and options for programming services and conditions of subscription to
programming and other services and facilities;
Installation and service maintenance policies;
Instructions on how to use services;
Channel positions of programming offered on a system; and
Billing and complaint procedures, including the name, address and telephone
number of the City.
Subscribers will be given thirty (30) days' advance notice of any changes in rates,
programming services or channel positions if the change is within the control of the
grantee. All such notice shall be provided in writing by any reasonable means. In
addition, the grantee shall notify subscribers thirty (30) days in advance of any significant
changes in other information required by this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any provision of this franchise to the contrary, a grantee shall not be required to provide
prior notice of any rate change that is the result of a regulatory fee, franchise fee or any
other fee, tax assessment or change of any kind imposed by any government entity on
the transaction between the grantee and the subscriber.
Billing.
Bills must be clear, concise and understandable. Bills must be fully itemized including,
but not limited to, basic and premium service charges and equipment charges.
Bills must clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges,
rebates and credits.

In case of a billing dispute, a grantee must respond to a written complaint from a
subscriber within twenty-one (21) calendar days.
Credits for service shall be issued no later than the subscriber's next billing cycle after
determination that the credit is warranted.
Late charges. A grantee may impose a monthly fee for any delinquent balance owed by a
subscriber, subject to the following:
At least ten (10) days before the date the fee is imposed, the subscriber shall be given
written notice on the face of the bill or by separate notice of:
The date after which the fee will be imposed if the balance is not paid; and
The amount of the fee that will be imposed; and
The fee for the delinquent payment shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the amount of
the delinquent balance per month or five dollars ($5.00) per month, whichever is greater.
Refunds. Refund checks will be issued promptly, but no later than either:
The subscriber's next billing cycle following resolution of the request or thirty (30) days,
whichever is earlier, or
The return of equipment supplied by the grantee if cable services are terminated.
Complaint Log. Subject to the privacy provisions of 47 U.S.C. Section 521 et seq., every grantee
shall prepare and maintain written records of all complaints made to them and the resolution of
such complaints, including the date of such resolution. Such written records shall be on file at the
office of grantee. A grantee shall make available to grantor a written summary of such complaints
and their resolution upon request.
Parental Control. Every grantee shall make available to any subscriber upon request a "lockout"
device for blocking both video and audio portions of any channel(s) of programming entering the
subscriber's premises. Such device shall be provided at a reasonable charge, except to the extent
that Federal law specifically provides otherwise. A grantee may, however, require a reasonable
security deposit for the use of such a device.
Service Area.
Area served. A franchisee shall build and maintain its system so that within a reasonable
period of time, as established by the franchise, it is able to provide service to all households
desiring service located within the franchise area without any construction charges (other than
standard connection charges and drop charges as indicated in Section 461.370(P)(2)(e). A
franchisee must build and maintain its system so that it can extend service to households
desiring service located outside the franchise area in accordance with Section 461.370(P)(2)
(a — f). Connections to commercial customers shall be governed by Section 461.370(P)(2)(f).
Line extension requirements.
For areas within the City limits but outside the franchise area, including areas annexed
after the effective date of its franchise, a franchisee shall upon request of the Governing
Body extend its trunk and distribution system to serve households desiring service
without any construction charge (other than standard connection charges and drop
charges as indicated in Section 5(e)(2)), unless the franchisee demonstrates to the
Governing Body's satisfaction evidenced by written decision that circumstances justify a
specific charge, where the new subscriber requesting service is located within five
hundred (500) feet from the termination of the cable system or the number of potential

subscribers to be passed by such extension is equal to or greater than twenty (20)
potential households per cable mile measured from any point on the system.
In circumstances where that the factors requiring line extension do not exist as set forth
in the foregoing paragraph (a) are not met, the franchisee shall on the request of the
Governing Body extend its cable system based upon the following cost-sharing formula.
The franchisee shall contribute an amount equal to the construction costs per mile
multiplied by the length of the extension in miles, multiplied by a fraction where the
numerator equals the number of potential households per mile at the time of the request
and the denominator equals twenty (20). Households requesting service as of the
completion of construction can be required to bear the remainder of the total construction
costs on a pro rata basis.
The "construction costs" are defined as the actual turnkey cost to construct the entire
extension including lines, materials, electronics, pole make-ready charges and labor but
not the cost of drops except as provided below. If the franchisee proposes to require a
household requesting extension to make a contribution in aid of extension, it must:
Notify the Governing Body in advance;
Send the Governing Body a copy of the invoice showing the amount actually
charged each household requesting extension; and
Within thirty (30) days of completion of the extension, furnish proof of the total cost of
the extension and make any appropriate refunds if the total cost is less than the
amounts charged in advance of construction.
At the end of each calendar year, the franchisee must calculate the
amount any contributing person would have paid based on the
number of persons served at that time and pay back the difference
between the amount which would then be owed. The franchisee
shall report such calculations and refunds to the City Clerk by the
end of January of the following year.
Installation of drops. Except as Federal rate regulations may otherwise require, the
franchisee shall not assess any additional cost for service drops of one hundred fifty
(150) feet or less unless the franchisee demonstrates to the Governing Body's
satisfaction, evidenced by written decision, that circumstances justify a specific charge.
Where a drop exceeds one hundred fifty (150) feet in length, a franchisee may charge
the subscriber for the difference between franchisee's actual costs associated with
installing a one hundred fifty (150) foot drop and the franchisee's actual cost of installing
the longer drop, provided that drop length shall be the shorter of:
The actual length of installed drop, or
The shortest practicable distance to the point where the franchisee would be
required to extend its distribution system.
Location of drops. Except as Federal rate regulations may otherwise require, in any area
where a franchisee would be entitled to install a drop above ground, the franchisee will
provide the subscriber the option to have the drop installed underground but may charge
the subscriber the difference between the actual costs of the above ground installation
and the actual cost of the underground installation.
Time for extension. A franchisee must extend service to any person who requests it:
Within seven (7) days of the request within the franchise area or where service can
be provided by activating or installing a drop within one hundred fifty (150) feet of the

existing distribution system;
Within thirty (30) days of the request for service outside the franchise area where an
extension of one-half (½) mile or less (but more than one hundred fifty (150) feet) is
required; or
Within six (6) months for service outside the franchise area where an extension of
one-half (½) mile or more is required.
Because existing conditions can vary dramatically, franchisee may in its discretion
require commercial customers to pay all reasonable costs of connection (including time
and materials) in excess of the average cost of connection for residential services.
Newly annexed areas. In such cases where mandatory extension of the cable system is
required for areas newly annexed after the effective date of the franchise, but the technical
capabilities of the then-existing cable system are such that the minimum technical
performance standards required by this franchise or the FCC cannot be met, then the grantee
shall be required to make such extension only if the grantee can earn a fair return (as
measured by the grantee's weighted average cost of capital) on the incremental investment
required combined with the overall investment base of the cable system within the boundaries
of the franchise area.
Special agreements. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a grantee from serving
areas not covered under this Section upon agreement with developers, property owners or
residents.
Customer Service Reporting Requirements. The City may require upon reasonable request that a
grantee periodically prepare and furnish to City semi-annual reports and any other reasonable
information relevant to the grantee's compliance with the customer service requirements of this
Chapter measured on a quarterly basis.
Section 461.380. Operation and Maintenance.
[R.O. 2010 §461.380; Ord. No. B2-01 §3.5, 2-19-2001]
Open Books And Records. Every grantee shall cooperate with the City with respect to City's
administration of this Chapter and Code and any applicable franchise granted pursuant to it.
Subject to the privacy provisions of the Cable Act, City shall have the right to inspect, upon three
(3) business days' notice, during normal business hours, all books, records, maps, plans, financial
statements, service complaint logs, performance test results and other existing like materials of a
grantee that relate to the operation of the grantee's cable system and that are reasonably
necessary to grantor's enforcement or administration of this Code or the grantee's franchise. A
grantee shall not be required to maintain any books or records for franchise compliance purposes
longer than three (3) years, except that financial records necessary to demonstrate compliance
with the required cable franchise fee payments shall be kept for six (6) years. Upon request, the
City will treat designated information disclosed by a grantee as confidential to the extent
permissible under State and Federal law. All such review of a grantee's books and records shall
be performed by an independent party if the City itself enters into the business as a competitor.
Communications With Regulatory Agencies. Copies of all petitions, applications, communications
and reports submitted by a grantee to the FCC, Securities and Exchange Commission or any
other Federal or State regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction in respect to any
matters directly affecting the cable system operations shall be made available contemporaneously
to the City upon request. Copies of responses from the above regulatory agencies to a grantee
likewise shall be made available promptly to the City upon request. If the City is specifically named
in any such pleading or response, the City shall automatically be furnished a copy.

revenues of the grantee for the preceding fiscal year;
A current list of names and addresses of each officer and director and other management
personnel of the grantee;

City and its agents and representatives shall have authority to arrange for and conduct an
audit during normal business hours of the books and records of grantee that are reasonably
necessary for the enforcement of a franchise. A grantee shall first be given thirty (30) days'
notice of the audit, the description of and purpose for the audit and a description, to the best
of City's ability, of the books, records and documents that City wants to review. The costs and
expense of such audit shall be borne by the grantee if the audit reveals a discrepancy of two
percent (2%) or more from the information related to the City.
Any review or audit of a grantee's books and records shall be performed by an independent
party if the City itself enters into the business as a competitor to provide cable services.
Index Of Reports.
Every grantee shall compile and maintain an index of reports that shall list all reports,
documents and filings that it has prepared with respect to the cable system over the course of
the past two (2) years as a result of the requirements of the FCC or this Chapter or Code or
franchise, including technical cable system testing, and proof of performance reports and
customer service compliance measurements and shall provide a copy of such index of reports
to the City annually and upon written request.
A grantee shall make a copy of any reports or documents listed in the index of reports
available to the City upon request.
Additional Reports And Assistance. Upon request of the City, a grantee shall add additional
reports to the index which are reasonably necessary to the City's proper enforcement of this
Chapter, Code or franchise. The City shall require such reports only through passage of a formal
resolution of the City. In addition, upon request, a grantee shall cooperate and assist the City in
interpreting and understanding any report required under this Chapter, Code or its franchise,
including through the provision of explanatory graphs and/or charts.

and/or local law or any applicable rules and regulations.
Upon request, a grantee shall submit to City any subscriber contract form that it utilizes. If no
written contract exists, a grantee shall file with the City a document completely and concisely
stating the terms of the residential subscriber contract offered, specifically including the length
of the subscriber contract. The length and terms of any subscriber contract shall be available
for public inspection during normal business hours.
Section 461.390. Financial Provisions, Remedies Procedures
and Due Process.
[R.O. 2010 §461.390; Ord. No. B2-01 §3.6, 2-19-2001]
Annual Cable Franchise Fee.
As compensation for grant of a franchise and in consideration of permission to use the rightsof-
way of the City for the construction, operation, maintenance and reconstruction of a cable
system and to defray the costs of franchise obligations, every grantee shall pay to the City on
an annual basis throughout the term of its franchise a sum totaling five percent (5%) of the
grantee's gross revenues.
Not a tax or in lieu of any other tax or fee.
The franchise fee is not a tax, license or fee subject to any requirement of voter approval,
but rather is a rental charge for special and individualized use of public property.
The franchisee fee is in addition to all other fees and all taxes and payments that a
franchisee or other person may be required to pay under any Federal, State or local law,
including any applicable property and amusements taxes, except to the extent that such
fees, taxes or assessments are a franchise fee under 47 U.S.C. Section 542.
Further, every grantee shall market any "bundled" services to fairly reflect an appropriate and
reasonable division of services among the various services offered. Whether or not a grantee
separates services on a subscriber's bill, it will provide to the City the amounts upon which it
will pay the communications service use fee and any other applicable taxes or fees based on
the provision of communications service and the amounts upon which it will pay the cable
service franchise fee. Should a grantee engage in billing practices that, in the determination of
the City, do not fairly reflect an appropriate split of communications services and cable
television services, the City will notify the grantee in writing of its determination. The parties
will meet and discuss in good faith whether the billing practices result in an unfair payment of
fees to the City. If the parties do not agree on an appropriate method of determining which
charges are subject to communications service use fees and which are subject to the cable
service franchise fee, the parties may subject the dispute to arbitration or may resort to other
methods of dispute resolution, including litigation. Taxes or fees which are not paid on the
appropriate division of the bundled bill, when ultimately paid, will be subject to all interest and
penalties provided by the applicable portion of this Code.
Payments due City under this Section shall be computed quarterly, for the preceding quarter,
as of March thirty-first (31st), June thirtieth (30th), September thirtieth (30th) and December
thirty-first (31st). Each quarterly payment shall be due and payable no later than forty-five (45)
days after the dates listed in the previous sentence. Each payment shall be accompanied by
a brief report by the grantee showing the basis for the computation and a "franchise fee
worksheet" listing all of the sources of revenues attributable to the operation of the grantee's
system.

Should any additional monies be due to the City as a result of information contained in the
annual financial report of a grantee or by audit as permitted by this Chapter, the grantee shall
pay such additional monies to the City within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice of same
from the City.
In the event any franchisee fee or other payment is not made on or before the date specified
herein, the franchisee and any other person shall pay interest charges computed from such
due date at an annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the City's primary
depository bank during the period such unpaid amount is owed. In addition, franchisee shall
pay an additional sum of two percent (2%) of the amount due to defray the City's additional
expenses by reason of the delinquency.
No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact
the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any
claim the City may have for further sums payable under the provisions of this Chapter, Code
or applicable franchise. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by the
City or its designee at any time upon reasonable notice and specification of the documents
requested to be reviewed. City's right to audit, and the grantee's obligations to retain records
related to the franchise fee audit, shall expire six (6) years from the date on which each
franchise fee payment by the grantee is due.
Security Fund. Each grantee may be required to maintain a security fund with the City to ensure
compliance with this Chapter, Code and applicable franchise in an amount and in a manner as set
forth in the grantee's franchise.
Bonds, Indemnification And Insurance. Each grantee shall maintain bonds and insurance with the
City in amounts and in a manner as set forth in the grantee's franchise. Each grantee also shall be
required to indemnify the City in a manner as set forth in Article I and in the grantee's franchise.
Remedies And Enforcement Procedure.
Whenever the City has reason to believe that a grantee has violated any provision of this
Code or its franchise, including the customer service and telephone availability requirements,
the City shall first notify the grantee in writing of the violation and demand correction within a
reasonable time, which shall not be less than thirty (30) days. If the grantee fails to
demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the City that no violation exists or if the grantee
fails to correct the violation within the time prescribed or if the grantee is unable to correct the
violation and fails to commence corrective action within the time prescribed and to diligently
remedy such violation thereafter, the grantee shall then be given written notice of not less
than thirty (30) days of a public hearing to be held before the Governing Body. Said notice
shall indicate with reasonable specificity the violation alleged to have occurred. This
procedure shall apply to all alleged Code or franchise violations, including those in which
grounds for revocation are considered.
At the public hearing, the Governing Body shall hear and consider all relevant evidence and
thereafter render findings and a decision based upon the evidence.
In the event the City finds that the grantee has corrected the violation or promptly commenced
correction of such violation after notice thereof from the City and is diligently proceeding to
fully remedy the violation or that no violation has occurred, the proceedings shall terminate
and no penalty or other sanction shall be imposed.
In the event the City finds that a violation exists and that the grantee has not corrected the
same in a satisfactory manner or did not promptly commence and diligently proceed to correct
the violation, the City may impose penalties and/or liquidated damages from the security fund,
as follows:

relating to initial construction schedules and system upgrade construction schedule, five
hundred dollars ($500.00) per day of non-compliance;
For all other violations, two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day per violation.
The City shall provide the grantee with written notice of its decision together
with a written finding of fact explaining the basis for such a decision.
If the City elects to assess penalties or liquidated damages, then such election shall constitute
the City's exclusive remedy for a period of sixty (60) days. Thereafter, if the grantee remains
in non-compliance, the City may pursue any other available remedy, including franchise
revocation.
In the event that a franchise is cancelled or terminated by reason of the default of the grantee,
the security fund deposited pursuant to the franchise shall remain in effect and available to
the City until all pending claims or penalties are resolved or settled, after which point any
remaining amounts in the security fund shall revert to the possession of the grantee.
The rights reserved to the City with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other
rights of City whether reserved by this Code, applicable franchise or authorized by law and no
action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any
other right City may have.
The foregoing provisions shall not be deemed to preclude the City from obtaining any other
available remedies for repeated violations of the same general type, whether remedied or not.
Grounds For Revocation. In addition to any rights in this Code or applicable franchise, the City
reserves the right to utilize the above-described enforcement procedure to revoke a franchise and
all rights and privileges pertaining thereto in the event that any of the following occur, and the City
and a grantee are not able to mutually agree upon a cure or alternate remedy:
The grantee substantially violates any material provision of this Code or its franchise;
The grantee practices an act of fraud or deceit upon the City; or
The grantee becomes insolvent or is adjudged bankrupt.
Right Of Appeal.
Upon the imposition of a penalty or revocation decision, a grantee shall have a period of one
hundred twenty (120) days subsequent to the date of the formal adoption of the decision by
the Governing Body within which to file an appeal with a court of competent jurisdiction.
During any such appeal period, the franchise shall remain in full force and effect.

Foreclosure. Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a part of the cable system or upon
the termination of any lease covering all or part of the cable system, a grantee shall notify the City
of such fact and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in control of the
grantee has taken place, and the provisions of this Code governing the consent to transfer or
change in ownership shall apply without regard to how such transfer or change in ownership
occurred.

cable system or effect a transfer of ownership of the cable system to another person, any such
acquisition or transfer shall in accordance with and to the extent permitted by 47 U.S.C. Section
547 as follows:
Upon revocation of a franchise, such valuation shall not include any sum attributable to the
value of the franchise itself and plant and property shall be valued according to its book value

[R.O. 2010 §461.420; Ord. No. B2-01 §3.9, 2-19-2001]
A grantee shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or dispose of, in whole or in part, an interest
in or control of a franchise or cable system without the prior consent of the City, which consent
shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed and may be denied only upon a good faith finding by
the City that the proposed transferee lacks the legal, technical or financial qualifications to
consummate the transaction and operate the cable system so as to perform its obligations under
the franchise. This Section shall not apply to sales of property or equipment in the normal course
of business. Consent from the City shall not be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage or other
instrument of hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness or for a pro forma
transfer to a corporation, partnership or other entity controlling, controlled by or under common
control with a grantee.
The following events shall be deemed to be a sale, assignment or other transfer of an interest in or
control of a franchise or cable system requiring compliance with this Section:
The sale, assignment or other transfer of all or a majority of a grantee's assets in the City;
The sale, assignment or other transfer of capital stock or partnership, membership or other
equity interests in a grantee by one (1) or more of its existing shareholders, partners,
members or other equity owners so as to create a new controlling interest in grantee;

including the pledge or grant of a mortgage or security interest to lenders of a grantee's assets
including, but not limited to, the franchise, such as in a transaction commonly known as an "initial
public offering" shall not be deemed to be a sale, assignment or other transfer of an interest in or
control of a franchise or cable system and thus shall not require compliance with this Section.
In the case of any sale or transfer of ownership of an interest in or control of a franchise or cable
system, the City shall have one hundred twenty (120) days to act upon any request for approval of
such sale or transfer that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in

final decision on the request within one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt by the City of all
required information, such request shall be deemed granted unless the requesting party and the
City agree to an extension of the one hundred twenty (120) day period.

otherwise discriminate against subscribers, programmers or general citizens on the basis of
income level, race, color, religion, national origin, sex or age. Every grantee shall strictly adhere to
the equal employment opportunity requirements of State and Federal law. Every grantee shall
comply at all times with all other applicable Federal, State and local laws and all executive and

rights-of-way on the effective date of any agreement or franchise, and those reasonably anticipated to
be installed in each six (6) month period subsequent to the initial and updated filing, and such other
related information as required by the City Engineer. Such maps shall be updated and kept current with
the City.

plans for the facilities, the City may in its discretion designate certain locations or facilities in the rightsof-
way to be excluded from use by provider for its facilities including, but not limited to, ornamental or
similar specially-designed street lights or other facilities or locations which, in the reasonable judgment
of the City Engineer, do not have electrical service adequate or appropriate for the provider's facilities
or cannot safely bear the weight or wind loading thereof or any other facility or location that in the
3/5/2020 City of Glendale, MO Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/GL3308?guid=29362430,29351405,29351456,29351572,29351601,29351622,29351713,29351870,29351913,29351… 361/444
reasonable judgment of the City Engineer is incompatible with the proposed facilities or would be
rendered unsafe or unstable by the installation. The City Engineer may further exclude certain other
facilities that have been designated or planned for other use or are not otherwise available for use by
provider due to engineering, technological, proprietary, legal or other limitations or restrictions as may
be reasonably determined by the City. In the event such exclusions conflict with the reasonable
requirements of the provider, the City will cooperate in good faith with provider to attempt to find
suitable alternatives, if available, provided that the City shall not be required to incur financial cost nor
require the City to acquire new locations for provider.
Section 461.520. Location, Type and Design of Facilities Subject
to Approval.
[R.O. 2010 §461.520; Ord. No. B2-01 §4.8, 2-19-2001]
The design, location and nature of all facilities shall be subject to the review and approval of the City
Engineer. Such review shall be based on non-discriminatory bases in application of City policy and
approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld. (Option 1: Except as provided herein, all facilities
constructed after the date of an agreement shall be placed underground and in conduit, where
capable. Antenna or other facilities may be located above ground only if approved by the City Engineer
for good cause and including as may be specifically authorized in an Exhibit attached hereto. Unless
extraordinary circumstances exist, good cause shall not include authorization for above ground
facilities requiring new poles or major modification to existing above ground structures. Option 2:
Except as provided herein, all facilities constructed after the date of an agreement shall be placed
underground and in conduit, where capable, unless existing above ground structures requiring no
major modification are available. Major modifications of above ground structures to accommodate
facilities or antenna or erection of new poles will be allowed only if approved by the City Engineer for
good cause or as may be specifically authorized in an Exhibit attached hereto.) Above ground
pedestals, vaults, antennae or other facilities may be installed only if approved by the City where
alternative underground facilities are not feasible or where underground requirements are otherwise
waived pursuant to the provisions of this Subsection. Existing conduit shall be used where feasible and
available. The location, design and requirements for antennae in the rights-of-way shall additionally be
subject to all specific ordinances, regulations or policies of the City generally applicable to the siting of
antennae. Where reasonable and appropriate and where adequate public rights-of-way exist the
provider shall place above ground facilities underground in conjunction with City capital improvement
projects and/or at specific locations requested by the City provided that such placement is practical,
efficient and economically feasible. Unless specifically authorized herein or otherwise by the City,
antennae/towers having a height of forty (40) feet or greater located on the rights-of-way or antennae
on other City-owned or controlled property shall not be authorized by an agreement but shall require a
separate lease or use agreement with the City. City height limitations, applicable zoning restrictions
and general City policies with regard to all users of the rights-of-way shall also be applicable to all
facilities. The City Engineer may establish such regulations or policies as may be deemed necessary
or appropriate to effect this provision.
Section 461.530. Notification, Joint Installation and Collocation
Requirements.
[R.O. 2010 §461.530; Ord. No. B2-01 §4.9, 2-19-2001]
Provider shall, prior to any excavation or installation within the rights-of-way, provide sufficient
notification and joint installation opportunity on a shared-cost basis to potential users of the rights-ofway
as may be provided for by separate City policy. Such notification and adopted policies shall be
designed to maximize collocation of providers to minimize the disturbance to the rights-of-way and
maximize its useable capacity. Provider shall not install new conduit or other facilities in the rights-ofway
where existing conduit is available to provider that would reasonably avoid the need for new
excavation or overhead installations. Provider shall identify by mapping, as required by the City
Engineer, the location and specifications of all conduit available or dedicated for collocation. Any

person unreasonably failing to respond to collocation opportunities or otherwise comply with this
provision or policies adopted hereunder shall, unless good cause is found by the City, be precluded
from use of the rights-of-way for a period of thirty (30) months at such locations that would reasonably
have been accommodated by the collocation opportunity that was declined.
Section 461.540. Use of Facilities by Others — Required Terms.
[R.O. 2010 §461.540; Ord. No. B2-01 §4.10, 2-19-2001]
If any provider chooses to make its facilities physically available for use by any other provider, it shall
do so only under terms that are fair and reasonable, competitively neutral and non-discriminatory and
which do not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or
intrastate telecommunications service under the circumstances. Provider shall further comply with the
facilities attachment requirements of Federal law codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 224.
Section 461.550. Additional Facilities Requirements — Planned
Infrastructure.
[R.O. 2010 §461.550; Ord. No. B2-01 §4.11, 2-19-2001]
When provider installs any new conduit, the provider shall simultaneously install sufficient additional
conduit or other related facilities ("excess conduit") as may be determined by the City Engineer and in
order to reasonably meet the needs of existing and future users of the rights-of-way. The criteria for
when such conduit will be required, the amount of conduit to be required, management and ownership
of the excess conduit and financing of the excess conduit and related matters shall be established by a
separate City policy. Such policy shall be publicly available and each agreement shall be deemed
subject to such applicable policies adopted or as may be amended. The excess conduit shall be
designed and installed in accordance with City specifications. The City may reserve for its own
purposes a portion of any excess conduit dedicated to the City but shall make available any portion not
so reserved to any and all subsequent providers (or others as determined by the City) on a nondiscriminatory
basis for fair and reasonable compensation that shall be paid in addition to the franchise
or use fees. When sections of provider's conduit is installed simultaneously with another provider, the
cost of such sections of excess conduit shall also be cost shared among each provider as may be
established by policy. The requirements herein shall be administered and applied so as not to create
an obstacle to entry in the market and on a competitively neutral and non-discriminatory basis to
maximize the available space in the rights-of-way and designed to minimize the total number of
excavations and cost of total communications infrastructure installation. No linear foot charge shall
apply to any excess conduit installed by provider and dedicated to the City.
Section 461.560. Removal of Facilities.
[R.O. 2010 §461.560; Ord. No. B2-01 §4.12, 2-19-2001]
Upon expiration of an agreement, whether by lapse of time, by agreement between the provider and
the City, or by forfeiture thereof, the provider shall remove, at its sole cost, from public property any
and all of its facilities that are the subject of an agreement within a reasonable time after such
expiration, not to exceed ninety (90) days, and it shall be the duty of provider immediately upon such
removal to restore the right-of-way from which the facilities are removed to as good condition as the
same were before the removal was effected and as required by the City. Provider shall further, unless
otherwise consented to by the City, remove all facilities that have not been used for a period of more
than one (1) year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon request of provider, the City may allow
underground facilities to be left in place when it is not practical or desirable to require removal.

reinstallation of any of its facilities, provider shall forthwith remove, relocate or reinstall any such
property as may be reasonably necessary to meet the request and the cost of such relocation, removal
or reinstallation of the facilities shall be the exclusive obligation of said provider. Provider shall upon
request of any other person requesting relocation of facilities and holding a validly issued building or
moving permit of the City, and within forty-eight (48) hours prior to the date upon which said person
intends to exercise its rights under said permit, thereupon temporarily raise, lower or relocate its wires
or other facilities as may be required for the person to exercise the rights under the permit, and
provider may require such permit holder to make payment in advance for any expenses incurred by
said provider pursuant to said person's request.
Section 461.580. No Cause of Action Against the City.
[R.O. 2010 §461.580; Ord. No. B2-01 §4.14, 2-19-2001]
The provider shall have no remedy or recourse whatsoever against the City for any loss, cost, expense
or damage arising from any of the provisions or requirements of any agreement or because of the
enforcement thereof by said City or for the failure of said City to have the authority to grant all or any
part of the herein granted; provided that said provider expressly acknowledges that it accepted the
rights herein granted in reliance upon its independent and personal investigation and understanding of
the power of authority of said City to enter into the agreement herein with provider; provided further,
that the provider acknowledges by its acceptance of said agreement that it has not been induced to
enter into an agreement upon any understanding or promise, whether given verbally or in writing by or
on behalf of said City or by any other person concerning any term or condition of an agreement not
expressed herein; provided further, that the provider acknowledges by the acceptance of an agreement
that it has carefully read the provisions, terms and conditions hereof and is willing to and does accept
all of the risk attendant to said provisions, terms and conditions. Nothing herein shall preclude provider
from seeking injunctive or declaratory judgment relief against the City where such relief is otherwise
available and the requirements therefor are otherwise satisfied; provided however, that the validity of
an executed agreement shall not be subject to challenge.
Section 461.590. Provider Responsible for Costs.
[R.O. 2010 §461.590; Ord. No. B2-01 §4.15, 2-19-2001]

with provider's installation, maintenance, repair, operation, use and replacement of its facilities within
the rights-of-way that are not otherwise accounted for as part of the permit fee established pursuant to
the ROW ordinance. All such costs shall be itemized and the City's books and records related to these
costs shall be made available upon request to the provider. Provider shall be responsible for its own
costs incurred removing or relocating its facilities when required by the City due to City requirements
relating to maintenance and use of the rights-of-way for City purposes.
Section 461.600. Insurance and Bonds.
[R.O. 2010 §461.600; Ord. No. B2-01 §4.16, 2-19-2001]
During the term of an agreement, the provider shall obtain and maintain at the provider's sole expense

streams subject to this Chapter, an undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained
for twenty-five (25) feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream
as measured from the top of the stream bank.
An additional setback shall be maintained for twenty-five (25) feet, measured horizontally,
beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be
prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback.
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.
Variance Procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted
in accordance with the following provisions:
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this Chapter, and its shape,
topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this
Chapter, and the Building Commissioner finds and determines that the requirements of this
Chapter prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the Board of
Adjustment of the City of Glendale may grant a variance from the buffer and setback
requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the
effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
Except as provided above, the Board of Adjustment of the City of Glendale shall grant no
variance from any provision of this Chapter without first conducting a public hearing on the
application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of
the Board of Adjustment. The City of Glendale shall give public notice of each such public
hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within St. Louis County, Missouri. The City of
Glendale shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance
and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the
property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of
the adoption of this Chapter prevents land development unless a buffer variance is
granted.
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the
ordinance would create an extreme hardship.
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this Chapter,
actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a
hardship on that property.
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, flood plain boundaries and
other natural features as determined by field survey;
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical
characteristics of the property;
A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and
other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both
inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected
shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;

an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
A storm water management site plan, if applicable; and
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request
must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of
the property;
The locations of all streams on the property including along property boundaries;
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion;
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; and
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the
environment.

[R.O. 2010 §500.180; Ord. No. 6-95 §1, 4-3-1995]
The St. Louis County "Weights and Measures Code", as amended, which was adopted by the County
of St. Louis on October 18, 1971, is hereby adopted as the "Weights and Measures Code" of the City
of Glendale, Missouri.
Article V. Sewer Lateral Repair Policy
Section 500.180. Sewer Lateral Repair Policy.
[R.O. 2010 §500.190; Ord. No. 03-01 §1, 3-5-2001; Ord. No. 14-04 §§1 — 3, 8-16-2004]
This program is to commence on January first (1st) of the year following first (1st) collection of the
fee.
A fee will be assessed at the rate of fifty dollars ($50.00) per year. Condominium residents are not
subject to this fee or program pursuant to State law.
Assuming fees collected exceed expenditures, the Board of Aldermen may waive all or any portion
of the fee for any period of time it chooses with the provision it may be reassessed without an
affirming vote of the people in order to meet increasing demand.
A sewer lateral is defined as the portion of pipe which carries household wastes to the MSD sewer
main and which lies between the house connection and the sewer main. The definition is the same
whether the pipe is located in the front, side or rear yard.
The City will contract for the repair of a defective lateral if after investigation, it is found to be
crushed due to causes beyond the control of the property owner, or if, as a result of pipe cracks or
leaking joints, tree roots or soil has infiltrated the pipe resulting in a blockage of the pipe rendering
the lateral not functional. Simple blockages that can be corrected by sewer cleaning or rodding will
not be covered under this program. The maximum that the City will pay under this program for any
sewer lateral repair is three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) with any additional cost for repair being
paid by the resident whose sewer lateral is being repaired.
The responsibility of the City is limited to excavation and repair of the lateral pipe, and backfilling
in a workmanlike manner. The top six (6) inches of the backfill material will be top soil. It will be the
responsibility of the unit owner to restore landscaping and ground cover, including grass, in
whatever manner they choose. The City will not be responsible for restoration of the yard to a
grass or landscaped surface.
The money generated from this fee will be used to replace sidewalks, driveways and streets
removed to accomplish the repair. In the event it was necessary to remove accessory structures
such as fences, this money can be used to restore such fences to their preexisting condition. In
the event obstacles such as yard sheds, garages, etc., are in the path of the lateral and lie over
the damaged portion of the lateral, the City reserves the right to reroute the lateral to avoid the
necessity of removing the structure.

Licensed plumbers and drain layers will be contracted to work on the sanitary sewer laterals on a
bid basis. The lowest and best bid shall be awarded the contract. The successful contractor shall
pay no less than the prevailing rate of hourly wages for each craft or type of workmanship needed
for the sewer lateral repair as determined by the Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial
Standards.
If during the above-mentioned investigation stage, the sewer line has to be cleaned out before it is
televised, any cost for that cleaning will be borne by the resident or property owner if the sewer
lateral is found not to be eligible for repair. If the sewer lateral is found to be eligible for repair, the
City will bear the cost for this cleaning in conjunction with this investigative stage.

twenty-five (25) calendar days, including any sale and removal of items.
After salvaging is completed, no pre-existing structure shall remain in a salvaged condition, as
described above, for a period in excess of twenty-five (25) calendar days prior to demolition,
unless the "salvage" area consists of more than three (3) pre-existing structures, constituting
a "large scale" housing development, in which case the time period shall be no more than
sixty (60) calendar days prior to demolition. Upon violation, the Building Official may order the

made on the project. Electrical, plumbing, mechanical and fire inspections must be completed and
approved prior to a framing inspection. In the event that a project requires multiple inspections
(framing, plumbing, mechanical, fire, etc.), these can sometimes be done at the same time to avoid
multiple inspection appointments.

Standard construction gauge international orange plastic mesh installed to a minimum
height of four (4) feet; and a maximum of five (5) feet from grade constitutes the minimum
fence requirement, although solid wood fencing material is preferred. The security of the
fence and gate(s) shall be maintained for the duration of the project.
Suitable iron, steel, painted metal or wood, non-rebar fence posts shall be installed at no
greater than eight (8) foot intervals. Space between any two (2) posts installed side by
side shall not be any greater than four (4) inches apart.
Access to the work site must be through a suitable "gate" to consist of a movable portion
of the fence which can be closed, fastened or otherwise secured as to emulate a
continuous segment of the adjacent fencing and post configuration. Maximum gate width
shall be fourteen (14) feet. Gate must be fastened or secured every evening or on
weekends so as to prevent unauthorized access. The space between gates, posts or
hardware shall be no greater than four (4) inches.
No temporary construction fence may encroach beyond the subject property line. No
temporary construction fence may encroach upon any public right-of-way without the
prior written approval of the Building Official.

[R.O. 2010 §501.080; Ord. No. 03-06 §1, 2-20-2006]
Existing sidewalks and streets must be maintained throughout the construction process. Construction
related damage requires the replacement of damaged sidewalk panels or the repair or replacement of
damaged street sections or the right-of-way in general to the specifications of the Public Works
Superintendent. In situations where the Building Official has approved construction fences encroaching
upon the public right-of-way, such fences will require a temporary sidewalk be constructed and
maintained, extending no more than four and one-half (4½) feet beyond the curb line. Such walks shall
be no less than four (4) feet in width, constructed in a safe and substantial manner as deemed
necessary by the Building Official. In instances where the public right-of-way affected is in proximity to
large amounts of pedestrian or commercial traffic, such as may be the case with a large scale housing
development exceeding three (3) total housing units, the Building Official may require the sidewalk be
roofed, handrails installed and properly lighted as a protection to the public from effects of construction
or demolition.
Section 501.090. Failure to Comply.
[R.O. 2010 §501.090; Ord. No. 03-06 §1, 2-20-2006]

work order, a fine consistent with Section 100.070 of the Glendale City Code, or both, and further court
imposed fines and orders.
Section 501.100. Construction Escrow.
[R.O. 2010 §501.100; Ord. No. 03-06 §1, 2-20-2006]
An escrow will be required by the builder of any new construction as determined by the City
Administrator in an amount not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the construction cost of the new home
in order to insure that any damage to sidewalks, streets and the public right-of-way during construction
is repaired in accordance with Section 501.080 herein upon completion of construction. If repairs are
not made within thirty (30) days of final inspection of the new home, the City may enter upon the
premises and may make such repairs using proceeds from the escrow. Said escrow will be in a form
prescribed by the City Administrator to insure that the escrow will be available to the City when it is
needed and may include an acceptable surety bond approved by the City Administrator.

The Board of Aldermen shall have the power, upon the petition of any citizens of the City, to make
contracts for the construction of sidewalks, including grading, with or without curbing, along any
street, avenue or public place, or highway. Such contracts shall be let to the lowest and best
bidder filed with and approved by the City Administrator and Board of Aldermen or the work shall
be performed by the City, whichever is preferable. Each lot or piece of ground abutting the
sidewalk constructed shall be liable for its proportionate share of the cost, as reported to the Board
of Aldermen, and special tax bills to abutting property owners shall be issued for the amount
thereof as set out in this Section. All tax bills shall bear an annual interest rate at the highest rate
allowed by State Statute (currently eight percent (8%)), for a maximum of ten (10) years.
The owners of property benefitted by these improvements shall, to the extent deemed proper by
the Board of Aldermen also provide all required and necessary easements and dedications before
work on the sidewalk improvements shall begin. They shall assume responsibility for
relandscaping. This responsibility extends to the replacement of trees, shrubs, and other plants
removed to complete the requested improvements. They shall assume responsibility for the
removal and reinstallation of fences removed to complete the improvements, unless a fence is
disturbed on private property instead of the public right-of-way.
The City's participation in said improvements shall to the extent authorized by the Board of
Aldermen provide the required and necessary engineering and design of the improvements,
assistance in the preparation of documents required for necessary easements and the preparation
of bids and specifications.
The City's participation in sidewalk construction shall be limited to the items listed in Subsection
(B) and Subsection (D) of this Section and shall not include materials and other labor not
specifically identified above which shall be the sole responsibility of the participating property
owners.
If an abutting property owner should determine not to participate in the construction cost of a
sidewalk, the other participating property owners may determine a method by which that property
owner's share can be reapportioned and paid among all the participating property owners.
The City shall not let any bids and specifications for a sidewalk construction project until a petition
as described in Subsection (B) is received along with support documentation of a willingness to
undertake the cost of the sidewalk improvement project as outlined in the policy. If the participants
shall desire an estimate of the construction cost, a deposit of two hundred dollars ($200.00) shall
be made with the City prior to an engineer's estimate. The petitioners shall agree to forfeit the
deposit if the project is not pursued otherwise it shall be returned to the depositors following
completion of the project.
Sidewalks shall be built according to the construction standard established in Section 520.210 of
this Chapter.
No provisions of this policy shall apply to the construction of sidewalks along private rights-of-way
not dedicated to the City.
Section 520.140. Sidewalk Maintenance Program.
[R.O. 2010 §535.150; Ord. No. 10-90 §1, 8-6-1990]
The City of Glendale standards and procedures for maintaining existing sidewalks shall require
each step of this policy to be met as herein described.
The Board of Aldermen shall have the power to repair or reconstruct sidewalks (condemnation) to
keep a record of the costs, and to subsequently issue a tax bill against the property which
benefitted from the improvement as set out in Section 520.150 of this Chapter. All tax bills shall

bear an annual interest rate at the highest rate allowed by State Statute (currently eight percent
(8%)), for a maximum of ten (10) years.
All responsibility to repair or reconstruct sidewalks is assigned to private property owners per
Section 520.200 of this Chapter. Upon change of occupancy or altering of a public safety hazard,
the requirements of the Minimum Housing Code must also be met.
The Board of Aldermen shall have the power as outlined in Section 520.200 of this Chapter to
condemn defective sidewalks. The Board of Aldermen shall also have the power to cause new
sidewalks to be constructed thereat at the City's own expense in certain instances. These powers
shall be extended to sidewalk sections which are in need of repair whenever the City has caused
the damage, repairs were necessary in coordination with street repair or other public works
improvement projects, and all sidewalk sections directly abut a major arterial road maintained by
the City of Glendale. These sidewalks shall receive preferential treatment due to their location
which renders more exposure to excessive vehicular and foot traffic, and to undue hardship from
heavy salting and heavy vehicular traffic along the curb-line.
Except for condemnation by the City of Glendale, until a petition for removal has been submitted
to and approved by the Board of Aldermen, no sidewalk sections shall be permanently removed.
The City shall establish an annual program for replacing defective sidewalk sections for the benefit
of property owner participation. Requests for replacement shall be taken by the City until the end
of April each year. An approximate replacement cost will be provided to each resident. Each
resident shall provide their name, address, phone number, and a non-refundable fifty dollar
($50.00) deposit. Once all requests have been received the City shall bid the replacement work or
determine whether or not the City shall bid the replacement work or determine whether or not the
City shall provide the work. Once the exact amount of cost has been determined, residents shall
be required to deposit the full amount of the repair work by June first (1st) each year.
Sidewalks shall be built according to the construction standards established in Section 520.210 of
this Chapter unless modifications should be accepted so as to integrate any new sidewalk
sections with existing sections.
No provisions of this policy shall apply to the maintenance of sidewalks along private rights-of-way
not dedicated to the City.

Assessment of Costs.
[R.O. 2010 §535.160; CC 1970 §28-15; Ord. No. 36-87 §1, 12-7-1987]
If upon inspection, the Enforcement Official of the City shall determine that a sidewalk needs repair or
reconstruction, the affected property owner shall be notified and given ninety (90) days to make such
repair or reconstruction according to City specifications. If repair or reconstruction of the sidewalk is not
made following ninety (90) days, the officer or department may, without notice, cause such work to be
done, keeping accurate account of the cost thereof, and reporting the same to the Board of Aldermen
for assessment, and each lot or piece of ground abutting on such sidewalk or part thereof, shall be
liable for its share of the cost of such sidewalk as reported to the Board of Aldermen, and special tax
bills shall constitute a lien on the property liable therefore until paid.
Section 520.160. Interest on Special Tax Bills.
[R.O. 2010 §535.170; CC 1970 §28-16; Ord. No. 36-87 §2, 12-7-1987]

[R.O. 2010 §535.180; C.O. 1948 c. 7 §3-4; CC 1970 §28-17]
All costs of building and constructing sidewalks shall be paid to the contractor, when the work is done
under a contract, in special tax bills assessed against the abutting property liable therefor, but in no
event, and in no manner whatever, shall the City be liable to the contractor, or to any person, for or on
account of any work done which is not paid for in the manner provided in this Section.

[R.O. 2010 §535.190; CC 1970 §28-18; Ord. No. 36-87 §3, 12-7-1987]
Whenever the Board of Aldermen shall assess special taxes against any lot of ground for the
construction or reconstruction or repair of sidewalks, it shall be the duty of the City Clerk to make out a
separate special tax bill against each lot or piece of ground showing the name of the owner, the
number or description of the lot in front of, or along which, the sidewalk was built, the number of feet
abutting the sidewalk, the cost of materials and labor per foot for new construction, the cost of
materials for reconstruction, the total amount due, the number of the ordinance under which the work
was done and if done by contract, the number of the contract. The tax bill shall be issued in favor of the
City and the City Clerk shall deliver the same to the City Finance Officer and charge him/her therewith.
It shall be the duty of the City Finance Officer to promptly collect all such tax bills placed in his/her
hand, and pay the money into the City Treasury. If for any cause, he/she cannot collect any tax bill,
he/she shall report the same to the City Clerk and the Board of Aldermen and upon all such
uncollected bills, suits shall be brought by the City Attorney, in the name of the City as plaintiff, when
the Board of Aldermen shall so order.

[R.O. 2010 §535.220; CC 1970 §28-22]
The following are hereby approved and adopted as specifications for the building of all concrete
sidewalks in the City:
Width and thickness. Sidewalks shall be of one (1) course type construction and shall be four
(4) feet wide, unless otherwise approved by the Board of Aldermen, and shall be a minimum
thickness of five (5) inches except in driveways where the minimum thickness shall be six (6)
inches. Slope shall be one-fourth (¼) inch per foot of width from the back of the walk toward
the center line of the street.
Cement. All cement used for Portland cement concrete sidewalks shall conform to the latest
A.S.T.M. Designation for High-Early-Strength Cement. If concrete is mixed on the site of the
work, cement shall be delivered to the job in full sacks only, and each sack shall bear a legible
label of the manufacturer.
Fine aggregate. Fine aggregate shall be natural sand. It shall consist of hard, strong, durable,
uncoated particles and shall be free from mica in excess of five percent (5%). It shall be of
graded sizes ranging from one-fourth (¼) inch down to that which will be retained in a No. 100
Standard Sieve and shall be free from injurious impurities.
Course aggregate. The course aggregate shall be sound, hard, tough, durable and uncoated
particles. Crushed stone shall be obtained from rock of uniform quality and all course
aggregate shall have a French coefficient of wear of not less than six (6). It shall be free from
all foreign matter, uniformly graded and of sizes that will pass a two (2) inch screen and be
retained on a one-fourth (¼) inch screen.
Water. The water used in mixing concrete shall be clean, free from acids, oils, alkali and
vegetable matter.
Retempering. Retempering, that is the remixing with water after a mixture has partially
hardened, will not be permitted.
Grading. Excavating or grading shall be to a depth below the top or surface of the intended
pavement to the thickness of the finished walk and in exact conformity with the grade stakes
approved by the City Engineer. Any and all filling required to bring the subgrade to the proper
level shall be laid in thin layers and shall be thoroughly compacted. The embankment shall
have a slope of not more than one (1) to one (1) (forty-five degrees (45°) and shall at the top
extend at least twelve (12) inches beyond the side of the finished walk and reach a plane of
not lower than one (1) inch below the surface of the finished walk. The subgrade shall be
evenly and firmly rolled and compacted and all interstices filled with earth or approved
granular fill and the subgrade moistened before the concrete shall be placed on same. If an
earth fill has been made it shall be allowed a sufficient time to settle and become firm.
Forms. All forms shall be straight, free from warp and of sufficient strength, when staked, to
resist the pressure of the concrete without springing. They shall be thoroughly cleaned and
greased before the concrete is placed against them. Forms shall be neatly and tightly joined,
securely staked to line and grade and expansion joints placed before any of the concrete is
placed. Before placement of any concrete, all forms shall have the approval of the City
Engineer and any concrete placed without such approval shall be removed at the contractor's
expense.
Joints. The sidewalk shall be marked with dummy joints at not less than four (4) nor more
than six (6) foot intervals and every sixth (6th) joint shall be made by placing between the
forms, at right angles to the forms, one-half (½) inch premolded asphalt expansion joint, made
to the cross-section of the walk. Where the walk is placed against the curb, a one-half (½)
inch premolded expansion joint, the depth of the walk, shall be placed between the sidewalk
and the curb. Where walks fill a space between a wall or building and a curb, a one-half (½)

inch premolded expansion joint shall be placed between the sidewalk and the wall or building
and the sidewalk and curb. Sidewalks placed against concrete curbs shall have joints
matching those of the curb as nearly as practicable. One-half (½) inch expansion joints shall
be placed on all sides of the squares formed by intersecting sidewalks or driveways.
Proportions for concrete. The concrete mixture for all sidewalks shall be proportioned by
volume so that a cubic yard of finished concrete contains not less than six (6) bags of cement
(ninety-four pounds (94 lbs.) each net). The proportion of fine and course aggregate shall be
varied to produce the most dense concrete obtainable. The volume of water used in gauging
the mix shall not exceed six and one-half (6½) gallons of water per bag of cement. The
method employed to measure the water shall be such as to take into full account the amount
of water contained in the fine and course aggregate. When the amount of walk to be
constructed is so small as to make it impracticable to make the tests necessary to proportion
the mix as above specified, the following arbitrary proportions shall be applied:
Bags of
Cement
Cubic Feet
of Sand
Cubic Feet of Coarse
Aggregate
For 1 inch gravel aggregate 1 2.5 3.2
For 2 inch gravel aggregate 1 2.3 3.4
For 1 inch stone aggregate 1 3.0 2.9
For 2 inch stone aggregate 1 2.7 3.1
Measurements of aggregate are by damp loose volume.
Mixing and placing concrete. All concrete shall be thoroughly mixed in a rotary batch mixer.
The period of mixing shall not be less than two (2) minutes after all ingredients have been
placed in the mixer. Mixed concrete shall be of uniform consistency and the mixing period
shall be increased if necessary to acquire thoroughly mixed concrete. Concrete shall be
transported to the forms in clean wheelbarrows or troughs and placed in the forms by
dumping, care being taken not to mix the concrete with the subgrade material.
Finish. The concrete shall be carefully tamped in place and finished without the addition of
mortar. Joints shall be edged and the walk shall be finished by belting and floating. When
necessary dry mortar mixed in the same proportion as the mortar in the concrete may be
sprinkled on the surface to aid in the finishing.
Protection. When completed the walk shall be kept moist and protected from traffic and the
elements for at least three (3) days. Forms shall remain in place for twenty-four (24) hours
and immediately upon their removal the spaces on either side of the sidewalk shall be filled
with suitable material. Chemical curing agents may be used provided it is applied according to
the manufacture's specifications and the type selected by the contractor has been approved
by the City Engineer.

from the site of the work as the excavation is made and no such materials shall be allowed to
accumulate on the site.
After the pipe or conduit has been properly placed, backfill to a depth of one (1) foot above the
extrados, as required by the Metropolitan Sewer District, shall be made.
In all areas which do not require granular backfill, job excavated material may be used. It shall be
free from debris, organic matter, perishable compressible materials and shall contain no rock or
lumps or stone fragments larger than four (4) inches, nor be in such amount that will interfere with
the consolidation properties of the fill material. Care shall be taken that stones, rocks or lumps
shall be kept separated. Such fill shall be placed in layers not to exceed six (6) inches in depth
and each layer shall be compacted with mechanical tampers.
Granular backfill shall consist of molder's sand which is free from excessive amounts of
consolidated masses, and unwashed river sand. Granular backfill shall be free from wood, paper,
cans, ashes or other weak and unstable, perishable materials and from such quantities of clay or
loam, either finely divided or in lumps, as will interfere with free flowing and compacting properties
of the composite fill.
Other types of granular backfill material may be used only upon approval of the material by the
City, samples having been furnished, and the City may reject this or any type of granular backfill
during the process of the work if in the opinion of the City, it is not of such quality to be acceptable.
Pea gravel or similar granular materials approximately uniform in size and without bonding
properties, shall not be used.
Granular backfill consisting of unwashed river sand or spent molder's sand shall be consolidated
by inundation with water, using flooding and poling, jetting and immersion type vibrators, or by any
other method which achieves thorough compaction, however should thorough compaction not be
achieved, then consolidation by inundation with water shall be required.
If granular backfill material other than sand or spent molder's sand is used, it shall be placed in the
trench in layers not more than twelve (12) inches in thickness, before compaction, and thoroughly
compacted with suitable mechanical tampers.

All paving for streets, shoulders, alleys, driveways, sidewalks, etc., either removed or damaged by
the excavator in his/her operations, shall be replaced in a condition at least equal to its original
state. This replacement shall include the replacement of all base courses, curb and other
incidental items. Asphalt type pavements shall be replaced with a macadam base course, a
minimum thickness of seven (7) inches after thorough compaction and covered with a minimum
thickness of two (2) inches, of an approved bituminous type surface material (surface material
shall conform in kind to that existing) finished off and compacted level and flush with the existing
paving. Cement concrete pavements shall be replaced with a concrete (Class A) slab of the
thickness of that removed, but in no case less than six (6) inches, finished off level and flush with
surrounding existing pavements.
In grassed areas the sod shall be removed in such manner that after backfilling is accomplished,
the top six (6) inches being good, clean dirt, it may be replaced, watered and rolled in such a
manner as to give, as near as practicable, an undisturbed appearance.
