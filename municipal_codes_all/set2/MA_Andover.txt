of one year. At each annual town election thereafter the voters shall elect
in place of those selectmen whose terms are about to expire a like number

the next town election appoint a qualified person to serve as selectman until
such election, at which election the voters shall elect a selectman to serve
for the unexpired portion, if any, of the original term. The selectmen in office
at the time of said first election shall continue in office until their successors
are elected and qualified.
The Board of Selectmen shall be considered the makers of policy of the
Town government, except as otherwise directed by Statutes or by the
Town Charter. The Town Manager shall be responsible for ensuring that
the boards, officers and representatives of the Town comply with policy
determinations of the Selectmen.

commission existing at the time of such acceptance and terminated
hereunder shall continue until such first town election and until the

The number of members of boards, commissions and committees so
appointed as provided in the preceding section, the length of the term of

manager shall possess all the powers and rights and shall be subject to all
the duties and liabilities specifically conferred or imposed by any applicable
provision of law upon them or upon officers, boards, commissions or
committees having corresponding powers and duties, but in the
performance thereof they shall be subject to the general supervision of the
town manager.
In the Charter, words in the masculine gender shall be interpreted to
include the feminine gender. [Amended 4-28-2003 ATM, Art. 21;

§ 5. Multiple Offices.
A member of the board of selectmen, or of the school committee, or of
the finance committee, shall during the term for which he was elected
or appointed, be ineligible to hold any other elective or appointive town
office or position. Any person elected or appointed to any other office,
board, commission or committee under the provisions of this act or of
any general or special law, shall be eligible, during his term of office,
for election or appointment to any other town office, board, commission
or committee, except that the town accountant shall not be eligible to
hold the office of the town treasurer or town collector. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, whenever the town shall undertake to construct or improve
a school building or property, one member of the school committee and
an administrative representative of the superintendent of schools shall
be appointed by the school committee to serve on the school building
committee to which the planning and construction or acquisition of such
school building or property is delegated. [Amended 10-23-1996 STM,
Art. 14; approved by Chapter 50 of the Acts of 1997]
Subject to the approval of the selectmen the town manager may, but without

such assumption to be evidenced by and effective upon the filing with the
town clerk of a written declaration of such assumption signed by the town

7-24-2004.
§ 4 TOWN CHARTER § 5
Charter:3
manager, except he shall not appoint himself as a member of any board or
committee.
§ 6. Appointment of Town Manager.
The selectmen shall appoint, as soon as practicable after the first town
election following acceptance of this act or after the occurrence of any
vacancy, for a term of five years, a town manager who shall be a person
especially fitted by education, training and previous full-time paid
experience in a responsible administrative position in municipal
government, to perform the duties of his office. The town manager shall be
appointed without regard to his political beliefs. He need not be a resident
of the town when appointed, but shall be a resident of the town during his
term of office. He may be appointed for successive terms of office. No holder
of elective office in the town shall within five years of holding such office be
eligible for appointment as town manager. Before entering upon the duties
of his office the town manager shall be sworn to the faithful and impartial
performance thereof by the town clerk, or by a justice of the peace. He shall
execute a bond in favor of the town for the faithful performance of his duties
in such sum and with such surety or sureties as may be fixed or approved
by the selectmen, the premium for said bond to be paid by the town.
§ 7. Acting Manager.
The town manager may designate, by letter filed with the town clerk, a
qualified officer of the town to perform his duties during his temporary
absence or disability. Pending the appointment of a town manager or the
filling of any vacancy or the failure of the town manager to designate a
temporary manager, or during the suspension of the town manager, the
selectmen shall appoint a suitable person to perform the duties of the office.
§ 8. Removal of Manager.
The selectmen, by a majority vote of the full membership of the board, may
remove the town manager. At least 30 days before such proposed removal
shall become effective, the selectmen shall file a preliminary resolution with
the town clerk setting forth in detail the specific reasons for the proposed
removal, a copy of which resolution shall be sent by registered mail to the
town manager. The manager may reply in writing to the resolution and may
request a public hearing. If the manager so requests, the board of selectmen
shall hold a public hearing not earlier than 20 days nor later than 30 days
after the filing of such request. After such public hearing, if any, otherwise
at the expiration of 30 days following the filing of the preliminary resolution,
and after full consideration, the selectmen, by a majority vote of the full
membership of the board, may adopt a final resolution of removal. In the
preliminary resolution, the selectmen may suspend the manager from duty,
but in any case his salary shall continue to be paid until the expiration of
one month after the date of the final resolution of removal.
§ 5 ANDOVER CODE § 9
Charter:4
§ 9. Compensation of Manager.
The town manager shall receive such compensation for his services as the
selectmen shall determine, but it shall not exceed the amount appropriated
therefor by the town.
§ 10. Powers and Duties of Manager.
In addition to other powers and duties expressly provided for in this act, the
town manager shall have the following powers and duties:
The town manager shall supervise and direct and shall be responsible
for the efficient administration of all offices, boards and committees
appointed by him and their respective departments. He shall, in
addition, supervise and direct and shall be responsible for the efficient
administration of any agency or activity of the town not subject to his
appointment or control, including the Andover Housing Authority, but
only at such time and to such extent and for such period as the elected
officials having control of such agency or activity may, with the consent
of the selectmen, determine.
(a)
The town manager, in accordance with the provisions of this act and
except as otherwise expressly prohibited by the General Laws, may
reorganize, consolidate or abolish departments, commissions, boards
or offices under his direction and supervision, in whole or in part,
may establish such new departments, commissions, boards or offices
as he deems necessary, and in so doing, may transfer the duties and
powers, and, so far as possible in accordance with the vote of the town,
the appropriation of one department, commission, board or office to
another.
(b)
The town manager shall fix the compensation of all town officers and
employees appointed by him, subject to any applicable provisions of
chapter 31 of the General Laws.
(c)
The town manager shall keep full and complete records of his office and
shall render as often as may be required by the selectmen a full report
of all operations during the period reported on.
(d)
The town manager shall keep the selectmen fully advised as to the
needs of the town, and shall recommend to the selectmen for adoption
such measures requiring action by them or by the town as he may deem
necessary or expedient.
(e)
The town manager shall have jurisdiction over the rental and use
of all town property, except schools. He shall be responsible for the
maintenance and repairs of all town property, except school buildings
and grounds. He shall be responsible for the preparation of plans and
the supervision of work on all construction, reconstruction, alterations,
improvements and other undertakings authorized by the town, subject,
however, to the approval of the school committee with respect to plans
for the construction or improvement of school buildings or property.
(f)
§ 9 TOWN CHARTER § 10
Charter:5
§ 11. Investigation of Claims.
Whenever any pay roll, bill or other claim against the town is presented
to the town manager, he shall, if the same seems to him to be of doubtful
validity, excessive in amount, or otherwise contrary to the interests of
the town, refer it to the selectmen, who shall immediately investigate
the facts and determine what, if any, payment should be made. Pending
such investigation and determination by the selectmen, payment shall be
withheld.
§ 12. Approval of Warrants.
The town manager shall be the chief fiscal officer of the town. Warrants for
the payment of town funds prepared by the town accountant, in accordance
with the provisions of section 56 of chapter 41 of the General Laws, shall
be submitted to the town manager. The approval of any such warrant by the
town manager, or in his absence the acting town manager, shall be sufficient
authority to authorize payment by the town treasurer, but the selectmen
shall approve all warrants in the event of the absence of the town manager,
acting town manager or a vacancy in the office of town manager.
The town manager shall administer, either directly or through a person
or persons appointed by him in accordance with this act, all provisions
of general and special laws applicable to said town, all by-laws and all
regulations established by the selectmen.
(g)
The town manager shall, with the approval of the selectmen, have the
authority to prosecute, defend or compromise all litigation to which the
town is a party.
(h)
The town manager shall perform such other duties consistent with his
office as may be required of him by the by-laws or vote of the town or
by the vote of the selectmen.
(i)
The town manager shall have access to all town books and papers for
information necessary for the proper performance of his duties, and
may, without notice, cause the affairs of any department or activity
under his control, or the conduct of any officer or employee thereof, to
be examined.
(j)
The town manager shall purchase all supplies, materials and equipment
except library books and related printed and audio-visual material, and
shall award all contracts for all departments and activities of the town
under his supervision; and he shall make all purchases, except school
text-books, for departments or activities not under his supervision but
only upon and in accordance with a requisition duly signed by the head
of any such department.
(k)
§ 10 ANDOVER CODE § 13
Charter:6
§ 13. Fees paid to Treasury.
The aggregate compensation of each town officer or employee appointed by
the town manager shall be limited to the amount established in accordance
with the provisions of this act, and all fees received in accordance with the
provisions of any general or special law shall be paid into the treasury of
the town.
§ 14. Certain Officers not to make Contracts with the Town.
It shall be unlawful for any selectman, the town manager, or any other
elective or appointive official of the town, directly or indirectly, to make a
contract with the town, or to receive any reward from, or any share in the
profits of, any person or corporation making or performing such contract,
unless the official concerned, immediately upon learning of the existence of
such contract, or that such a contract is proposed, shall notify the selectmen
and the town manager, by registered mail, of the contract and of the nature
of his interest therein, and shall abstain from doing any official act on behalf
of the town in reference thereto. In case such interest exists on the part of
an officer whose duty it is to make such a contract on behalf of the town,
the contract may be made by another officer of the town duly authorized
thereto by vote of the selectmen. Violation of any provision of this section
shall render the contract in respect to which such violation occurs voidable
at the option of the town. Any person violating any provision of this section
shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by imprisonment for
not more than one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment.
§ 15. Estimate of Expenditures.
All boards, officers and committees, of the town shall annually, at the
request of the town manager, submit to him in writing a detailed estimate
of the appropriations required for the efficient and proper conduct of their
respective departments and offices during the next fiscal year. On or before
a date established by a Town By-Law, the town manager shall submit to each
member of the finance committee and of the board of selectmen a copy of
his annual budget, which shall contain a careful, detailed estimate of the
probable expenditures of the town for the ensuing fiscal year, including a
statement of the amounts required to meet the interest and maturing bonds
and notes or other indebtedness of the town, and showing specifically the
amount necessary to be provided for each office, department and activity,
together with a statement of the expenditures for the same purposes in the
two preceding years and an estimate of expenditures for the current year.
He shall also submit a statement showing all revenues received by the town
in the two preceding years, together with an estimate of the receipts of
the current year and an estimate of the amount of income from all sources
of revenue exclusive of taxes upon property in the ensuing year. He shall
also report to said committee and to the selectmen the probable amount
required to be levied and raised by taxation to defray all of the proposed
expenditures and liabilities of the town, together with an estimate of the tax
rate necessary therefor.
§ 13 TOWN CHARTER § 16
Charter:7
§ 16. By-Laws, Rules, etc.
All laws, by-laws, votes, rules and regulations in force in the town of
Andover on the effective date of this act, or any portion thereof, not
inconsistent with its provisions, whether enacted by authority of the town
or any other authority, shall continue in full force and effect until otherwise
provided by law, by-law or vote; all other laws, by-laws, votes, rules and
regulations, so far as they refer to the town of Andover, are hereby repealed
and annulled, but such repeal shall not revive any pre-existing enactment.
§ 17. Contracts.
No contract existing and no action at law or suit in equity, or other
proceeding pending at the time this act is accepted, or at the time of
revocation of such acceptance, shall be affected by such acceptance or
revocation.
§ 18. Submission of Act and Time of Taking Effect.
This act shall be submitted for acceptance to the qualified voters of the
town of Andover at the first annual town election after passage of this
act. The vote shall be taken by ballot in accordance with the provisions
of the General Laws, so far as the same shall be applicable, in answer to
the following question, which shall be placed upon the ballot to be used at
said election: "Shall an act passed by the General Court in the year 1956
entitled 'An act establishing a selectmen-town manager plan for the town
of Andover' be accepted by the town?" If a majority of the voters voting on
this question vote in the affirmative, said act shall take effect immediately
for the purpose of the next annual town election, and for all things relating
thereto, and shall take full effect beginning with said following election. It
shall be the duty of all town officials having to do with elections and holding
office at the time of acceptance to do, in compliance with law, all things
necessary for the nomination and election of officers first to be elected
under this act.
If this act is rejected when first submitted it shall again be submitted at
the next following annual town election, and if accepted shall take effect as
hereinbefore provided.
If this act is rejected for the second time it shall be again submitted at the
annual town election in the year 1959, and if accepted shall take effect as
hereinbefore provided. If this act is again rejected when so submitted for
the third time, it shall thereupon become void.
§ 19. Revocation of Acceptance.
At any time after the expiration of three years from the date of acceptance
of this act, and not less than 90 days before the date of an annual meeting,
a petition signed by not less than 10% of the registered voters of the town
may be filed with the selectmen, requesting that the question of revoking
the acceptance of this act be submitted to the voters. No such petition shall
§ 16 ANDOVER CODE § 19
Charter:8
be valid unless notice thereof shall be published by the selectmen for at
least two consecutive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in
the town, the last publication to be at least 30 days prior to said annual
meeting. The selectmen shall thereupon direct the town clerk to cause the
said question to be printed on the official ballot to be used at the next annual
election in the following form: "Shall the acceptance by the town of Andover
of an act passed by the General Court in the year 1956, entitled 'An act
establishing a selectmen-town manager plan for the town of Andover' be
revoked?" If such revocation is favored by a majority of the voters voting
thereon, this act shall cease to be operative on and after the annual meeting
next following such vote. All general laws respecting town administration
and town officers, and any special laws relative to said town, the operation
of which has been suspended or superseded by acceptance of this act, shall
be revived by such revocation and shall continue to be in full force and
effect. By-laws, votes, rules and regulations in force when such revocation
takes effect, so far as they are consistent with the general laws respecting
town administration and town officers and with special laws relating to said
town, shall not be affected thereby, but any other by-laws, votes, rules and
regulations inconsistent with such general or special laws shall be annulled.
If such revocation is not favored by a majority of the voters voting thereon,
no further petition therefor shall be filed under this section oftener than
once in every three years thereafter.

SECTION 1.0
PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY
1.1. PURPOSE.
The purpose of this by-law is to provide for the town all protection and
advantages of zoning restrictions and regulations as authorized by G.L. c.
40A, as from time to time amended, and as set forth in Section 2A of 1975
Mass. Acts 808.
1.2. AUTHORITY.
This Zoning By-Law is enacted in accordance with but not limited to, the
provisions of G.L. c. 40A, and any and all amendments thereto, and by
Article 89 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts.
1.3. SCOPE.
The construction, repair, alteration, reconstruction, height, number of
stories, and size of buildings and structures, the size and width of lots,
the percentage of lot area that may be occupied, the size of yards, courts,
and other open spaces, the density of population, and the location and use
of buildings, structures, and land in the town are regulated as hereinafter
provided.
1.4. APPLICABILITY.
All buildings or structures hereinafter erected, reconstructed, altered,
enlarged, or moved, and the use of all premises in the town, shall be in
conformity with the provisions of the Zoning By-Law. No building, structure
or land shall be used for any purpose or in any manner other than is
specifically permitted within the district in which such building, structure
or land is located. Where the application of this by-law imposes greater
restrictions than those imposed by any other regulations, permits,
restrictions, easements, covenants, or agreements, the provisions of this bylaw
shall control.
1.5. AMENDMENTS.
This by-law may from time to time be changed by amendment, addition, or
repeal by the Town Meeting in the manner provided in G.L. c. 40A, s. 5, and
any amendments thereto.
The owner of land proposed for changed use by means of an amendment to
the Zoning By-Law may, with Planning Board approval, record a covenant
running with the land which places greater restrictions than embodied in
the by-law, upon all or a portion of the proposed use zone to be effective only
if the Town Meeting action on the proposed amendment is affirmative. The
Town Clerk shall certify to the Registrar of Deeds as to whether the action
of the Town Meeting was affirmative or negative.

SECTION 2.0
DISTRICTS
2.1. ESTABLISHMENT. [Amended 5-8-2013 ATM, Art. 50]
For the purposes of this by-law, the town is hereby divided into the types of
zoning districts set forth below:
Residence Districts:
SRA  Single Residence A
SRB  Single Residence B
SRC  Single Residence C
APT  Apartment
Business Districts:
LS  Limited Service
OP  Office Park
GB  General Business
MU  Mixed Use
Industrial Districts:
IG  General Industrial
IA  Industrial A
ID  Industrial D
ID2  Industrial 2
2.2. OVERLAY DISTRICTS. [Amended 5-7-2013 ATM, Art. 27;
5-12-2014 ATM, Art. 37; 5-4-2015 ATM, Art. 49]
Overlay districts shall be superimposed on other districts established by
this by-law. Any land lying within such overlay districts shall also be subject
to and have the benefit of the development and use regulations for the
applicable underlying district(s) and shall, in addition, conform to the
additional regulations of the one or more overlay districts in which the land
lies. In the event of any conflict between the regulations of two or more
overlay districts which apply to the same lot of land, or in the event of
conflict between an underlying district(s) and an overlay district affecting
it, the conflict shall be resolved by applying the most restrictive regulations.
The following overlay districts are hereby established and described in
Section 8.0:
Flood Hazard Overlay District
Watershed Protection Overlay District
Senior Residential Community Overlay District
Medical Marijuana Overlay District
2.1 TOWN CHARTER 2.2
Charter:59
Historic Mill District
2.3. ZONING MAP.
The boundaries of districts set forth in Section 2.1 are located and
described by detailed written descriptions and/or by delineation on Zoning
Maps on file in the Office of the Planning Board, which descriptions and
delineations shall be deemed a part of the by-law. Where detailed written
descriptions and a Zoning Map each intend to describe the same boundary
of a district and in so doing one appears to conflict with or differ from
the other, then in all such cases the detailed written description shall be
conclusive and prevail over the Zoning Map.
2.3.1. Map Amendments.
Any changes in the boundaries or location of zoning districts shall be made
by the same procedure as an amendment to the text of the Zoning By-Law.
See Section 1.5.
2.4. RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT
BOUNDARIES.
The following rules shall apply for the interpretation of district boundaries:
2.4.1. Lots Along Town Boundaries.
When a lot is situated in part of the Town of Andover and in part in an
adjacent city or town, the regulations and restrictions of the by-law shall be
applied to that portion of such lot as lies in the Town of Andover in the same
manner as if the entire lot were situated therein.
2.4.2. Lots Split by Zoning Boundary.
Where a boundary line between zoning districts divides a lot, the
dimensional and use regulations of the less regulated zoning district shall
be applicable to that part of the lot located in the more regulated district
which lies within 30 feet of the zoning district boundary. The portion of
the lot which falls beyond 30 feet shall be required to comply with the
dimensional and use regulations of the more regulated district. For this
purpose, for example, a single residence district is deemed more regulated
than a business district and an industrial district; and a business district
more regulated than an industrial district. The Inspector of Buildings shall
determine, as to sub-districts within each principal district, which subdistrict
is the less regulated sub-district and which is the more regulated.

use authorized as a principal use by special permit may also be authorized
as an accessory use by special permit. Any use not allowed in the district
as a principal use is also prohibited as an accessory use. Accessory uses
are permitted only in accordance with lawfully existing principal uses. In

3.3. NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES.
3.3.1. Applicability.
This Zoning By-Law shall not apply to structures or uses lawfully in
existence or lawfully begun, or to a building or special permit issued before
the first publication of notice of the public hearing required by G.L. c. 40A,
s. 5 at which this Zoning By-Law, and any amendments, were adopted. Such
prior, lawfully existing nonconforming uses and structures may continue,
provided that no modification of the use or structure is accomplished, unless
authorized hereunder.
3.3.2. Nonconforming Uses.
The Board of Appeals may grant a special permit to change a
nonconforming use in accordance with this section only if it determines that
such change or extension shall not be substantially more detrimental than
the existing nonconforming use to the neighborhood. The following types of
changes to nonconforming uses may be considered by the Board of Appeals:
3.3.3. Nonconforming Structures.
The Board of Appeals may grant a special permit to reconstruct, extend,
alter, or change a nonconforming structure other than single or two-family
dwellings in accordance with this section only if it determines that such
reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change shall not be substantially
more detrimental than the existing nonconforming structure to the
neighborhood. The following types of changes to nonconforming structures
may be considered by the Board of Appeals:
such parking will not, under the circumstances, be detrimental to
the neighborhood;
a.
such use may be permitted subject to conditions deemed necessary

Charter:63
3.3.4. Variance Required.
Except as provided in Section 3.3.5, below, the reconstruction, extension or
structural change of a nonconforming structure other than single or twofamily
dwellings in such a manner as to increase an existing nonconformity,
or create a new nonconformity shall require the grant of a variance by
the Board of Appeals. For the purposes of this section, the extension of an
exterior wall at or along the same nonconforming distance within a required
yard shall require the grant of a variance by the Board of Appeals.
3.3.5. Nonconforming Single and Two Family Residential
Structures.
Nonconforming single and two family residential structures may be
reconstructed, extended, altered, or structurally changed upon a
determination by the Inspector of Buildings that such proposed
reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change does not increase the
nonconforming nature of said structure. The following circumstances,
individually or in combination, shall not be deemed to increase the
nonconforming nature of said structure:
3.3.6. Abandonment or Non-Use.
A nonconforming use or structure which has been abandoned, or not used
for a period of two years, shall lose its protected status and be subject to all
of the provisions of this Zoning By-Law.
3.3.7. Catastrophe or Demolition.
Any nonconforming structure may be reconstructed after a fire, explosion
or other catastrophe, or after demolition, provided that such reconstruction
is completed within 24 months after such catastrophe or demolition, and
Alteration to a structure which complies with all current setback and
building height requirements on a Lot with insufficient area, where the
alteration will also comply with all of said current requirements.
1.
Alteration to a structure which complies with all current setback and
building height requirements on a lot with insufficient frontage, where
the alteration will also comply with all of said current requirements.
2.
Alteration to a structure which presently encroaches upon one or more
required setback areas, where the alteration will comply with all
current setback, yard and building height requirements.
In the event that the Inspector of Buildings determines that the
nonconforming nature of such structure would be increased by the
proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change, the Board of
Appeals may, by special permit, allow such reconstruction, extension,
alteration, or change where it determines that the proposed
modification will not be substantially more detrimental than the
existing nonconforming structure to the neighborhood.
3.
3.3.4 ANDOVER CODE 3.3.7
Charter:64
provided that the building(s) as reconstructed shall be only as great in
volume or area as the original nonconforming structure unless a larger
volume or area is authorized by special permit from the Board of Appeals.
Such time for reconstruction may be extended by the Board of Appeals for
good cause.
3.3.8. Reversion to Nonconformity.
No nonconforming use shall, if changed to a conforming use, revert to a
nonconforming use.

meet or exceed the minimum requirements specified in the Table of
Dimensional Requirements, except where otherwise provided herein or
where the premises are otherwise governed by the provisions of Chapter
40A of the General Laws. Except as otherwise provided for in this bylaw,
not more than one building designed or available for use for dwelling
purposes shall be erected or converted to use as such on any lot, parcel, or
tract of land in the town.
4.1.2. Table of Dimensional Requirements.
Except as provided elsewhere in this by-law, all buildings and structures
shall conform to the Table of Dimensional Requirements, as set forth in
Appendix A, Table 2.
4.1.3. Exceptions and Special Requirements.

no adjoining single residence district, the requirements of the nearest
single residence district shall apply.
1.
Yards.
Each lot shall have a width of not less than 80% of the required
frontage at all points between the street line along which the
frontage of the lot is measured and the furthest point of the rear
wall of the dwelling upon such lot. Such width shall be measured
along lines which are parallel to the street line.
a.
The minimum yard depth requirements shall not apply in any
district to covered or uncovered stairs, small bays, bay windows,
eaves or cornices, provided that the same are unenclosed and do

13.Editor's Note: This article amended Section 4.1.3.b of the Zoning By-Law rather than
Section 4.1.3.2.b. This incorrect reference to Section 4.1.3.6 was corrected to Section
4.1.3.2.6 by Art. 50 of the 5-2-2005 ATM.
4.1 TOWN CHARTER 4.1.3
Charter:67
The yard depth from an existing way is to be measured from the
right-of-way line where a plan of the way is on file with the Registry
of Deeds or Land Court, or Town Clerk's office or, in the absence of
such a plan or if such way is less than 40 feet wide, from a line 20
feet from and parallel with the center line of the traveled way as
determined by the Town Engineer.
c.
In SRA, SRB, and SRC districts, where other buildings exist within
200 feet on both sides of the lot in question and within the same
block and district, the principal structure may extend as near
the way as the average setback of said other buildings; but if
such other buildings are setback more than 30 feet from the way,
the principal structure shall not extend nearer said way than the
average setback of such other buildings.
d.
In the case of lots abutting on more than one way, the minimum
front yard depth requirement shall be applicable to each such way,
but such lots shall be required to have the minimum frontage
on only one such way. In addition, one minimum side yard depth
requirement and one minimum rear yard depth requirement shall
be applicable to the lot and determined at the time of building
permit issuance. The provisions of this Zoning By-Law amendment
shall not apply to those lots approved prior to the adoption of this
amendment pursuant to the provisions of G.L. c. 40A and c. 41 and
the Rules and Regulations governing the Subdivision of Land in the
Town of Andover.
e.
In the case of lots which abut on a limited access highway, the
minimum yard depth requirement from such highway shall be the
same as the applicable side or rear yard minimum depth.
f.
No fence or sign shall be erected or installed and no trees, shrubs
or other growth shall be planted or permitted to grow or exist
in any district requiring a minimum front yard depth which will
dangerously obstruct the view of traffic by operators of vehicles at
street intersections. This requirement shall be deemed to include,
but not be limited to, any such obstruction which is more than
three feet and less than eight feet above the grade of the adjoining
way, and is located within an area bounded by the side lines of the
intersecting ways and the line joining points on such ways 25 feet
from the intersections of such side lines or the intersections of the
side lines projected so as to interfere with traffic visibility across
the corner.
g.
When the distance between any two points on lot lines is less
than 50 feet, measured in a straight line (the threshold line), the
smaller portion of the lot which is bounded by such straight line
and such lot lines beyond the threshold line shall not be considered
in computing the minimum lot area unless the cumulative distance
along such lot lines between such two points and including the
threshold line is less than 150 feet.

Building Height.
The limitation on height of buildings shall not apply in any district
to chimneys, ventilators, towers, silos, spires or other ornamental
features of buildings, which features are in no way used for living
purposes and do not constitute more than 25% of the ground floor
area of the building.
a.
Buildings in any residence district or the Apartment District used
for municipal or educational purposes may be three stories in
height but not in excess of 45 feet. [Amended 4-28-2010 ATM,
Art. 54]
b.
3.
Lots Resulting from Public Acquisition. Public acquisition of any portion
of a lot for the purpose of laying out or altering a public road shall
not be construed to render the resulting lot or existing structures upon
it to be dimensionally nonconforming or to disqualify the resulting lot
for separate sale or for otherwise legal building, provided that the
width of the strip thus acquired does not exceed 10 feet. Front yard
and coverage requirements on any such lot shall be measured from
the street right-of-way line in existence immediately prior to the public
acquisition.
4.
Apartment Districts.
The minimum lot area and frontage requirements shall be the same
as applies to the adjoining single residence sharing the longest
common boundary. In the event there is no adjoining single
residence district, the requirements of the nearest single residence
district shall apply.
a.
For multiple dwellings, there shall be at least 3,500 square feet of
lot area for each dwelling unit. See Section 7.6.3 of this by-law.
b.
1.
Business Districts (LS, OP, GB, MU).
No building in a business district shall be erected or expanded
within 15 feet of a building containing a residential use, regardless
of the zoning district in which said building containing a residential
use is located.
a.
In the General Business District, the front setback shall be the
average front setback of existing buildings on the block.

driveways, tanks, loading bays, outdoor storage or work areas and
similar accessory operations, located or to be located on a lot in
nonresidential use, if said lot in nonresidential use abuts a lot in
residential use within said Industrial A or Industrial D or Office
Park District, or if said lot in nonresidential use abuts a lot zoned
Single Residence A or B or C, or if said lot in nonresidential use
abuts a public or private way which itself abuts in whole or in part
a Single Residence A or B or C District.
In Industrial A and Industrial 2 and Industrial D and Office Park
Districts, no nonresidential structure shall be erected nearer than
300 feet to the outside wall of any existing dwelling, regardless of
the zoning district in which said dwelling is situated, and whether
or not a public or private way lies within said 300 feet. [Amended
5-8-2013 ATM, Art. 50]
b.
In the case of lots which are located in industrial districts and
abut railroad property, the minimum yard depth requirement from
such railroad property shall not apply if a railroad siding is to be
constructed.
c.
In all industrial districts, yard depth requirements will be
measured from the street line of a public way or internal access
road, whichever is applicable.
d.
In the Industrial D District, required yard areas shall be developed
and maintained only for lawns, landscaping, walks, driveways and
parking areas; provided, however, that no parking area shall be
located within 50 feet of the street line of any public way or internal
access road on which the building fronts unless a special permit to
reduce this requirement is granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals
upon its determination that circumstances of the site and its design
provide control of visual intrusion and traffic comparable to the
usual application of this requirement.
e.
In the case of a lot located in an Industrial A District, the maximum
height of a building thereon shall be four occupiable stories, but
not in excess of 60 occupiable feet or 80 total feet, provided that
existing municipal water pressure must be sufficient for adequate
water supply to reach the portion of the building in excess of
60 feet for both fire protection and service needs without any
artificial means to increase existing municipal pressure; and the
space above 60 feet (as height is measured in accordance with this
by-law) shall be:
used solely for building mechanicals, heating, ventilation and
air conditioning, utilities and other building services uses;
1.
setback at least 10 feet on all sides from the outside face of the
top story of the building; and

be at least 1,000 feet from the district boundary line of any
residence district.

subdivision, the Board shall give particular attention to, and may use as a
basis for its decision, the following criteria:
Conveyance. Such open land shall either be conveyed to the Town of
Andover and accepted by it for park or open space use or be conveyed
to a nonprofit organization, the principal purpose of which is the
conservation of open space, or be conveyed to a corporation or trust
owned or to be owned by the owners of lots or residential units within
the plan, articles of corporation or trust to be legally drawn up and
available for review by Planning Board prior to final approval of the
plan. If such a corporation or trust is utilized, ownership thereof shall
pass with conveyances of the lots or residential units. In any case where
such land is not conveyed to the town, a restriction enforceable by the
Town of Andover shall be recorded providing that such land shall be
kept in an open or natural state and not be built upon or developed for
accessory uses such as parking or roadway. All such open space shall
be restricted by deed from all future building. Before final approval
of the special permit by the Planning Board, the developer shall state
which of the three conveyance options above is being proposed, and
such disposition, if approved, shall be recorded as a restriction on the
development plan.

7.4.4. Assisted Living Residences  Affordability.
Except as provided in Sections 7.4.4.6 and 7.4.4.10, 15% of the total
number of assisted living units shall be set aside as affordable housing units
for elderly persons who qualify as low, moderate, or upper-moderate income
persons as defined as follows:
Low income: below 60% of the Lawrence Standard Metropolitan
Statistical Area (SMSA) median income based on Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) figures ("median income").
Moderate income: 60-79% of median income.
Upper-moderate income: 80-100% of median income.
dumpster locations and loading areas except for their points of ingress
and egress, shall be 15 feet.
In determining the total number of affordable units required, a
fractional unit of 0.5 or more shall be regarded as a whole unit. To
the extent legally permissible, the affordable units shall be offered to
eligible Andover residents before being offered to non-Andover eligible
elderly persons.
1.
Such affordable units may be rented, sold or otherwise provided to
qualified elderly persons in accordance with income and asset
limitations established by the authorizing state or federal agency in
those instances where the affordable units benefit directly from such
assistance, or in the absence thereof pursuant to the definitions of
income and assets established for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit
program, or pursuant to the standards promulgated by the SPGA.
2.
Affordable units shall be dispersed throughout the building(s) and shall
be compatible with and generally comparable to the market-rate units
in terms of location, quality and character.
3.
Of the affordable units, the applicant shall set aside units representing
all three income levels as follows: 20% shall serve low income persons,
50% shall serve moderate income persons and 30% shall serve uppermoderate
income persons.
4.
Although eligibility for the affordable units shall be determined by
reference to income and assets of the prospective residents, the
affordable units shall be considered affordable only if they are
restricted in the amount of monthly rent or other monthly charges for
the unit based upon a percentage of the applicable median income.
For purposes of computing the monthly rent or other monthly charges
for the unit, there shall be excluded any special charges for extra or
specialized services which are not provided to the general population
of the project but are unique to the particular needs of an individual
resident. The standards of affordability for proposed projects,
including, without limitation, the methods of determining and
maintaining eligibility, the percentage of applicable median income

7.4.3 TOWN CHARTER 7.4.4
Charter:131
used for limiting the monthly amounts charged for the affordable units
and any variations in the percentages of median income in the three
income levels shall be set and revised from time to time by the SPGA
provided said standards are consistent with appropriate federal and
state standards.
At the discretion of the SPGA, the applicant may be permitted to
set aside a lower percentage of affordable units, but in no case less
than 10% of the units, if, in the opinion of the SPGA, the applicant
has demonstrated that public subsidies (including, without limitation,
public or low interest financing, tax benefits and town-provided
subsidies such as provision of services, real estate tax abatements or
reduced assessments or reductions of water and sewer charges with
respect to the affordable units) are unavailable or inappropriate and/
or the provision of the required percentage of affordable units will
threaten the viability of the project without some form of relief. In such
cases, or in order to encourage an applicant to exceed the required
percentage of affordable units, the SPGA may:
Provide a density bonus whereby the total number of allowable
units computed hereunder ("Maximum allowable units") may be
increased by an amount of additional units determined by the
SPGA, not to exceed 25% of the maximum allowable units, and any
such additional units granted by the SPGA as a density bonus shall
be market units and shall not cause a corresponding increase in the
number of required affordable units;
a.
Permit higher percentages of units to be offered to moderate or
upper-moderate-income persons; and/or
b.
Permit the applicant to make a cash or other contribution to the
town or its designee for use by the town in (1) providing or
subsidizing affordable housing for low, moderate, and uppermoderate-
income elderly persons as defined by this section of the
by-law or (2) providing other elderly facilities or elderly services.
c.
6.
Affordability restrictions shall be embodied in applicable deed
covenants, contractual agreements and/or other mechanisms to ensure
compliance with this section.
7.
All affordable units shall be maintained as affordable housing units for
the life of the assisted living facility.
8.
Prior to the issuance of any building permit for any units, a clearance
certificate shall be required to be issued by the Planning Department
indicating compliance with this subsection. No clearance certificate
shall be issued for any units until (a) all documents necessary to ensure
compliance with this subsection including, without limitation, the
documents referred to in Section 7.4.4.7 have been executed and, if
required, recorded at the Registry of Deeds and (b) any required cash

to override or supersede the fair marketing regulations of the
Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), the
Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD), or any
authority with jurisdiction and like purpose, to provide low- and
moderate-income housing.
Such affordable units may be rented, sold or otherwise provided to
qualified seniors in accordance with income and asset limitations

charges for the unit based upon a percentage of the applicable
median income. For purposes of computing the monthly rent or
other monthly charges for the unit, there shall be excluded any
special charges for extra or specialized services which are not
provided to the general population of the project but are unique
to the particular needs of an individual senior. The standards of
affordability for proposed projects, including, without limitation,

percentage of applicable median income used for limiting the
monthly amounts charged for the affordable units and any
variations in the percentages of median income in the three income

regarding affordability, including an affordability restriction
executed by the Commonwealths Secretary of Housing and
Community Development pursuant to General Laws Chapter 184,
Section 32, have been executed and recorded at the Registry of

Nothing in this subsection shall preclude a developer from setting
aside more than the required number of affordable units or from
setting aside additional units for higher but limited income groups
or from setting aside more units for lower-income groups.

For purposes of ensuring that the applicant is abiding by its
obligations relative to the affordable units pursuant to the special
permit, a monitoring agent shall be assigned by the Planning Board
and prior to the issuance of a building permit, a monitoring
agreement shall have been submitted to the Planning Board and
Town Counsel for review and approval. The applicant and
successors and assigns as owners of the project (applicant/owner),
shall pay, in perpetuity, any reasonable fees charged by the
monitoring agent/agency.
j.
If an affordable dwelling unit is a rental unit, on each anniversary
of the unit, the applicant/owner will obtain and maintain on file a
Certification of Tenant Eligibility in a form and for the time period
approved by the monitoring agent. Such Certifications shall be filed
annually with the Planning Division in the Town of Andover. The
applicant shall verify that the income provided by an applicant
in an income certification is accurate. The applicant will maintain
complete and accurate records pertaining to the Affordable Units,
and during reasonable business hours and upon reasonable notice,
will permit the Town to inspect the books and records of the

into sub-elements, preferably expressing the functional diversity
within the building.
d.
To provide visual relief from buildings and hard materials,
landscape treatment using shrubs, trees, flower boxes and other
greenery around buildings or in recessed places is encouraged.

Rationale/purpose.
There exists conclusive evidence that tobacco smoke causes
cancer, respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disease, negative birth
outcomes, as well as, irritations to the eyes, nose and throat. Both
smokers and those exposed to secondhand smoke are at risk. It is
the opinion of the Board of Health that nonsmokers should not be
involuntarily exposed to tobacco smoke.
A.
More than 90% of all smokers begin smoking before the age of 18
(the legal age to purchase cigarettes in the Commonwealth) and
an estimated 3,000 minors begin smoking every day in the United
States. There is therefore, an important health need to reduce easy

In passing upon matters before it, the Commission shall consider,
among other things, the historical and architectural value and
significance of the site, building or structure, the general design
arrangement of the features involved and the relation of such

existing buildings or structures, the Commission shall consider the
appropriateness of the size and shape of the building or structure,
both in relation to the land area upon which the building or
structure is situated and to buildings and structures in the vicinity,

and setback requirements in addition to those required by any

9.
Procedures.
Except as this by-law provides in Section 7, no building or structure
within the Historic District shall be constructed or altered in any
way that affects exterior architectural features unless the
Commission shall first have issued a certificate of appropriateness,
a certificate of nonapplicability or a certificate of hardship with
respect to such construction or alteration. In addition, the
demolition of any building or structure must comply with the
requirements of Article XII, Section 33, of the General Bylaws of
the Town of Andover. In the event of any conflict with the provisions
of Article XII, Section 33, of the General Bylaws, this by-law shall
prevail.
A.
Applications for certificates shall be made with the Inspector of
Buildings. Copies of applications shall be forwarded to the Historic
District Commission. Applications shall be in a form specified by
the Commission that adequately describes the proposed work. This
may include plans and elevations, drawn to scale, detailed enough
to show the architectural design of the structure and its relation
to the existing building. Plot and site plans should be filed when
an application is made for improvements involving applicable
landscape features such as walls and fences. In the case of
B.
8.
§ 36 TOWN CHARTER § 36
Charter:261
demolition or removal, the Inspector of Buildings shall forward one
copy of the demolition permit application to the Commission.
Within 14 days of the filing of an application for any certificate, the
Commission shall be required to determine whether the application
involves any exterior architectural features which are within the
jurisdiction of this bylaw.
C.
If the application requires the Commission's review or at the
request of the applicant, the Commission shall hold a public
hearing (a hearing may be waived according to the provisions of
Chapter 40C of the General Laws, as amended). The Commission
shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing on any application.
The Inspector of Buildings shall give public notice of the time,
place and purposes thereof at least 14 days before said hearing
in such manner as may be determined. A copy of said notice shall
be mailed, postage prepaid, to the applicant, to the owners of all
adjoining property and other property deemed by the Commission
to be materially affected thereby as they appear on the most recent
real estate tax list of the Board of Assessors, to the Town Planning
Board and to such other persons as the Commission shall deem
entitled to notice.
D.
The Commission shall decide upon the determination of any
application within 60 days of its filing or within such further time
as the applicant may choose to allow in writing.
E.
A certificate of appropriateness shall be issued to the applicant
if the Commission determines that the proposed construction or
alteration will be appropriate for or compatible with the
preservation or protection of the Historic District. In the case of a
disapproval of an application for a certificate of appropriateness,
the Commission shall place upon its records the reason for such
a determination and shall forthwith cause a notice of its
determinations, accompanied by a copy of the reasons therefor as
set forth in the records of the Commission, to be issued to the
applicant, and the Commission may make recommendations to the
applicant with respect to the appropriateness of the design. Prior
to the issuance of any disapproval, the Commission may notify the
applicant of its proposed action, accompanied by recommendations
of changes in the applicant's proposal, which, if made, would make
the application acceptable to the Commission. If within 14 days of
the receipt of such notice, the applicant files a written modification
of the application in conformity with the recommended changes
of the Commission, the Commission shall issue a certificate of
appropriateness to the applicant.
F.
Only upon request will the Commission issue a certificate of
nonapplicability to any applicant whose application does not
require Commission approval.
G.
§ 36 ANDOVER CODE § 36
Charter:262
If an application is deemed inappropriate or if application is made
for a certificate of hardship, the Commission may issue a certificate
of hardship, if conditions especially affecting the building or
structure involved, but not affecting the Historic District generally,
would make failure to approve an application involve a substantial
hardship, financial or otherwise, to the applicant and approval
would not involve substantial detriment to the public welfare. A
certificate of hardship shall also be issued in the event that the
Commission does not make a determination of an application
within the time specified in Subsection 8E of this by-law.
H.
Each certificate shall be dated and signed, and the Commission
shall keep a permanent record of its determination and of the vote
of each member participating therein and shall file a copy of notice
of certificates and determinations of disapproval with the Town
Clerk and the Inspector of Buildings.
I.
Any person aggrieved by a determination of the Commission may,
within 20 days after filing of the notice of determination with
the Town Clerk, file a written request with the Commission for
a review by a person or persons of competence and experience
in such matters, designated by the Merrimack Valley Planning
Commission.
The finding of the person or persons making such review shall be
filed in triplicate with the Town Clerk, the Inspector of Buildings
and the Historic District Commission within 45 days after the
request and shall be binding on the applicant and the Commission,
unless a further appeal is sought as provided in Subsection 8K of
this by-law.
J.
Any person aggrieved by a determination of the Commission or by
a finding by the person or persons making a review may, within
20 days after filing of the notice of such determination or such
finding with the Town Clerk, appeal to the Superior Court sitting in
equity for Essex County. The Court shall hear all pertinent evidence
and shall annul the determination of the Commission if it finds the
decision of the Commission to be unsupported by the evidence or
to exceed the authority of the Commission or may remand the case
for further action by the Commission or make such other decree
as justice and equity may require. The remedy provided by this
section shall be exclusive, but the parties shall have all rights of
appeal and exception as in other equity cases.
Costs shall not be allowed against the Commission unless it shall
appear to the Court that the Commission acted with gross
negligence, in bad faith or with malice in the matter from which
the appeal was taken. Costs shall not be allowed against the party
appealing from such a determination of the Commission unless it
shall appear to the Court that such party acted in bad faith or with
malice in making the appeal to the Court.

as defined and regulated in Article VIII, Section 8.9 of the Town's
Zoning By-Law, are prohibited in the Town of Andover.
1.
Severability. If any provisions, paragraphs, sentences, or clauses of this
bylaw shall be held invalid for any reason, all other provisions shall
continue in full force and effect.
2.
Enforcement. The penalty for violation of this bylaw shall be $200 for

offense. In addition to any other applicable remedy, violation of this
bylaw may be enforced by noncriminal disposition in accordance with
MGL c. 40, § 21D. The Town Manager, police officers and the Building
Inspector shall be enforcing persons.
3.
Findings and Intent
Thin film single-use plastic checkout bags have a significant effect on
marine (including freshwater systems) and terrestrial environments
1.
§ 48 ANDOVER CODE § 50
Charter:288
and human health, including, but not limited to: 1) harming marine and
terrestrial animals through ingestion and entanglement; 2) polluting
and degrading the terrestrial and marine environments; 3) clogging
storm drainage systems; 4) creating a burden for solid waste disposal
and recycling facilities; 5) requiring the use of fossil fuels in their
composition; 6) degrading into microplastic pieces (<5mm) that are
concurrently ingested by fish, crustaceans, bivalves and other ocean
life moving up the food chain to disrupt human health; 7) acting as
a vector for stagnant water through which mosquito-borne diseases
can spread. Studies have shown that even "compostable" or
"biodegradable" bags require very specific and controlled conditions to
biodegrade, and have potentially negative environmental effects similar
to conventional thin film single use plastic bags. Such bags should
therefore be subject to the same restrictions as conventional thin film
single use plastic checkout bags.
NOW THEREFORE, the purpose of this bylaw is to protect Andover's
unique natural beauty and irreplaceable natural resources by reducing
the number of single-use plastic checkout bags in circulation in the
Town of Andover and to promote the use of reusable bags. Numerous
Massachusetts communities have acted or are in the process of
reducing use of thin film single-use plastic checkout bags.
Definitions.
BIODEGRADABLE PLASTIC BAG  A plastic bag that conforms to the
current ASTM D7081 standard specification for marine degradability.
COMPOSTABLE PLASTIC BAG  Conforming to the ASTM (American
Society for Testing and Materials) D6400 for compostablility.
DEPARTMENT  The Town of Andover Health Division.
FOOD ESTABLISHMENT  An operation that stores, prepares,
packages, serves, vends, or otherwise provides food for human
consumption, as further defined in 105 CMR 590.002. Any
establishment requiring a permit to operate in accordance with the
State Food Code, 105 CMR 590.000 et seq., shall be considered a "food
establishment" for purposes of this bylaw.
HEALTH AGENT  A person appointed by the Board of Health as its
Health Agent.
POLYETHYLENE  Any of various lightweight thermoplastic resins
made by polymerizing ethylene, a flammable hydrocarbon gas primarily
occurring in natural gas, coal gas, and crude oil, chiefly used for plastic
bags, food containers and other products.
RECYCLABLE PAPER BAG  A paper bag, with or without handles, that
contains at least 40% post-consumer recycled content, and displays in
a visible manner on the outside of the bag 1) the word "recyclable" or
a symbol identifying the bag as recyclable and 2) a label identifying
the bags as being made from post-consumer recycled content and the
percentage of post-consumer recycled content in the bag.
2.
§ 50 TOWN CHARTER § 50
Charter:289
REUSABLE CHECKOUT BAG  A sewn bag with stitched handles,
that is specifically designed for multiple reuses that (i) can carry 25
pounds; (ii) is machine washable or is made of a material that can
be cleaned or disinfected 125 times; (iii) is made of either polyester,
polypropylene, cotton or other natural fiber material; and (iv) has a
thickness of greater than four mils.
THIN FILM SINGLE-USE CHECKOUT BAG  Those bags typically
with handles, constructed of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), lowdensity
polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE),
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or
polypropylene (other than woven and nonwoven polypropylene fabric),
if said film is less than four mils in thickness.
Regulated conduct.

(1) Recyclable paper bag;
(2) Reusable checkout bag; or
(3) Cardboard boxes.
b.
3.
Exemptions.

contain dry cleaning, newspapers, fruit, vegetables, nuts, grains,
candy, wet items and other similar merchandise are not prohibited
under this bylaw.
a.
All food establishments must provide at the point of sale, free of
charge, either reusable checkout bags or recyclable paper bags,
or both, at the Food Establishment's option, to any customer
participating in the Supplemental Food Program for Women,
Infants and Children (WIC) pursuant to MGL c.111, or in the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) pursuant to
MGL c.18.
b.
The provisions of this bylaw do not apply to bags used by a
nonprofit corporation or other charity as defined by MGL c.12
to distribute food, grocery products, clothing or other household
items to clients.
c.
This bylaw does not prevent food establishments from selling to
customers various types of plastic bags sold in packages containing

Definitions. The following words and phrases shall, unless context
clearly indicates otherwise, have the following meanings:
2.
§ 51 ANDOVER CODE § 51
Charter:292
ASTM STANDARD  Refers to materials meeting the standards of
the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International
Standards D6400 or D6868 for biodegradable and compostable
plastics, as those standards may be amended. D6400 is the specification
for plastics designed for compostability in municipal or industrial
aerobic composting facilities. D6868 is the specification for aerobic
compostability of plastics used as coatings on a compostable substrate.
BIODEGRADABLE  Materials that will completely degrade and return
to nature, i.e., decompose into elements found in nature within a
reasonably short period of time after customary disposal.
COMPOSTABLE  Materials that will completely degrade into, or
otherwise become part of, usable compost (e.g., soil-conditioning
material, mulch) in a safe and timely manner. Compostable disposable
food service ware must meet ASTM Standards for compostability and
any bioplastic or plastic-like product must be clearly labeled, preferably
with a color symbol, such that any customer or processor can easily
distinguish the ASTM Standard compostable plastic from non-ASTM
Specification compostable plastic.
DISPOSABLE FOOD SERVICE WARE  All containers, bowls, plates,
trays, cartons, cups, lids, straws, forks, spoons, knives, and other items
designed for one-time or nondurable uses on or in which any food
vendor directly places or packages prepared foods or which are used
to consume foods. This includes, but is not limited to, service ware for
takeout foods and/or leftovers from partially consumed meals prepared
at food establishments.
FOOD ESTABLISHMENT  An operation that stores, prepares,
packages, serves, vends, or otherwise provides food for human
consumption, as further defined in 105 CMR 590.002. Any
establishment requiring a permit to operate in accordance with the
State Food Code, 105 CMR 590.000 et seq., shall be considered a "food
establishment" for purposes of this bylaw.
POLYSTYRENE  The term means and includes blown polystyrene and
expanded and extruded foams (sometimes called "styrofoam," a Dow
Chemical Co. trademarked form of EPS insulation), also referred to as
"expanded polystyrene (EPS)," which are thermoplastic petrochemical
materials utilizing a styrene monomer and processed by any number
of techniques, including, but not limited to, fusion of polymer spheres
(expandable bead polystyrene), injection molding, form molding, and
extrusion-blow molding (extruded foam polystyrene); and in this
chapter is referenced as "foam polystyrene." Foam polystyrene is
generally used to make cups, bowls, plates, trays, clamshell containers,
meat trays and egg cartons. The term also means and includes clear or
solid polystyrene which is also known as "oriented," which is produced
by stretching extruded PS film, improving visibility through the
material by reducing haziness and increasing stiffness. This is often
used in packaging where the manufacturer would like the consumer
to see the enclosed product. This is referenced in this chapter as
§ 51 TOWN CHARTER § 51
Charter:293
"rigid polystyrene." "Rigid polystyrene" is generally used to make clear
clamshell containers, and clear or colored straws, lids and utensils.
PREPARED FOOD  Food or beverages, which are served, packaged,
cooked, chopped, sliced, mixed, brewed, frozen, squeezed or otherwise
prepared on the food establishment's premises within the Town of
Andover. Prepared food may be eaten either on or off the premises, also
known as "takeout food."
RECYCLABLE  Material that can be sorted, cleansed, and
reconstituted using Andover's available recycling collection programs
for the purpose of using the altered form in the manufacture of a
new product. "Recycling" does not include burning, incinerating,
converting, or otherwise thermally destroying solid waste.
RETAIL ESTABLISHMENT  Any commercial facility that sells goods
directly to the consumer, including but not limited to grocery stores,
pharmacies, liquor stores, convenience stores, restaurants, retail stores
and vendors selling clothing, food, and personal items, and dry cleaning
services.
REUSABLE  Materials that will be used more than once in its same
form by a food establishment. Reusable food service ware includes:
tableware, flatware, food or beverage containers, packages or trays,
such as, but not limited to, soft drink bottles and milk containers
that are designed to be returned to the distributor and customer that
is provided takeout containers. "Reusable" also includes durable
containers, packages, or trays used on premises or returnable
containers brought back to the food establishment.
Prohibited use and distribution of disposable food service ware.
Food establishments are prohibited from providing prepared food
to customers in foam polystyrene or rigid polystyrene food service
ware.
a.
All food establishments using any disposable food service ware
will use biodegradable, compostable, reusable or recyclable food
service ware. All food establishments are strongly encouraged to
use reusable food service ware in place of using disposable food
service ware for all food served on premises.
b.
3.
Exemptions.
Any person may seek an exemption from the requirements of this
chapter by filing a request, in writing, with the Board of Health.
The Board of Health may waive any specific requirement of this
chapter for a period of not more than six months if the person
seeking the exemption has demonstrated that strict application
of the specific requirement would cause undue hardship. For
purposes of this chapter, an "undue hardship" is a situation unique
to the food establishment where there are no reasonable
alternatives to the use of expanded polystyrene disposable food
a.

significant economic hardship to that food establishment. The
Board of Health's decision to grant or deny an exemption shall be
in writing and shall be final.
Coolers and ice chests that are intended for reuse are exempt from
the provisions of this chapter.
b.

surveyor showing the boundary lines of a lot which meets the
area and frontage requirements stated in the Andover Zoning
By-Law for the zoning district in which the lot is located.
b.
Easement plan drawn and certified by a registered
professional engineer or a registered land surveyor.
c.
A plan showing land to be conveyed from one lot to an adjacent
lot, so long as the conveyance does not leave any lot so affected
without the frontage and area set forth in § III, Subsection B,
Paragraph la, above.
d.
In determining whether an existing private way is adequate
to qualify a plan for an endorsement as Approval Under the
Subdivision Control Law Not Required, the Planning Board
shall consider all of the following: [Added 3-10-1998]
The right-of-way is at least 40 feet in width and must exist
in fact on the ground.
i.
There is an adequate turnaround area within the layout if
the way is a dead-end street.
ii.
The traveled way does not exceed a grade of 8% vertically
and is of such horizontal alignment so as to provide safe
visibility.
iii.
The traveled way is at least 18 feet in width, with at least
eight inches of compacted gravel if serving not more than
two residential dwellings, and/or paved with at least two
inches of bituminous pavement if serving more than two
residential dwellings.

Form B plans: Preliminary plans submitted pursuant to Section
81-S of the SCL. These plans follow the same basic procedures as
definitive plans but are normally less formal in nature. They show
enough general information for review as a concept, and receive
a nonbinding decision by the Board. Residential Form B plans are
not required but are highly recommended, especially for larger,
complicated proposals. For nonresidential subdivisions a Form B
plan is mandatory. They help to resolve planning and design issues
prior to engineering the definitive plan. [Amended 11-2-1987]

all physical construction of such subdivision improvements and those
legal and engineering documents needed for acceptance of streets,
utilities and any open spaces by the Town. (See § VIII, Street
acceptance procedures, below.)
The Department of Public Works shall compute the amount he
estimates to be required to complete such subdivision
improvements shown on the plan. This amount shall be adjusted
to include a reasonable inflation factor under § IV, Subsection A,
Paragraph 1, above and such fees deemed by the Board to be
sufficient to cover legal fees and engineering fees necessary to
have streets accepted by the Town. In no case shall these legal and
engineering fees be less than $200 per lot in the subdivision.
1.
The Board shall consider approval of the figure submitted by the
Department of Public Works at a public meeting. If approved by
2.
B.
§ 4 ANDOVER CODE § 4
Charter:318
majority vote, the Board shall notify the developer of the term
of the performance guaranty (not to exceed two years) and the
amount, which shall be a valid figure for a period of 30 days.
The applicant shall provide the performance guaranty in passbook
account form, as required by § IV, Subsection A, Paragraph 2, of
these regulations, by delivery to the Board's office in the Town
Office Building; the passbook and withdrawal slip shall be held by
the Town Treasurer.
3.
Release of performance guaranties. From time to time the applicant
may make a written request to the Board for release from the
performance guaranty such funds as may have been expended for
construction of the required subdivision improvements.
Such request shall be given to the Department of Public Works.
The Department of Public Works shall investigate and shall provide
the Board with a written report describing work satisfactorily
completed and recommending the amount eligible for such release,
based on the dollar value of the satisfactorily completed
construction.
1.
Requests for release of a portion of the guaranty amount may
be granted following the Board's determination that remaining
funds are sufficient to cover completion of the remaining required
subdivision improvement work at labor and material costs
prevalent at the time of the request and an inflation factor.
2.
Within 45 days of a request for release of the whole balance of a
performance guaranty, and following a report by the Department of
Public Works that all required subdivision improvements have been
completed satisfactorily, the Board may release a performance
guaranty except for 10% of the full amount of the original guaranty,
which shall be held until the streets have been accepted by the
Town. If the Department of Public Works reports that not all
required subdivision improvements have been completed
satisfactorily, the Board shall, prior to the expiration of said 45
days, send notification of outstanding defects by registered mail to
the developer with a copy to the Town Clerk.
3.
Owners of record of all lots within a subdivision for which release of
all performance guaranty moneys is requested shall be given timely
notice prior to the meeting at which the Board shall vote on such
release.
4.
C.
Termination of performance guaranty. During the final month of the
term of a performance guaranty, the applicant shall give notice, in
writing, to the Board that the required subdivision improvements have
been completed or have not been completed, and, if not completed,
shall state why the performance guaranty should not be taken in
default; or, alternatively, the applicant shall request an extension of the
term.
D.
§ 4 TOWN CHARTER § 4
Charter:319
§ 5. Planning Board conditions and releases of conditions.
If an extension of the term of the performance guaranty is
requested, the Board shall ask the Department of Public Works
to report as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the remaining
moneys to cover the projected cost to complete the required
subdivision improvements. If found to be insufficient, the
Department of Public Works shall state the amount required to
cover the completion of the required subdivision improvements.
Upon the Board's approval of that amount or such other amount
as the Board may establish, the applicant shall deposit with his
performance guaranty, within 30 days of the Board's approval, the
amount so determined, which shall be subject to all the obligations
of a performance guaranty hereunder.
1.
In the event the Board declares an applicant in default of the
conditions of his performance guaranty, the Board, following
proper notice and a public hearing, shall use the balance of the
funds remaining in such performance guaranty to complete the
work necessary to have the required subdivision improvements
installed and accepted by the Town. Such balance shall be placed
in an interest-bearing account in the name of the Town of Andover.
The Department of Public Works shall be responsible for the
completion of the improvements by the use of current bid
prices for materials, materials installed, labor and equipment
rental, negotiation for professional services and securing of
new bids.
a.
Such work shall be paid for from the defaulted balance
deposited as aforesaid following presentation to the Board
and its approval of invoices, receipts and reports from the
Department of Public Works regarding the work.
b.
The cost of completing the engineering and legal documents
required for the Town's acceptance of the subdivision
improvements and open space shall also be paid for from these
funds.
c.
Funds remaining following acceptance of the streets by the
Town shall be returned to the applicant along with any interest
accrued thereon, for which the applicant shall provide a
written receipt.
d.

this condition will be deemed to have been complied with and
considered released for that lot.
h.
Prior to construction activity of any kind within the subdivision,
the developer shall submit to the Planning Department a
proposed construction sequence schedule in a form provided
by the Department, said schedule to be used as a guide to
activities within the development, including construction of
roadways, utilities, drainage systems, stabilization, earth

stabilized by methods determined by the Board through the
Planning Department within 60 days of such disturbance
unless otherwise approved by the Board.
l.
No building lot shall remain in an open condition longer than
60 days. "Open" shall be defined as that period of time between
initial preparation of the lot for building (clearing of trees,
stripping of topsoil), and the time that the foundation has
been installed, backfilled, and the rough grading has been
established and stabilized by use of temporary seeding,
mulching, or netting. This restriction shall remain in force until
the lot has been properly stabilized and shall survive changes
in ownership of the lot.
m.
Stockpiles of earth materials shall not be permitted in any
area that necessitates removal of trees for such purpose, nor
within 50 feet of any wetland boundary, drainage channel, or
watercourse. Stockpile areas shall be designated on a plan,

subdivision in its entirety.
u.
Prior to the conveyance of individual lots within the
subdivision, the developer shall provide the Planning
Department with a surveyor's certification that temporary lot
corners have been established on the ground for the lot to be
conveyed. Once established, maintenance of these temporary
corners shall be the responsibility of the lot owner. Upon
completion of the street and prior to the Selectmen's layout,
the developer shall provide the Planning Department with a
surveyor's certification that all bounds and corners have been
set in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Board.
v.
Immediately following the installation of water lines, the
developer shall prepare a plan pursuant to the Rules and
Regulations of the Board showing the location of all service

these conditions shall be enforced under the provisions of said
Rules and Regulations.
y.
The developer shall be responsible for proper maintenance
and operation of the drainage systems and detention areas
shown on the plan until such time as the streets have been
accepted by the Town or the last lot in the subdivision has
been sold, whichever is the earlier; whereupon the detention
areas, inlets and outlets shall be maintained by a homeowners'
association (HOA) established by the developer to which each
lot in the subdivision is subject and whereby all lot owners
will be responsible to pay for the maintenance, repair and
replacement of said drainage features. The Town shall be
provided with an easement to maintain and repair said
features if necessary, but all costs associated with such
maintenance or repairs shall be the responsibility of the HOA
and all lot owners by virtue of their interest in said HOA.
No clearance certificate shall be issued for any lot in the
subdivision until such time as all documents for the HOA have
been approved by the Planning Board and recorded, and the
account referred to in Subsection aa below has been
established in the manner prescribed by the Town.

incurred in the event the Town is required to perform any
work in or on any detention area in order to ensure its proper
operation and functioning; and in the latter event the Town
shall have the right to employ and enforce any procedure
allowed to it under law in order to secure such reimbursement.
All deeds to building lots shown on the plan shall reserve
the fee and/or interest in the streets and/or easements, said
fee and/or interest (except as may be provided for under
Subsections z and aa above) to be conveyed to the Town at the
time of street acceptance.
bb.
Any blasting operations or activities associated with the
subdivision shall require proper permits and shall be
undertaken in accordance with all applicable local and state
regulations. Blasting may not be undertaken on any weekend
or holiday.
cc.
Hauling of earth materials and heavy equipment associated
with the subdivision is restricted to the time period between
the last morning pick-up of school children and the first
afternoon drop-off, as determined by the School Transportation
Coordinator. It shall be the developer's responsibility to inform
all contractors, subcontractors, vendors, and workmen of this
restriction, which shall be enforced pursuant to the Board's
Rules and Regulations.
dd.
Earth materials associated with the construction of a
subdivision may not be transported to or removed from the
site without the applicant having first secured approval for
such activities from the Board. Such transport shall be in
accordance with a schedule, in a form provided by the Board,
which shall include the volume of material, number of
truckloads, anticipated hours and dates of hauling activities
and hauling routes to and from the subdivision. The developer
shall be responsible for ensuring that the public ways are
kept free and clear of dirt and debris associated with hauling
activities.
ee.
Prior to issuance of any clearance certificates for any lots
within the subdivision, the developer shall have established

stabilization and removal of all erosion controls prior to
completion of the subdivision. Said account shall be
established in an amount recommended by the Town Engineer,
approved by the Planning Board, and secured in manner and
form approved by the Board. This account, once established,
ff.
§ 5 ANDOVER CODE § 5
Charter:326
will be used to ensure that all unnecessary erosion controls
are promptly removed upon receipt of certificate of compliance
from the Conservation Commission. The Planning Department
and the Conservation Commission will coordinate times and
dates in which the erosion controls can be removed. Upon
removal of all erosion controls, the account may be released in
full.

on the plan approved by the Board. Any further division of
lots or property in the subdivision for building purposes is
prohibited unless and until a modification of this approval has
been granted by the Planning Board pursuant to MGL c. 41,
§ 81W.
ii.
Prior to the recording of the definitive plan at the Registry of
Deeds, the developer shall provide the Planning Department

guaranty required under § IV to the Board, the Board may provide an
instrument allowing for the conveyance, sale or transfer of lots shown
on the plan. Thereafter, the Board may provide instruments for partial
releases of restrictions, meaning those restrictions which have been
complied with or are not applicable to any given lot, for which a fee of

providing access to a proposed development. It is the Board's
intent that a proposed development not overly strain the
capacity of existing or planned public ways so as to result in
traffic congestion or safety problems.
Where deemed necessary by the Board, a traffic study
shall be performed, at the developer's expense, by a
person or firm experienced and competent in the field of
traffic engineering. Such person or firm shall be selected
by the Board. The developer shall provide the fee for such
study to the Board prior to commencement of the study.
(1)
When, in the opinion of the Board, and based upon the
findings and recommendations of a traffic study, or the
recommendations of the Department of Public Works, a
subdivision is deemed to have a detrimental impact on
existing or proposed streets or traffic conditions, the
Board may approve such subdivision on conditions limiting
the number of lots upon which buildings may be erected.

Adequate access from a public way. [Added 3-26-2001]
Where the street system within a subdivision does not connect
with or have, in the opinion of the Board, adequate access from
a Town, county or state (public) way, the Board may require,
as a condition of approval of a plan, that such adequate access
be provided by the subdivider and/or that the subdivider make
physical improvements to and within such a way of access,
from the boundary of the subdivision to a Town, county or state
way.
a.
Where the physical condition or width of a public way from
which a subdivision has its access is considered by the Board
to be inadequate to carry the traffic expected to be generated
by such subdivision, the Board may require the subdivider
to dedicate a strip of land for the purpose of widening the
abutting public way to a width at least commensurate with
that required within the subdivision and to make physical
improvements to and within such public way to the same
standards required within the subdivision. Any such dedication
of land for the purpose of way and any such work performed
within such public way shall be made only with permission of
the governmental agency having jurisdiction over such way,

easements when, in the Board's opinion, the subdivision will cause
an increase or change in surface water volumes or velocities, either
through open channels or through culverts into or onto any
abutting properties. [Amended 3-10-1998]
8.
Drainage and grading. Drainage is directly affected by grading and
earth movement within the subdivision. Grading on building lots
directly or indirectly impacts the street drainage systems within the
subdivision as well as on adjacent Town ways. This section contains
the design requirements for drainage and for grading as it relates to
drainage. These requirements are intended to further the purposes
of the SCL, Section 81-M. All drainage within or associated with a
subdivision shall be designed in accordance with the Stormwater Policy
Handbook, as prepared by the Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection, dated March 1997, and as amended from
time to time. [Amended 3-26-2001]
All lots within the subdivision shall be graded to provide positive
drainage away from existing or proposed structures, adjacent
private or public properties, and from the surface areas of existing
or proposed on-site sewage disposal systems. [Amended
3-26-2001]
1.
The Board will not approve grading which would cause drainage
flows to exceed the capacity of natural wetlands, watercourses,
drainage channels and any man-made drainage facilities on and in
existing or proposed streets.
2.
Grading for slope requirements for on-site sewage disposal systems
shall be totally contained within the lot upon which such system
is proposed. No slope easements onto any adjacent lot or property
shall be permitted.
3.
Where any stream or other natural watercourse or drainageway
is proposed to be enclosed or piped underground, the Board shall
require the grading plan to provide for an alternate aboveground
path suitable for passage of water in the event that the enclosed or
piped section becomes blocked.
4.
Natural drainageways, channels or streams shall not be disturbed,
but shall be protected by easements as required by § VI, Subsection
E, of these regulations, unless alternative provisions for
maintaining flows and carrying capacities for such features have
been reviewed and approved by the Board.
5.
The final grading shown on any approved Form C plan shall not
be amended or changed without prior review and approval of the
Board except as may be deemed minor by the Board's staff as
6.

amendments or changes the Board shall consider the impact of
such amendments or changes upon the subdivision as:
a. Changes in direction of stormwater runoff;
b. Changes in velocities of runoff;
c. Impacts on abutting properties;
d. Impacts on street drainage systems;
Impacts on natural drainage channels, watercourses or
streams.
e.
Minor changes in the grading plan of a subdivision or a lot within
a subdivision may be approved by the technical staff of the Board
if and when it can be determined that no adverse impacts might
result from such change and no other section of these rules and
regulations is violated. Minor changes in the grading plan shall be
defined as:
a. Changes in elevation of no more than one foot in cut or fill;
b. Changes in slope of no more than 2%;
Changes proposing a vertical retaining wall of no more than
four feet in height no closer to any property or lot line than 15
feet.
c.
7.
Drainage systems shall be designed to accommodate the ten-year,
twenty-four-hour storm. Cross culverts and major drainageways
shall be designed to accommodate at least a twenty-five-year,
twenty-four-hour storm. The preferred methodology for calculation
of drainage shall be the United States Department of Agriculture
 Soil Conservation Service, Technical Report 55 (TR-55) as
amended. Other methodologies deemed appropriate may be used
only after prior approval of the Board and upon recommendation
of the Department of Public Works. [Amended 11-2-1987;
1-8-2002; 1-11-2011]
8.
With the exception of Local Streets, drainage facilities in the form
of detention or retention basins or ponds may not be located within
any street right-of-way, nor on any proposed building lot, nor within
any open space area intended to be conveyed to the Town. Such
facilities, if required as part of a subdivision, shall be located on
separate parcels which are to be retained by the applicant or
developer, or conveyed to an association of lot owners within the
subdivision. The Planning Board shall have the authority to review
and approve any documents related to an association of lot owners
and may require a performance guarantee to be established to
ensure the continued operation and maintenance of a drainage
facility. The town shall have no responsibility for the maintenance

runoff onto adjacent property shall not be permitted unless proper
drainage easements are obtained from all affected property
owner(s). All such fully executed easements shall be provided at the
time of submission of the plan. [Added 3-26-2001]
12.
Flooding or erosion onto land abutting the subdivision is
prohibited. The proposed stormwater system must provide
adequate protection against damage to property within and
without the subdivision. [Added 3-26-2001]
13.
The proposed subdivision may not have an adverse impact upon
water quality within or outside the subdivision. The drainage from
surface water runoff may not pollute adjoining land. [Added
3-26-2001]
14.
Test pits shall be done in each drainage control basin and
subsurface drainage structure by a licensed soil evaluator, and
all results, analyses and conclusions of such tests, certified by

16.
Plans shall show all proposed subdrains with details. Plans shall
show all proposed erosion control measures. [Added 3-26-2001]
17.
Open space. Before approval of a plan the Board may, in proper cases,
require the plan to show a park or parks suitably located for playground
or recreation purposes or for providing light and air. The park or
parks shall not be unreasonable in area in relation to the land being
subdivided and to the prospective uses of such land. The Board may,
by appropriate endorsement on the plan, require that no building be
erected upon such park or parks for a period of not more than three
years without its approval.
If open space or other real property is to be conveyed to the Town,
whether or not by special permit, then prior to the issuance of the
first clearance certificate for construction of a building, the applicant
must provide to the Planning Board a certification to the Town of
Andover from an attorney licensed to practice in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts that the title to the subject open space or other
real property is a good, clear, marketable title, and that the property
is being conveyed free of all liens, mortgages and encumbrances.

the minimum standards for the protection of the public welfare.
If any mandatory provision of these regulations is won by the
applicant, to the satisfaction of a majority of the Board present at a
scheduled public meeting, to be unreasonable and to cause unique and
undue hardship as it applies to his proposed subdivision, the Board
may, in the interest of justice, grant a waiver to such applicant from
such mandatory provision; provided, however, that the Board also finds
that such waiver or waivers is (1) in the public interest and (2) not
inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the SCL.
In granting waivers, the Board may impose such conditions as will,
in its judgment, encourage a design which will secure as nearly as
reasonable on the facts, the objectives of the standards or
requirements so waived.
Waiver of specific rules and regulations. [Added 1-8-2002]
Pursuant to MGL c. 41, § 81-R, the Board may waive strict
compliance with these Rules and Regulations in any particular case
where such action is in the public interest and not inconsistent with
the intent and purpose of the Subdivision Control Law. A waiver
shall be approved only by a motion which gives reasons why the
waiver is appropriate, and which motion shall be supported by a
majority of the members of the Board. The Board may make its
1.
A.
§ 8 TOWN CHARTER § 9
Charter:355

approval of a waiver conditional upon certain requirements for the
proposed subdivision.
If the applicant wants certain requirements waived for a plan
submitted pursuant to these Rules and Regulations, the request
for waiver shall be submitted together with the application. The
request for waiver shall state the particular rule and regulation
for which a waiver is requested and give the justification for the
waiver.
2.
If the Board fails to make the findings to grant a waiver, the waiver
request shall be considered denied.
3.
If no waiver request is submitted, the noncompliance with these
Rules and Regulations may provide the basis for determining that
the application is not a proper submittal or that it should be denied.
Failure to comply. [Added 1-8-2002]
Failure to comply with the provisions of these Rules and
Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Andover,
Massachusetts, shall be reason for denial of a subdivision

(c)
§ 5 ANDOVER CODE § 7
Charter:360
§ 7. Burden of proof.
The applicant shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the credible evidence that the work proposed in the permit application
will not have unacceptable significant or cumulative effect upon the values
protected by this by-law. Failure to provide adequate evidence to the
Commission supporting this burden shall be sufficient cause for the
Commission to deny such permit or to grant a permit with conditions.
§ 8. Permits and conditions.
If, after said hearing, the Commission determines that the activities which
are subject to the permit application are likely to have a significant or
cumulative effect upon the values protected by this by-law, the Commission,
within 21 days of the close of the public hearing or such further time as
the Commission and the applicant shall agree on, shall issue or deny a
permit for the activities proposed. If it issues a permit, the Commission shall
impose conditions which it deems necessary or desirable to protect those
values, and all work shall be done in accordance with those conditions.
The Commission is empowered to deny a permit for failure to meet the
requirements of this by-law; for failure to submit necessary information
and plans requested by the Commission; for failure to meet the design
specifications, performance standards and other requirements in
regulations of the Commission; for failure to avoid or prevent unacceptable
significant or cumulative effects upon the values protected by this bylaw;
and where no conditions are adequate to protect those values. The
Commission may waive the provisions of this by-law upon the written
request of any applicant for a determination or permit, when, in its
judgment, such action is consistent with the purpose and intent of this bylaw,
and when strict enforcement of the requirements of this by-law would
result in hardship to the applicant.
Lands within 200 feet of rivers, and lands within 100 feet of other resource
areas, are presumed important to the protection of these resources because
activities undertaken in close proximity to resource areas have a high
likelihood of adverse impact upon the wetland or watercourse, either
immediately, as a consequence of construction, or over time as a
consequence of daily operation or existence of those activities. In addition,
such areas are often vital to the preservation of species that depend on
wetlands for food or reproduction. The Commission may therefore require
that the applicant maintain a continuous strip of continuous, undisturbed
vegetative cover within the two-hundred-foot (or one-hundred-foot) area,
unless the applicant demonstrates that the area or part of it may be
disturbed without harm to the values protected by this by-law.
In reviewing proposed activity in areas within 200 feet of rivers, no permit
issued hereunder shall permit any activities unless the applicant, in addition
to meeting the otherwise applicable requirements of this by-law, has proved
by a preponderance of the evidence that there is no practicable alternative
to the proposed project with less adverse effects and that such activities,
§ 7 TOWN CHARTER § 8
Charter:361
taking into account proposed mitigation measures, will have no significant
impact on the values protected by this by-law. The Commission shall regard
as practicable an alternative which is reasonably available and capable of
being done after taking into consideration the proposed use of the property,
the overall project purpose (e.g., residential, institutional, commercial or
industrial purpose), logistics, existing technology and costs.
To prevent wetlands loss, the Commission shall require applicants to avoid
wetlands alteration wherever feasible, to minimize wetlands alteration and,
where alteration is unavoidable, to incorporate mitigation measures into the
project design.
A permit shall expire three years from the date of issuance.
Notwithstanding the above, the Commission in its discretion may issue a
permit of unlimited duration for recurring or continuous maintenance work,
provided that annual notification of time and location of work is given to the
Commission. Any permit may be renewed for one or more additional periods
of up to three years, provided that a request for a renewal is received in
writing by the Commission at least 30 days prior to expiration.
For good cause the Commission may revoke or modify a permit or
determination issued under this by-law after notice to the holder of the
permit or determination, notice to the public, abutters and town boards,
pursuant to §§ 5 and 6, and a public hearing.
The Commission in an appropriate case may combine the permit or
determination issued under this by-law with the order of conditions or
determination of applicability issued under the Wetlands Protection Act,
MGL c. 131, § 40, and regulations, 310 CMR 10.00.
No work proposed in any permit application shall be undertaken until the
permit issued by the Commission with respect to such work has been
recorded in the Registry of Deeds or, if the land affected is registered land,
in the registry section of the land court for the district wherein the land lies,
and until the holder of the permit certifies, in writing, to the Commission
that the permit has been recorded.
§ 9. Coordination with other boards.
Any person filing a permit application or request for determination of
applicability shall give notice thereof, by certified mail or hand delivery to
the Planning Board, the Board of Health and Board of Selectmen. If a permit
is required from the Board of Appeals, the applicant shall also furnish a copy
to that Board.
The Commission shall, to the extent practicable, coordinate with any other
board reviewing the project, and having similar authority to recover its
consulting fees from the applicant, in an effort to avoid duplication of
consulting services.
§ 8 ANDOVER CODE § 10
Charter:362
§ 10. Security.
As part of a permit issued under this by-law, the Commission may require,
in addition to any security required by any other town or state board,
commission, agency or officer, that the performance and observance of the
conditions imposed hereunder be secured wholly or in part by one or more
of the methods described below:
§ 11. Regulations.
The Commission shall promulgate after due notice and public hearing rules
and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this by-law, including rules
requiring the maintenance of an undisturbed vegetated buffer of not more
than 25 feet from the edge of any bank, freshwater wetland, marsh, wet
meadow, bog, swamp, reservoir, lake, pond, creek, river or stream, or any
land under said waters, except in the Fish Brook/Haggetts Pond Watershed
Protection Overlay District, and/or a vernal pool, where such rules may
require an undisturbed vegetated buffer of not more than 50 feet from those
resource areas. Failure by the Commission to promulgate such rules and
regulations or a legal declaration of their invalidity by a court of law shall
not act to invalidate or suspend the effect of this by-law.
§ 12. Enforcement.
No person shall remove, fill, dredge, build upon, degrade or otherwise alter
resource areas protected by this by-law, or cause, suffer or allow such
activity to continue or allow such fill or other alteration to be left in place,
without the required authorization pursuant to this by-law.
The Commission, its agents, officers and employees shall have authority,
with prior approval from the property owner or pursuant to court process,
to enter upon privately owned land for the purpose of performing their
duties under this by-law and may make or cause to be made such
examinations, surveys or sampling as the Commission deems necessary.
The Commission shall have authority to enforce this by-law, its regulations
and permits issued thereunder by violation notices, administrative orders
and civil and criminal court actions. Any person who violates provisions of
By a proper bond or deposit of money or negotiable securities, sufficient
in the opinion of the Conservation Commission to secure performance
of the conditions and observance of the safeguards of such permit, to
be released upon the issuance of a certificate of compliance for work
performed pursuant to the permit; or
(a)
By a conservation restriction, easement or other covenant enforceable
in a court of law, executed and duly recorded by the owner of record,
running with the land to the benefit of the Commission, whereby the
permit conditions shall be performed and observed before any lot may
be conveyed other than by mortgage deed.
(b)
§ 10 TOWN CHARTER § 12
Charter:363
this by-law may be ordered to restore the property to its original condition
and take other action deemed necessary to remedy such violations.
Upon request of the Commission, the Town Manager and Town Counsel,
with the approval of the Board of Selectmen, may take legal action for
enforcement under civil law. Upon request of the Commission, the Chief of
Police may take legal action for enforcement under criminal law.
Municipal boards and officers, including any police officer or other officer
having police powers, shall have authority to assist the Commission in
enforcement.
As an alternative to criminal prosecution in a specific case, the Commission
may issue citations under the noncriminal disposition procedures set forth
in Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 40, Section 21D. Any person who
violates any provision of this by-law or regulations issued thereunder shall
be punished by a fine of $200. Each day or portion thereof during which
a violation continues, or unauthorized fill or other alteration remains in
place, shall constitute a separate offense, and each provision of the bylaw,
regulations, permit or administrative order violated shall constitute a
separate offense. [Amended 4-23-2002 ATM, Art. 29]
§ 13. Relation to Wetlands Protection Act.
This by-law is adopted under the Home Rule Amendment of the
Massachusetts Constitution and the Home Rule Statutes, independent of
the Wetlands Protection Act, MGL c. 131, § 40, and regulations, 310 CMR
10.00, thereunder.
§ 14. Severability.
The invalidity of any section or provision of this by-law shall not invalidate
any other section or provision thereto, nor shall it invalidate any order of
conditions which has previously become final.
§ 15. Effective date.
This by-law shall take effect as provided in MGL, c. 40, § 32, and shall apply
to any activity described herein which occurs after its effective date, except
that this by-law shall not apply to any activity described in a notice of intent
or request for determination of applicability filed with the Conservation
Commission under the Wetlands Protection Act on or before the date of its
adoption by Town Meeting vote, provided that such activity is subsequently
approved in a final order of conditions or determination of applicability
issued under the said Act.
