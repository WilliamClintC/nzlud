or declared unlawful, or fails to act when the failure is thereby prohibited
or declared unlawful, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished as for a

   All fines, forfeitures and penalties recovered by the city for the

monies. Payment shall be made in the manner, at the time and in the

   When a penalty or forfeiture is provided for the violation of a
chapter, section, subdivision, paragraph or provision of this City Code, the
penalty or forfeiture shall be construed to be for each such violation.

§ 1.10  CERTIFICATION OF MISDEMEANOR AS PETTY MISDEMEANOR.



   Subd. 1.   General Rule. Except as provided in Subd. 2. below, if
the prosecuting attorney believes it is in the interest of justice that the
defendant not be imprisoned if convicted, an alleged misdemeanor violation
may be treated as a petty misdemeanor. The prosecuting attorney shall certify
that belief to the Court at or before the time of arraignment or pretrial
hearing. The Court shall approve the certification motion but the defendant's
consent to the certification is not required. When an offense is certified as
a petty misdemeanor under this section, the defendant's eligibility for Court
appointed counsel must be evaluated as though the offense were a misdemeanor.



   Subd. 2.   Certain Violations Excepted. Subd. 1 above shall not
apply to a misdemeanor violation of M.S. §§ 169A.20, 609.224, 609.226,
609.324(3), 609.52, 617.23, or 609.2242, as amended, (or any ordinance that
conforms in substantial part to these state statutes). A violation of the
state statutes, or ordinances in conformity therewith, must be treated as a
misdemeanor unless the defendant consents to the certification of the
violation as a petty misdemeanor.



   Subd. 3.   Use of Conviction for Enhancement. Notwithstanding any
other law, a conviction for a violation that was originally charged as a
misdemeanor and was treated as a petty misdemeanor under Subd. 1. above, or
the Rules of Criminal Procedure, may not be used as the basis for charging a
subsequent violation as a gross misdemeanor rather than a misdemeanor.



§ 1.11  TITLES.



   A title or caption to or in any chapter, section, subdivision,
subparagraph or other provision of the City Code is for convenience only and
shall not limit, expand or otherwise alter or control the content, wording or
interpretation thereof.



§ 1.12  REFERENCE TO A PUBLIC OFFICIAL.



   Wherever an appointed public official is referred to in the City Code,
the reference shall include the public official or his or her designee.



§ 1.13  ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS AND CIVIL PENALTIES.



   Subd. 1.   Purpose. The City Council finds that there is a need for
alternative methods of enforcing the City Code. While criminal fines and
penalties have been the most frequent enforcement mechanism, there are
certain negative consequences for both the city and the accused. The delay
inherent in that system does not ensure prompt resolution. Citizens resent
being labeled as criminals for violations of administrative regulations. The
higher burden of proof and the potential of incarceration do not appear
appropriate for most administrative violations. The criminal process does not
always regard City Code violations as being important. Accordingly, the City
Council finds that the use of administrative citations and the imposition of
civil penalties is a legitimate and necessary alternative method of
enforcement. This method of enforcement is in addition to any other legal
remedy that may be pursued for City Code violations.



   Subd. 2.   General Provisions.



      A.   A violation of a provision of the City Code is an
administrative offense, that may be subject to an administrative citation and
civil penalties. Each day a violation exists constitutes a separate offense.



      B.   An administrative offense may be subject to a civil
penalty not exceeding $1,000.



      C.   The City Council must adopt by resolution a schedule of
fines for offenses initiated by administration citation. The City Council is
not bound by that schedule when a matter is appealed to it for administrative
review. The City Council may adopt a schedule of fees to be paid to
administrative Hearing Officers.



      D.   The City Administrator must adopt procedures for
administering the administrative citation program.



   Subd. 3.   Administrative Citation.



      A.   A person authorized to enforce provisions of the City
Code may issue an administrative citation upon belief that a code violation
has occurred. The citation must be issued in person or by mail to the person
responsible for the violation or attached to the motor vehicle in the case of
a vehicular offense. The citation must state the date, time and nature of the
offense, the name of the issuing officer, the amount of the scheduled fine
and the manner for paying the fine or appealing the citation.



      B.   The person responsible for the violation must either pay
the scheduled fine or request a hearing within seven days after issuance.
Payment of the fine constitutes admission of the violation. A late payment
fee of 10% of the scheduled fine shall be imposed in accordance with Subd.
7.D. below.



   Subd. 4.   Administrative Hearing.



      A.   Hearing. Any person contesting an administrative offense
pursuant to this subdivision may, within seven days of the time of issuance
of the notice, request a hearing by a Hearing Officer who shall forthwith
conduct an informal hearing to determine if a violation has occurred.



      B.   Hearing Procedures. Notice of the hearing must be served
in person or by mail on the person responsible for the violation at least ten
days in advance, unless a shorter time is accepted by all parties. At the
hearing, the parties will have the opportunity to present testimony and
question any witnesses, but strict rules of evidence will not apply. The
Hearing Officer must tape record the hearing and receive testimony and
exhibits. The Officer must receive and give weight to evidence, including
hearsay evidence, that possesses probative value commonly accepted by
reasonable and prudent people in the conduct of their affairs.



      C.   Hearing Officer. A city employee designated in writing by
the City Administrator shall be the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer is
authorized to hear and determine any controversy relating to administrative
offenses provided for in this section.



      D.   Authority.



         1.   The Hearing Officer has the authority to determine
that a violation occurred, to dismiss a citation, to impose the scheduled
fine and to reduce, stay or waive a scheduled fine either unconditionally or
upon compliance with appropriate conditions. When imposing a penalty for a
violation, the Hearing Officer may consider any or all of the following
factors:



            a.   The duration of the violation;



            b.   The frequency or reoccurrence of the
violation;



            c.   The seriousness of the violation;



            d.   The history of the violation;



            e.   The violator's conduct after issuance of the
notice of hearing;



            f.   The good faith effort by the violator to
comply;



            g.   The economic impact of the penalty on the
violator;



            h.   The impact of the violation upon the
community; and



            i.   Any other factors appropriate to a just
result.



         2.   a.   The Hearing Officer may exercise discretion
to impose a fine for more than one day of a continuing violation, but only
upon a finding that:



               (1)   The violation caused a serious threat
of harm to the public health, safety or welfare; or



               (2)   The accused intentionally and
unreasonably refused to comply with the code requirement.



            b.   The Hearing Officer's decision and supporting
reasons must be in writing.



      E.   Failure to Attend. The failure to attend the hearing
constitutes a waiver of the violator's rights to an administrative hearing
and an admission of the violation. A Hearing Officer may waive this result
upon good cause shown. Examples of "good cause" are: death or incapacitating
illness of the accused; a court order requiring the accused to appear for
another hearing at the same time; and lack of proper service of the citation
or notice of the hearing. "Good cause" does not include: forgetfulness and
intentional delay.



   Subd. 5.   Council Review.



      A.   Request for Review. The Hearing Officer's decision may be
appealed to the City Council by submitting a request in writing to the City
Clerk within ten days after the Hearing Officer's decision.



      B.   Notice. The appeal will be heard by the City Council
after notice served in person or by registered mail at least ten days in
advance. The parties to the hearing will have an opportunity to present oral
or written arguments regarding the Hearing Officer's decision.



      C.   Council Review. The City Council must consider the
record, the Hearing Officer's decision and any additional arguments before
making a determination. The Council is not bound by the Hearing Officer's
decision, but may adopt all or part of the officer's decision. The Council's
decision must be in writing.



      D.   Council Action. If the Council makes a finding of a
violation, it may impose a civil penalty not exceeding $1,000 per day per
violation, and may consider any or all of the factors contained in Subd. 4.D.
of this chapter. The Council may also reduce, stay or waive a fine
unconditionally or based on reasonable and appropriate conditions.



      E.   License Suspension or Revocation. In addition to imposing
a civil penalty, the Council may suspend or revoke a city-issued license,
permit or other approval associated with the violation.



   Subd. 6.   Judicial Review. An aggrieved party may obtain judicial
review of the decision of the Hearing Officer or the City Council by
proceeding under a writ of certiorari in District Court.



   Subd. 7.   Recovery of Civil Penalties.



      A.   If a civil penalty is not paid within the time specified,
it will constitute:



         1.   A lien on the real property upon which the
violation occurred if the property or improvements on the property was the
subject of the violation and the property owner was found responsible for
that violation; or



         2.   A personal obligation of the violator in all other
situations.



      B.   A lien may be assessed against the property and collected
in the same manner as taxes.



      C.   A personal obligation may be collected by appropriate
legal means.



      D.   A late payment fee of 10% of the fine may be assessed for
each 30-day period, or part thereof, that the fine remains unpaid after the
due date.



      E.   During the time that a civil penalty remains unpaid, a
license, permit or other city approval or authorization of any kind may not
be granted when sought by a violator or for property under the violator's
ownership or control.



      F.   Failure to pay a fine is grounds for suspending or
revoking a license related to the violation.



   Subd. 8.   Criminal Penalties.



      A.   The following are misdemeanors, punishable in accordance
with state law:



         1.   Failure, without good cause, to appear at a hearing
that was scheduled under Subd. 4. above;



         2.   Failure to pay a fine imposed by a Hearing Officer
within 30 days after it was imposed, or such other time as may be established
by the Hearing Officer, unless the matter is appealed under Subd. 5. above;
and



         3.   Failure to pay a fine imposed by the City Council
within 30 days after it was imposed, or such other time as may be established
by the City Council.



      B.   If the final adjudication in the administrative penalty
procedure is a finding of no violation, then the city may not prosecute a
criminal violation in District Court based on the same set of facts. This
does not preclude the city from pursuing a criminal conviction for a
violation of the same provision based on a different set of facts. A
different date of violation will constitute a different set of facts.



   Subd. 9.   Disposition of Penalties. All penalties collected
pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the city's General Fund.



   Subd. 10.   Offenses and Penalties. Offenses which may be charged as
administrative offenses and the penalties for such offenses may be
established by resolution of the City Council from time to time. Copies of
such resolutions shall be maintained in the office of the City Administrator.



   Subd. 11.   Restitution.



      A.   Demand for Restitution. If the city incurs a loss as a
direct result of a violation of a provision of the City Code subject to this
section, a demand for restitution shall be made at the same time that the
administrative citation is issued. The demand must describe the items or
elements of loss, itemize the total dollar amounts of restitution claimed and
specify the reasons justifying these amounts.



      B.   Appeal. The person receiving such a demand for
restitution may challenge the demand in the manner provided for in Subds. 4.
and 5. of this section, but must do so by requesting a hearing within 30 days
of receiving written notification of the amount of restitution demanded. The
hearing request must be made in writing and filed with the City
Administrator. A person may not challenge the amount of the restitution
demanded after the 30-day time period has passed. A person may challenge the
demand for restitution without contesting the administrative offense.
Notwithstanding the 30-day time period, a person contesting the
administrative offense must comply with the seven-day time period contained
in Subd. 4. above. Payment of the demanded restitution constitutes an
admission of liability.



      C.   Dispute; Evidentiary Burden; Procedures. At the hearing
on the restitution challenge, the person challenging the restitution shall
have the burden to produce evidence if the person intends to challenge the
amount of restitution or specific items of restitution or their dollar
amounts. This burden of production must include a detailed sworn affidavit of
the person setting forth all challenges to the restitution or items of
restitution, and specifying all reasons justifying dollar amounts of
restitution which differ from the amounts demanded by the city. The affidavit
must be filed with the City Administrator at least five business days before
the hearing. A dispute as to the proper amount or type of restitution must be
resolved by the Hearing Officer or City Council by the preponderance of the
evidence. The burden of demonstrating the amount of loss sustained by the
city as a result of the ordinance violation and the appropriateness of a
particular type of restitution is on the city.

§ 1.14  EFFECTIVE DATE OF ORDINANCES.



   The City Charter controls the effective date and as to any dates that
may be passage dates and not effective dates contained below the sections of
the code, the effective date is the date that the ordinance creating the
particular section was published, pursuant to the Redwood Falls Charter
provisions.



§ 1.15  ADOPTING FUTURE AMENDMENTS TO STATUTES AND RULES BY REFERENCE.



   It is the intention of the City Council that, when adopting the Code of
Ordinances, all future amendments to any state or federal rules and statutes
adopted by reference in this code shall be included by reference in the code
as if the amended statute or rule had been in existence at the time the code
was adopted.

   Regular meetings of the Council shall be held on the first and third

   Special meetings of the Council may be called by the Mayor or by any

the Council by mailing a copy of the filing to all members who did not sign
or issue the call at least three days prior to the time stated therein, or by
personal service at least 72 hours prior to the projected time of meeting.
Special meetings may be held without prior written notice to the Council when
all Council members are present at the meeting or consent thereto in writing
before meeting of those not present. Any such consent shall be filed with the
City Administrator prior to the beginning of the meeting. Any special meeting
attended by all Council members shall be a valid meeting for the transaction
of any business that may come before the meeting. Meetings of the Council
which are adjourned from time to time shall not be subject to the foregoing
notice requirements; nor shall special meetings which, in the judgment of the
Council, require immediate consideration to meet an emergency require the
notice, but may be called by telephone communication or any other expeditious
means. In all such cases, the members of the Council in attendance shall sign
a waiver of notice which shall be made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
Notice to the public and to news media shall be given as required by statute.

decision to be challenged by the appellant. At such hearing the appellant may
present any evidence he or she deems pertinent to the appeal, but the city

Mayor, or other officer presiding at the hearing, may, in the interest of
justice or to comply with time requirements and on his or her own motion or
the motion of the appellant, the City Administrator, or a member of the
Council, adjourn the hearing to a more convenient time or place, but such
time or place shall be fixed and determined before adjournment so as to avoid
the necessity for formal notice of reconvening.

§ 2.71  FRANCHISES.



   Subd. 1.   Definition. The term "franchise", as used in this
section, shall be construed to mean any special privileges granted to any
person in, over, upon or under any of the streets or public places of the
city, whether the privilege has heretofore been granted by it or by the state
or shall hereafter be granted by the city or by the state.



   Subd. 2.   Franchise Ordinances. The Council may grant franchises by
ordinance. Franchise rights shall always be subject to the superior right of
the public to the use of streets and public places. All persons desiring to

the public's right in such places, or desiring the privilege of placing in,
over, upon or under any street or public place any permanent or
semi-permanent fixtures for the purpose of constructing or operating
railways, telegraphing or transmitting electricity, or transporting by
pneumatic tubes, or for furnishing to the city or its inhabitants or any
portion thereof, transportation facilities, water, light, heat, power, gas or
any other such utility, or for any other purpose, shall be required to obtain
a franchise before proceeding to make the use of the streets or public places
or before proceeding to place such fixtures in such places.



   Subd. 3.   Power of Regulation Reserved. The city shall have the
right and power to regulate and control the exercise by any person, of any
franchise however acquired, and whether the franchise has been heretofore
granted by it or by the state.

part all the terms of this section and will comply with all pertinent

time be amended.



      B.   The grantee shall, in no case, claim or pretend to
exercise any power to fix fares, rates and charges; but that the fares, rates
and charges shall at all times be just, fair and reasonable for the services
rendered and shall in all cases be fixed and from time to time changed,
unless regulated by an agency of the state, in the manner following:



         1.   A reasonable rate shall be construed to be one
which will, with efficient management, normally yield above all operating
expenses and depreciation, a fair return upon all money invested.



         2.   If possible, maximum rates and charges shall be
arrived at by direct negotiation with the Council.



         3.   If direct negotiations fail to produce agreement,
the Council shall, not less than 30 days before the expiration of any
existing rate schedule or agreement, appoint an expert as its representative,
the franchisee shall likewise appoint an expert as its representative and the
two of them shall appoint a third person, preferably an expert, and the three
of them shall constitute a Board of Arbitration. The Board shall report its
findings as soon as possible and the rates and charges it shall agree upon by
majority vote shall be legal and binding, subject only to review by a court
of competent jurisdiction upon application of one of the parties.



      C.   The Council shall have the right to require reasonable
extensions of any public service system from time to time, and to make such
rules and regulations as may be required to secure adequate and proper
service and to provide sufficient accommodations for the public.



      D.   The grantee shall not issue any capital stock on account
of the franchise or the value thereof, and that the grantee shall have no
right to receive upon condemnation proceedings brought by the city to acquire
the public utility exercising the franchise, any return on account of the
franchise or its value.



      E.   No sale or lease of the franchise shall be effective
until the assignee or lessee shall have filed with the city an instrument,
duly executed, reciting the facts of the sale or lease, accepting the terms
of the franchise and agreeing to perform all the conditions required of the
grantee thereunder.



      F.   Every grant of a franchise permitting the erection of
poles, masts or other fixtures in the streets and for the attachment of wires
thereto, or for the laying of tracks in, or of pipes or conduits under the
streets or public places, or for placing in the streets or other public
places any permanent or semi-permanent fixtures whatsoever, shall be subject
to the conditions that the Council shall have the power to require the
alterations therein, or relocation or rerouting thereof, as the Council may
at any time deem necessary, for the safety, health or convenience of the
public. Particularly, the Council shall have the power to require the removal
of poles, masts and other fixtures bearing wires and placing underground all
facilities for whatsoever purpose used.



      G.   Every franchise shall contain a provision granting the
city the right to acquire the same in accordance with statute.



      H.   The franchisee may be obligated by the city to pay the
city fees to raise revenue or defray increased costs accruing as a result of
utility operations, or both, including, but not limited to, a sum of money
based upon gross operating revenues or gross earnings from its operations in
the city.



   Subd. 5.   Further Provisions of Franchises. The enumeration and
specification of particular matters which must be included in every franchise

right of the city to insert in any such franchise or renewal or extension
thereof such other and further conditions and restrictions as the Council may
deem proper to protect the city's interests, nor shall anything contained in
this section limit any right or power possessed by the city over existing
franchises.

as defined in M.S. Chapter 168B, as amended from time to time, that has
remained illegally for a period of more than 48 hours on public property
owned or controlled by a unit of government, or more than four hours on that
property when it is properly posted, or on private property for a period of
time, as determined under M.S. Chapter 168B, as it may be amended from time
to time, without the consent of the person in control of the property and
lacks vital component parts or is in an inoperable condition such that it has
no substantial potential for further use consistent with its usual functions,
unless it is kept in an enclosed garage or building. It shall also mean a
motor vehicle voluntarily surrendered by its owner to and accepted by the
city.  A classic car or pioneer car, as defined by M.S. Chapter 168B, as it
may be amended from time to time, shall not be considered an abandoned motor
vehicle within the meaning of this section. Vehicles on the premises of junk
yards or automobile graveyards, which are defined, maintained, and licensed
in accordance with the City Code, shall not be considered to be abandoned
motor vehicles within the meaning of this section.



         2.   The term "vital component parts" means those parts
of a motor vehicle that are essential to the mechanical functioning of the
vehicle, including, but not limited to, the motor, drive train and wheels.



      B.   Custody. The city may take into custody and impound any
abandoned motor vehicle.



      C.   Notice.



         1.   When the city takes possession of an abandoned
motor vehicle or impounds a motor vehicle, the city shall give notice of the
taking within five days. The notice shall set forth the date and place of the
taking, the year, make, model and serial number of the abandoned motor
vehicle, if the information can be reasonably obtained, and the place where
the vehicle is being held, shall inform the owner and any lien holders of
their right to reclaim the vehicle under Subd. 1.D. below, and shall state
that failure of the owner or lien holder to exercise his or her right to
reclaim the vehicle and contents shall be deemed a waiver by him or her of
all rights, title and interest in the vehicle and a consent to the sale of
the vehicle and contents at a public auction pursuant to Subd. 1.E. below.



         2.   The notice shall be sent by mail to the registered
owner, if any, of the abandoned motor vehicle and to all readily identifiable
lien holders of record. If it is impossible to determine with reasonable
certainty the identity and address of the registered owner and all lien
holders, the notice shall be published once in the official newspaper.
Published notices may be grouped together for convenience and economy.



      D.   Right to Reclaim.

sale under this section 15 days after notice to the owner if the vehicle is
determined to be a junk vehicle, as defined by M.S. Chapter 168B, as it may
be amended from time to time, or an abandoned vehicle. If an unauthorized
vehicle (as defined as M.S. Chapter 168B, as it may be amended from time to
time) is impounded by the city, the impounded vehicle is eligible for
disposal or sale the earlier of 45 days after notice to the owner of the date
of a voluntary written title transfer by the registered owner to the impound
lot operator.



         2.   An abandoned motor vehicle and contents taken into
custody and not reclaimed within the waiting periods described in the
previous subdivision, shall be sold to the highest bidder at public auction
or sale, following one notice published at least seven days prior to the
auction or sale. The purchaser shall be given a receipt in a form prescribed
by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles which shall be sufficient title to dispose
of the vehicle. The receipt shall also entitle the purchaser to register the
vehicle and receive a certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
claims of ownership. Before the vehicle is issued a new certificate of title,
it must receive a motor vehicle safety check.



         3.   From the proceeds of the sale pursuant to this
section, the city shall reimburse itself for the cost of towing, preserving
and storing the vehicle, and all administrative, notice and publication costs
incurred pursuant to this subdivision. Any remainder from the proceeds of a
sale shall be held for the owner of the vehicle or an entitles lien holder
for 90 days and then shall be deposited in the General Fund of the city.

         2.   Where the city enters into a contract with a person
duly licensed by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, the Agency shall
review the contract to determine whether it conforms to the Agency's plan for
solid waste disposal. A contract that does so conform may be approved by the
Agency. Where a contract has been approved, the Agency may reimburse the city
for the costs incurred under the contract which have not been reimbursed.



         3.   If the city utilizes its own equipment and
personnel for disposal of the abandoned motor vehicle, it shall be entitled

cash and negotiables. The notice shall be published once at least three weeks
prior to sale. Sale shall be made to the highest bidder at public auction or
sale conducted in the manner directed by the Council in its resolution
declaring property abandoned and stated in the notice.



      D.   Fund and Claims Thereon. All proceeds from the sale shall
be paid into the General Fund of the city and expenses thereof paid

   Subd. 1.   Partial Prepayment of Assessments Permitted. After the
adoption of an assessment roll pursuant to M.S. Chapter 429, as amended from
time to time, and before certification of the assessment roll to the County

and directed to accept partial prepayment of the assessment, but not less
than 50% of the total amount of any assessment, and reduce the amount
certified to the County Auditor accordingly. As provided by law, partial

of the assessment roll.



   Subd. 2.   Scope. This section shall apply to all assessment rolls
which, on the effective date hereof, have been adopted by the Council, but
not yet certified to the County Auditor, and to all assessment rolls

§ 2.83  COMMERCIAL REHABILITATION LOAN PROGRAM.



   Subd. 1.   Purpose. The Council finds that within the city there is
a need for a city program for rehabilitation of small and medium-sized
commercial buildings which are physically deteriorating and in need of
rehabilitation and that the provision of affordable loans to effect the
rehabilitation of small and medium-size commercial buildings will preserve
and enhance the city's tax base and will assist in the implementation of the
Redwood Falls Comprehensive Plan thereby protecting the health and safety and
promoting the general welfare of the community and its residents.



   Subd. 2.   Findings. The Council further finds and determines:



      A.   The city has carried out a commercial rehabilitation loan
program in conjunction with a grant received from the Department of Trade and
Economic Development in 1995 through its Small Cities Development Program;



      B.   The terms of the grant obligated to the city to use the
income received as a result of the program to address future commercial
revitalization needs;



      C.   Within the incorporated areas of the city there exists
small and medium-sized commercial buildings which are physically
deteriorating, under-used, economically inefficient and in need of
rehabilitation in order to meet applicable building codes;



      D.   Some owners of small and medium-sized commercial
buildings are unable to obtain rehabilitation loans because the loans are not
available on terms which the owners can afford or are not available to them
on any terms from time to time because of restrictions in the private lending
market;



      E.   In carrying out the commercial rehabilitation loan
program referenced above, the city has learned that public participation with
private lenders in commercial rehabilitation loans enhances the lenders'
willingness to make loans to owners of or tenants in small and medium-sized
commercial buildings and by reducing interest charged on the public share of
the loans makes the combined loan affordable to the owners; and



      F.   The provisions of publicly assisted commercial
rehabilitation loans throughout the entire city under authority of M.S. §
469.184, as amended from time to time, is essential to the physical
rehabilitation of small and medium-sized buildings within, and the economic
revitalization of, the city's neighborhood and downtown commercial areas on a
comprehensive basis, in accordance with the objectives and policies of the
Redwood Falls Comprehensive Plan, thereby stabilizing and increasing the
municipal tax base and contributing to the health, safety and general welfare
as well as the preservation of the quality of life of the residents of the
city.



   Subd. 3.   Definitions. The following words and phrases, when used
in this chapter, shall have the meanings respectfully ascribed to them in

prepared and submitted for Council consideration and adoption program
regulations, as defined in Subd. 3. hereof, contemporaneously with the
adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived.

therewith;



         2.   Any charge for a municipal utility service, or any

premises served, is unpaid after due notice thereof;



            a.    The city's form for application for utility
service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the title, address, room
number, and telephone number of the official in charge of billing, clearly
visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:

considered.  In the absence of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the
hearing procedure provided herein, service will be discontinued at the time
specified, but in no event until the charges have been due and unpaid for at
least 30 days.



            c.   When it becomes necessary for the city to
discontinue utility service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service
will be reinstated only after all bills for service then due have been paid,

attention. Failure to allow or refusing entry to any city employee into and
upon the private property of the customer for the purpose of inspecting,
repairing, reading meters, connecting or disconnecting the municipal utility
service, while in the course and scope of their employment, is considered
prohibited and unlawful.



   Subd. 6.   Meter Test. Whenever a consumer shall request the city to
test any utility meter in use by him or her, such a request shall be
accompanied by a cash deposit for each meter to be tested. If any such meter
is found to be inaccurate the same shall be replaced with an accurate meter
and the deposit thereon refunded. If the meter shall be found to be accurate
in its recordings or calculations it shall be reinstalled and the deposit

      A.   Public Utility Charges. The owner of any tract or parcel
of real property connected to the city's waterworks system, storm or sanitary
sewer system, electrical system or any or all of those, will be liable to the
city for the payment of any rates or charges for water, sewage or electrical
service, to such piece or parcel of real property. Consumption of the
services by any person or entity other than the fee owner shall not relieve
the fee owner of the premises served of the responsibility for payment of the
rates or charges.

of other taxes in the following year. The City Clerk will prepare and file in
his or her office an assessment roll not later than October 1 of each year
providing for the special assessment of all such delinquent accounts against

at his or her last known address who appears as owner of the premises in the
files of the County Recorder or by service of the notice as provided in the
case of civil actions.



         2.   Each assessment will be payable on or before the
first Monday of the following January. Interest on the assessment will be
charged at the rate established by the assessment resolution. Interest will

property so assessed may, at any time prior to certification of the
assessment to the County Auditor, pay to the City Treasurer the whole of the
assessment covering the property with interest at the same rate as
established above accrued to the date of payment.



         3.   Upon adoption by the City Council, the City Clerk

WATER SERVICE



§ 3.30  RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO WATER SERVICE.



   Subd. 1.   Deficiency of Water and Shutting Off Water. The city is
not liable for any deficiency or failure in the supply of water to customers
whether occasioned by shutting the water off for the purpose of making
repairs or connections or by any other cause whatever. In case of fire, or
alarm of fire, water may be shut off to insure a supply for fire fighting. In
making repairs or construction of new works, water may be shut off at any
time and kept off so long as may be necessary.



   Subd. 2.   Repair of Leaks. It is the responsibility of the consumer
or owner to maintain the water service from the curb stop into the house or
other building. In case of failure upon the part of any consumer or owner to
repair any leak occurring in his or her water service within 24 hours after
oral or written notice has been given to the owner or occupant of the
premises, the water may be shut off and will not be turned on until a
reconnection charge has been paid and the water service has been repaired.
When the waste of water is great or when damage is likely to result from the
leak, the water will be turned off if the repair is not proceeded with
immediately.



   Subd. 3.   Increasing Size of Water Service. When it is desired to
increase the size of water service from the main, a new permit shall be taken
out and the regular tapping charge shall be made as if this were a new
service.



   Subd. 4.   Service Pipes. Every service pipe must be laid in such
manner as to prevent rupture by settlement. The service pipe shall be placed
not less than eight feet below the surface in all cases so arranged as to
prevent rupture and stoppage by freezing. Frozen service pipes between the
curb stop and the building shall be the responsibility of the owner. Service
pipes must extend from the curb stops to the inside of the building; or if
not taken into a building then to the hydrant or other fixtures which they
are intended to supply. A valve, the same size as the service pipe, shall be
placed close to the inside wall of the building, ahead of the meter and well
protected from freezing. Type "K" copper tubing shall be used up to and
including two-inch services. Joints on copper tubing shall be flared and kept
to a minimum. Not more than one joint shall be used for a service up to 70
feet in length. All joints shall be left uncovered until inspected. All
services of more than two inches in diameter shall be composed of cast iron
mechanical joint pipe. Minimum size connection with the water mains shall be
three-fourths inch in diameter for single-occupancy residences and one inch
in diameter for all other establishments.



   Subd. 5.   Private Water Supplies. No water pipe of the city water
system shall be connected with any pump, well, pipe, tank or any device that
is connected with any other source of water supply and when such are found,
the city shall notify the owner or occupant to disconnect the same and, if
not immediately done, the city water shall be turned off. Before any new
connections to the city system are permitted, the city shall ascertain that
no cross-connections will exist when the new connection is made. When a
building is connected to "city water" the private water supply may be used
only for such purposes as the city may allow.



   Subd. 6.   Prohibited Uses or Restricted Hours. Whenever the city
shall determine that a shortage of water threatens the city, it may entirely
prohibit water use or limit the times and hours during which water may be
used from the city water system for lawn and garden sprinkling, irrigation,
car washing, air conditioning and other uses or either or any of them. It is
unlawful for any water consumer to cause or permit water to be used in
violation of the determination after public announcement thereof has been
made through the news media specifically indicating the restrictions thereof.



   Subd. 7.   Private Fire Hose Connections. Owners of structures with
self-contained fire protection systems may apply for and obtain permission to
connect the street mains with hydrants, large pipes and hose couplings, for
use in case of fire only, at their own installation expense and at such rates
as the Council may adopt by resolution as herein provided.



   Subd. 8.   Opening Hydrants. It is unlawful for any person, other
than members of the Fire Department or other person duly authorized by the
city, in pursuance of lawful purpose, to open any fire hydrant or attempt to
draw water from the same or in any manner interfere therewith. It is also
unlawful for any person so authorized to deliver or suffer to be delivered to
any other person any hydrant key or wrench, except for the purposes strictly
pertaining to their lawful use.



   Subd. 9.   Unmetered Service. Unmetered service may be provided for
construction, flooding skating rinks and any other purpose. The service shall
be at a duly adopted rate. Where it is difficult or impossible to accurately
measure the amount of water taken, unmetered service may be provided and the
unmetered rate applied; provided, however, that, by acceptance thereof the
consumer agrees to have the city estimate the water used. In so estimating,
the city shall consider the use to which the water is put and the length of
time of unmetered service.



   Subd. 10.   Water Meters. All water meters shall be purchased by the
property owner and maintained by the city. All repairs of water meters not
resulting from normal usage shall be the responsibility of the property
owner. Any other meter in need of replacement shall be replaced with a remote
type which shall be furnished and maintained by the city. All water meters
shall be installed and controlled by the city and the cost of installation
shall be the responsibility of the property owner. Any remote type meter in
need of replacement by reason of normal usage shall be furnished and
installed by the city, thereafter, the city shall own the meter.



   Subd. 11.   Code Requirement. All piping, connections and
appurtenances shall be installed and performed strictly in accordance with
the Minnesota Plumbing Code. Failure to install or maintain the same in
accordance therewith, or failure to have or permit required inspections
shall, upon discovery by the city, be an additional ground for termination of
water service to any consumer.



   Subd. 12.   Tampering With Water Meters. It is unlawful for any
person other than those duly authorized by the city to adjust the reading,
disconnect the recording mechanism or in any way deliberately damage any
water meter or remote meter. Upon installation of the meter and the remote
meter, a seal shall be placed upon the unit by a city employee. To the extent
that the seal is broken or there is other evidence of tampering with the
meter or the remote, the owner of the premises or the individual known to be
personally responsible for the tampering is guilty of violation of this
section.



   Subd. 13.   Additional Rules and Regulations. The Council may, by
resolution, adopt such additional rules and regulations relating to
placement, size and type of equipment as it, in its discretion, deems
necessary or desirable. Copies of such additional rules and regulations shall
be kept on file in the office of the City Administrator and uniformly
enforced.

         2.   The allocation of users to these categories for the
purpose of assessing user charges and debt service charges shall be the
responsibility of the City Administrator. Allocation of users to user classes
shall be based on the substantive intent of the definitions of these classes
contained herein.



      B.   Classification. Each user shall pay operation,
maintenance and replacement costs in proportion of the user's proportionate
contribution of wastewater flows and loadings to the treatment plant, with
the minimum rate for loading of BOD and TSS being the rate established for
concentrations of 200 mg/l BOD and 250 mg/l TSS (i.e. normal domestic
strength wastewater). Those industrial users discharging segregated normal
domestic strength wastewater only can be classified as commercial users for
the purpose of rate determination.



      C.   Billable wastewater volume. The charges assessed
residential users and those users of other classes who discharge normal
domestic strength wastewater shall be established proportionately according
to billable wastewater volume. Billable wastewater volume shall be calculated
as follows.



         1.   Residential Users. Billable wastewater volume for
residential users shall be calculated on the basis of monthly metered water
usage.

non-residential users will be determined in the same manner as for
residential users. Except that if the city determines that there are
significant seasonal variations in the metered water usage of non-residential
users resulting in a proportionate increase in wastewater volume; then
billable wastewater volume shall be:



               (1)   Calculated on the basis of average
metered water usage as recorded throughout the year; and



               (2)   Calculated on the basis of wastewater
flow meters.



            b.   The city may, as its discretion, require
non-residential users to install such additional water meters or wastewater
flow meters as may be necessary to determine billable wastewater volume.



      D.   Determination of User Charges. User charges for normal
domestic strength users shall be determined as follows.



         1.   Calculations of Unit Cost for Treatment of Normal
Domestic Strength Wastewater.



 


Uomr  -

 
  Comr

   Where:      Uomr = Unit cost for operation, maintenance and
replacement in $/100 feet 3 .



         Comr = Total Annual OM&R Costs (excluding billing and I and
I).



         Tbwv = Total annual billable wastewater volume in 100 ft 3 .



         2.   Calculations of User Charge.



Uc  = (Uomr x bwv) + Qfc



   Where:      Uomr = Unit cost for operation, maintenance and
replacement in $/100 ft 3 .



         bwv = Billable wastewater volume of a particular user in
kgal.



         Qfc = Fixed charge per connection for I and I and billing
costs per month.



      E.   Particular Connection. The sewer service charge for a
particular connection shall be determined as follows:



SSC = Uc + Cc



   Where:      SSC = Sewer service charge.



         Uc = User charge.



         Cc = Charge per connection for debt service and capital
construction costs.



      F.   Additional charges. The sewer service charges established
in this section shall not prevent the assessment of additional charges to
users who discharge wastes with concentrations greater than normal domestic
strength or wastes of unusual character, or contractual agreements with the
users, as long as the following conditions are met.



         1.   The user pays operation, maintenance and
replacement costs in proportion to the user's proportionate contribution of
wastewater flows and loadings to the treatment plant, and no user is charged
at a rate less than that of normal domestic strength wastewater.



         2.   The measurements of such wastes are conducted
according to the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater in a manner acceptable to the city as provided for in
this chapter.



         3.   A study of unit costs of collection and treatment
processes attributable to flow, BOD, TSS and other significant loadings shall
be developed for determining the proportionate allocation of costs to flows
and loadings for users discharging wastes of greater than normal domestic
strength or wastes of unusual character.



   Subd. 4.   Sewer Service Fund.



      A.   The city hereby establishes a Sewer Service Fund as an
income fund to receive all revenues generated by the sewer service charge
system, and all other income dedicated to the operation, maintenance,
replacement and construction of the wastewater treatment works, including
taxes, special charges, fees and assessments intended to retire construction
debt.



      B.   The city also establishes the following accounts as
income and expenditure accounts within the Sewer Service Fund:



         1.   Operation and Maintenance Account;



         2.   Equipment Replacement Account; and



         3.   Debt Retirement Account.



      C.   All revenue generated by the sewer service charge system,
and all other income pertinent to the treatment system, including taxes and
special assessments dedicated to retire construction debt, shall be held by
the City Administrator separate and apart from all other funds of the city.
Funds received by the Sewer Service Fund shall be transferred to the
"Operation and Maintenance Account", the "Equipment Replacement Account" and
the "Debt Retirement Account" in accordance with state and federal
regulations and the provisions of this section.



      D.   Revenue generated by the sewer service charge system
sufficient to insure adequate replacement throughout the design or useful
life, whichever is longer, of the wastewater facility shall be held separate
and apart in the "Equipment Replacement Account" and dedicated to affecting
replacement costs. Interest income generated by the "Equipment Replacement
Account" shall remain in the "Equipment Replacement Account".



      E.   Revenue generated by the sewer service charge system
sufficient for operation and maintenance shall be held separate and apart in
the "Operation and Maintenance Account".

Service Fund shall be administered according to the following provisions.



      A.   The City Administrator shall maintain a proper system of
accounts suitable for determining the operation and maintenance, equipment
replacement and debt retirement costs of the treatment works, and shall
furnish the Council with an auditor's report of the costs annually in June.



         1.   The Council shall annually determine whether or not
sufficient revenue is being generated for the effective operation,
maintenance, replacement and management of the treatment works, and whether
sufficient revenue is being generated for debt retirement. The Council will
also determine whether the user charges are distributed proportionately to
each user in accordance with this section and § 204(b)(2)(A) of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act, being 33 U.S.C. § 1284, as amended.



         2.   The city shall thereafter, but not later than the
end of the year, reassess and as necessary revise the sewer service charge
system then in use to ensure the proportionality of the user charges and to
ensure the sufficiency of funds to maintain the capacity and performance to
which the facilities were constructed, and to retire the construction debt.



      B.   In accordance with federal and state requirements, each
user will be notified annually in conjunction with a regular billing of that
portion of the sewer service charge attributable to operation, maintenance
and replacement.



      C.   In accordance with federal and state requirements, the
City Administrator shall be responsible for maintaining all records necessary
to document compliance with the sewer service charge system adopted.



      D.   Bills for sewer service charges shall be rendered on a
monthly basis succeeding the period for which the service was rendered and
shall be due on the date of rendering. Any bill not paid in full after the
due date printed on the bill will be considered delinquent. At that time, the
city shall notify the delinquent owner/occupant in writing regarding the
delinquent bill and subsequent penalty. The penalty shall be computed as 10%
of the original bill and any bill that becomes 60 days delinquent shall, upon
written notice and opportunity for hearing, be disconnected without further
consideration. Service may be restored after receipt of the amount owing,
plus a service charge and an additional deposit may be required.



      E.   Any additional costs caused by discharges to the
treatment works of toxics or other incompatible wastes, including the cost of
restoring wastewater treatment services, clean up and restoration of the
receiving waters and environs, and sludge disposal, shall be borne by the
discharger(s) of the wastes, at no expense to the city.



   Subd. 6.   Sewer Service Charge System Precedence. The sewer service
charge system shall take precedence over any terms or conditions of
agreements or contracts which are inconsistent with the requirements of §
204(b)(1)(A) of the Act, being 33 U.S.C. § 1284, and Federal Regulation 40
C.R.F. (Code of Federal Regulations) § 35.2140 of the Environmental
Protection Agency's grant regulations.

from time to time by further resolution of the Council.



   Subd. 2.   Basic Charge. All single-family residential properties
will be charged the basic rate, i.e., one REF-Residential Equivalency Factor.



   Subd. 3.   Properties Charged Greater Than One REF. Duplexes shall
be charged 1.2 REFs and four-plexes shall be charged 1.3 REFs. Any
residential development greater than a four-plex shall be considered
commercial property. All commercial property shall be calculated on an
individual basis based upon size and amount of run-off generated. Properties
which have storm water retention ponds will be given a 54.7% credit for that
portion of the property that is serviced by the pond.



   Subd. 4.   Exceptions to Charges. No city-owned property which is
funded through the General Fund will be charged a monthly fee. All city-owned
property which is funded through revenues will pay the equivalent commercial
rate. Undeveloped property having no hard surfaces will not be charged a
monthly fee. Any developed property that does not contribute run-off or does
not generate run-off related costs will not be charged a monthly fee. No
privately-owned property shall be exempt from charges on the basis it is
vacant and unoccupied.



   Subd. 5.   Additional Fee Based on Off-Premises Benefits. The
downtown businesses in the Central Business District Zone who have inadequate
or non-existent off-street parking will be charged on a pro rata basis for
the monthly charges attributed to the municipal parking lots servicing those
businesses.



   Subd. 6.   Use of Funds. Funds collected by the storm sewer utility
charges will be used to fund infrastructure replacement, operation and
maintenance and wetland mitigation. All new development or first time
improvements will be assessed their appropriate share of the costs.

connection with the sanitary sewer carrying roof water, ground water, surface
water or any other natural precipitation.



      D.   Exceptions. In certain locations where surface storm
water discharge would create a safety hazard during freezing weather,
connection to the sanitary sewer may be maintained from October 15 to March
15. In no case shall any connection to the sanitary sewer be maintained from
March 15 to October 15. Exceptions will be granted by permit on a case by
case basis as determined by authorized city personnel.

on which the building or structure is located.

remote-type water meters shall be installed at the expense of the owner.



DESIGN CONTROL



§ 4.50  DESIGN CONTROL.



   Subd. 1.   Purpose. It is deemed to be in the best interests of the
city to promote the health, safety, general welfare, comfort and appearance
by controlling the exterior design of new construction; by controlling the
placement of previously used buildings; by regulating congestion and
preventing fires and other danger; by assuring adequate light, ventilation
and utility systems; and, preserving the value of property and encouraging
appropriate land use.



   Subd. 2.   Prohibited Exterior Facing. Except as allowed by
proceedings under this section, no building permit shall be issued for any
structure having a front, (either) side or rear abutting or facing a public
street when the proposed structure contains exterior facing materials which
tend to rapidly deteriorate or which for any reason are, or tend to quickly
become, unsightly.



   Subd. 3.   Moving Buildings. No building permit shall be issued to
move a building from without the city onto a site within the city, or move a
building from one location to another within the city, unless the
architectural design of the buildings in the area of the new site is
compatible with the building moved to such site. Comparative age, bulk,
architectural style and quality of construction of both the building moved
and the buildings existing in the area shall be considerations in determining
whether a building is compatible. If the building to be moved is more than
ten years older than the oldest building situated on surrounding properties
to which the building is moved, the fact shall be evidence that the building
to be moved is incompatible.



   Subd. 4.   Hearing. Moving any building from without the city to a
site within the city, or from one site to another within the city, shall
require a hearing. Use of any material for exterior facing which is
prohibited in this section shall require a hearing. All such hearings shall
be held before the Planning Commission after notice given as for a change of
zoning district boundaries provided for in City Code, Chapter 11.

dwelling shall be placed on a foundation constructed of masonry, concrete or
treated wood. All footings supporting the foundation shall be constructed of
solid masonry or concrete placed at a minimum depth of 42 inches below the
finished grade; provided that, this subdivision shall not apply to a building
constructed on a reinforced concrete slab if the slab forms the ground floor
of the dwelling.



   Subd. 2.   Exterior of All Buildings. The exposed exterior of all
buildings shall be brick, solid masonry or concrete, or colored steel, wood
or Masonite siding.

   Every individual, corporation, partnership, association, trust,
unincorporated organization, any similar entity or any combination of the
foregoing acting in concert, who violates a section, subdivision, paragraph
or provision of this chapter when he or she performs an act thereby
prohibited or declared unlawful, or fails to act when the failure is thereby
prohibited or declared unlawful, or performs an act prohibited or declared
unlawful or fails to act when the failure is prohibited or declared unlawful
by a Code adopted by reference by this chapter and, upon conviction thereof,
shall be punished as for a misdemeanor except as otherwise stated in specific
provisions hereof. Any individual, corporation, partnership, association,
trust, unincorporated organization, any similar entity or any combination of
the foregoing acting in concert, violating this chapter or any code adopted
by reference in this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for
each day or portion thereof during which any such violation is committed,
continued or permitted.

§ 5.02  APPLICATIONS AND LICENSES UNDER THIS CHAPTER - PROCEDURE AND
ADMINISTRATION.



   Subd. 1.   Application. All applications shall be made at the office
of the City Administrator upon forms prescribed by the city or, if by the
Commissioner, then together with such additional information as the Council
may desire. Information required may vary with the type of business
organization making application. All questions asked or information required
by the application forms shall be answered fully and completely by the
applicant. The applicant will also authorize the completion of a criminal
history background investigation as provided for in § 6.32 of this Code. 
Before any investigation is undertaken by the City Attorney, the applicant
must authorize the City Attorney in writing to undertake the investigation
and to release any information gathered during the investigation as provided
in § 6.32 of this Code. The written consent must fully comply with the
provisions of M.S. Chapter 13, as it may be amended from time to time,
regarding the collection, maintenance and use of the information.



   Subd. 2.   False Statements. It is unlawful for any applicant to
intentionally make a false statement or omission upon any application form.
Any false statement in such application, or any willful omission to state any
information called for on such application form shall, upon discovery of the
falsehood, work an automatic refusal of license, or if already issued, shall
render any license issued pursuant thereto void and of no effect to protect
the applicant from prosecution for violation of this chapter, or any part
thereof.



    Subd. 3.   Application and Investigation Fees. At the time the
initial application is made, an applicant for a license under this chapter
shall accompany the application with payment of a fee to be considered an
application and investigation fee, non-refundable to the applicant, to cover
the cost of the city in processing the application and the investigation of
the applicant. No investigation fee shall be required of an applicant for a
temporary beer license.



   Subd. 4.   Action.



      A.   Granting. The Council may approve any application for the
period of the remainder of the then-current license year or for the entire
ensuing license year. All applications including proposed license periods
must be consistent with this chapter. Prior to consideration of any
application for a license, the applicant shall pay the license fee, and if
applicable, pay the investigation fee. Failure to pay any portion of a fee
when due shall be cause for revocation.



      B.   Issuing. If an application is approved, the City
Administrator shall forthwith issue a license pursuant thereto in the form
prescribed by the city or the Commissioner, as the case may be, and upon
payment of the license fee. All licenses shall be on a calendar year basis
beginning January 1 and ending December 31. Unless otherwise herein
specified, license fees shall be prorated on the basis of one-twelfth for
each calendar month or part thereof remaining in the then-current license
year. Provided that, for licenses where the fee is $100 or less, a minimum
license fee equal to one-half of the annual license fee shall be charged.
Licenses shall be valid only at one location and on the premises therein
described.



      C.   Transfer. No license shall be transferable between
persons. Any change in individual ownership, incorporation or substitution of
partners is a transfer. No license shall be transferable to a different
location without prior consent of the Council and payment of the fee for a
duplicate license. It is unlawful to make any transfer in violation of this
subparagraph.



      D.   Refusal and Termination. The Council may, in its sole
discretion and for any reasonable cause, refuse to grant any application. No
license shall be granted to a person of questionable moral character or
business reputation. Licenses shall terminate only by expiration or
revocation.



      E.   Public Interest. No license under this chapter may be
issued, transferred or renewed if the results of any investigation show, to
the satisfaction of the Council, that the issuance, transfer or renewal would
not be in the public interest.



      F.   Revocation or Suspension. For any license granted under
the provisions of this chapter, the Council may revoke, suspend for a period
not to exceed 60 days, impose a civil fine not to exceed $2,000, or any
combination of these sanctions, for each violation on a finding that the
licensee has failed to comply with a statute, regulation or provision of the
City Code relating to alcoholic beverages, including any provision found in
Chapter 11 relating to outdoor patio areas. The Council shall revoke the
license upon conviction of any licensee or agent or employee of a licensee
for violating any law relating to the sale or possession of beer, wine or
liquor upon premises of the licensee, or if the revocation is mandatory by
statute. If it shall be made to appear at the hearing thereon that the
violation was not willful, the Council may order suspension; provided that,
revocation shall be ordered upon the third violation or offense. No
suspension or revocation shall take effect until the licensee has been
afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the Council, a committee of the
Council or a hearing under the Administrative Procedures Act, as may be
determined by the Council in action calling the hearing. The hearing shall be
called by the Council upon written notice to the licensee served in person or
by certified mail not less than 15, nor more than 30, days prior to the
hearing date, stating the time, place and purpose thereof. As additional
restrictions or regulations on licensees under this chapter and, in addition
to grounds for revocation or suspension stated in the City Code or statute,
the following shall also be grounds for the action:



         1.   The licensee suffered or permitted illegal acts
upon licensed premises unrelated to the sale of beer, wine or liquor;



         2.   The licensee had knowledge of the illegal acts upon
licensed premises, but failed to report the same to police;



         3.   The licensee failed or refused to cooperate fully
with police in investigating the alleged illegal acts upon licensed premises;
or



         4.   The activities of the licensee created a serious
danger to public health, safety or welfare.



      G.   Corporate Applicants and Licensees. A corporate
applicant, at the time of application, shall furnish the city with a list of
all persons that have an interest in the corporation and the extent of the
interest. The list shall name all shareholders and show the number of shares
held by each, either individually or beneficially for others. It is the duty
of each corporate licensee to notify the City Administrator in writing of any
change in legal ownership, or beneficial interest in such corporation or in
such shares. Any change in the ownership or beneficial interest in the shares
entitled to be voted at a meeting of the shareholders of a corporate
licensee, which results in the change of voting control of the corporation by
the persons owning the shares therein, shall be deemed equivalent to a
transfer of the license issued to the corporation, and any license shall be
revoked 30 days after any such change in ownership or beneficial interest of
shares unless the Council has been notified of the change in writing and has
approved it by appropriate action. The Council, or any officer of the city
designated by it, may at any reasonable time examine the stock transfer
records and minute books of any corporate licensee in order to verify and
identify the shareholders, and the Council or its designated officer may
examine the business records of any other licensee to the extent necessary to
disclose the interest which persons other than the licensee have in the
licensed business. The Council may revoke any license issued upon its
determination that a change of ownership of shares in a corporate licensee or
any change of ownership of any interest in the business of any other licensee
has actually resulted in the change of control of the licensed business so as
materially to affect the integrity and character of its management and its
operation, but no such action shall be taken until after a hearing by the
Council on notice to the licensee.



   Subd. 5.   Duplicate Licenses. Duplicates of all original licenses

   Subd. 6.   Violations and Penalties.

violator shall be issued a citation by the city police and given notice of
his or her right to be heard on the accusation. Each violation, and every day
in which a violation occurs or continues, shall constitute a separate
offense. Any person found to be in violation of this section shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to the maximum penalty authorized by
state law for a misdemeanor.



         2.   As an alternative to a misdemeanor prosecution, the
city may offer the accused violator a chance to pay an administrative fine as
provided in the fine schedule adopted and amended from time to time by the
Council. If the accused violator accepts the administrative option, he or she
may pay the fine to the city's Deputy Clerk or he or she may, within ten days
of the notice, request an administrative hearing before the Council or
authorized hearing officer designated by the Council. If, after the hearing,
the person is found to be in violation of this section, he or she shall be
ordered to pay the fine. If a violator elects to pay the fine, or if he or
she is acquitted of the violation by the hearing officer, he or she shall not
be subject to misdemeanor prosecution for violation of the section. If the
violator fails to pay the fine within 90 days following the hearing, or 90
days following the last day to request a hearing when a hearing has not been
requested, the city may vacate the civil action and proceed with the
misdemeanor prosecution. At any time, the accused violator may abandon his or
her request to pursue the administrative penalty and elect to have his or her
case heard in court under the misdemeanor prosecution. The city shall also
have the right to refuse to offer the administrative penalty and instead
proceed directly with the misdemeanor prosecution for a particular offense.
If the accused violator accepts the administrative option, no administrative
fine shall be imposed pursuant to Subd. 6.C. of this section.



         3.   In addition to any fine or other penalty, whether
administrative, civil or criminal, violation of this section by a licensee
under this section shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation of the
license.



      B.   License Revocation, Suspension and Administrative Fine.
The Council may revoke or suspend for three days any license issued under
this section and shall impose a mandatory administrative fine of at least
$75, or more, as provided in the fine schedule adopted and amended from time
to time by the Council, upon a finding that a licensee or its employee
violated this section. In the event the city finds that a licensee or its
employee has violated this section twice within a 24-month period, the city
may revoke or suspend for a period of six months and shall impose a mandatory
administrative fine of at least $200, or more, as provided in the fine
schedule adopted and amended from time to time by the Council. A third or
subsequent offense at the same location within a 24-month period by a
licensee or employee shall subject the licensee to a mandatory seven-day
suspension of the licensee's authority to sell tobacco at that location,
shall constitute a basis for a permanent revocation of the licensee's
authority to sell tobacco at that location, and shall subject the violator to
a mandatory administrative fine of at least $250, or more, as provided in the
fine schedule adopted and amended from time to time by the Council. No
suspension or revocation shall take effect until the licensee has received
notice, served personally or by certified mail, of the alleged violation and
has been afforded an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to § 2.06 of this
code. A decision of the Council that a violation has occurred must be in
writing. Unless the licensee requests review of the order imposing an
administrative fine, the penalty is due and payable on the thirty-first day
after the order was received. All administrative fines shall be payable to
the city.



      C.   Administrative Fine for Other Individuals. In addition to
any fine or other penalty, whether administrative or criminal, other
individuals, other than minors regulated by Subd. 6.D. below, found to be in
violation of this section shall be charged an administrative fine of $50. No
penalty may be imposed until the individual has received notice, served
personally or by certified mail, of the alleged violation and an opportunity
for a hearing before a person authorized by the licensing authority to
conduct a hearing. Any decision that a violation has occurred must be in
writing.



      D.   Minors. Minors found in unlawful possession of, or who
unlawfully purchase or attempt to purchase, tobacco, tobacco products or
tobacco-related devices, shall be charged an administrative fine of $50. Any
second or subsequent violation of this section by a minor shall result in the
imposition of an administrative fine of $100. In addition to any fine or
other penalty, whether administrative or criminal, any minor found to be in
violation of this section shall be provided with notification of any
tobacco-related programs, courses or classes offered within the community
which are designed to provide education on the harmful effects of the use of
tobacco or tobacco products and/or instruction on smoking cessation.

or operate a taxicab without a license therefor from the city.



   Subd. 3.   License Fees. The annual license fee for a taxicab shall

vehicle is disabled through mechanical failure or for needed repairs, the
license may be temporarily transferred to another conveyance for a seven-day
period upon approval by the city.



   Subd. 4.   Granting of Licenses and Renewals.



      A.   Upon the filing of an application for a license, the
Council shall order a hearing thereon to determine whether the public
convenience and necessity require the proposed taxicab service. Notice of the
hearing shall be published once in the official newspaper at least seven days
prior to the time fixed for the hearing. The cost of the publication shall be
borne by the applicant and the notice shall state the name of the applicant,

number of vehicles to be operated under the license and the time and place of
hearing.



      B.   If, after the hearing, the Council is satisfied and, by
resolution, finds and determines that the public convenience and necessity
require the issuance of a license period, it shall grant the license period.
Provided, however, that, the hearing shall not be required for renewal of any
license, but the applicant for a renewal license shall file an application at
least 30 days prior to the expiration of the license, and failure by the
applicant to file the application within the time limited shall be deemed an
abandonment by the licensee of the right to renewal without a hearing. This
time requirement may be waived by the Council for good and sufficient cause
as determined by the Council.



   Subd. 5.   License Issuance and Display, and Vehicle Marking. All
licenses shall be issued for specific conveyances, except as otherwise herein
provided. Both sides of every licensed taxicab, when in use, shall be plainly

Administrator, before a taxicab license is issued or renewed, a schedule of
proposed maximum rates to be charged by him or her during the licensed period
for which the application is made. The schedule of proposed maximum rates, or
a compromise schedule thereof, shall be approved by the Council before
granting the license. The schedule shall be posted in a conspicuous place in
the taxicab in full view of passengers riding therein. Nothing herein shall
prevent a taxicab licensee from petitioning the Council for review of the
rates during the licensed period, and the Council may, likewise, consider the
petition and make new rates effective at any time. No taxicab licensee shall
charge rates in excess of maximum rates approved by the Council.



   Subd. 8.   Mechanical Condition. Before issuing a taxicab license,
the Council may require a mechanic's certification showing that the taxicab
conveyance is in good mechanical condition, that it is thoroughly safe for
transportation of passengers and that it is in neat and clean condition. Such
similar certificate may be required from time to time during the licensed
period.



   Subd. 9.   Unlawful Acts. It is unlawful for the operator or driver

section, shall have the meanings stated.



      A.   The term "lodger" means the person obtaining lodging from
an operator.



      B.   The term "lodging" means the furnishing for a
consideration of lodging by a hotel, motel or rooming house, except where the
lodging shall be for a continuous period of 30 days or more to the same
lodger(s). The furnishing of rooms by religious, educational or non-profit
organizations shall not constitute "lodging" for purposes of this section.



      C.   The term "operator" means a person who provides lodging
to others or any officer, agent or employee of the person.



      D.   The term "rent" means the total consideration valued in
money charged for lodging whether paid in money or otherwise, but shall not
include any charges for services rendered in connection with furnishing
lodging other than the room charge itself.



   Subd. 2.   Imposition of Tax. There is hereby imposed a tax of 3% on
the rent charged by an operator for providing lodging to any person after
10-1-1990. The tax shall be stated and charged separately and shall be
collected by the operator from the lodger. The tax collected by the operator
shall be a debt owed by the operator to the city and shall be extinguished
only by payment to the city. In no case shall the tax imposed by this section
upon an operator exceed the amount of tax which the operator is authorized
and required by this section to collect from a lodger.



   Subd. 3.   Collections. Each operator shall collect the tax imposed
by this section at the time the rent is paid. The tax collections shall be
deemed to be held in trust by the operator for the city. The amount of tax
shall be separately stated from the rent charged for the lodging and those
persons paying the tax shall receive a receipt of payment from the operator.



   Subd. 4.   Advertising No Tax. It is unlawful for any operator to
advertise, or hold out or state to the public or any customer, directly or
indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by
the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent or that, if added, it
or any part thereof will be refunded. In computing the tax to be collected,
amounts of tax less than $0.01 shall be considered an additional cent.



   Subd. 5.   Payment and Returns.



      A.   The taxes imposed by this section shall be paid by the
operator to the city monthly not later than 15 days after the end of the
month in which the taxes were collected. At the time of payment, the operator
shall submit a return upon the forms and containing the information as the
City Administrator may require. The return shall contain the following
minimum information:



         1.   The total amount of rent collected for lodging
during the period covered by the return;



         2.   The amount of tax required to be collected and due
for the period;



         3.   The signature of the person filing the return or
that of his or her agent duly authorized in writing;



         4.   The period covered by the return; and



         5.   The amount of uncollectible rental charges subject
to the lodging tax.



      B.   The operator may offset against the taxes payable with
respect to any reporting period, the amount of taxes imposed by this section
previously paid as a result of any transaction, the consideration for which
became uncollectible during the reporting period, but only in proportion to
the portion of the consideration which became uncollectible.



   Subd. 6.   Examination of Return, Adjustments, Notices and Demands.
The City Administrator shall, after return is filed, examine the same and
make any investigation or examination of the records and accounts of the
person making the return deemed necessary for determining its correctness.
The tax computed on the basis of the examination shall be the tax to be paid.
If the tax due is found to be greater than that paid, the excess shall be
paid to the city ten days after receipt of a notice thereof given either
personally or sent by registered mail to the address shown on the return. If
the tax paid is greater than the tax found to be due, the excess shall be
refunded to the person who paid the tax to the city within ten days after
determination of the refund.



   Subd. 7.   Refunds. Any person may apply to the City Administrator
for a refund of taxes paid for a prescribed period in excess of the amount
legally due for that period; provided that, no application for refund shall
be considered unless filed within one year after the tax was paid, or within
one year from the filing of the return, whichever period is the longer. The
City Administrator shall examine the claim and make and file written findings
thereon denying or allowing the claim in whole or in part and shall mail a
notice thereof by registered mail to the person at the address stated upon
the return. If the claim is allowed in whole or in part, the City
Administrator shall credit the amount of the allowance against any taxes due
under this section from the claimant and the balance of the allowance, if
any, shall be paid by the City Administrator to the claimant.



   Subd. 8.   Failure to File a Return.



      A.   If any operator required by this section to file a return
shall fail to do so within the time prescribed, or shall make, willfully or
otherwise, an incorrect, false or fraudulent return, the operator shall, upon
written notice and demand, file the return or corrected return within five
days of receipt of the written notice and shall at the same time pay any tax
due on the basis thereof. If the person shall fail to file the return or
corrected return, the City Administrator shall make a return or corrected
return, for the person from the knowledge and information as the City
Administrator can obtain, and assess a tax on the basis thereof, which tax
(less any payments theretofore made on account of the tax for the taxable
period covered by the return) shall be paid within five days of the receipt
of written notice and demand for the payment. Any such return or assessment
made by the City Administrator shall be prima facie correct and valid and the
person shall have the burden of establishing its incorrectness or invalidity
in any action or proceeding in respect thereto.



      B.   If any portion of a tax imposed by this section,
including penalties thereon, is not paid within 30 days after it is required
to be paid, the City Attorney may institute the legal action as may be
necessary to recover the amount due plus interest, penalties, the costs and
disbursements of any action.



      C.   Upon a showing of good cause, the City Administrator may
grant an operator one 30-day extension of time within which to file a return
and make payment of taxes as required by this section provided that interest
during the period of extension shall be added to the taxes due at the rate of
10% per annum.



   Subd. 9.   Penalties.



      A.   If any tax imposed by this section is not paid within the
time herein specified for the payment, or any extension thereof, there shall
be added thereto a specific penalty equal to 10% of the amount remaining
unpaid.



      B.   In case of any failure to make and file a return within
the time prescribed by this section, unless it is shown that the failure is
not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the tax, in addition to
the 10% specific penalty provided in Subd. 9.A. above, 10% if the failure is
for not more than 30 days with an additional 5% for each additional 30 days
or fraction thereof during which the failure continued, not exceeding 25% in
the aggregate. If the penalty as computed does not exceed $10, a minimum
penalty of $10 shall be assessed. The amount so added to any tax shall be
collected at the same time and the same manner and as a part of the tax
unless the tax has been paid before the discovery of the negligence, in which
case the amount so added shall be collected in the same manner as the tax.



      C.   If any person willfully fails to file any return or make
any payment required by this section, or willfully files a false or
fraudulent return, or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any
such tax or payment thereof, there shall also be imposed as a penalty an
amount equal to 50% of any tax (less any amounts paid on the basis of the
false or fraudulent return) found due for the period to which the return
related. The penalty imposed by this subdivision shall be collected as part
of the tax, and shall be in addition to any other penalties provided by this
section.



      D.   All payments received shall be credited first to
penalties, next to interest and then to the tax due.



      E.   The amount of tax not timely paid, together with any
penalty provided by this section, shall bear interest at the rate of 8% per
annum from the time the tax should have been paid until paid. Any interest
and penalty shall be added to the tax and be collected as part thereof.



      F.   In addition to any other penalties provided for
hereunder, the Council may, subject to the provisions set forth in this
section, suspend or revoke any license or permit issued by the city to the
operator of the facility.



   Subd. 10.   Administration of Tax. The City Administrator shall
administer and enforce the assessment and collection of the taxes imposed by
this section. The City Administrator shall cause to be prepared blank forms
for the returns and other documents required by this section and shall
distribute the same throughout the city and furnish them on application, but
failure to receive or secure them shall not relieve any person from any
obligation required of him or her under this section.



   Subd. 11.   Examine Records. The City Administrator and those
persons acting on behalf of the City Administrator authorized in writing by
the City Administrator, may examine the books, papers and records of any
operator in order to verify the accuracy of any return made, or if no return
was made, to ascertain the tax as provided in this section. Every such
operator is directed and required to give to the City Administrator or to his
or her duly authorized agent or employee the means, facilities and
opportunity for the examination and investigations as are hereby authorized.

become effective until presented to the Council for its approval and, when so
approved, the tax imposed by this section shall be collected and administered
pursuant to the terms of the agreement.

a return authorized by this section or who shall fail to pay the tax after
written demand for payment, or who shall fail to remit the taxes collected or
any penalty or interest imposed by this section after written demand for the
payment, or who shall refuse to permit the City Administrator or any duly
authorized agents or employees to examine the books, records and papers under
his or her control, or who shall willfully make any incomplete, false or
fraudulent return shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

the collection of taxes pursuant to this section shall be used in accordance
with M.S. § 469.190, as the same may be amended from time to time, to fund a
local convention or tourism bureau for the purpose of marketing and promoting
the city as a tourist or convention center. The city may use up to 5% of the
proceeds obtained hereunder to defray the costs and expenses of collection
and administration of the tax. The city may contract with the person or

tourism and convention bureau.

appeal a decision must file a written notice of appeal with the City
Administrator within ten days after the decision has been mailed to the

of this section is hereby declared to be a nuisance and upon three-days'
written notice to the owner, as the owner is shown by the records of the
Redwood County Auditor or the taxpayer of record as shown by the records of
the Redwood County Treasurer, the city shall be entitled to remove the
leaves, grass or tree limbs which have been deposited in the street or public

§ 7.23  RIGHT-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT.



   Subd. 1.   Findings and Purpose.



      A.   The city holds the rights-of-way within its geographical
boundaries as an asset in trust for its citizens. The city and other public
entities have invested millions of dollars in public funds to build and
maintain the rights-of-way. It also recognizes that some persons, by placing
their equipment in the right-of-way and charging the citizens of the city for
goods and services delivered thereby, are using this property held for the
public good. Although the services are often necessary or convenient for the
citizens, the persons receive revenue and/or profit through their use of
public property. Although the service delivery facilities are in most cases a
necessary and proper use of right-of-way, the city hereby seeks to regulate
and manage the uses pursuant to applicable state law.



      B.   To provide for the health, safety and well-being of its
citizens, and to ensure the structural integrity of its streets and the
appropriate use of the rights-of-way by all users, the city strives to keep
its rights-of-way in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary
encumbrances. Although the general population bears the financial burden for
the upkeep of the rights-of-way, one of the causes for the early and
excessive deterioration of its rights-of-way is frequent excavation.



      C.   This section imposes reasonable regulations on the
placement and maintenance of equipment currently within its rights-of-way or
to be placed therein at some future time. It is intended to complement the
regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. Under this section, persons
disturbing and obstructing the rights-of-way will bear a fair share of the
financial responsibility for their integrity. Finally, this section provides
for recovery of the city's costs associated with managing its rights-of-way.



   Subd. 2.   Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, as
used herein, have the following meanings.



      A.   The term "city cost" means the actual cost incurred by
the city for public rights-of-way management; including, but not limited to,
costs associated with registering applicants; issuing, processing, and
verifying right-of-way permit applications; inspecting job sites and
restoration projects; maintaining, supporting, protecting or moving
facilities during public right-of-way work; determining the adequacy of
right-of-way restoration; restoring work inadequately performed; mapping of
"as built" locations of facilities located in rights-of-way; and revoking
right-of-way permits; and performing all other tasks required by this
section, including other costs the city may incur in managing the provisions
of this section.



      B.   The term "degradation" means the accelerated depreciation
of the right-of-way caused by excavation in or disturbance of the
right-of-way, resulting in the need to reconstruct the right-of-way earlier
than would be required if the excavation did not occur.



      C.   The term "degradation cost" means money paid to the city
to cover the cost associated with a decrease in the useful life of a public
right-of-way caused by excavation.



      D.   The term "emergency" means a condition that:



         1.   Poses a clear and immediate danger to life or
health, or of a significant loss of property; or



         2.   Requires immediate repair or replacement in order
to restore service to a customer.



      E.   The terms "equipment" or "facilities" mean any tangible
thing in any right-of-way; but shall not include boulevard plantings or
gardens planted or maintained in the right-of-way between a person's property
and the street curb.



      F.   The term "excavate" means to dig into or in any way
remove or physically disturb or penetrate any part of a right-of-way.



      G.   The term "permit" means a permit issued pursuant to this
section.



      H.   The term "permit holder" means any person to whom a

to have its facilities or equipment located in any right-of-way.



      J.   The terms "restore" or "restoration" mean the process by

foundation, is returned to the condition that existed before the commencement
of the work.

by a permittee to cover the cost of restoration.



      L.   The term "right-of-way" means the surface and space above

cooling system; and



         5.   Cable communications systems as defined in M.S.
Chapter 238, as amended from time to time.



      N.   The term "telecommunication rights-of-way user" means a
person owning or controlling a facility in the public right-of-way, or
seeking to own or control a facility in the public right-of-way, that is used
or is intended to be used for transporting telecommunication or other voice
or data information. For purposes of this section, a cable communication
system defined and regulated under M.S. Chapter 238, as amended from time to
time, and telecommunication activities related to providing natural gas or
electric energy services are not telecommunications right-of-way users.

      N.   Excavations, trenches and jacking pits shall be protected
when unattended to prevent entrance of surface drainage;



      O.   All backfilling must be placed in six inch layers at
optimum moisture compacted with the objective of attaining 100% of AASHO
(American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials) density.
Compaction shall be accomplished with hand, pneumatic or vibrating compactors
as appropriate;



      P.   Backfill material shall consist of the excavated soils
that have been removed during excavation. The materials shall be segregated
and backfilled in the same manner as removed; provided, the material moisture
is capable of obtaining optimum compaction. If the backfill material is too
wet, then granular material may be substituted at the direction of authorized
city personnel. All backfill must replace "in kind" the materials removed.
All organic materials must be replaced with granular material as directed by
authorized city personnel;



      Q.   Compacted backfill shall be brought to street grade and
crowned at the center not more than one inch;



      R.   Street and pedestrian traffic shall be maintained
throughout construction unless provided otherwise by the permit;



      S.   No lugs damaging to roadway surfaces may be used;



      T.   Dirt or debris must be periodically removed during
construction; and



      U.   Other reasonable standards and requirements of authorized
city personnel.



   Subd. 7.   Repair and Restoration.



      A.   Schedule. The work to be done under the permit, and the
repair and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be
completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days
as work could not be done because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the
control of the permit holder, when work was prohibited as unseasonable or
unreasonable or when extended by authorized city personnel. In addition to
repairing its own work, the permit holder must restore the general area of
the work, and the surrounding areas, including the paving and its
foundations, to the condition that existed before the commencement of the
work, but only to the extent the permit holder disturbed the surrounding
areas.



      B.   General Standards. The permit holder shall perform
repairs and restoration according to the standards and with the materials
specified by authorized city personnel. The authorized city personnel shall
have the authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration and
may do so in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case
basis. The authorized city personnel in exercising this authority shall be
guided by the following standards and consideration:



         1.   The number, size, depth and duration of the
excavations, disruptions or damage to the right-of-way;



         2.   The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way; the
character of the neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way;



         3.   The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way;
the remaining life-expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the excavation;



         4.   Whether the relative cost of the method of
restoration to the permit holder is in reasonable balance with the prevention
of an accelerated depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise
result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the right-of-way; and



         5.   The likelihood that the particular method of
restoration would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the
right-of-way that would otherwise take place.



      C.   City Restoration. The permit holder may request that the
city restore the right-of-way. The permit holder shall pay to the city, in
advance, a cash deposit equaling 150% of the estimated restoration cost. The
restoration cost shall be estimated by authorized city personnel and shall
include an estimate of the degradation cost. The estimate of the degradation
cost shall be based upon criteria adopted by the Minnesota Public Utilities
Commission. Following completion of the restoration, any funds in excess of
the actual restoration cost and the degradation cost shall be returned to the
permit holder.



      D.   Guarantees. The permit holder shall guarantee its work
and shall maintain it for 24 months following its completion. During this
24-month period, it shall, upon notification from authorized city personnel,
promptly correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using the
method required by authorized city personnel.



   Subd. 8.   Permit Limitations. Permits issued pursuant to this
section are valid only for the area of the right-of-way specified in the
application and the permit, and only for the dates so specified. No work
shall be extended beyond the permitted area or dates without a new permit
being procured. The authorized city personnel may extend the completion date
of the work in accordance with Subd. 7.A. above.



   Subd. 9.   Denial of Permit. The authorized city personnel may deny
a permit due to the following:



      A.   Failure to register pursuant to Subd. 3. above;



      B.   A proposed excavation within a street or sidewalk surface
that has been constructed or reconstructed within the preceding five years
unless authorized city personnel determines that no other locations are
feasible or when necessitated by an emergency;



      C.   The applicant has failed to comply with or correct
inadequacies of previous permits;



      D.   The proposed schedule for the work would conflict or
interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival or any other similar
event;



      E.   The right-of-way would become unduly congested due to the
proposed facilities and equipment when combined with other uses in the
right-of-way as provided in Subd. 14.C. below;



      F.   Businesses or residences in the vicinity will be
unreasonably disrupted by the work;



      G.   The proposed schedule conflicts with scheduled total or
partial reconstruction of the right-of-way; and



      H.   The applicant fails to comply with the requirements of
this section or other sections of this Code.



   Subd. 10.   Emergency Work.



      A.   A registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are
necessary to respond to an emergency. Within two business days after the
occurrence of the emergency the registrant shall apply for the necessary
permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the
requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this section for
the actions it took in response to the emergency.



      B.   If the authorized city personnel becomes aware of an
emergency, the authorized city personnel shall attempt to contact the local
representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the
emergency. In any event, the authorized city personnel may take whatever
action deemed necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall
be borne by the registrant whose facilities or equipment occasioned the
emergency.



   Subd. 11.   Revocation of Permits. The authorized city personnel may
revoke any permit, without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of
the terms and conditions of any statute, this Code, rule or regulation or any
condition of the permit which the substantial breach shall continue uncured
for ten calendar days after the issuance of a written order of authorized
city personnel. A substantial breach of a permit holder shall include, but
shall not be limited to, the following:



      A.   The violation of any material provision of the permit;



      B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of
the permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit
upon the city or its citizens;



      C.   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application
for a permit;



      D.   The failure to maintain the required bonds and insurance;



      E.   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; or



      F.   The failure to correct a condition indicated on an order
issued by authorized city personnel.



   Subd. 12.   Appeal.



      A.   Filing of Appeal.



         1.   Any person aggrieved by the following may appeal to
the Council by filing a written notice of appeal with the City Administrator:



            a.   The denial of a permit application;



            b.   The denial of a registration;



            c.   The revocation of a permit; or



            d.   The application of the fee imposed by the fee
schedule.



         2.   The notice must be filed with 20 days of the action
causing the appeal.



      B.   Notice of Hearing. The Council shall hear the appeal not
later than 30 days after the date the appeal is filed. Notice of the date,
time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be mailed to the appellant not
less than ten days before the date of the hearing.



      C.   Hearing and Decision. The Council shall, at the hearing,
hear and consider any evidence offered by the appellant, the authorized city
personnel and anyone else wishing to be heard. After hearing the oral and
written views of all interested persons, the Council shall issue a written
decision.



   Subd. 13.   Mapping. Within 120 days following completion of any
work pursuant to a permit, the registrant shall provide authorized city
personnel accurate maps and drawings certifying the "as-built" location of
all facilities and equipment installed, owned and maintained by the
registrant. The maps and drawings shall indicate both the horizontal and
vertical location of all facilities and equipment and shall be provided in a
format consistent with the city's mapping system. Failure to provide maps and
drawings in accordance with this subdivision shall be grounds for revoking
the permit holder's registration.



   Subd. 14.   Location of Facilities and Equipment.



      A.   Undergrounding by Telecommunications Right-of-Way Users.
Any new construction and the installation of new equipment and replacement of
old equipment of telecommunication right-of-way users shall be underground or
contained within buildings or other structures in conformity with applicable
codes. Telecommunications right-of-way users may attach equipment and
facilities to existing poles and structures maintained by a service or
utility service with the owner's permission.



      B.   Corridors. The authorized city personnel may assign
specific corridors within the right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof
as may be necessary, for each type of equipment installation currently
permitted or anticipated to be permitted in the future. All permits issued by
the authorized city personnel involving the installation or replacement of
equipment shall designate the proper corridor for the equipment at issue.



      C.   Limitation of Space. To protect health and safety, the
authorized city personnel shall have the power to prohibit or limit the
placement of new or additional equipment within the right-of-way if there is
insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests of registrants or
persons to occupy and use the right-of-way. In making the decisions, the
authorized city personnel shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate
all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided
primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for
the particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time
of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing
equipment in the right-of-way and future city plans for public improvements
and development projects which have been determined to be in the public
interest.



      D.   Preservation of Corridor Space in the Right-of-Way for
Future Installations. To adequately plan for future demand on the
right-of-way by users, the authorized city personnel may reserve corridor
space within the right-of-way for equipment to be installed at a point of
time in the future even though it is not currently permitted.



   Subd. 15.   Relocation.



      A.   Relocation for City Purposes. A registrant shall promptly
but in no event more than 120 days of the city's request, permanently remove
and relocate at no charge to the city, any facilities or equipment if and
when made necessary by a change in the grade, alignment or width of any
right-of-way, vacation of any right-of-way, by the construction, maintenance
or operation of any city facilities or to protect the public health, safety
and welfare. The registrant shall restore any rights-of-way to the condition
it was in prior to removal and relocation. No fees shall be required of the
permittee for work done under this paragraph.



      B.   Undergrounding of Relocated Telecommunications
Facilities. A telecommunications right-of-way user shall relocate all above
ground facilities and equipment to underground locations at its own cost and
expense at the city's request when:



         1.   The city requires the relocation of all
telecommunications facilities and equipment to underground locations; or



         2.   Structures or poles to which the registrant's
facilities or equipment is attached are abandoned or removed by the owner of
the structures or poles.



   Subd. 16.   Right-of-Way Vacation.



      A.   Reservation of Right. If the city vacates a right-of-way
which contains the equipment of a registrant, and the vacation does not
require the relocation of registrant facilities and equipment, the city shall
reserve, to and for itself and all registrants having facilities and
equipment in the vacated right-of-way, the right to install, maintain and
operate any facilities and equipment in the vacated right-of-way and to enter
upon the vacated right-of-way at any time for the purpose of reconstruction,
inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same.



      B.   Relocation of Equipment. The other person or persons must
pay the relocation costs:



         1.   If the vacation requires the relocation of
registrant facilities and equipment;



         2.   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the
registrant, the registrant must pay the relocation costs;



         3.   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the
city, the registrant must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to
by the city and the registrant; or



         4.   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by a
person or persons other than the registrant or permit holder.



   Subd. 17.   Abandoned and Unusable Equipment.



      A.   Discontinued Operations. A registrant who has determined
to discontinue its operations in the city must either:



         1.   Provide information satisfactory to the authorized
city personnel that the registrant's obligations for its equipment in the
right-of-way under this section have been lawfully assumed by another
registrant; or



         2.   Submit to the authorized city personnel an action
plan for the removal or abandonment of equipment and facilities. The
authorized city personnel shall require removal of the facilities and
equipment if the authorized city personnel determine the removal is necessary
to protect the public health, safety and welfare, authorized city personnel
may require the registrant to post a bond in an amount sufficient to
reimburse the city for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in
removing the facilities and equipment.



      B.   Abandoned Facilities Equipment. Facilities and equipment
of a registrant located on the surface of, or above a right-of-way, or on
city property which remains unused for a period of two years shall be deemed
to be abandoned. The abandoned equipment is deemed to be a nuisance. The city
may exercise any remedies or rights available including, but not limited to:



         1.   Abating the nuisance; or



         2.   Requiring removal of the equipment or facilities by
the registrant or the registrant's successor in interest.



      C.   Removal of Underground Equipment. Any registrant who has
unusable and abandoned underground facilities or equipment in any
right-of-way shall remove it from that right-of-way during the next scheduled
excavation, to the extent the facilities or equipment is uncovered by the
excavation unless this requirement is waived by authorized city personnel.



   Subd. 18.   Indemnification and Liability.



      A.   Limitation of Liability. By reason of the acceptance of a
registration or the grant of a right-of-way permit, the city does not assume
any liability:



         1.   For injuries to persons, damage to property or loss
of service claims by parties other than the registrant or the city; or



         2.   For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from
the installation, presence, maintenance or operation of equipment by
registrants or activities of registrants.



      B.   Indemnification. By registering with authorized city
personnel, a registrant agrees, or by accepting a permit under this section,
a permit-holder is required, to defend, indemnify and hold the city whole and
harmless from, all costs, liabilities and claims for damages of any kind
arising, out of the construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair
or operation of its equipment, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a
right-of-way, whether or not any act or omission complained of is authorized,
allowed or prohibited by a right-of-way permit. It further agrees that it
will not bring, nor cause to be brought, any action, suit or other proceeding
claiming damages, or seeking any other relief against the city for any claim
nor, for any award arising out of the presence, installation, maintenance or
operation of its equipment, or any activity undertaken in or near a
right-of-way, whether or not the act or omission complained of is authorized,
allowed or prohibited by a right-of-way permit. The foregoing does not
indemnify the city for its own negligence except for claims arising out of or
alleging the city's negligence where the negligence arises out of or is
primarily related to the presence, installation, construction, operation,
maintenance or repair of the equipment by the registrant or on the
registrant's behalf, including, but not limited to, the issuance of permits
and inspection of plans or work. This section is not, as to third parties, a
waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the registrant or to
the city; and the registrant, in defending any action on behalf of the city,
shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the
city could assert in its own behalf.



   Subd. 19.   Franchise Holders. If there is a conflict in language
between the franchise of a person holding a valid franchise agreement with
the city and this section, the terms of the franchise shall prevail.



   Subd. 20.   Effective Date. This section shall be in full force and
effect upon publication.



   Subd. 21.   Violation a Misdemeanor. Every person who violates a
section, subdivision, paragraph, item, clause, part or any provision of this
chapter when performing an act thereby prohibited or declared unlawful, or
fails to act when the failure is thereby prohibited or declared unlawful and,
upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as for a misdemeanor except as
otherwise stated in specific provisions thereof.

provision specifically makes violation a misdemeanor, he or she shall be
punished as for a misdemeanor; where a violation is committed in a manner or
under circumstances so as to endanger or be likely to endanger any person or
property, he or she shall be punished as for a misdemeanor; where he or she
stands convicted of violation of any provision of this chapter, exclusive of
violations relating to the standing or parking of an unattended vehicle,
within the immediate preceding 12-month period for the third or subsequent
time, he or she shall be punished as for a misdemeanor.

   Subd. 4.   Where to ride.



      A.   Every person operating a bicycle upon a roadway shall
ride as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway,
except when overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, when preparing for a left turn at an intersection or into a
private road or driveway or when reasonably necessary to avoid conditions,
including fixed or moving objects, vehicle, pedestrians, animals, surface
hazards, or narrow width lanes, that make it unsafe to continue along the
right-hand curb or edge.



      B.   If a bicycle is traveling on a shoulder of a roadway, the
bicycle shall travel in the same direction as adjacent vehicular traffic.



      C.   Persons riding bicycles upon a roadway or shoulder shall

adjacent to a roadway, bicycle riders shall use such paths and shall not use
the roadway.



   Subd. 5.   Right of way - sidewalks. Whenever a person is riding a
bicycle upon a sidewalk, such person shall yield the right of way to any
pedestrian and shall give audible signal before overtaking and passing such
pedestrian. Provided, that it is unlawful for any person to ride a bicycle on
a sidewalk in a Business District or to park a bicycle upon a sidewalk except
where parking stalls have been provided. A person operating a bicycle on a
sidewalk, or across a roadway or shoulder on a crosswalk, shall have all the
rights and duties applicable to a pedestrian under the same circumstances.



   Subd. 6.   Carrying articles. It is unlawful for any person
operating a bicycle to carry any package, bundle or article which prevents

      A.   Every bicycle when in use at nighttime shall be equipped
with, or its operator shall carry, a lamp on the front which shall emit a
white light visible from a distance of at least 500 feet to the front and
with a red reflector on the rear of a type approved by the Department of
Public Safety which is visible from all distances from 100 feet to 600 feet
to the rear when directly in front of lawful lower beams of headlamps on
motor vehicle. A lamp emitting a red light visible from a distance of 500
feet to the rear may be used in addition to the red reflector. No person may,
at any other time when there is not sufficient light to render clearly
discernible persons and vehicles on the highway at a distance of 500 feet
ahead, operate a bicycle unless the bicycle or its operator is equipped with
reflective surfaces that shall be visible during the hours of darkness from
600 feet when viewed in front of lawful lower beams of headlamps on a motor
vehicle. The reflective surfaces shall include reflective materials on each
side of each pedal to indicate their presence from the front or the rear and
with a minimum of 20 square inches on each side of the bicycle or its
operator, of white reflective material. All reflective materials used in
compliance with this subdivision shall meet the requirements as prescribed by

§ 10.16  SOCIAL HOST.



   Subd. 1.   Purpose and Findings. The City Council intends to
discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done
within the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons
criminally responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21
years of age possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person
hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The City Council finds
that:



      A.   Events and gatherings held on private or public property
where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are
harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health
requiring prevention or abatement.



      B.   Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage
persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol
consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions.



      C.   Alcohol is an addictive drug which if used irresponsibly
could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are
affected by the actions of an irresponsible user.



      D.   Often events or gatherings involving underage possession
and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are
times when the parent(s) is/are present and condone the activity and in some
circumstances provide the alcohol.



      E.   Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage
person is a crime, it is difficult to prove; and an ordinance is necessary to
help further combat underage consumption.



      F.   A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person
criminally responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage
possession or consumption occurs.



   Subd. 2.   Authority. This section is enacted pursuant to M.S. §
145A.05, Subd. 1, as amended from time to time.

(Ord. 54, Fourth Series, passed 12-6-2016)



§ 10.43  DISEASED TREES AND STUMPS.



   Subd. 1.   Declaration of Policy. The health of the trees in the
city is threatened by shade tree pests, and the loss or ill health of trees
growing upon public and private property substantially depreciates the value
of property within the city and impairs the safety, good order, general
welfare and convenience of the public. In addition to and in accordance with
M.S. §§ 89.001, 89.01, and 89.51-89.64, the provisions of this section are
adopted as an effort to control and prevent the spread of these shade tree
pests.



   Subd. 2.   Jurisdiction. The city shall have control of all street
trees, shrubs, and other plantings now or hereafter in any street, park,
public right-of-way or easement, or other public place within the city
limits, and shall have the power to plant, care for, maintain, remove, and
replace such trees, shrubs, and other plantings as regulated by the City of
Redwood Falls Boulevard Tree Policy, a copy of which is retained at City Hall.



   Subd. 3.   Definition, Control Measures and Control Area of a Shade
Tree Pest.



      A.   Oak Wilt Disease.



         1.   Definition. Oak wilt disease is a shade tree pest
and is defined as any living or dead tree, log, firewood, limb, branch,
stump, or other portion of a tree from any species of the genus Quercus
existing within the control area defined that has bark attached and that
exceeds three inches in diameter or ten inches in circumference and contains
to any degree any spore or reproductive structures of the fungus Ceratocystis
fagacearum.



         2.   Control Measures. Control measures that may be
taken to abate oak wilt disease are:



            a.   Installation of a root graft barrier. A root
graft barrier can be ordered installed to prevent the underground spread of
oak wilt disease. The city will mark the location of the root graft barrier.
The barrier disrupts transmission of the fungus within the shared vascular
systems of root grafted trees. The barrier is created by excavating or
vibratory plowing a line at least 42 inches deep between any oak tree
infected with oak wilt disease and each nearby and apparently healthy oak
tree within 50 feet of the infected tree.



            b.   Removal and disposal of trees.



               (1)   On property that is zoned residential
and commercial the city may mark for removal trees that have the potential to
produce spores of the fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum. After, and in no case
before, the installation of the root graft barrier and no later than May 1 of
the year following infection, all marked trees must be felled. The stump from
such felled trees must not extend more than three inches above the ground or,
if taller, must be completely debarked. If, however, after the city
prescribes the location for a root graft barrier, the city determines that
installation of the barrier is impossible because of the presence of pavement
or obstructions such as a septic system or utility line, the city may mark
for removal all oak trees whether living or dead, infected or not and located
between an infected tree and the marked barrier location. These marked trees
must be felled and disposed of no later than May 1 of the year following
infection. The stump from such felled trees must not extend more than three
inches above the ground or, if taller, must be completely debarked.



               (2)   On all other property, the city may
mark for removal all oak trees whether living or dead, infected or not and
located between an infected tree and the marked barrier location. These
marked trees must be felled and disposed of no later than May 1 of the year
following infection. The stump from such felled trees must not extend more
than three inches above the ground or, if taller, must be completely debarked.



               (3)   All wood more than three inches in
diameter or ten inches in circumference from such felled trees must be
disposed of by burying, debarking, chipping, or sawing into wane-free lumber,
or by splitting into firewood, stacking the firewood, and immediately
covering the woodpile with unbroken four-mill or thicker plastic sheeting
that is sealed into the ground until Oct. 1 of the calendar year following
the calendar year in which the tree was felled, or by burning before May 1 of
the year following infection. Wood chips from infected trees may be
stockpiled or immediately used in the landscape.



         3.   Control Area. The control area for oak wilt disease
is all lands within the boundaries of the city.



      B.   Emerald Ash Borer.



         1.   Definition. Emerald ash borer is a shade tree pest
and is defined as an insect that attacks and kills ash trees. The adults are
small, iridescent green beetles that live outside of trees during the summer
months. The larvae are grub- or worm-like and live underneath the bark of ash
trees.



         2.   Control Measures. Control measures that may be
taken to abate emerald ash borer are those provided in the document,
Minnesota Emerald Ash Borer Science Advisory Group Recommendations on
Preparing for Emerald Ash Borer in Minnesota.



         3.   Control Areas. The control area for emerald ash
borer is all lands within the boundaries of the city.



      C.   Dutch Elm Disease.



         1.   Definition. Dutch elm disease is a shade tree pest
and is defined as a disease of elm trees caused by the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi
or Ophiostoma novo-ulmi, and includes any living or dead tree, log, firewood,
limb, branch, stump, or other portion of a tree from any species of the genus
Ulmus existing within the control area defined that has bark attached and
that exceeds three inches in diameter or ten inches in circumference and
could contain bark beetles or any spore or reproductive structures of the
fungus Ophiostoma ulmi or Ophiostoma novo-ulmi.



         2.   Control Measures. Control measures that may be
taken to abate Dutch elm disease are:



            a.   Use of fungicide. Fungicides may be effective
in preventing Dutch elm disease when injected into living trees that do not
already show symptoms of Dutch elm disease. Fungicide injections on private
lands are optional and, if performed, are at the landowner's expense.



            b.   Removal and disposal of trees. Prompt removal
of diseased trees or branches reduces breeding sites for elm bark beetles and
eliminates the source of Dutch elm disease fungus. Trees that wilt before
July 15 must be removed within 20 days of detection [alternative: 30 days].
Trees that wilt after July 15 must be removed by April 1 of the following
year. Diseased trees not promptly removed will be removed by the city at the
landowner's expense. Wood may be retained for use as firewood or saw logs if
it is debarked or covered from April 15 to Oct. 15 with four-mill plastic.
The edges of the cover must be buried or sealed to the ground.



         3.   Control Areas. The control area for Dutch elm
disease is all lands within the boundaries of the city.



   Subd. 4.   Declaration of a shade tree pest. The Council may by
ordinance declare any vertebrate or invertebrate animal, plant pathogen, or
plant in the community threatening to cause significant damage to a shade
tree or community forest, as defined by M.S. § 89.001, to be a shade tree
pest and prescribe control measures to effectively eradicate, control, or
manage the shade tree pest, including necessary timelines for action.



   Subd. 5.   Shade tree pest are unlawful. It is unlawful for any
person to permit any shade tree pest as defined in this section to remain on
any premises the person owns or controls within the city. The nuisance may be
abated as provided in this section and the owner cited per § 10.69 Subds. 1.
and 2.



   Subd. 6.   Reporting discovery of shade tree pest. Any owner or
occupier of land or any person engaged in tree trimming or removal who
becomes aware of the existence of a shade tree pest as defined under Subd. 3.
shall report the same to the city.



   Subd. 7.   Tree inspector. The Council may appoint a tree inspector
to coordinate the activities of the city relating to the control and
prevention of damage by shade tree pests. The tree inspector will recommend
to the Council the details of any program for the declaration, control, and
prevention of shade tree pests. The tree inspector is authorized to enforce
or cause to be enforced the tasks incident to such a program adopted by the
Council. The term "tree inspector" includes any person designated by Council
or the tree inspector to carry out activities authorized in this section.



   Subd. 8.   Inspection and application of control measures.



      A.   The tree inspector is authorized to inspect premises and
places within the city to determine whether shade tree pests exist thereon
and to investigate all reported incidents of shade tree pests. The tree
inspector is authorized to take all reasonable measures to prevent the
maintenance of shade tree pests and may enforce the provisions relating to
abatement in this section. Diagnosis of shade tree pests may be by the
presence of commonly recognized symptoms; by tests as may be recommended by
the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Agriculture or the
commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources; or other
reliable means.



      B.   Except in situations of imminent danger to human life and
safety, the tree inspector shall not enter private property for the purpose
of inspecting or preventing maintenance of a shade tree pest without the
permission of the owner, resident, or other person in control of the
property, unless the tree inspector has obtained a warrant or order from a
court of competent jurisdiction authorizing the entry.



      C.   No person, firm, or corporation shall interfere with the
tree inspector or with anyone acting under the tree inspector's authority
while engaged in activities authorized by this section.



   Subd. 9.   Abatement procedure. Except as provided in Subd. 12.,
whenever a tree inspector determines with reasonable certainty that a shade
pest is being maintained or exists on premises in the city, the tree
inspector is authorized to abate the shade tree pest according to the
procedures in this Subd. 9.



      A.   The tree inspector will notify in writing the owner of
record or occupant of the premises that a shade tree pest exists and order
that the shade tree pest be terminated or abated. The notice may be given in
person or by mail. Failure of any party to receive the mail does not
invalidate the service of the notice. A copy of the notice shall be filed
with the City Clerk.



      B.   The notice of abatement shall state that unless the shade
tree pest is abated by the owner or occupant, it will be abated by the city
at the expense of the owner or occupant. The notice shall specify the control
measures to be taken to abate the shade tree pest, and provide a reasonable
amount of time to abate the shade tree pest. The notice will also state that
the owner or occupant has the right to appeal the determination that a shade
tree pest exists by submitting a request in writing to the City Clerk within
seven days after service of the notice, or before the date by which abatement
must be completed, whichever comes first.



      C.   If no timely appeal is submitted, and the control
measures prescribed in the notice of abatement are not complied with within
the time provided by the notice or any additional time granted, the tree
inspector or designated person shall have the authority to obtain permission
or an administrative search warrant, enter the property, and carry out
abatement in accordance with the notice of abatement.



   Subd. 10.   High-cost abatement. If the tree inspector determines
that the cost of abating a shade tree pest will exceed $5,000 based on a
reasonable, good faith estimate, the written notice referred to in Subd. 9.
must provide that if the shade tree pest is not abated within the reasonable
amount of time provided, the matter will be referred to the City Council for
a hearing. The date, time, and location of the hearing must be provided in
the notice.



   Subd. 11.   Appeal procedure. If the City Clerk receives a written
request for a hearing on the question of whether a shade tree pest exists,
the City Council shall hold a hearing within 21 calendar days following
receipt by the Clerk of the written request. At least ten days notice of the
hearing shall be given to the individual who made the written request for the
hearing. The Council may modify the abatement notice or extend the time by
which abatement must be completed. Each owner, agent of the owner, occupant,
and lienholder of the subject property or properties in attendance, if any,
shall be given the opportunity to present evidence at the hearing. After
holding the hearing, the City Council may issue an order requiring abatement
of the shade tree pest.



   Subd. 12.   Abatement procedure in event of imminent danger.



      A.   If the tree inspector determines that the danger of
infestation to other shade trees is imminent, and delay in control measures
may put public health, safety, or welfare in immediate danger, the tree
inspector may provide for abatement without following Subd. 9. or 10. The
tree inspector must reasonably attempt to notify the owner or occupant of the
affected property of the intended action and the right to appeal the
abatement and any cost recovery at the next regularly scheduled City Council
meeting.



      B.   Nothing in this section shall prevent the city, without
notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition that poses an
imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.



   Subd. 13.   Recovery of cost of abatement; liability and assessment.



      A.   The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been abated
by the city shall be personally liable for the cost to the city of the
abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been
completed and the cost determined, the City Clerk or other official shall
prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon the amount
shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the City Clerk.



      B.   After notice and hearing, as provided in M.S. § 429.061
(which may be amended from time to time), the City Clerk shall, on or before
Sept. 1 next following abatement of the nuisance, list the total unpaid
charges as well as other charges for current services to be assessed under
M.S. § 429.101 against each separate lot or parcel to which the charges are
attributable. The City Council may then certify the charges against the
property to the County Auditor for collection along with current taxes the
following year or in annual installments as the City Council may determine in
each case.

(Police Officer)


 




 



   Subd. 11.   Release From Shelter. Before a seized animal is released
to its owner, the Shelter shall verify that the owner is compliant with this
chapter, as it relates to licensing, if applicable. The Shelter shall be
entitled to collect and retain a per diem, boarding, immunization fees, care
and adoption fees for any animals.



   Subd. 12.   Immobilization of Animals. For the purpose of
enforcement of this section, any peace officer may use a so-called
tranquilizer gun or other instrument for the purpose of immobilizing and
catching an animal.



   Subd. 13.   Barking Dogs.



      A.   It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or harbor a
dog which habitually barks or cries. Habitual barking shall be defined as
barking for repeated intervals of at least five minutes with less than one
minute of interruption. The barking must also be audible off of the owner's
or caretaker's premises.



      B.   Any police officer may enter onto private property and
seize any barking dog; provided that the following conditions exist:



         1.   There is an identified complainant other than the
peace officer making a contemporaneous complaint about the barking;



         2.   The peace officer reasonably believes that the
barking meets the criteria set forth in Subd. 13.A.;



         3.   The peace officer can demonstrate that there has
been at least one previous complaint of a dog barking at this address on a
prior date;



         4.   The peace officer has made reasonable attempts to
contact the owner of the dog(s) or the owner of the property and those
attempts have either failed or have been ignored;



         5.   The seizure will not involve forced entry into a
private residence. Use of a passkey obtained from a property manager,
landlord, innkeeper or other person authorized to have such a key shall not
be considered as a forced entry;



         6.   No other less intrusive means to stop the barking
is available; and



         7.   Written notice of the seizure is left in a
conspicuous place if personal contact with the owner of the dog is not
possible.



      C.   Any dog seized under the provisions of Subd. 13.B. shall
be taken to the Shelter and kept there to be reclaimed by the owner. The
owner shall pay all other fees required under Subd. 11. Any dog seized under
Subd. 13.B. which is unclaimed may be disposed of according to the provisions
of Subds. 9.B.



      D.   A person who violates § 10.46, Subd. 13.A. is guilty of
a petty misdemeanor.



   Subd. 14.   Interfering with a Peace Officer. No person shall, in
any manner, molest, hinder or interfere with any peace officer, or any other
individual employed directly or by contract with the city to capture animals
and convey them to the Shelter while the person is engaged in the occupation.



   Subd. 15.   Dangerous Dogs. No person may own, possess, keep,
harbor, maintain or otherwise have a dangerous dog in the city.



      A.   Notice of Potentially Dangerous or Dangerous Dogs. If,
after an investigation conducted by a peace officer, it is determined that a
dog is potentially dangerous or dangerous according to the criteria described
in Subd. 1. the Police Department will serve a notice of intent to declare
the dog potentially dangerous or dangerous on the owner of the dog in
question. This notice shall inform the owner of this designation, the basis
for the determination, the procedures for contesting the designation as
described in Subd. 15.B. and the result of the failure to contest the
designation as described in Subd. 15.H.



      B.   Contesting Declaration of Dangerous or Potentially
Dangerous Dogs. If the owner of a dog has received a notice of intent to
declare a dog as a potentially dangerous or dangerous dog, the owner may
request that a hearing be conducted to determine whether or not such a
designation is justified. This request must be made in writing and delivered
to the Police Department within 14 days of receipt of the notice of intent to
declare a dog as potentially dangerous or dangerous.



      C.   Initial Review. Upon receipt of the request, the Police
Department will forward the request along with all necessary supporting
documentation to the City Attorney. The City Attorney will make an initial
review of the evidence surrounding the notice to determine if there is
sufficient evidence supporting the designation to convene a hearing of the
Animal Control Review Panel. If there is insufficient evidence supporting the
designation, the City Attorney shall withdraw the designation and none of the
requirements of this section applying to dangerous or potentially dangerous
dogs shall apply to the dog in question. If there is sufficient evidence that
the Review Panel could uphold the designation, the City Attorney will cause
this notice to be brought to the attention of the Review Panel that will
conduct the hearing.



      D.   Hearing Procedure. This Review Panel will consist of the
Council President, a Council member as appointed by the Mayor, and an elector
who resides within the city. The Panel will schedule a hearing and may call
witnesses and review documents as needed to make a determination on the
issue. Owners shall have the right to present evidence on their behalf and to
cross-examine any witnesses. A simple majority of the members of the Panel is
necessary for a finding that the dog is either dangerous or potentially
dangerous. The burden of proof is on the Police Department. A finding
supporting a designation of dangerous or potentially dangerous dog must be
proven by a preponderance of the evidence. The decision of the Panel shall be
in writing and shall indicate the reasons for the findings. A copy of the
findings shall be provided to the Police Department and the dog owner.



      E.   Effect of Findings that Dog is Potentially Dangerous or
Dangerous. If the Panel finds there is sufficient basis to declare a dog as
potentially dangerous or dangerous, that finding will serve as notice to the
owner that the dog is in fact a potentially dangerous or dangerous dog.
Within 14 days after the owner has received notice that the dog is dangerous,
the owner must cause the animal to be humanely destroyed or removed from the
city limits.



      F.   Appeal. If the owner of the dog disputes the decision of
the Review Panel, the owner shall have the right to appeal the decision to
the City Council, The appeal must be filed with the City Clerk within 14 days
of the Panel's ruling. If the owner of the dog disputes the findings of the
City Council, the owner may appeal to the Minnesota Court of Appeals as
provided by state law.



      G.   Mayor to Appoint Veterinarian and Substitute Panel
Members. The Mayor of the city may appoint a veterinarian to serve on the
Hearing Panel on a voluntary basis in lieu of the elector. The appointment
shall continue in effect until the appointee resigns or is replaced by the
Mayor. In the event the veterinarian is temporarily unavailable or has a
personal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the Mayor may appoint
another veterinarian to replace the initial appointee on the Panel. In
addition, in the event the City Council President or relevant Council member
is temporarily unavailable or has a personal interest in the outcome of the
proceeding, the Mayor may appoint other members of the City Council or city
staff to sit in their place.



      H.   Failure to Contest Notice of Intent to Declare.



         1.   If the owner of a dog receives a notice from the
Police Department of the intent to declare the dog as potentially dangerous
or dangerous, and the owner fails to contest that notice within 14 days, the
owner shall be considered as having forfeited the right to the hearing
described in Subd. 15.D. and as having consented to the designation of the
dog as potentially dangerous or dangerous by default.



         2.   The Police Department will then issue a declaration
of dangerous or potentially dangerous dog to the owner. Within 14 days after
the owner has received notice that the dog is dangerous, the owner must cause
the animal to be humanely destroyed or removed from the city limits.



      I.   Seizure of Dangerous Dogs and Violations. The peace
officer shall immediately seize any dangerous dog and/or issue a citation to
the owner of any dangerous dog if within 14 days after the owner has received
notice that the dog is dangerous, the dog is not humanely destroyed or
removed from the city limits.



      J.   Exemptions. Dogs may not be declared potentially
dangerous or dangerous if the threat, injury or damage was sustained by a
person:



         1.   Who was at the time of injury committing or
attempting to commit a willful trespass or other tort or crime upon the
premises occupied by the dog;



         2.   Who was provoking, tormenting, teasing, abusing or
assaulting the dog or who can be shown to have repeatedly, in the past,
provoked, tormented, teased, abused or assaulted the dog; or



         3.   Who was committing or attempting to commit a crime.



      K.   Law Enforcement Exemption. The provisions of this section
do not apply to trained dogs used by law enforcement personnel officials for
police work.



   Subd. 16.   Enforcement. The peace officer may enter upon private
land where there is reasonable cause to believe this section is being
violated. Any person who brings an animal into the city is subject to this
section.



   Subd. 17.   Summary Destruction. Notwithstanding the provisions set
forth in Subd. 15. whenever a peace officer has reasonable cause to believe
that a particular animal presents a clear and immediate danger to residents
of the city because it is infected with rabies or because of a clearly
demonstrated vicious nature, the officer, after making reasonable attempts to
impound the animal, may summarily destroy the animal.



   Subd. 18.   Obstructing. No person shall tamper, hinder or interfere
with any live trap set for the purpose of capturing cats found to be running
at large, or break open any trap, or attempt to do so, or to take or let out
any cat captured therein. A violation of this section shall constitute a
petty misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $300 or that amount
which may be lawfully prescribed by a municipality for an ordinance violation
that is defined as a petty misdemeanor.



   Subd. 19.   Quarantine of Unvaccinated Animal. The owner of an
animal that inflicts a bite on a human shall provide to the Police Department
evidence that the animal is current on its rabies vaccination. The Police
Department may seize and hold the animal at the Shelter for a period of not
less than ten days if evidence of a current rabies vaccination is not
presented or otherwise of record. If the animal is owned by a resident of the
city, the animal may be reclaimed by the owner upon payment of impounding,
boarding and immunization fees; if the animal is a dog, the owner must also
provide proof of current licensure or purchase a dog license. If the animal
is owned by a person not a resident of the city, the animal may be reclaimed
by the owner upon payment of impounding, boarding fees and immunization fees.
Any animal impounded pursuant to this section cannot be reclaimed or released
until such time that the animal has been immunized for rabies. In the event
any dog, cat, or other impounded animal is unclaimed after the expiration of
any applicable redemption or quarantine period set forth in Minnesota Statues
or Redwood Falls City Ordinances, whichever is longer, they shall become the
property of the Shelter and may be disposed of, adopted, or sold in its sole
discretion. All proceeds from the disposition of such animals shall be the
sole property of the Shelter, including any proceeds received from any
animals disposed of in accordance with M.S. § 35.71.

(Ord. 54, Fourth Series, passed 12-6-2016)



§ 10.69  ABATEMENT PROCEDURE.



   Subd. 1.   Procedure. Whenever the peace officer or other designated
official determines that a public nuisance or violation of this chapter is
being maintained or exists on the premises in the city, the official shall
notify in writing the owner of record or occupant of the premises of such
fact and order that the nuisance be terminated or abated. The notice shall be
by certified or registered mail. The notice of violation shall specify the
steps to be taken to abate the nuisance and the time within which the
nuisance is to be abated, not to exceed 30 days. If the notice of violation
is not complied with within the time specified, the official shall report
that fact forthwith to the City Council. Thereafter, the City Council may,
after notice to the owner or occupant and an opportunity to be heard,
determine that the condition identified in the notice of violation is a
nuisance and further order that if the nuisance is not abated within



the time prescribed by the City Council, the city may take any and all action
necessary to abate said nuisance immediately and may assess to the landowner
any and all costs incurred therein, including legal fees and costs, and said
assessment shall be a specific lien against any real estate owned by said
landowner.



   Subd. 2.   Notice. Written notice of the violation; notice of the
time, date, place, and subject of any hearing before the City Council; notice
of the City Council order; and notice of motion for summary enforcement
hearing shall be served by a peace officer or designated official on the
owner of record or occupant of the premises either in person or by certified
or registered mail. If the premises is not occupied, the owner of record is
unknown, or if the owner of record or occupant refuses to accept notice,
notice of the violation shall be served by posting it on the premises.



   Subd. 3.   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of
emergency, where delay in abatement required to complete the procedure and
notice requirements as set forth in Subds. 1. and 2. of this section will
permit a continuing nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health, safety,
or welfare, the City Council may order summary enforcement and abate the
nuisance. To proceed with summary enforcement, the peace officer or other
designated official shall determine that a public nuisance exists or is being
maintained on premises in the city and that delay in abatement will
unreasonably endanger public health, safety, or welfare. The officer or
designated official shall notify in writing the occupant or owner of the
premises of the nature of the nuisance, whether public health, safety, or
welfare will be unreasonably endangered by delay in abatement required to
complete the procedure set forth in Subds. 1. and 2. of this section and may
order that the nuisance be immediately terminated or abated. If the nuisance
is not immediately terminated or abated, the City Council may order summary
enforcement and abate the nuisance.



   Subd. 4.   Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall
prevent the city, without notice or other process, from immediately abating
any condition that poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or
safety.



   Subd. 5.   Judicial remedy. Nothing in this section shall prevent
the city from seeking a judicial remedy when no other adequate administrative
remedy exists.



   Subd. 6.   Personal liability. The owner of the premises on which a
nuisance has been abated by the city, or a person who has caused a public
nuisance on property not owned by that person, shall be personally liable for
the cost to the city of the abatement, including administrative costs. As
soon as the work has been completed and the cost determined, the City Clerk
or other city official shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the
owner. Thereupon the amount shall be immediately due and payable at the
office of the City Clerk.



   Subd. 7.   Assessment. After notice and hearing as provided in M.S.
§ 429.061, as it may be amended from time to time, if the nuisance is a
public health or safety hazard on private property, the accumulation of snow
and ice on public sidewalks, the growth of weeds on private property or
outside the traveled portion of streets, or unsound or insect-infected trees,
the City Clerk shall, on or before September 1 next following abatement of
the nuisance, list the total unpaid charges along with all other such charges
as well as other charges for current services to be assessed under M.S. §
429.101 against each separate lot or parcel to which the charges are
attributable. The City Council may then spread the charges against the
property under that statute and any other pertinent statutes for
certification to the County Auditor and collection along with current taxes
the following year or in annual installments, not exceeding ten, as the City
Council may determine in each case.

CHAPTER 20: LISTING OF UNCODIFIED ORDINANCES IN EFFECT



   All ordinances described in this chapter remain in effect after
adoption of the City Code. They are of a permanent and continuing nature as
authority for a specific act which has been performed. These ordinances are
of two types, that generally distinguish them from other provisions of the
City Code, either (1) their texts have no continuing reference value, or (2)
they are in the nature of a contract and of only occasional reference value.
For these reasons it appears justified to list and describe them here only to
facilitate finding them in the event this becomes necessary.

Variances are intended to provide a means of departure from the literal requirements of this ordinance where strict adherence would cause practical difficulties due to special conditions or circumstances unique to a site. It is not the intent of this section to allow a variance for a use that is not permitted within a particular zoning district.
3.45 Application for Variance
Any person having a legal or equitable interest in a property may file an application for one or more variances.

3.47 Action by City Council on Variances

(1) The property owner proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner not permitted by the zoning ordinance.
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 48
(2) The plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the property not created by the landowner.
(3) The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality.
(C) Economic considerations and/or applicant preference, alone, do not constitute “practical difficulties.” Variances shall be granted for earth sheltered construction as defined in M.S. § 216C.06, Subd. 14. Neither the Board of Appeals and Adjustment, nor the City Council, may permit as a variance any use that is not allowed under the zoning ordinance for property in the zone where the affected person's land is located.
3.49 Variance Conditions and Guarantees

ARTICLE 10. VACATIONS OF STREET, EASEMENT, OR OTHER PUBLIC RESERVATIONS
3.51 Purpose of Vacation

3.52 Petition of Vacation
No public grounds, streets or alleys shall be vacated except upon the Council's own motion or upon the petition directed to the Council of a majority of the owners of property on the line of the public grounds, streets or alleys residing within the City, and completion of the procedure hereinafter specified. The petition shall set forth the reasons for the desired vacation, accompanied by a plat of the public grounds, streets or alleys proposed to be vacated, and the petition shall be verified by the oath of a majority of the petitioners residing within the City.
3.53 Hearing on Application for Vacation
The City Administrator shall give notice of the hearing by publication once at least 15 days in advance of the hearing, and by mail to the last known address of all of the owners of property on the line of the public grounds, streets or alleys proposed to be vacated at least ten days in advance of the hearing, the last known addresses to be obtained from the office of the County Auditor. The notice shall in brief state the object of the hearing, the time, place and purpose thereof, and the fact that the Council, or a board or commission designated by it shall hear the testimony and examine the evidence of the parties interested.
If, in the discretion of the Council, it is expedient that the matter be proceeded with, it may under the petition filed for record with the City Administrator, order a hearing on the petition and fix the time and place of the hearing as provided in Section 3.11.
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 49
3.54 Action by City Council on Vacation
The Council, after hearing the same, or upon the report of the board or commission designated to hold the hearings, may, by ordinance approved by a majority of the Council, declare such public grounds, streets or alleys vacated. Upon passage, the ordinance shall be certified by the City Administrator and shall be filed for record and duly recorded in the office of the County Recorder in and for Redwood County, Minnesota.
3.55 Required Findings for Vacation of Street, Alley, or other Public Reservation
Unless specified otherwise, the vacation of any public ground, street, alley or segment thereof under this section shall not destroy or interfere with the right of any person, corporation or municipality owning or having control of any electric light or telephone pole or lines existing upon the street at the time of the vacation thereof or with any sewer or water pipes, mains or hydrants thereon or thereunder to enter upon the street or portion thereof vacated for the purpose of repairing the same or otherwise attending thereto.
The City Council shall make the following findings in granting approval of the vacation of a street, alley, or other public reservation:
(A) No private rights will be injured or endangered as a result of the vacation.
(B) The public will not suffer loss or inconvenience resulting from the granting of the requested vacation.
(C) No written objection has been received, prior to the public hearing, from an adjacent property owner who did not join in the application.
3.56 Property Interests After a Vacation
When a street is lawfully vacated, the easement granting the public the right to travel the street ceases to exist, the title to the land under the street reverts to the underlying fee owners of the property for their exclusive use and enjoyment. There shall be no compensation to the City for loss of the vacated street. Once a street has been vacated, the vacation means a permanent loss of the City’s interest of that street.

4.03 Non-conforming use restrictions
(A) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the placing of a structure in safe condition when the structure is declared unsafe by the Building Official providing the necessary repairs shall not constitute more than 50% of fair market value of the structure. The value shall be determined by the County Assessor.
(B) When a non-conforming principal use has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed to any non-conforming use.
(C) Repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance and improvement of a structure containing or related to a non-conforming use are permitted, except as provided in subsection (F) below.
(D) Whenever a lawful non-conforming use of a structure or land is discontinued for a period of one year, following written notice from the Building Official pursuant to Council authorization, any future use of the structure or land shall be made to conform with the provisions of this chapter.
(F) If, at any time, a non-conforming building, structure or use shall be destroyed to the extent of more than 50% of its fair market value, the value to be determined by the County Assessor, then without further action by the Council, the building and the land on which the building was located or maintained shall, from and after the date of the destruction, be subject to all the regulations specified by these zoning regulations for the district in which the land and buildings are located. Any building which is damaged to an extent of less than 50% of its value may be restored to its former extent. Estimate of the extent of damage or destruction shall be made by the Building Official.
(G) A lawful non-conforming use of a structure or parcel of land may be changed to lessen the non-conformity of use. Once a non-conforming structure or parcel of land has been changed, it shall not thereafter be so altered to increase the non-conformity.
(H) No non-conforming building, structure or use shall be moved to another lot or to any other part of the parcel of land upon which the same was constructed or was conducted on the effective date of this Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 52
chapter, or amendments hereto, unless the movement shall bring the non-conformance into compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
4.04 Non-conforming buildings or structures
(A) A principal or accessory building or structure which is non-conforming due to dimensions or setbacks from property lines may be expanded in compliance with the following:
(1) The addition or alteration does not increase the degree of non-conformity or further infringe upon established setbacks or building restrictions.
(B) Normal Repairs, replacement, restoration, maintenance, and improvement of a building or other structure containing or related to a lawful non-conforming use is permitted, including necessary non-structural repairs and incidental alterations which do not physically extend or intensify the non-conforming use, except as provided in subsection (C) below.
(C) A non-conforming building or structure which is destroyed by fire or other peril to the extent of greater than 50 percent of its market value, as determined by the City Assessor and Building Official and no building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is damaged, shall not be restored except in conformance with the City code.
(D) If a non-conforming structure is moved for any reason, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located.
(E) Whenever a lawful non-conforming use of a structure or land is discontinued for a period of one year, following written notice from the Building Official pursuant to Council authorization, any future use of the structure or land shall be made to conform with the provisions of this chapter.
(F) Alterations may be made to a building containing lawful non-conforming residential units when they will improve the livability thereof, provided they will not increase the number of dwelling units or the lot area coverage of the building.
(G) Any proposed structure which will, under this chapter, become non-conforming but for which a building permit has been lawfully granted prior to the effective date of this chapter, or amendments hereto, may be completed in accordance with the approved plans; provided construction is started within 60 days of the effective date of this chapter, or amendments thereto, is not abandoned for a period of more than 120 days, and continues to completion within two years. Such structure and use shall thereafter be a legally non-conforming structure and use.

Chapter 5 Site Plan Review
ARTICLE 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
5.01 Purpose
Site plan review standards and guidelines are established to promote development that is compatible with nearby properties, neighborhood character, and natural features, to minimize conflict between pedestrian and vehicular traffic, to promote public safety, and to visually enhance development within the City. The requirements of this chapter aim to recognize the unique character of land and development and the need for flexibility in site plan review.
5.02 Uses Subject to Site Plan Review
The site plan review requirements of this chapter shall apply to all new construction, remodeling, or expansion of commercial, industrial, or multi-family residential uses, with the following exceptions:
(A) The use is established in an existing building that has received site plan approval, and the establishment of the use does not alter the approved site plan for the property.
(B) Proposed modifications are strictly related to the interior of the building.
(C) Modifications, additions, or enlargements to a building which do not increase the gross floor area by more than five-hundred (500) square feet or ten (10) percent, whichever is less, and which do not require a variance from the provisions of this ordinance.
(D) Grading or site preparation that results in minor modifications to the existing site, as approved by the City Engineer.
5.03 Site plan Requirements
(A) In general. Except in those instances specified in Section 5.02, site plan approval is required prior to issuance of a building permit for any proposed construction or issuance of a zoning certificate for any proposed use. When a site plan is required in support of a request for conditional use permit or variance approval, such plan shall also be subject to the requirements established within this chapter.
(B) Required information. All site plans shall be drawn to scale and shall contain the following information, unless otherwise specifically waived by the Zoning Administrator:
(1) A vicinity map which shall include the location of any railroads, major streams or rivers, and public streets in the vicinity of the site.
(2) The boundaries and dimensions shown graphically, along with a written legal description of the property.
(3) The present and proposed topography of the site and adjacent areas within fifty (50) feet by contour lines at an interval of not more than five (5) feet, and by use of directional arrows, the proposed flow of storm water runoff from the site.
(4) The location of existing and proposed structures, with height and gross floor area appropriately noted.

A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued without completion of all elements on the site plan, provided written assurance is given that all improvements will be completed with a timeline that is approved by City staff.
ARTICLE 2. BUILDING AND SITE DESIGN GUIDELINES
5.05 Purpose
Building and site design guidelines, as established in this section, are for the purpose of promoting quality development in terms of attractiveness, convenience, ease of access, and compatibility with surrounding uses. These guidelines are intended to be general in nature and are not intended to restrict creativity, variety, or innovation. However, unless site characteristics or conditions dictate otherwise, the City’s expectation is that these guidelines be adhered to. In cases where building and site design standards are specific in nature and required as part of this ordinance, such standards are noted within the individual zoning district chapters.
5.06 Architectural Consistency
(A) In general. Building materials for all projects should be durable, require low maintenance, and be of the same or better quality than those used at surrounding properties. Special care should be given to those elevations that face a public street or residential area, with quality building materials selected that will enhance the surrounding neighborhood or view from the street.
(B) Architectural variety. Buildings design and finish colors should be consistent or compliment neighboring structures. Colors that are not consistent with neighboring structures because they are of bold or bright color palettes shall not be used. Doors, screening walls, or other architectural features should be painted or finished to complement the color of the building.
(C) Signage. Signage should be integrated as an architectural element, with attention given to the color, scale, and orientation of all proposed signs in relation to the overall design of the building.
5.07 Site Layout Guidelines
(A) Existing site features. Site design, where feasible, should incorporate existing topography and natural features, such as hillsides, wooded areas, and greenways. Important vistas and viewpoints, both from the site and into the site, should be protected and enhanced.
(B) Building arrangement. When multiple buildings are proposed for a site, care should be taken to provide maximum street exposure for all buildings. Pad site buildings should be located using elevations and angles that do not inhibit the view of other buildings on the site.
(C) Service and docking facilities. Loading, delivery, and service bays should be oriented away from existing residences and public streets. When site considerations do not allow for such orientation, such service and docking areas should be screened from view through the provision of walls, fencing, or landscaping. Industrial zoning districts are exempt from these screening requirements.
(D) Lighting. Lighting location should provide for security and visual interest while limiting impact on adjacent properties. All light sources adjacent to residential properties shall be shielded from view, with illumination directed in a manner to prevent bleeding and glare onto adjacent properties and public right-of-way. Additionally, parking and loading areas should be located in such a manner to minimize the chance of headlights shining into residential windows. Performance standards related to glare and lighting are further specified in Section 7.34. Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 56
(E) Drive-through facilities. Drive-through facilities, where permitted in the applicable zoning district, are permitted when the resulting traffic patterns are safe, easily understood, and provide sufficient stacking space based on the requirements shown in Section 9. Drive-through windows should be placed on an elevation that does not face a public street. Loudspeakers should be so directed to avoid the creation of a nuisance for adjacent properties.
(F) Public safety through site design. Site plans should employ design principles aimed at crime prevention, such as the promotion of natural surveillance and visibility, minimization of the number of entrances and exits to the site, and clear distinction between public and non-public spaces.
(G) Stormwater management. Site design should utilize practices to minimize off-site stormwater runoff, increase on-site filtration, and minimize the discharge of pollutants to ground water and surface water. Consideration should be given to reducing the need for stormwater management facilities by incorporating the use of natural topography and existing land cover. Design should also discourage stormwater from adjacent properties.
5.08 Vehicular Access and Circulation
(A) In general. Vehicular circulation should be designed to minimize conflicts with pedestrian access and circulation within surrounding residential areas. Primary access should be from streets designed to handle higher traffic volumes, rather than from streets whose primary purpose is to serve residential areas.
(B) Entrance and exits. All entrances and exits should be designed to facilitate efficient and safe traffic flow for both inbound and out-bound traffic. Parking spaces that require backing into an entrance or exit drive are discouraged. Figure 5-1 illustrates a site with efficient separation between access driveways and parking areas.
(C) Internal traffic circulation. Internal traffic circulation patterns should be easily understood, allow for efficient movement of traffic, and be designed in such a way to reduce the potential for traffic accidents. When multiple buildings are proposed as part of a development, the use of access easements is encouraged to ensure adequate access in the event of any property ownership changes.
(D) Snow storage and removal. Adequate areas for snow storage should be provided on site in order to eliminate the utilization of access drives and parking areas for such purposes.
(E) Service and delivery access. Reasonable access for service and delivery vehicles should be provided which does not conflict with pedestrian or general vehicle use of the site. Access points for such vehicles should provide as direct a route as possible to service and loading dock areas while avoiding movement through parking areas, as shown in Figure 5-2.

(5) The location, common name, size, and quantity of all proposed landscape materials.
(6) Proposed seeding or sodding plans for all disturbed areas, including the type of ground cover and method of application.
(7) The location and height of any proposed earth berms, fences, or other measures used to satisfy the screening requirements of this chapter.
5.11 Landscape Design Requirements
Landscape design shall serve to provide visually interesting open space, to reduce the potential negative impact of development on adjacent land uses, and to facilitate the preservation and reestablishment of plants native to the region. The following items are required in developing a landscape plan for submittal to the City:
(A) The overall composition and location of landscaped areas should complement the scale of the development and its surroundings.
(B) Plant materials should be selected and arranged to prevent blocking or obscuring of required site lighting during all stages of plant growth.
(C) Plantings at intersections or driveway entrances shall be arranged to allow a permanently clear, safe sight distance.
(D) Trees or shrubs shall not be planted under existing or proposed utility lines when their ultimate height may interfere with the lowest lines. Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 58

(F) Landscaped areas should be of adequate size to promote proper plant growth and to protect plantings from pedestrian traffic, vehicle traffic, and other types of concentrated activity.
(G) Landscaped areas and plantings should be located in a manner to prevent spread onto adjacent properties or right-of-way, and to allow adequate room for proper maintenance.
5.12 Landscaping Requirements, Single and Two-Family Residential Uses
Trees are permitted in all yards of residential uses, except in line of sight triangle on corner lots. Trees/bushes/plants that have the potential to grow large in size shall be planted no closer than five (5) feet to the property line. Those trees/bushes/plants shall be maintained to not burden other property owners. All remaining lot area not used for structures, parking area, or driveway shall be landscaped with traditional grasses that shall be maintained, and lot area may be landscaped with ground cover (i.e. mulch or rocks), or other perennial flowering plants, vines, shrubs, or trees.
5.13 Landscaping Requirements, Industrial Districts

Chapter 9 Off-Street Parking and Loading
ARTICLE 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
9.01 Purpose
Parking and loading regulations are established to alleviate or prevent congestion of the public right-of-way, to provide for the parking and loading needs of uses and structures, to enhance the compatibility between parking and loading areas and their surroundings, and to regulate the number, design, maintenance, and location of required off-street parking and loading spaces, and access driveways and aisles.
9.02 Change of Use or Occupancy of Land or Buildings
No change of use or occupancy of land already dedicated to a parking area, parking spaces or loading spaces shall be made, nor shall any sale of land, division or subdivision of land be made which reduces area necessary for parking, parking stalls or parking requirements below the minimum prescribed by these zoning regulations. Any change of use or occupancy of any building or buildings including additions thereto requiring more parking area shall not be permitted until there is furnished such additional parking spaces as required by these zoning regulations.
9.03 Existing Facilities
Existing parking and loading facilities shall not be reduced below the requirements for a similar new use or, if less than the requirements for a similar new use, they shall not be reduced further. Should a non-conforming structure or use be damaged or destroyed by fire, it may be re-established if elsewhere permitted in these zoning regulations, except that in doing so, any off-street parking or loading space which existed before shall be retained. Any use which depends upon off-site parking to meet the requirements of this chapter shall maintain ownership and parking utilization of the off-site location until such time as on-site parking is provided or a site in closer proximity to the principal use is acquired and developed for parking.
9.04 Use
Required parking and loading spaces and the driveways providing access to them shall not be used for storage, display, sales, rental or repair of motor vehicles or other goods, or for the storage of inoperable vehicles or snow. Additionally, no fee shall be charged for any required parking space.

(D) The site used for off-site parking shall be under the same ownership as the principal use being served or the use of the parking facilities shall be protected by a recorded instrument acceptable to the City.
9.06 Calculation of Requirements
Calculating the number of parking spaces required shall be in accordance with the following:
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 110
(A) Gross floor area. The term “gross floor area” (GFA) for the purpose of calculating the number of off-street parking spaces required shall be determined on the basis of the exterior floor dimensions of the building, structure, or use times the number of floors, minus ten (10) percent.
(B) In stadiums, sports arenas, churches and other places of public assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews or other similar seating facilities, each 18 inches of the seating facilities shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of determining requirements.
(C) In cases where parking requirements are based on “capacity” of persons, capacity shall be based on the maximum number of persons that may occupy a place, as determined by the Building Code. Maximum capacity shall be posted within the establishment. Both indoor and outdoor seating is included in maximum capacity.
(D) When calculating the number of off-street parking spaces results in a fraction, each fraction of one-half (½) or more shall require another space.
(E) Except in shopping centers or where joint parking requirements have been approved, if a structure or site contains two or more uses, each use shall be calculated separately in determining the total off-street parking spaces required.
(F) In cases where future potential uses of a building may generate additional parking demand, the City may require a proof of parking plan for the site, showing how the anticipated parking demand will be met. The City may permit the additional land area that would be required for anticipated parking to be placed in reserve as landscaped open space until needed.

ARTICLE 2. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT DISTRICTS
14.05 Floodplain District Purpose
The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, in compliance with directives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) and the National Flood Insurance Program (“NFIP”) has requested that the City of Redwood Falls adopt and incorporate the “Flood Insurance Study, Redwood County, Minnesota And Incorporated Areas,” the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map Panels numbered 27127C0145C, 27127C0153C, 27127C0154C, 27127C0161C and 27127C0162C, and to make other pertinent revisions to the existing floodplain ordinance to bring it into compliance with FEMA regulations, NFIP requirements and the “Statewide Standards and Criteria for Management of Floodplain Areas of Minnesota” as set out in Minnesota Statutes § 103F and Minnesota Rules 6120.5000 to 6120.6200. To comply with these federal and state requirements, to provide for the protection and safety of residents, and to ensure that flood insurance remains available to affected residents, Redwood Falls Code of Ordinances § 11.65 and § 11.66 shall be combined into a unified floodplain ordinance and shall be amended and restated in their entirety as follows:
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 165
14.06 Statutory Authorization
The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minnesota Statutes Chapter 103F and 462 delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Redwood Falls, Minnesota does ordain as follows:
14.07 Findings of Fact
(A) The flood hazard areas of the City of Redwood Falls, Minnesota, are subject to periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures or flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(B) Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. This Ordinance is based upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
(C) National Flood Insurance Program Compliance. This Ordinance is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59 -78, as amended, so as to maintain the community’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
14.08 Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in section 14.07(A) by provisions contained herein.
14.09 Lands to Which Ordinance Applies
This Ordinance shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Redwood Falls, Minnesota shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or the attachments thereto as being located within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General Flood Plain Districts.
14.10 Establishment of Official Zoning Map
The Official Zoning Map together with all materials attached thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Ordinance. The attached material shall include the Flood Insurance Study, Redwood County, Minnesota And Incorporated Areas, the Flood Insurance Rate Map Index for Redwood County, Minnesota And Incorporated Areas with a Map Number of 27127CIND1A and the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels therein for Redwood County, Minnesota And Incorporated Areas numbered 27127C0145C, 27127C0153C, 27127C0154C, 27127C0161C and 27127C0162C; all of the aforementioned documents being dated July 16, 2013 and prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Official Zoning Map shall be on file in the Office of the City Clerk and the Zoning Administrator.
14.11 Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation
The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one (1) foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from designation of a floodway.
14.12 Interpretation
(A) In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the City Council and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
(B) The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the Official Zoning Map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the Official Zoning Map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 166
boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the decision of the Zoning Administrator, the City Council shall make the necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the site at the time the Community adopted its initial floodplain ordinance or on the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the 100-year floodplain if earlier, and other available technical data. Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the City Council, following review and recommendation from the Planning Commission, and to submit technical evidence.
14.13 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions
It is not intended by this Ordinance to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this Ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this Ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
14.14 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
This Ordinance does not imply that areas outside the flood plain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of Redwood Falls, Minnesota or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
14.15 Severability
If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this Ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Ordinance shall not be affected thereby.
14.16 Definitions
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage and so as to give this Ordinance its most reasonable application.
(A) Accessory Use or Structure - a use or structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure.
(B) Basement - means any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of excavation below ground level.
(C) Conditional Use - means a specific type of structure or land use listed in the official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that: (a) certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist; and (b) the structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan if one exists and are compatible with the existing neighborhood.
(D) Equal Degree of Encroachment - a method of determining the location of floodway boundaries so that flood plain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
(E) Flood - a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
(F) Flood Frequency - the frequency for which it is expected that a specific flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
(G) Flood Fringe - that portion of the flood plain outside of the floodway. Flood fringe is synonymous with the term "floodway fringe" used in the Flood Insurance Study for Redwood County, Minnesota and Incorporated Areas.
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 167
(H) Flood Plain - the beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.
(I) Flood Proofing - a combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or elimination of flood damages.
(J) Floodway - the bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and those portions of the adjoining flood plain which are reasonably required to carry or store the regional flood discharge.
(K) Lowest Floor - the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor.
(L) Manufactured Home - a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include the term “recreational vehicle.”
(M) Obstruction - any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence, stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory flood plain which may impede, retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by such water.
(O) Principal Use or Structure - means all uses or structures that are not accessory uses or structures.
(P) Reach - a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings would most typically constitute a reach.
(Q) Recreational Vehicle - a vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the purposes of this Ordinance, the term recreational vehicle shall be synonymous with the term travel trailer/travel vehicle.
(R) Regional Flood - a flood which is representative of large floods known to have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term "base flood" used in a flood insurance study.

(V) Substantial Improvement - within any consecutive 365-day period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “substantial Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 168
damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (a) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or (b) any alteration of an “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an “historic structure.” For the purpose of this Ordinance, “historic structure” shall be as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1.
(W) Variance - means a modification of a specific permitted development standard required in an official control including this Ordinance to allow an alternative development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in a community's respective planning and zoning enabling legislation.

(D) Standards for Floodway Conditional Uses
(1) All Uses. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected.
(2) All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and standards contained in section 14.25(D) of this Ordinance.
(3) The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists.
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 170
(4) Fill.
(a) Fill, dredge spoil, and all other similar materials deposited or stored in the flood plain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method.
(b) Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
(c) As an alternative, and consistent with (b) immediately above, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the City Council has received an appropriate plan which assures the removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available. The conditional use permit must be title registered with the property in the Office of the County Recorder.
(5) Accessory Structures.
(a) Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
(b) Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of flood waters:
(1) Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
(2) So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
(c) Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry flood proofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 flood proofing classification in the State Building Code provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size at its largest projection, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All flood proofed accessory structures must meet the following additional standards:
(1) The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
(2) Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly flood proofed; and
(3) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings. Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 171
(6) Storage of Materials and Equipment.
(a) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
(b) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the City Council.
(7) Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be subject to the provisions of Minnesota Statute, Chapter 103G. Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to remove areas from the regulatory flood plain shall not be allowed in the floodway.
(8) A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream.
14.20 Flood Fringe District
(A) Permitted Uses. Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district(s). If no pre-existing, underlying zoning use districts exist, then any residential or non-residential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted use in the Flood Fringe District provided such use does not constitute a public nuisance. All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for Flood Fringe District “Permitted Uses” listed in section 14.20(B) and the "Standards for all Flood Fringe Uses" listed in section 14.20(E).
(B) Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses.
(1) All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one (1) foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least fifteen (15) feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
(2) As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at its largest projection may be internally flood proofed in accordance with section 14.19(D)(5)(c).
(3) The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of one-thousand (1,000) cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a conditional use, unless said fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with section 14.20(B)(1) of this ordinance.
(4) The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
(5) The provisions of section 14.20(E) of this Ordinance shall apply.
(C) Conditional Uses. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or flood proofed in accordance with sections 14.20(B)(1) – 14.20(B)(2), and/or any use of land that does not comply with the standards in sections 14.20(B)(3) – 14.20(B)(4), shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An application for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures specified in sections 14.20(D) – 14.20(E) and section 14.25(D) of this Ordinance.
(D) Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses. Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 172
(1) Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if: 1) the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure; 2) it is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and 3) it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards:
(a) Design and Certification. The structure's design and as-built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State Building Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
(b) Specific Standards for Above-grade, Enclosed Areas. Above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate: (1) A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a flood proofing technique. There shall be a minimum of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot above grade. The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters without any form of human intervention; and (2) That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage.
(2) Basements, as defined by section 14.16(B) of this Ordinance, shall be subject to the following:
(a) Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation.
(b) Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry flood proofed in accordance with section 14.20(D)(3) of this Ordinance.
(3) All areas of non-residential structures including basements to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be flood proofed in accordance with the structurally dry flood proofing classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally dry flood proofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing classification in the State Building Code and this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted.
(4) When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless the community is enforcing a state approved shoreland
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 173
management ordinance. In the absence of a state approved shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the City Council. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the flood plain if adequate flood warning time exists.
(5) Storage of Materials and Equipment.
(a) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
(b) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the City Council.
(6) The provisions of section 14.20(E) of this Ordinance shall also apply.
(E) Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses.
(1) All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two (2) feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the City Council must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
(2) Commercial Uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four (4) upon occurrence of the regional flood.
(3) Manufacturing and Industrial Uses. Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in section 14.20(E)(2) above. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in flood plain areas.
(4) Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation - FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
(5) Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the Official Zoning Map.
(6) Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in section 14.24(C).
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 174
(7) All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
14.21 General Flood Plain District
(A) Permissible Uses.
(1) The uses listed in section 14.19(A) of this Ordinance shall be permitted uses.
(2) All other uses shall be subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria pursuant to section 14.21(B) below. Section 14.19 shall apply if the proposed use is in the Floodway District and section 14.20 shall apply if the proposed use is in the Flood Fringe District.
(B) Procedures for Floodway and Flood Fringe Determinations Within the General Flood Plain District.
(1) Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the General Flood Plain District, the applicant shall be required to furnish such of the following information as is deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator for the determination of the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use is within the Floodway or Flood Fringe District.
(a) A typical valley cross-section(s) showing the channel of the stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water information.
(b) Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground, pertinent structure, fill, or storage elevations, the size, location, and spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site, and the location and elevations of streets.
(c) Photographs showing existing land uses, vegetation upstream and downstream, and soil types.
(d) Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed development.
(2) The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District and to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation. Procedures consistent with Minnesota Regulations 1983, Parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200 and 44 Code of Federal Regulations Part 65 shall be followed in this expert evaluation. The designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective Department of Natural Resources' Area Hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis. The designated engineer or expert shall:
(a) Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood.
(b) Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.
(c) Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood stages more than 0.5 foot. A lesser stage increase than .5' shall be required if, as a result of the additional stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in computing floodway boundaries.
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 175
(3) The Zoning Administrator shall present the technical evaluation and findings of the designated engineer or expert to the City Council. The Council must formally accept the technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood Fringe District boundary or deny the permit application. The City Council, prior to official action, may submit the application and all supporting data and analyses to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Department of Natural Resources or the Planning Commission for review and comment. Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District Boundaries have been determined, the City Council shall refer the matter back to the Zoning Administrator who shall process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of sections 14.19 and 14.20 of this Ordinance.
14.22 Subdivisions

All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that comply with the provisions of this Ordinance and have road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. For all subdivisions in the flood plain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting documents.
(B) Floodway/Flood Fringe Determinations in the General Flood Plain District. In the General Flood Plain District, applicants shall provide the information required in section 14.21(B) of this Ordinance to determine the 100-year flood elevation, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries and the regulatory flood protection elevation for the subdivision site.
(C) Removal of Special Flood Hazard Area Designation. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
14.23 Public Utilities, Railroads, Roads and Bridges
(A) Public Utilities. All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer, and water supply systems to be located in the flood plain shall be flood proofed in accordance with the State Building Code or elevated to above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
(B) Public Transportation Facilities. Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges to be located within the flood plain shall comply with sections 14.19 and 14.20 of this Ordinance. Elevation to the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be provided where failure or interruption of these transportation facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the public health or safety.
(C) On-site Sewage Treatment and Water Supply Systems. Where public utilities are not provided: 1) On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 2) New or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject to impairment or contamination during times of flooding.

(B) Special Provisions
(1) Single-family attached (triplex, quad or townhome units). For each unit over two (2) units (duplex), add the lot area and width to the total development area within the Shoreland zone. The area and width may be added to individual lots or to the lot area owned in common by the development, so that the total area of the development and total width are equal to the areas prescribed on the table.
(2) Residential subdivisions with dwelling unit densities exceeding those in the tables above can only be allowed if designed and approved as planned unit developments. Only land above the ordinary high water level of public waters can be used to meet lot area standards, and lot width standards must be met at both the ordinary high water level and at the building line. The sewer lot area dimensions in Section 14.40(A) above can only be used if publicly owned sewer system service is available to the property.
(3) Subdivisions of duplexes and attached single-family units of four (4) units or less on Natural Environment Lakes must also meet the following standards:
(a) Each building must be set back at least two hundred (200) feet from the ordinary high water level.
(b) Watercraft docking facilities for each lot must be centralized in one (1) location and serve all dwelling units in the building; and
(c) No more than twenty-five (25) percent of a lake's shoreline can be in duplex and single-family attached developments.
(4) Attached single-family and multifamily dwellings with five (5) or more units shall only be allowed as part of a Planned Unit Development.
(C) Lots with controlled access to public waters. Lots intended as controlled access to public waters or as recreation areas for use by owners of non-riparian lots within subdivisions are permissible and must meet or exceed the following standards:
(1) They must meet the width and size requirements for residential lots, and be suitable for the intended uses of controlled access lots.
(2) If docking, mooring or over-water storage of more than six (6) watercraft is to be allowed at a controlled access lot, then the width of the lot (keeping the same lot depth) must be increased by the percent of the requirements for riparian residential lots for each watercraft beyond six (6), consistent with the following table:

Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 191
(3) Lots must be jointly or commonly owned by all purchasers of lots in the subdivision or by all purchasers of non-riparian lots in the subdivision who are provided riparian access rights on the access lot in the manner acceptable to the City and the DNR
(4) Covenants or other equally effective legal instruments must be developed that specify which lot owners have authority to use the access lot and what activities are allowed. The activities may include watercraft launching, loading, storage, beaching, mooring, or docking. They must also include other outdoor recreational activities that do not significantly conflict with general public use of the public water or the enjoyment of normal property rights by adjacent property owners. Examples of the conflict activities that are not significant include swimming, sunbathing, or picnicking. The covenants must limit the total number of vehicles allowed to be continuously moored, docked, or stored over water, and must require centralization of all common facilities and activities in the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize topographic and vegetation alterations. They must also require all parking areas, storage buildings, and other facilities to be screened by vegetation or topography as much as practical from view from the public water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
(D) Placement of structures. When more than one (1) setback applies to a site, structures and facilities must be located to meet all setbacks. Where structures exist on the adjoining lots on both sides of a proposed building site, structure setbacks may be altered without a variance to conform to the adjoining setbacks from the ordinary high water level, provided the proposed building site is not located in a shore impact zone or in a bluff impact zone. Structure setbacks* (in feet) from the Ordinary High Water Level are as follows:

(E) Bluff setback.
(1) Structures must be set back thirty (30) feet from the top of the bluff, regardless of the classification of the water body.
(2) Bluff impact zones. Structures and accessory facilities, except stairways and landings, must not be placed within bluff impact zones.
(F) Floodplain design criteria for structures. Structures must be placed in accordance with floodplain regulations applicable to the site as required in Chapter 14, Article 2 of the Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance. Chapter 14, Article 2, Section 14.11, states that the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one (1) foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from the designation of a floodway. Where these controls do not exist, the elevation to which the lowest floor, including basement, is placed or flood-proofed must be determined as follows:
(1) For lakes, by placing the lowest floor at a level at least three (3) feet above the highest known water level, or three (3) feet above the ordinary high water level, whichever is higher;
(2) For rivers and streams, by placing the lowest floor at least three (3) feet above the flood of record, if data are available. If data are not available, by placing the lowest floor at least three (3) feet above the ordinary high water level, or by conducting a technical evaluation to determine effects of proposed construction upon flood stages and flood flows and to establish a flood Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 192
protection elevation. Under all three (3) approaches, technical evaluations must be done by a qualified engineer or hydrologist consistent with Minnesota Rules 6120 governing management of floodplain areas. If more than one (1) approach is used, the highest flood protection elevation determined must be used for placing structures and other facilities; and
(3) Water-oriented accessory structures may have the lowest floor placed lower than the elevation determined in this item if the structure is constructed of flood-resistant materials to the elevation, electrical and mechanical equipment is placed above the elevation and, if long duration flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to withstand ice action and wind-driven waves and debris.
(G) Water-oriented accessory structures. Each lot may have one (1) water-oriented accessory structure not meeting the normal structure setback requirements of this ordinance if this water-oriented accessory structure complies with the following provisions:
(1) The structure or facility must not exceed ten (10) feet in height, exclusive of safety rails, and cannot occupy an area greater than two hundred fifty (250) square feet. Detached decks must not exceed eight (8) feet above grade at any point.
(2) The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high water level must be at least ten (10) feet.
(3) The structure or facility must be treated to reduce visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent Shorelands by vegetation, topography, increased setbacks, or color, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
(4) The structure or facility must not be designed or used for human habitation and must not contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities.
(5) As an alternative for general development and recreational development waterbodies, water-oriented accessory structures used solely for watercraft storage and including storage of related boating and water-oriented sporting equipment, may occupy an area up to four hundred (400) square feet provided the maximum width of the structure is twenty (20) feet as measured parallel to the configuration of the shoreline.
(H) Stairways, lifts, and landings. Stairways and lifts are the preferred alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access up and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts must meet the following design requirements:
(1) Stairways and lifts must not exceed four (4) feet in width on residential lots. Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties, public open space-recreational properties, and planned unit developments.
(2) Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must not exceed thirty-two (32) square feet in aggregate area for each stairway. One (1) landing is allowed per twelve (12) vertical feet. Landings larger than thirty-two (32) square feet may be used for commercial properties, public open space-recreational properties, and planned unit developments.
(a) Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts, or landings.
(b) Stairways, lifts, and landings may be either constructed above the ground on posts or pilings, or placed into the ground, provided they are designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion.
(c) Stairways, lifts, and landings must be located in the most visually inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the public water assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever practical.
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 193
(d) Facilities such as ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for physically handicapped persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore areas, provided that the dimensional and performance standards of subitems (1) to (5) of Subsection (G) above are complied with in addition to the requirements of Minnesota Regulations, Chapter 1340.
(I) Significant historic sites. No structure may be placed on a significant historic site in a manner that affects the values of the site unless adequate information about the site has been removed and documented in a public repository.
(J) Steep slopes. The Zoning Administrator/City Engineer/Building Official must evaluate possible soil erosion impacts and development visibility from public waters before issuing a permit for site grading, construction of roads, driveways, structures, or other improvements on steep slopes. When determined necessary, conditions must be attached to issued permits to prevent erosion and to preserve existing vegetation screening of structures, vehicles, and other facilities as viewed from the surface of public waters, assuming summer, leaf-on vegetation.
(K) Height of structures. All structures in all Shoreland Districts shall not exceed 35 feet in height except that a conditional use permit may be granted for additional height up to four stories maximum, provided it can be demonstrated that any such proposed structure will not negatively impact views from the water body, and provided all other provisions for planned unit developments are met.. The conditional use permit for additional height shall be subject to notice and comment by the DNR before issuance by the City.
14.41 Shoreland and Vegetation Alterations
Alterations of vegetation and topography will be regulated to prevent erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve Shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping, and protect fish and wildlife habitat.
(A) Exemptions. Vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of structures and sewage treatment systems, agricultural uses, and the construction of roads and parking areas regulated by Section 14.43 of this ordinance are exempt from the vegetation alteration standards that follow.
(B) Alteration standards. Removal or alteration of vegetation, except for agricultural and forest management uses as regulated in Subsections 14.35(B) and (C), is allowed subject to the following standards:
(1) Intensive vegetation clearing within the shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes is prohibited.

(3) Nonconforming sewage treatment systems:
(a) A sewage treatment system not meeting the requirements of this ordinance must be upgraded, at a minimum, at any time a permit or variance of any type is required for any improvement on, or use of, the property. For the purposes of this provision, a sewage treatment system shall not be considered nonconforming if the only deficiency is the sewage treatment system's improper setback from the ordinary high water level.
(b) The City Council has by formal resolution notified the Commissioner of its program to identify nonconforming sewage treatment systems. The City will require upgrading or replacement of any nonconforming system identified by this program within a reasonable period of time which will not exceed two (2) years. Sewage systems installed according to all applicable local Shoreland management standards adopted under Minnesota Statutes, section 103 [sic], in effect at the time of installation may be considered as conforming unless they are determined to be failing, except that systems using cesspools, leaching pits, seepage pits, or other deep disposal methods, or systems with less soil treatment area separation above groundwater than required by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's Chapter 7080 for design of on-site sewage treatment systems, shall be considered nonconforming.
14.48 Planned Unit Developments (PUD)
(A) PUDs Density Evaluation. The regulations in this overlay district are intended to manage Shoreland areas suitable for development as Planned Unit Developments as allowed in the underlying Zoning District. It is the intent of this overlay district to be used in conjunction with the adopted land use regulations and requirements of the City's Unified Development Ordinance. The allowable uses and standards for Planned Unit Developments in the Shoreland management overlay district shall be Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 200
consistent with those identified in the Unified Development Ordinance, Chapter 15, and reflected on the Zoning Map, with the exceptions in Shoreland areas as identified in the following sections. The Shorelands of all classified water bodies shall be made up of density tiers, which shall vary in width depending on each classification. Within each tier the density allowed may be increased based on the specific standards applicable to the water body's classification, and provided the provisions of this section can be met:
(1) General Development Lakes (each tier is two hundred (200) feet):
(a) Within the first tier (two hundred (200) feet from the OHWL), minimum lot size shall be fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet.
(2) Natural Environment Lakes (each tier is three hundred (300) feet)
(a) Within the first tier (three hundred (300) feet from the OHWL), minimum lot size shall be forty thousand (40,000) square feet.
(3) The suitable area within each tier is next calculated by excluding from the tier area all wetlands, bluffs, or land below the ordinary high water level of public waters. This suitable area and the proposed project are then subjected to the planned unit development density evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable number of dwelling units or sites.
(4) The suitable area within each tier is divided by the single residential lot size standard for lakes or, for rivers, the single residential lot width standard times the tier depth, unless the local unit of government has specified an alternative minimum lot size for rivers which shall then be used to yield a base density of dwelling units or sites for each tier. Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or sites for the residential planned unit developments are then compared with the tier, density, and suitability analyses herein.
(5) Increases to the dwelling unit or dwelling site base densities previously determined are allowable if the dimensional standards are met or exceeded and the design criteria are satisfied. The allowable density increases below will only be allowed if structure setbacks from the ordinary high water level are increased to at least fifty (50) percent greater than the minimum setback, or the impact on the waterbody is reduced an equivalent amount through vegetative management, topography, or additional means acceptable to the local unit of government and the setback is at least twenty-five (25) percent greater than the minimum setback.
(6) Residential and Commercial Planned Development P.D. Density Evaluation. The procedures for determining the "base" density of a P.D. and density increase multipliers are as follows. Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any other tier further from the waterbody, but shall not be transferred to any other tier closer.
(a) Residential P.D. "Base" Density Evaluation: The suitable area within each tier is divided by the minimum single residential lot size standard for each lake and river class to determine the maximum permitted density. Proposed locations and number of dwelling units or sites for residential planned developments are then compared with the tier, density and suitability analyses herein and the design criteria in 6(c) below.
(b) Commercial P.D. "Base" Density Evaluation: Determine the average inside living area size of dwelling units or sites within each tier, including both existing and proposed units and sites. Computation of inside living area sizes shall not include decks, patios, stoops, steps, garages or porches and basements, unless they are habitable space.
(c) Select the appropriate floor area ratio from the following table:

(d) Multiply the suitable area within each tier by the floor area ratio to yield total floor area for each tier allowed to be used for dwelling units or sites.
(e) Divide the total floor area by tier, computed in 6(d) above, by the average inside living area size determined in 6(a) above. This yields a base number of dwelling units and sites for each tier.
(f) Proposed locations and number of dwelling units or sites for the commercial planned development are then compared with the tier, density and suitability analyses herein and the design criteria in following sections.
(7) Allowable Dwelling Unit or Dwelling Site Density Increases for Residential Planned Unit Developments are as follows:

(2) Be designed and constructed to effectively manage reasonably expected quantities and qualities of stormwater runoff. Impervious surface coverage within any tier must not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the tier area except that for commercial P.D.s, 35% impervious surface coverage may be allowed in the first tier of general development lakes with an approved storm water management plan and consistent with the provisions of this section.
(D) Centralization and design of facilities. Centralization and design of facilities and structures shall be done according to the following standards:
(1) Planned unit developments must be connected to publicly-owned water supply and sewer systems.
(2) Dwelling units or sites shall be clustered into groups and located on suitable areas of the development. They shall be designed and located to meet or exceed the dimensional standards for the relevant Shoreland classification, including setbacks from the ordinary high water level, elevation above surface water features, and maximum height.
(3) Structures, parking areas, and other facilities shall be treated to reduce visibility as viewed from the public waters and adjacent Shorelands by vegetation, topography, increased setbacks, color, or other means acceptable to the local unit of government, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. Vegetative and topographic features shall be preserved, if existing, or may be required to be provided.
(4) Accessory structures and facilities shall meet the required principal structure setback and must be centralized.
(5) Water-oriented accessory structures and facilities may be allowed if they meet or exceed design standards contained in this ordinance centralized.
(6) Shore recreation facilities, including, but not limited to, swimming areas, docks and watercraft mooring areas and launching ramps, shall be centralized and located in suitable areas. Evaluation of suitability shall include consideration of land slope, water depth, vegetation, soils, depth to groundwater and bedrock, or relevant factors. The number of spaces provided for continuous beaching, mooring or docking of watercraft shall not exceed one for each allowable dwelling units or site in the first tier. Launching ramp facilities, including a small dock for loading and unloading equipment, may be provided for use by occupants of dwelling units or sites located in other tiers.
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 203
(E) Evaluation of Factors. The following factors are carefully evaluated to ensure that the increased density of development is consistent with the resource limitations of the public water:
(1) Suitability of the site for the proposed use;
(2) Physical and aesthetic impact of increased density;
(3) Level of current development;
(4) Amount of ownership of undeveloped shoreland;
(5) Levels and types of water surface use and public access;
(6) Possible effects on overall public use.
(F) Open Space Preservation.
(1) Before final approval of a planned unit development, adequate provisions must be developed for preservation and maintenance in perpetuity of open spaces and for the continued existence and functioning of the development.

(b) Dwelling units or sites, road rights-of-way, or land covered by road surfaces, parking areas or structures, except water-oriented accessory structures or facilities, are developed areas and shall not be included in the computation of minimum open space.
(c) Open space must include areas with physical characteristics unsuitable for development in their natural state, and areas containing significant historic sites or unplatted cemeteries.
(d) Open space may include outdoor recreational facilities for use by owners of dwelling units or sites, by guests staying in commercial facilities or uses, but may contain water-oriented accessory structures or facilities.
(e) Open space must not include commercial facilities or uses, but may include water-oriented accessory structures or facilities.
(f) The appearance of open space areas, including topography, vegetation, and allowable uses, must be preserved by use of restrictive deed covenants, permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective and permanent means.
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 204
(g) The shore impact zone, based on normal structure setbacks, must be included as open space. For residential PUDs, at least fifty (50) percent of the shore impact zone area of existing developments or at least seventy (70) percent of the shore impact zone area of new developments must be preserved in its natural or existing state.
ARTICLE 5. AIRPORT DISTRICT
14.49 Purpose and Authority
(A) This subdivision is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by M.S. § 360.063, as amended from time to time. It is hereby found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity, and may reduce the size of the area available for the landing, taking-off and maneuvering of aircraft, thereby impairing the utility of the airport and the public investment therein. It is also found that the social and financial costs of disrupting existing land uses around airports in built up urban areas, particularly established residential neighborhoods, often outweigh the benefits of a reduction in airport hazards that might result from the elimination or removal of those uses.
(B) Accordingly, it is hereby declared:
(1) The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the community served by the airport in question;
(2) It is therefor necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety and general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented and that this should be accomplished to the extent legally possible, by exercise of the police power, without compensation; and
(3) The elimination or removal of existing land uses, particularly established residential neighborhoods in built up urban areas, or their designation as non-conforming uses is not in the public interest and should be avoided whenever possible consistent with reasonable standards of safety.
(C) It is further declared that the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or property interests therein.

In order to carry out the provisions of this subdivision, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the primary zone, horizontal zone, conical zone, approach zone and transitional zone. The areas and zones are shown on the Redwood Falls Municipal Airport Land Use Plan and Zoning Map consisting of 11 sheets, prepared by The HNTB Companies, and dated February, 1996, which is attached to this subdivision and made a part hereof. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
(A) Primary Zone. A primary zone is hereby established as all that land which lies directly under an imaginary surface longitudinally centered on a runway and extending 200 feet beyond each end of a runway with a specially prepared hard surface or planned hard surface, or coinciding with each end of other runways. The width of the primary surface is 500 feet for all runways. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline.
(B) Horizontal Zone. A horizontal zone is hereby established as all that land which lies directly under an imaginary horizontal surface with its height 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 206
primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is 6,000 feet for all runways.
(C) Conical Zone. A conical zone is hereby established as all that land which lies directly under an imaginary conical surface extending upward and outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to one (20:1) for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet as measured radially outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface.
(D) Approach Zone. An approach zone is hereby established as all that land which lies directly under an imaginary surface longitudinally centered on the extended centerline at each end of a runway. The inner edge of the approach surface is at the same width and elevation as, and coincides with, the end of the primary surface. The approach surface inclines upward and outward at a slope of 40 to one (40:1) for a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet. The approach surface expands uniformly to a width of 2,500 feet (10:1 flare ratio).
14.53 Height Restrictions
Except as necessary and incidental to airport operation, no structure or tree shall be constructed, altered or allowed to grow in any airport zone so as to project above any of the imaginary airspace surfaces as established in 14.52(D) above. Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail.
14.54 Land Use Safety Zones
(A) Safety Zone Boundaries. In order to carry out the purposes of this subdivision, there are hereby created and established the following safety zone boundaries:
(1) Safety Zone A. All that land in the approach zones of a runway extending outward from the end of the primary surface a distance equal to two-thirds the runway length or planned runway length.
(2) Safety Zone B. All that land in the approach zones of a runway extending outward from safety zone a distance equal to one-third the runway length.
(3) Safety Zone C. All that land which is enclosed within the perimeter of the horizontal zone defined in 14.52(D) above and which is not included in Zone A or Zone B.
(B) Use Restrictions. In order to restrict those uses which may be hazardous to the operational safety of aircraft operating to and from an airport, and furthermore to limit population and building density in the runway approach areas, thereby creating sufficient open space so as to protect life and property in case of accident, the following use restrictions are applied to the land use safety zones.
(1) General. No use shall be made of any land in any of the safety zones which creates or causes interference with the operation of radio or electronic facilities on the airport or with radio or electronic communications between the airport and aircraft, makes it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights, results in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impairs visibility in the vicinity of the airport, or otherwise endangers the landing, taking off or maneuvering of aircraft.
(2) Zone A. Zone A is subject at all times to the height restriction set forth in 14.53 above and to the general restrictions contained in 14.54(B)(2) Zone A shall contain no buildings, temporary structures, exposed transmission lines, or other similar land use structural hazards, and shall be restricted to those uses which will not create, attract, or bring together an assembly of persons thereon. Permitted uses may include, but are not limited to, such uses as agriculture (seasonal crops), horticulture, raising of livestock, animal husbandry, wildlife habitat, light outdoor recreation (nonspectator), cemeteries and auto parking.
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 207
(3) Zone B. Zone B is subject at all times to the height restrictions set forth in 14.54(B)(2) and to the general restrictions contained in subsection (general), Zone B shall be restricted in use as follows.
(a) Each use shall be on a site whose area shall not be less than three acres.
(b) Each use shall not create, attract or bring together a site population that would exceed 15 times that of the site acreage.
(c) Each site shall have no more than one building plot upon which any number of structures may be erected.
(d) A building plot shall be single, uniform and non-contrived area, whose shape is uncomplicated and whose area shall not exceed the following minimum ratios with respect to the total site area:

(e) The following uses are specifically prohibited in zone B: Churches, hospitals, schools, theaters, stadiums, hotels and motels, trailer courts, camp grounds and other places of public or semi-public assembly.
(4) Safety Zone C. Areas designated within Safety Zone C are subject only to height restrictions as set forth is Section 14.54 and the general restrictions established in Section 14.54(B)(2).
14.55 Non-Conforming Uses
(A) Regulations Not Retroactive. These regulations shall not require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this subdivision.
(B) Marking or Lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph of this section, the owner of any existing structure or tree that has an adverse effect on the public interest and safety as determined by the Board of Adjustment shall install or allow the installation of obstruction markers as deemed necessary by the Board of Adjustment, at the expense of the City, so that the structures become more visible to pilots.
14.56 Permits
(A) Future Uses.
(1) Except as specially provided in 14.56(1) (a) and (b) hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise established in any zone hereby created, unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If the determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted.
(a) In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 208
ground, except when because of terrain, land contour or topographic features the tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for the zone.
(b) In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones.
(2) Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration or growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this subdivision except as set forth in section 14.53.
(B) Existing Uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a non-conforming use, structure or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of this subdivision or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for the permit shall be granted.
(C) Non-conforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the Zoning Administrator determines that a non-conforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than 50% torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow the structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. The Zoning Administrator may order the owner of the abandoned or partially destroyed, physically deteriorated or decayed non-conforming structure, at their own expense, to lower, remove or reconstruct or equip in the same manner necessary to conform to the provisions of this subdivision. In the event the owner of the non-conforming structure shall neglect or refuse to comply with such order within ten days after receipt of written notice of the order, the Zoning Administrator may, by appropriate legal action, proceed to have the abandoned or partially destroyed, physically deteriorated or decayed non-conforming structure lowered, removed, reconstructed or equipped and assess the cost and expense thereof against the land on which the structure is or was located. Unless such an assessment is paid within 90 days from the service of notice thereof on the owner of the land, the sum shall bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date the cost and expense were incurred until paid, and shall be collected in the same manner as are general taxes.
(D) Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this subdivision, may apply to the Board of Adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The variances shall be allowed where it duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but would will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this subdivision.
(E) Hazard Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this subdivision and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the City at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard.
14.57 Enforcement
It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the Redwood Falls Zoning Administrator upon a form furnished by him or her. Applications required by this subdivision to be submitted to the Zoning Administrator shall be promptly considered and granted or denied by him or her. Applications for action by the Board of Adjustment shall be forthwith transmitted by the Zoning Administrator.

Chapter 15 Planned Unit Development District
ARTICLE 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
15.01 Purpose
This chapter is established to provide comprehensive procedures and standards designed to allow the development of neighborhoods or portions thereof incorporating a variety of residential types and non-residential uses. Recognizing that traditional density, bulk, setbacks, use and subdivision regulations which may be useful in protecting the character of substantially developed areas, may be inappropriate to control development in less developed areas.
15.02 Identified Objectives
When reviewing requests for approval of a planned unit development, the City shall consider whether one or more of the objectives listed below are served or achieved. It is not the intent of this chapter to allow for reductions or waivers to standard zoning requirements solely for the purpose of increasing overall density or allowing development that otherwise could not be approved.
(A) Accommodation of the growing demand for housing of all types and for commercial facilities conveniently located to such housing.
(B) Promotion of integrated land uses, allowing for a mixture of residential, business, and public facilities along corridors and in transitional areas.
(C) More convenience in location of accessory commercial and service areas.
(D) The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such as natural topography and geologic features and the prevention of soil erosion.
(E) Higher standards of site and building design through the use of trained and experienced land planners, architects and landscape architects.
(F) An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets thereby lowering housing costs and public investments and the promotion of energy resource conservation.
(G) A development pattern in harmony with the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
(H) A more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of zoning and subdivision regulations of the City.
15.03 Relationship to Other Applicable Regulations
A planned unit development shall be subject to all applicable standards, procedures, and regulations of this ordinance and the zoning district in which it is located, including applicable site plan review standards contained in Chapter 5, Site Plan Review, for the individual uses within the development, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
15.04 Platting Requirement
All land proposed for planned unit development shall be platted or replatted into one or more lots, in compliance with the applicable requirements of Chapter 16, Subdivision Regulations. For the purposes of this chapter, the development plan shall include the necessary information to serve as a preliminary plat for the development.
15.05 Allowed Uses
Any use allowed within the zoning district in which the planned unit development is located may be included as part of the development plan. In addition, other uses of land may be permitted within the planned unit Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 212
development upon approval by the City Council. The development plan shall identify all proposed land uses and those uses shall become permitted uses with the acceptance of the development plan. Single-family attached and multifamily uses with more than five (5) dwelling units may be allowed in the Shoreland Management District only as part of a planned unit development.
15.06 Minimum Project Size
There shall be no required minimum or maximum area size for planned unit developments.
15.07 Phasing of Development
Phasing of the planned unit development shall be permitted, provided that each individual phase shall be designed and developed to exist as an independent unit. Additionally, the construction and provision of all common open space and site amenities that are shown on the development plan must proceed at the same rate as the construction of dwelling units, if any. Any violation of this provision shall authorize the City Council to hold a public hearing to review compliance of the planned unit development.

15.23 Lot Requirements
(A) In general. The City Council may authorize reductions in the area and width of individual lots within a planned unit development from that required for the base zoning district, provided that such reductions are compensated for by an equivalent amount of open space elsewhere in the planned unit development. Such open space shall not include areas designated as public or private streets.
(B) Density bonus. The City Council may authorize a reduction in the minimum lot area per dwelling unit required by the zoning district regulations by not more than twenty (20) percent for the purpose of promoting an integrated project with a variety of housing types and additional site amenities.
15.24 Open Space
For all planned unit developments, at least twenty (20) percent of the project area not within street right-of-way must be devoted to open space. Such open space must be available to the residents or tenants of the planned unit development for recreational purposes or other similar benefit. Land reserved for stormwater detention facilities and other required site improvements, private yards and required or proposed setback areas, and areas not accessible by those living in the development, shall not be applied toward satisfaction of open space requirements. Such open space must be suitably improved for its intended use, and plans for such improvements shall be submitted and approved as part of the planned unit development approval process. Areas containing natural features worthy of preservation or excessive areas of public or private utility easements may, at the City Council’s discretion, be counted as open space, and may, at the City Council’s discretion, be left unimproved. The development plan must coordinate improvements to open space areas concurrent with construction of permitted structures and other required improvements within their respective phase of the planned unit development.
15.25 Parking
(A) In general. Parking requirements for all uses within the planned development shall be as established in Chapter 9, Off-Street Parking and Loading. When private streets are proposed as part of a residential planned development, additional common area off-street parking will be required in accordance with Table 15-1 below. Such parking areas shall be dispersed throughout the planned development and shall not be located directly in front of any residential unit.

(B) Effect of on-street parking. At least fifty (50) percent of the curb frontage on the designated parking side or sides of a street must be available for parking. Available parking frontage shall not include driveways, three (3) feet either side of a driveway, the frontage within twenty-five (25) feet of an intersection, and ten (10) feet either side of a fire hydrant. A length of twenty (20) feet shall be used as a parking space length along the available curb frontage. When less than fifty (50) percent of the curb frontage is available for on-street parking, off-street parking, in addition to that required in Table 15-1, shall be provided. The amount of additional parking provided shall be the difference between the amount of on-street parking that would be available if fifty (50) percent of the curb frontage was available for parking and the amount actually being provided based on the development plan.
15.26 Private Streets
(A) When permitted. Private streets will be allowed when the pattern of development does not lend itself to through streets, taking into consideration existing properties, buildings, or topographical features that make construction of a public street unfeasible or inappropriate.
Private streets will not be permitted in the following instances:
(1) When a street serves as an extension of an existing public street.
(2) When a future extension of the street will serve as access to adjacent properties.
(3) When the street is, or will be, part of a larger neighborhood traffic system or is part of the City-wide comprehensive street system.
(B) Design standards. Private streets shall be located within a dedicated easement and shall be equivalent to public streets in construction design, as determined by the City Engineer. Streets shall include concrete curb and gutter, with surmountable style curbing permitted, and street lighting equivalent to standards for installation along public streets. Minimum street width, as measured from face-to-face of curb, along with the minimum easement width to allow for utility installations, is indicated in Table 15-2.

ARTICLE 5. PREMATURE SUBDIVISIONS
16.24 Premature Subdivision Described
Any preliminary plat of a proposed subdivision deemed premature for development shall be denied by the City Council. A subdivision may be deemed premature should any of the conditions which follow exist:
(A) Lack of adequate drainage. A condition of inadequate drainage shall be deemed to exist if surface or subsurface water retention and runoff is such that it constitutes a danger to the structural security of the Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 229
proposed structures, the proposed subdivision will cause damage from erosion and siltation on downhill or downstream land, or the proposed site grading and development will cause harmful and irreparable damage from erosion and siltation on downstream land.
(B) Lack of adequate roads or highways to serve the subdivision. A proposed subdivision shall be deemed to lack adequate roads or highways to serve the subdivision when roads which serve the proposed subdivision are of such a width, grade, stability, vertical and horizontal alignment, site distance and surface condition that an increase in traffic volume generated by the proposed subdivision would create a hazard to public safety and general welfare, or seriously aggravate an already hazardous condition.
(C) Lack of municipal sanitary sewer and water availability. A proposed subdivision shall be deemed premature if the extension of municipal sanitary sewer or water facilities is not feasible or is not proposed as part of subdivision improvements or if existing facilities are inadequate to support the subdivision if developed to its maximum permissible density.
(D) Inconsistency with Land Use Plan. The proposed subdivision is inconsistent with the purposes, objectives and recommendations of the duly adopted Land Use Plan of the City, as may be amended.
(E) Threat to Environmentally Sensitive Areas: The proposed subdivision is inconsistent with policies and standards of the City, the County, the State, or Federal Government relating to environmentally sensitive areas and protections.
ARTICLE 6. DESIGN STANDARDS
16.25 Minimum Design Standards
The design standards set forth below are deemed to be minimum requirements. The City may impose additional or more stringent requirements concerning lot size, streets, and overall design as deemed appropriate considering the property being subdivided.
16.26 Blocks
(A) Block length. In general, intersecting streets, determining block lengths, shall be provided at such intervals so as to serve cross-traffic adequately and to meet existing streets. Where no existing plats control, the blocks in residential subdivisions should not exceed one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320) feet nor be less than four hundred (400) feet in length, except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from such standards. In blocks longer than eight hundred (800) feet, pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block may be required near the center of the block.

(C) Land suitability. Land to be dedicated shall be reasonably suitable for its intended use and shall be at a location convenient to the people to be served. In evaluating the adequacy of proposed park and recreation areas, the City Council shall consider factors including size, shape, topography, geology, hydrology, tree cover, access, and location. Wetlands, ponding areas, and drainageways accepted by the City shall not contribute towards park land requirements, except at the discretion of the City Council.
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 234
(D) Terms of dedication. Dedication of land for public use shall be without restrictions or reservations and shall be designated as an outlot on the plat. The subdivider shall be responsible to grade the land to the contours shown on the approved preliminary plat and to leave such dedicated land in a condition suitable to the City.
(E) Fee in lieu of land dedication. When it is determined that park land dedication is not desirable due to location, size, or other suitability factors as defined in Section 16.33(C) above, the City shall require, in lieu of land donation, a cash donation equal to a percentage of the fair market value of the property. Such percentage is based on the requirements identified in Section 16.33(B). For the purposes of this section, fair market value shall be determined at the time of final plat approval in accordance with the following:
(1) The City and the developer may agree as to the fair market value, or
(2) The fair market value may be based upon a current appraisal submitted to the City by the subdivider at the subdivider's expense. The appraisal shall be made by a qualified real estate appraiser who is an approved member of the SREA or MAI, or equivalent real estate appraisal societies.
(3) If the City disputes such appraisal the City may, at its own expense, obtain a second appraisal of the property by a qualified real estate appraiser, mutually agreed upon by the developer and the City, which appraisal shall be conclusive evidence of the fair market value of the land.
(F) Combined land and cash donations. The City may elect to receive a combination of cash and land as part of parkland dedication requirements. In such cases, the percentage of land dedicated shall reduce the required fee percentage by an equal amount.
(G) Planned unit developments. Planned developments with mixed land uses shall make cash and/or land contributions in accordance with this section based upon the percentage of land devoted to the various uses.
(H) Payment requirements. Park cash contributions are to be calculated at the time of final plat approval. The City Council may approve a delay in the payment of cash requirements provided that an agreement is executed guaranteeing such payment in accordance with the following:
(1) Any developer may elect to pay in full park fees based on the amount required at the time of the final plat approval.
(2) Plats with park fees of up to $2,500.00 must be paid in full when the City Council approves the final plat.

Plats with park fees of $2,501.00 to $7,500.00 must pay at least one-third of the fee when the final plat is approved by the City Council, one-half of the balance no later than six (6) months from the date of final plat approval, and the final balance not later than twelve (12) months from the date of final plat approval. No interest will be charged on the payments during the twelve (12) months.
(4) Twenty-four month scheduled payment plan. Plats with park fees of over $7,501.00 must pay at least one-third of the fee when the final plat is approved by the City Council, and one-half of the balance no later than twelve (12) months from the date of final plat approval. No interest will be charged on the money due and paid during the first twelve (12) months. The final payment must be paid not later than twenty-four (24) months from the date of final plat approval by the City Council, and interest at a rate set forth in the development agreement shall be charged on the park fees due and paid after twelve (12) months.
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 235
(I) Identified sites. When a proposed park, playground, recreational area, school site or other public ground has been indicated in the City's official map or Land Use Plan and is located in whole or in part within a proposed plat, it shall be designated as such on the plat and shall be dedicated to the appropriate governmental unit. If the subdivider elects not to dedicate an area in excess of the land required hereunder for such proposed public site, the City may consider acquiring the site through purchase or other available means prior to approval of the plat.
(J) Private open space / parks. Where private open space for park and recreation purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision, such areas may be used for credit, at the discretion of the City Council, against the requirement of dedication for park and recreation purposes, provided the City Council finds it is in the public interest to do so.
ARTICLE 8. REQUIRED BASIC IMPROVEMENTS
16.34 General Provisions
(A) Development agreement required. Before a final plat is delivered by the City to the subdivider, the subdivider of the land covered by said plat shall pay all applicable fees and execute and submit to the Council a developer's agreement which shall be binding on his or their heirs, personal representatives and assigns, a part of which agreement shall set forth that the subdivider will cause no private construction to be made on the lands within said plat, nor shall the subdivider file or cause to be filed any application for building permits for such construction until all improvements required under this Section have been made or arranged for in the manner and conforming to the requirements as set forth herein. No private construction shall commence, nor shall building permits be issued, until all improvements required under this section have been contracted for and the subdivision improved by completion of sewer, water, storm sewer, and graded right-of-way. No final certificate of occupancy shall be issued for private construction until all improvements, including paving of streets, have been completed.
(B) Surety Required. Prior to the delivery of the approved final plat, the subdivider shall deposit with the City Treasurer an amount of equal to one and one-half times authorized City personnel's estimated cost of the required improvements within the plat, either in a cash escrow fund performance and indemnity bond, or letter of credit. Any surety involved in said financial guarantees shall be acceptable to the City. The said cash escrow letter of credit or performance and indemnity bond shall be conditioned upon:
(1) The making and installing of all the improvements required by terms and conditions set forth by the City within one year.
(2) Satisfactory completion of the work and payment therefor, which work was undertaken by the subdivider in accordance with the developer's agreement referred to above.
(3) The payment by the subdivider to the City of all expenses incurred by the City, which expenses shall include but not be limited to expenses for engineering, fiscal, legal, construction and administration. In instances where a cash escrow is submitted in lieu of a letter of credit or performance and indemnity bond, there shall be a cash escrow agreement which shall provide that in the event the required improvements are not completed within one year, all amounts held under the cash escrow agreement shall be automatically turned over and delivered to the City and applied by the City to the cost of completing the required improvements. If the funds available within the said cash escrows agreement are not sufficient to complete the required improvements, the necessary additional cost to the City shall be assessed against the subdivision. Any balance remaining in the cash escrow fund after such improvements have been made and all expenses therefor have been paid, shall be returned to the subdivider. In
Redwood Falls Unified Development Ordinance 236
instances where a letter of credit is used in lieu of a cash escrow or performance and indemnity bond, the said letter of credit shall be in a form satisfactory to the City and the terms thereof shall substantially comply with the procedure as set forth for a cash escrow fund.

Such "as-built drawings" shall be certified to be true and accurate by the registered engineer responsible for the installation of the improvement.
(G) No final plat shall be approved by the Council on land subject to flooding or containing poor drainage facilities, and on land which would make adequate drainage of the streets and lots impossible. However, if the subdivider agrees to make improvements which will, in the opinion of authorized City personnel, make the area completely safe for residential occupancy and provide adequate street and lot drainage and conform to applicable regulations of the other agencies such as the U.S. Corps of Engineers, or the Department of Natural Resources, the final plat of the subdivision may be approved. In addition, such plats may not be approved if the cost of providing municipal services to protect the flood plain area would impose an unreasonable economic burden upon the City.
(H) All of the required improvements to be installed under the provisions of this Section shall be approved by and subject to the inspection of authorized City personnel. All of the City's expenses incurred as the result of the requirement improvements shall be paid either directly, indirectly or by reimbursement to the City by the subdivider.
