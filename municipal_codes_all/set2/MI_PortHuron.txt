and services, the cost of which is less than the threshold amount, may
be made in the open market, but such purchases shall, where practical,

All purchases of goods and services shall be obtained through one of the
following methods and regardless of the method of purchase used, all goods
and services exceeding the threshold amount shall require City Council
approval unless otherwise not required under the purchasing ordinance:
as a public servant, unless approved by City Council and in
accordance with the state law and the Charter.
(1) Formal bids. Formal bids shall be asked for in all transactions involving
the expenditure above, or expected to be above, the threshold amount,
and the transaction evidence by a written contract unless otherwise
provided by this division.
a. Definition. A "formal bid" shall be defined as the submission of a
written, sealed price quotation by a vendor to the City pursuant to
the issue of public notice thereof by the City, and based on written
specifications and standard conditions stipulated by the City for the
purpose of purchasing goods and services for the use of the City.
Bids may be received by various means, including, but not limited
to, written, facsimile, electronic (e.g., internet, email), or other
reliable means, subject to the purchasing policies and procedures
of the City and as may be specified in the bid submission
requirements. Facsimiles, electronic or other similar bids shall be
deemed as a written, sealed price quotation, provided they are
forthwith transferred to the Finance Department and kept
confidential until the public bid opening.
b. Notice inviting bids. A notice inviting bids shall include a general
description of the articles to be purchased or sold, submission
requirements, state where bid blanks and specifications may be
secured and the time and place for opening bids. Notice of bids
shall be posted or advertised at least seven calendar days
preceding the last day set forth for the receipt of bids. The notice of
bids shall be advertised by one or more methods, the first of which
shall be the one that generates no cost to the City, as follows:
1. At a minimum, notice of bids shall be posted in the purchasing
section of the City's website.
2. Notice of bids shall also be posted, where applicable, on the
website(s) of those bid cooperatives of which the City is a
member.
3. Additional trade magazines and/or the City's official newspaper
shall be utilized only when such electronic posting is deemed
inappropriate in order to garner adequate exposure to
potential vendors.

4. The Purchasing Agent may also post notice of all pending
purchases or sales on the bulletin board in City buildings or
other appropriate locations.
5. The Purchasing Agent may also advertise all pending
purchases or sales through such additional notices as the
Agent deems to be in the best interest of the City.
6. If any perspective bidder fails to receive notice, it shall in no
way invalidate any contracts entered into hereunder.
c. Bid, performance, labor and material bonds. Bid bonds,
performance bonds or maintenance bonds shall be required when it
is determined that such bonds are reasonably necessary to protect
the best interests of the public; provided, however, performance
bonds shall be provided when required by state law (PA 213 of
1963).14 Labor and material bonds shall be required as provided by
this Act, and each shall be executed by the contractor and a
corporate surety in an amount not less than the total amount of the
contract. Such bonds shall not require City Council approval, but
shall be approved by the appropriate administrative officer, or his
or her designee, as to substance and by the City's Attorney as to
form, issuing surety and execution.
d. Addendums/clarifications. Bid addendums and clarifications may
be issued by the administrative officer of the applicable operating
department in coordination with the Purchasing Agent.
e. Bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place
designated in the invitation to bid and in the presence of the
Purchasing Agent and a designated representative from the
appropriate operating department, or their designees. The amount
of each bid and other relevant information, together with the name
of each bidder, shall be recorded by the Purchasing Agent, or
designee, who may refer the bids to any appropriate City officer for
tabulation before reviewing them. Bid tabulations shall be open
and available to public inspection in accordance with state law.
f. Bid acceptance. Bids shall be accepted (with the exception of late
bids, which shall not be accepted) without alteration or correction,
except as otherwise authorized by the purchasing procedures or
the factors stipulated in the invitation to bid.
(2) Request for proposals. Requests for proposals (RFP) shall be asked for
where appropriate, including situations where the use of competitive
sealed bidding is either not practicable or not advantageous to the City.
RFPs are used where multiple factors and criteria will be considered,
such as transactions involving professional services, for situations
where there is not sufficient information to prepare specific
specifications suitable for formal bidding procedures, where a
14.Editor's Note: See MCLA § 129.201 et seq.
§ 2-794 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-794
1:67
discussion with the vendor is necessary in order to understand the
proposal, or for other reasons which are determined by the City.
Whenever it is determined that it is in the best interest of the City to
solicit RFPs, the successful proposal will be evaluated and determined
based upon the proposer's ability to provide the services requested,
the City's prior experience with the proposer, the nature and degree
of expertise required, the professional experience of the proposer, the
costs of the services and any references received with respect to the
successful proposer. Each operating department will establish
procedures for issuing RFPs in the best interest of the City, including,
but not limited to, public notice, written specifications and a public
opening.
(3) Professional services. Requests for proposal shall be used for the
employment of professional services or consultants where technical
expertise or knowledge of a specialized field is critical to the
performance of that service. Professional services include, but are not
limited to, auditors, engineers, planning and financial consultants,
architects, accountants and other similar professionals. The City
Council shall approve all professional service contracts above the
threshold amount and the City Manager, or his or her designee, shall
have the authority to procure the services for contracts below the
threshold amount.
(4) Sole source purchases. Sole source purchases are allowed when only
one item or service will meet the City's needs and when only one vendor
can supply that item or service. If a proprietary item is required, a sole
source circumstance may exist in the following circumstances:
a. The compatibility or standardization of equipment, accessories or
replacement parts is the paramount consideration and the items
are only available from one vendor.
b. The vendor, or a distributor, has an exclusive right to sell in a
geographic area.
c. The item is required to maintain the warranty or service contract in
force for the particular equipment.
d. The item is not interchangeable with similar items from another
source.
e. The sole supplier's item is needed for trial use or testing.
f. When there is doubt that the product or service is sole source,
competition should be solicited.
§ 2-794 PORT HURON CODE § 2-794
1:68
All sole source purchases which exceed threshold limits must be
approved by City Council. Sole source purchases which do not
exceed the threshold limits must be approved by the purchasing
committee. Insufficient time for solicitation of bids is not sufficient
reason to justify a sole source procurement. Price, terms and
conditions shall be negotiated to obtain the best purchase terms
for the City.
(5) Continuity of professional services. A professional service contract may
be extended beyond the expiration of the contract if it would be in the
best interest of the City to extend the contract based on uniformity of
results or history of services. Contracts that are extended that exceed
the threshold amount shall require the prior approval of the City
Council.
(6) Emergency purchases. With the mutual concurrence of the City
Manager and administrative officer of an operating department, a
purchase may be made to alleviate a situation in which there is a threat
to health, welfare, or safety, or to address an immediate regulatory
mandate, or is necessary to the continuation of the work of the
department that does not allow time for normal competitive purchasing
procedures. This method may not follow required purchasing methods
as previously described due to the immediate need, but shall be made
with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances. Such
purchases and the emergency causing them shall be reported in detail
to the Director of Finance and Purchasing Agent immediately at the
time the costs are incurred or purchased.
(7) Cooperative purchasing. It shall be the policy of this City to engage in
those cooperative purchasing efforts for goods and services with other
governmental agencies, such as MiDeal or MITN, whenever such
activity is feasible and economically advantageous to the City. All
cooperative purchasing conducted under this article shall be consistent
with the methods of this section. If the Purchasing Agent or other
officer has engaged in cooperative purchasing bids of goods and
services with another government or governments or other similar
agency where joint bids have been taken and are advantageous to the
City, such bids will be deemed to conform with the City's purchasing
procedures.
(8) Life cycle costs as determination of selection. Life cycle cost analysis
shall be used where it is the most appropriate method of determining
the benefit to the City. "Life cycle costs" are defined as the sum of all
recurring and one-time (nonrecurring) costs over the full life span or a
specified period of a good, service, structure or system. It includes
purchase price, installation cost, operating costs, maintenance and
upgrade costs and remaining (residual or salvage) value at the end of
ownership or its useful life.
(9) Reverse online auctions. When it is determined that the bidding
methods prescribed in this section will not result in the best value for

§ 2-795. Bid evaluation — Purchasing Committee. [3-14-2011 by
Ord. No. 1321]
Purchases of goods and services which require prior approval of the City
Council shall be evaluated by the Purchasing Committee, consisting of the
Director of Finance, Director of Public Works, Purchasing Agent and City
Clerk, or their designated representatives. Bid evaluation shall be based on
the requirements set forth in this division and in the invitation to bid, which
may include criteria to determine acceptability, such as quality, references,
workmanship, delivery, inspection, testing, suitability for a particular
purpose and recommendations by City consultants. Upon reviewing the
bids, the Purchasing Committee shall transmit the tabulation to the City
Manager and to the City Council with its recommendation.
the City, the Purchasing Agent may use a third form of competitive
selection known as reverse auction. A reverse auction is a real-time
purchasing event that is conducted over the internet. Interested
bidders submit responses in a manner similar to those in an invitation
to bid, with the exception that no prices are included. Those bidders
whose products or services meet the specifications are invited to the
reverse auction event. These bidders will then be provided with
instructions for the reverse online auction. During the event, bidders
may submit multiple prices electronically over a short time period, with
the lowest cost winning. Reverse auctions are often advantageous for
items of definite quantity and definite delivery. Price is a primary factor
in the award.
(10) The following purchasing method exemptions may apply:
a. No advantage to bid. The purchase of goods and services is other
than a public work or improvement and the product or material
contracted for is not competitive in nature and no advantage to the
City would result from requiring competitive bidding. Prior City
Council approval shall be required for purchases above the
threshold amount.
b. Recurring expenses of goods and services. The Director of Finance,
or designated representative, shall be authorized to purchase and/
or make payment for repetitive contractual obligations incurred by
the City, without regard to threshold amount limitations,
competitive bidding and without City Council approval, provided
such expenditures are within the approved budget and funds are
available for such expenditures. Such repetitive contractual
obligations include, but are not limited to, debt payments, utility
billings, legal or other professional billings, lease agreements,
payments of property taxes to other taxing jurisdictions, fuel
expenses, payroll, payroll taxes and employee benefit expenses,
etc.

§ 2-796. Council action on bids. [3-14-2011 by Ord. No. 1321]
Upon receipt of the bid tabulation and recommendation of the Purchasing
Committee for purchases of goods and services requiring prior City Council
approval, the City Council shall retain the right to reject bids or take any of
the following actions in awarding a bid:
(1) Award a contract to the lowest bidder who is determined to be a
responsible and a responsive bidder as follows:
a. Definition of responsible bidder. "Responsible bidder" is herein
defined as a person or firm which has the capability in all respects
to fully perform the contract requirements, and which has the
integrity and reliability which will assure good faith performance.
Items to be considered are:
1. The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the
contract to provide the services required.
2. Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the
service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or
interference.
3. The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and
efficiency of the bidder.
4. The quality of performance of previous contracts or services.
5. The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws
and ordinances relating to the contract or services.
6. The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the
bidder to perform the contract or provide the service.
7. The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies or
contractual services to the particular use required.

service for the use of the subject of the contract.
9. The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid.
b. Definition of responsive bidder. A "responsive bidder" is herein
defined as a person or firm that has submitted a bid which
conforms in all material respects to the descriptions, specifications,
terms, conditions and other factors called for in the invitation to
bid.
(2) Waive any inconsequential informality or defect in the bids.
(3) Award a contract to a bidder other than the low bidder in accordance
with § 2-797 (preference for local bidders section).

[3-14-2011 by Ord. No. 1321]
(4) Award a contract by division among two or more vendors if such
alternatives are duly indicated in the original invitation to bid.
(5) If two or more bidders are the lowest bidder, and determined to be a
responsible and a responsive bidder, the successful bidder may be
determined by lot.
(a) Purpose. The City believes that its purchasing practices should
encourage local vendors to provide goods and/or services to the City,
resulting in increased economic activity through more local jobs, tax
revenues, and expenditures to entice businesses to be located in the
City.
(b) Definition of City-based business. "City-based business" means a
physical and economic relationship to the City of Port Huron
determined by a verifiable business address (not a temporary location,
such as a post office box or construction trailer, etc.) within the
corporate boundaries of the City, activities carried out in the City of
Port Huron are substantial enough to consider it a City-based business
and the filing of a City income tax or personal property tax return for
the calendar year prior to the date of the bid submittal.
(c) Exceptions. The following purchases of goods and services shall be
exempt from local bidder preference provisions: emergency purchases,
sole source purchases, cooperative purchases, request for proposals,
bid solicitations that utilize federal funding that prohibit awards based
on local preference criteria and bid solicitations that utilize "life cycle
cost" as the basis of award in place of submitted bid price.
(d) Preference. When bids are received, the following shall apply:
(1) The person or business submitting the lowest bid who is
determined to be a responsible and a responsive bidder as provided
for in § 2-796(1) shall be deemed the lowest bidder. If the lowest
bidder is not a City-based business, the lowest City-based bidder
with a bid within 3% of the lowest bid on any contract bid in an
amount of $100,000 or less and within 1% on any bid amount in
excess of $100,000 shall be deemed the lowest bidder if it agrees to
reduce its bid to match the bid of the lowest bidder. A lowered bid
by a City-based business which is premised upon, in whole or in
part, changes to or variances to the bid specifications, contract
requirements or scope of work shall be considered nonresponsible
and will not be considered.
(2) If such a City-based business does not reduce its bid to match the
lowest bid, then the next lowest bidder that is a City-based business
with a bid within the applicable lowest-bid threshold amounts in

Council approval, in accordance with ordinances establishing contract
procedures for the purchase, sale, lease or services by the City, become
effective upon approval of the City Council. However, notwithstanding the
above, when it becomes necessary in the completion of any public work
or public improvement done under a public works contract to make an
alteration or modification in such contract, such alteration or modification
shall be made by a change order agreed upon in writing and signed by
§ 2-797(d)(1) shall be deemed the lowest bidder, if it agrees to
reduce its bid to match the bid amount of the lowest bidder.
(3) If no responsive and responsible City-based business within the
applicable bid threshold amounts in § 2-797(d)(1) agrees to reduce
its bid, then the contract shall be awarded to the person or business
with the lowest bid who is determined to be a responsible and a
responsive bidder.
(4) No contract awarded pursuant to this section shall be sublet in any
matter that permits 50% or more of the dollar value of the contract
to be performed by a subcontractor or subcontractors who do not
meet the definition of City-based business or where the City
determines the goods and/or services provided will not provide an
economic benefit to a City-based business.
(e) Rights of City. This section shall not waive or constrain, in any manner,
the right and prerogative of the City to reject any and all bids or
proposals, to reject a bid not accompanied by required bid security or
other documentation or data required by the bidding documents, or to
reject a bid which is in any way incomplete, irregular, not responsible or
not responsive.

Influence
§ 2-826. Purpose. [Code 1992, § 29-600; 1-24-1994 by Ord. No.

The City finds that a significant number of traffic arrests and traffic
accidents in the City involve drivers who were operating a motor vehicle,
snowmobile, off-road vehicle, or vessel while under the influence of
alcoholic liquor and/or a controlled substance. In addition, the City finds
that in traffic accidents involving drivers who were operating a motor
vehicle, snowmobile, off-road vehicle, or vessel while under the influence of
alcoholic liquor and/or a controlled substance there is a greater likelihood
of personal injury and property damage. As a result of these determinations,
a greater operational and/or financial burden is placed upon the City police,
public service, firefighting and rescue services by persons who are
operating motor vehicles, snowmobiles, off-road vehicles, or vessels while
under the influence of alcoholic liquor and/or a controlled substance.

influence of alcoholic liquor or a controlled substance or the combined
influence of alcoholic liquor and a controlled substance, when his or her
physical or mental abilities are impaired to a degree that he or she no
longer has the ability to operate a motor vehicle, snowmobile, off-road
vehicle, or vessel with the caution characteristic of a sober person of
ordinary prudence. Further, it shall be presumed that a person was
operating a motor vehicle, snowmobile, off-road vehicle, or vessel while
under the influence of alcoholic liquor if a chemical analysis of his or
her blood, urine or breath indicates that the amount of alcohol in his or
her blood was in excess of 0.07%.
(c) Charge against person. The expense of an emergency response shall be
charged against the person liable for the expenses under this division.

relevant factors. At the request of the recipient of a blight violation
notice, the inspector may also reschedule the hearing date to provide

during which they may be represented by counsel, present witnesses,
and cross-examine witnesses. A party may request the hearing officer to
issue subpoenas to direct the attendance and testimony of relevant
witnesses and the production of relevant documents. The rules of
evidence as applied in a nonjury civil case in circuit court shall be
followed as far as practicable, but the hearing officer may admit and
give probative effect to evidence of a type commonly relied upon by
reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. Irrelevant,
immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded. Effect
shall be given to the rules of privilege recognized by law. Objections to
offers of evidence may be made and shall be noted in the record.
Subject to these requirements, the hearing officer, for the purpose of
expediting hearings and when the interests of the parties will not be
substantially prejudiced thereby, may provide in an administrative
hearing or by rule for submission of all or part of the evidence in written
form.
(c) Decision. Any decision by a hearing officer that a blight violation does
or does not exist constitutes a final decision and order for purposes of
judicial review and may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.

§ 2-906. Appeal. [12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 1357]
(d) Default. If at the time set for a hearing neither the recipient of a blight
violation notice, nor his or her attorney of record, appears and the
blight violation notice is properly completed and sworn, the
administrative hearing officer may find the recipient in default and
enter an order of default which includes the sanctions as permitted
under § 2-903(c). A copy of the order of default must be served on the
party by United States Mail.
(e) Petition to set aside default. The recipient of a notice of blight violation
who is found to be in default may petition the administrative hearing
officer to set aside the order of default and set a new hearing date, at
any time, if the petitioner establishes that the petitioner was not
provided with proper service of process. If the petition is granted, the
administrative hearing officer must proceed with a new hearing on the
underlying matter as soon as practical. An administrative hearing
officer may set aside any order entered by default and set a new
hearing date, upon a petition filed within 21 days after the issuance of
the order of default, if the administrative hearing officer determines
that the petitioner's failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause
or, at any time, if the petitioner establishes that the petitioner was not
provided with proper service of process. If the petition is granted, the
administrative hearing officer must proceed with a new hearing on the
underlying matter as soon as practical.
(a) Time to appeal. A party may file a claim of appeal within 28 days after
entry of the final decision and order by the hearing officer with the St.
Clair County Circuit Court.
(b) Appeal bond. An alleged violator who appeals a final decision and order
to circuit court shall post with the Administrative Hearings Bureau, at
the time the appeal is taken, a bond equal to the fine and costs imposed.
A party who has paid the fine and costs is not required to post a bond. If
a party who has posted a bond fails to comply with the requirements of
Supreme Court rules for an appeal to the circuit court, the appeal may
be considered abandoned, and the Bureau may dismiss the appeal on
seven days' notice to the parties. The Administrative Hearings Bureau
must promptly notify the circuit court of a dismissal, and the circuit
court shall dismiss the claim of appeal. If the appeal is dismissed or the
decision and order are affirmed, the Administrative Hearings Bureau
may apply the bond to the fine and costs. An appeal by the City must be
asserted by the City's Attorney and a bond is not required.
(c) Review on appeal. An appeal to the circuit court shall be a review by the
circuit court of the certified record provided by the Bureau. Pending
appeal, and subject to the bond requirement provided for herein, the
hearing officer may stay the order and any sanctions or costs imposed.
Once an appeal is filed, and subject to the bond requirement provided
for herein, the circuit court may stay the order and any sanctions or
costs imposed. The circuit court, as appropriate, may affirm, reverse, or
§ 2-905 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-906

§ 2-907. Enforcement of order. [12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 1357]
modify the decision or order of the Bureau, or remand the matter for
further proceedings. The circuit court shall hold unlawful and set aside
a decision or order of the hearing officer if substantial rights of an
alleged violator have been prejudiced because the decision or order is
any of the following:
(1) In violation of the Constitution or a statute, Charter, or ordinance;
(2) In excess of the authority or jurisdiction of the agency as conferred
by statute, Charter, or ordinance;
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure resulting in material prejudice to a
party;
(4) Not supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on
the whole record;
(5) Arbitrary, capricious, or clearly an abuse or unwarranted exercise
of discretion; and/or
(6) Affected by other substantial and material error of law.
(a) Payment. All fines and assessments ordered by an administrative
hearing officer shall be paid to the City's Treasurer. Any fine, sanction,
or cost imposed by an administrative hearing officer's order that
remains unpaid after the exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust,
judicial review procedures is a debt due and owing the City and, as
such, may be collected in accordance with applicable law, and shall
become a lien on the property and assessed as a single lot assessment
against such property.
(b) Enforcement. After the expiration of the period in which judicial review
may be sought, unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
findings, decision, and order of an administrative hearing officer may
be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction, and may be enforced against assets of the
owner other than the building or structure.
(c) Failure to comply. In any case in which a respondent fails to comply with
an administrative hearing officer's order to correct a blight violation or
imposing a fine or other sanction as a result of a blight violation, any
expenses incurred by the City to enforce the administrative hearing
officer's order, including but not limited to, attorney's fees, court costs,
fines, fees, and costs related to property demolition or foreclosure, after
they are fixed by a court of competent jurisdiction or an administrative
hearing officer, is a debt due and owing the City. Before an
administrative hearing officer assesses any expense, the respondent
must be provided notice that states that the respondent must appear at
a hearing before an administrative hearing officer to determine
whether the respondent has failed to comply with the administrative

§ 2-908. Administrative adjudication procedures not exclusive.
[12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 1357]
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, neither the Bureau's
authority to conduct administrative adjudication procedures nor the
institution of such procedures under this chapter precludes the City from
seeking any remedies for blight violations through the use of any other
administrative procedure or court proceeding where authorized by law.
The City may elect to pursue a court proceeding to address an emergency
situation where there exists an immediate threat to the public interest,
safety or welfare.
§ 2-909. Rules and procedures. [12-9-2013 by Ord. No. 1357]
The City may establish rules and procedures necessary for the efficient
operation of the Bureau. Such rules and procedures shall be made publicly
available.
hearing officer's order. The notice must set the time for the hearing,
which may not be less than seven days from the date that notice is
served. Notice is sufficient if served by first-class mail and the sevenday
period begins to run on the date that the notice is deposited in the
mail.
(d) Remedies not exclusive. Nothing in this section prevents the City from
enforcing or seeking to enforce any order of an administrative hearing
officer in any manner, which is in accordance with applicable law.

by Ord. No. 1194; 6-13-2005 by Ord. No. 1251]
For the purposes of this article, the responsible local agent shall be an
individual person who represents the owner, a real estate holding company,
corporation, partnership or other legal entity and must have a place of
residence in the state within 45 miles of the City limits. The responsible
local agent shall be designated by the owner as legally responsible for

codes and ordinances. The owner may act as the responsible local agent,
provided he of she resides in the state and within 45 miles of the City limits.
All official notices of the City may be issued to the responsible local agent,
account and returned to the property owner if (1) the unit fails the
initial inspection and is not provided a rental certification pursuant to
§ 10-159, or (2) after the initial two-year certificate period set forth in
§ 10-159, there have been no fines issued as the result of a municipal
civil infraction under § 10-169. In such a case, the deposit shall be
returned to the property owner at the time of issuance of the second
rental certificate; however, if there is an unpaid civil infraction as of the
time of the expiration of the two-year certificate period, the amount of
the infraction and any cost incurred by the City to fix the blight shall be
deducted from the deposit, and the balance, if any, shall be returned to
the property owner. Existing property owners with properly registered
and certified rental units in the City, which have had no citations issued
during the past two years for building, blight, or rental code violations,
are exempt from the requirement for a deposit on newly created units.
(d) Registration for immediate family members. Any residential unit that is
occupied by someone other than the owner or the owner's immediate
family member shall be considered a rental unit and shall be registered
and certified with the City of Port Huron Department of Rental
Inspection before it is rented. If an immediate family member lives in a
residential unit, without the owner occupying the residence, the unit
shall be registered with the Department of Rental Inspection, indicating
that an immediate family member is occupying the residence.
Documentation shall be provided to the City providing proof that the
occupant is an immediate family member. Documentation shall consist
of a copy of a recent photo identification of the occupant, along with a
signed affidavit by both the occupant and owner that the occupant is an
immediate family member. The occupant's name, date of birth,
telephone number, and relationship to the owner shall be listed on the
affidavit. A residence occupied by an immediate family member shall be
exempt from the rental certification process and fee. If the residence is
on file with the City of Port Huron's Assessor's Office as a 100%
principal residence exemption, the residence need not be registered
with the Department of Rental Inspection. If a nonimmediate family
member should ever occupy the unit, the City must be notified; the unit
must receive a new rental registration and follow the certification
process in order for the unit to be rented.

(b) Subject to the restriction in § 10-178, a certification may be issued for a
two-year period on existing one- and two-family dwelling units and
existing multifamily dwellings (three or more and any rooming house
with one or more rooms, or boardinghouse) in accordance with the
following:
(1) The City will issue a certification valid for those years if the
inspector determines during the inspection that:
a. Any deficiencies discovered during previous inspections of the
rental unit have been corrected;
b. There are no major violations of the inspection guidelines for
rental dwellings. Major violations are those violations which, in
the inspector's professional judgment, create a risk to the
health or safety of tenants;
c. A residential rental unit located in a multifamily residential
rental structure will receive a certification only if all residential
rental units within the residential rental structure have a valid
certification or are also entitled to receive a certification.
(2) Temporary, one-year certificate. The exterior condition of all rental
units are subject to compliance with other related City codes and
ordinances, including § 10-31(b) (including property maintenance
code) of this chapter, and Chapter 22, Article II, Blight. If exterior
conditions are not in compliance with other City codes and

exterior of the unit(s) to established standards outlined in an
executed work agreement and in accordance with City codes and
ordinances within one year and, upon completion, be eligible to
receive a valid certification.
(3) Exemplary residential rental units:
a. A residential rental unit that has had both (1) no deficiencies
during any inspection and (2) no valid complaints or code
violations, for a period of four or more years, will receive the
status of "exemplary residential rental unit."
b. An exemplary residential rental unit may be issued a
certification for a four-year period instead of a two-year period
provided in § 10-159(b).
c. An exemplary residential rental unit may lose its status as the
result of the occurrence of any deficiencies, valid complaints,
or code violations during the four-year certification period.
(4) Probationary residential rental units:
a. A residential rental unit that has had more than one major
deficiency, valid complaint or code violation during the period
of its last rental certification will receive the status of
"probationary residential rental unit."
b. A probationary residential rental unit may be issued a
certification for a one-year period instead of the two-year
period provided in § 10-159(b).
c. A probationary residential rental unit may be removed from its
status if it has both (1) no deficiencies during any inspection,
and (2) no valid complaints or code violations for a period of
one or more years.
(a) This article applies to all residential rental structures and residential
rental units within the City existing on the effective date of the article.
(b) Any residential rental structure which is a new construction or
renovation which required a comprehensive inspection and which is
issued a certificate of occupancy pursuant to an inspection after the
effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived will
also be issued a certification simultaneous with the certificate of
occupancy, and an inspection fee pursuant to § 10-162 shall not then be
required. Residential rental structures which are new constructions

shall comply with registration requirement pursuant to § 10-155. Newly
constructed residential rental units may be issued a certification valid
for six years and then must adhere to the reinspection and
recertification process as set forth for all other rental units under
this article. Residential rental units with a current, valid and executed
lease agreement through the HUD Section 8 Housing or Michigan
State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA) programs may be able
to receive a waiver on an initial inspection for certification during
the effective date of the lease agreement. This waiver only applies
to the interior of the structure and does not relieve property owner
from responsibilities for compliance on the exterior of the structure or
the property area, nor compliance with any other applicable codes or
ordinances.
(a) The enforcing officer for the City Building Inspection Division shall
inspect the interior and exterior of residential rental units for the
purpose of conducting an initial inspection in the case of new rental
certification, or on a periodic basis pursuant to this article for the
purpose of a renewal. In such case, the inspection fee shall be set by
resolution of Council, subject to the restrictions of § 10-162. The City
Building Inspection Division may also conduct an inspection under any
of the following circumstances:
(1) Upon receipt of a complaint from an owner or occupant that the
premises is in violation of this article.
(2) Upon receipt of a report or a referral from the Police Department,
other public agencies or departments, or any individual indicating
that the premises is in violation of this article and which is based on
the personal knowledge of the person making the report.
(3) If an exterior survey of the premises gives the enforcing officer
probable cause to believe that the premises is in violation of this
article.
(4) Upon receipt of information by the enforcing officer that a rental
unit is not registered with the City or certified by the City as
required by this article.
(b) The owner or local agent shall be sent a reminder notice regarding the
need to schedule an inspection for the renewal of certification. Owners
of newly registered units must call to schedule their own inspections. If
the owner, or agent or tenant does not respond to the reminder notice,
the following will take place:
§ 10-160 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 10-161
1:139
(1) The inspector or Clerk shall notify the owner of a residential rental
structure of the date and time such structure is to be inspected.
Such notice may be personally delivered or may be sent by firstclass
mail.
(2) Upon receipt of the notice, the owner must either:
a. Appear at the date and time scheduled for the inspection or
have a representative or the tenant at the site to allow
complete access; or
b. Object within 10 days of the mailing or delivery of the notice,
and:
1. Schedule an alternative date for the appointment within
30 days from the date identified in the initial notice; or
2. Direct the inspector to contact the occupant of the rental
unit directly to schedule the inspection and provide the
occupant's name and address.
(3) If an owner or occupant subsequently learns he or she will not be
present for a scheduled appointment, the individual must provide
the inspector with at least 24 hours' advance notice and must
schedule a second inspection date within 30 days from the
scheduled appointment. Failure to appear for a scheduled
appointment without providing the notice shall require that a
reinspection fee be paid for any rescheduled date and may result in
the rental unit's certification expiring.
(c) The tenant of a single- or two-family dwelling unit may have the right to
deny access for an interior rental inspection, provided that the
following procedures are followed:
(1) The tenant must complete and submit an "access denied" form to
the Rental Certification Department within the ten-day time frame.
(2) The certification will be flagged as a one-year certificate due to
"access denied" and a recheck scheduled for one year's time.
(3) If the unit becomes vacant, it is the property owner's responsibility
to schedule an inspection and to obtain certification prior to
allowing occupancy.
(4) Failure to arrange for an inspection once the unit becomes vacant
shall result in a municipal civil infraction.
(5) Allowing occupancy of a unit without a valid certification after a
vacancy shall result in a separate municipal civil infraction.
(6) "Access denied" does not eliminate the requirement for an exterior
inspection of the property. The inspector will complete an exterior

inspection, and the certificate will not be issued unless the property
meets all related codes, including blight.
(7) Multifamily dwelling units (three or more, including rooming
houses and boardinghouses) must be inspected every two years
and receive a valid certification. Multifamily dwelling complexes of
20 or more units may be inspected every two years by the Rental
Certification Division by randomly selecting 50% of the total
number of units for inspection. If no violations are noted, the entire
complex may be certified for two years. Subsequent complaints
may affect the certification if there are valid violations and it is
determined that such violations warrant further inspections. The
units shall be selected and inspected randomly at the time of
scheduling. Additional units may be deemed necessary to inspect at
the discretion of the rental certification inspector or Building
Inspector should he/she have reasonable cause to believe other
violations exist in uninspected units or the unit(s) inspected is/are
found to have significant code violations that may be believed to
adversely affect other units or reasonably expected to be found in
other units. Failure to correct violations in units inspected will
prevent certification of the multi-unit building.
(d) During the inspection, the enforcing officer shall note any violations of
this article or other sections of this Code and give notice of the
violations to the responsible local agent in accordance with § 10-154.
The enforcing officer shall direct the responsible local agent and owner
to correct violations within the time set forth in the notice. A reasonable
time for correcting violations shall be determined by the enforcing
officer in light of the nature of the violations and all relevant
circumstances but shall not exceed 60 days. Upon request of the person
responsible for correcting violations, the enforcing officer may extend
the time for correcting violations if the enforcing officer deems such
action appropriate under all relevant circumstances, but not to exceed
an additional 60 days.
(e) Properties with a valid HUD Section 8 or MSHDA inspection
certification must provide a copy of said certification to the Rental
Certification Division in order to be exempt from the interior inspection
requirements of this article. These properties are not exempt from
exterior inspections and related code compliance.
(a) The annual operating fees for periodic inspection of each residential
rental unit and any other fees provided by this article shall be as
adopted by resolution by the City Council and amended, as necessary,
by resolution of the City Council. The annual operating fee shall cover
the periodic inspection for the issuance or renewal of a certification,

except that such fee shall not cover an inspection made pursuant to a
final notice of violation issued under § 10-164(b).
(b) If the enforcing officer determines that a complaint was filed without a
factual basis and such inspection is made on a complaint basis, or if the
enforcing officer believes the complaint was maliciously filed, he or she
may seek a warrant under § 10-166.
(c) An administrative late fee of the unpaid balance shall be paid to the City
by the person obligated to pay an annual operating fee under
Subsection (a) of this section if such fee is not paid within 60 days from
the billing date, as adopted by resolution of the City Council. After 90
days from the date of billing, those fees shall become a lien on the
property as a single lot special assessment pursuant to § 40-19 and
shall be collected as a special assessment.
(d) The rental inspection program as provided for in this article shall be
operated by the City on a break-even basis. This means the annual
operating fees charged shall be set at a rate to produce sufficient
revenue to cover the actual, direct cost of administering the program. If
the fees as set forth in this article or as amended exceed the actual,
direct cost of administering the program, the City Council, by
resolution, shall reduce the fees to an amount which shall produce
sufficient revenue to cover the actual, direct cost of administering the
program. If at any time the fees being collected are insufficient to cover
the cost of the program, the City Council, by resolution, shall increase
the fees to an amount which shall produce sufficient revenue to cover
the actual, direct cost of administering the program. Fines and fees due
to legal action, enforcement proceedings, civil infractions or citations
as a result of noncompliance with this article are exempt and will not be
included in this calculation.
(a) Between 60 and 30 days before the expiration date on the certification
issued for a rental property, every owner shall apply to the City Building
Inspection Division for the scheduling of an inspection for the issuance
of a new certification for that residential rental structure. [6-26-2017
by Ord. No. 17-005]
(b) Upon receipt of a timely request for an inspection for the purpose of the
issuance or renewal of a certification, the City shall inspect the
premises before the certification expires or is initially issued. Upon
failure of the City to conduct an inspection prior to occupancy or
expiration of the certification, the owner may rent the property until the
City has conducted an inspection, and the owner will not be deemed in
violation of § 10-159 during that time. If, however, the City's failure to
inspect is due to the owner's, agent's or tenant's action, failure to act,
or refusal to permit an inspection after reasonable notice of the intent

he or she shall give notice of such alleged violation and orders for
correction of the violation as provided in this section, except this
section shall not apply in any way to the prosecution of violations of

forth in this article as such may be prosecuted without notice. Such
notice shall:
(1) Be in writing.

Notice given to the responsible local agent is deemed as notice
given to the owner.
(b) Final notice of violation. Upon observing the continued existence of a
violation of this article or applicable code as stated in the notice of
violation, the building official or enforcing officer shall send a final
notice of violation and may issue an order to vacate to the responsible
local agent. Such notice shall be sent by regular, first-class mail to the
last known address of the owner or responsible local agent and shall:
(1) Specify the date of the inspection.
(2) Specify the address where the violation was found.
(3) Include the name, telephone number and signature of the
inspector.

will be required to be paid prior to a reinspection, and the
owner or local agent shall be responsible for contacting the
Rental Inspection Department for scheduling the reinspection
within 10 days of the date on the notice;
c. State that failure to comply with the notice will result in a fine
for failure to correct the final notice of violation, or

violation shall be established by a resolution of the City
Council.
d. Employ any other additional or optional corrective or
enforcement measure as provided for under this Code or by
law.
e. Each reinspection, as needed, will require an additional
reinspection fee to be paid prior to a reinspection.

for a residential rental structure or residential rental unit or its
accessory building, the City may affix a copy of the notice on the
residential rental structure or unit and deliver a copy of the notice to
the occupants, if any.
(d) Nuisance per se. Notwithstanding any section in this article to the
contrary, any residential rental structure or unit that is found to be in
such condition as to preclude habitation or threaten the health, safety
or welfare of the occupants or community shall be considered a

is present or is de minimis shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon
conviction thereof, shall be punished according to § 1-16.

either the existence of an alleged violation or the period of time that will
be reasonably required for the owner to correct the alleged violations
as set forth in the notice of violation and order to repair given pursuant
to this article, or a finding of a public nuisance under § 10-168(b), the
owner may appeal to the Rental Housing Board of Appeals, which is
hereby designated to hear such appeals. An occupant of a dwelling shall
have standing to appeal any notice or order to vacate the dwelling.

bring an action to seek the enforcement of this article by abatement,
mandatory injunction to cause correction of a violation, enjoinment of
the violation to prevent an act or violation, the vacation of the premises
by all occupants and its discontinuance as a residential rental structure,
or such other action as provided for under this article. Any structure not
in compliance with this article is deemed a nuisance per se. If a
residential unit is vacant and not certified, or the certification has
expired, or an inspection to certify has not been completed, then the
unit may be yellow-tagged to signify that it may not be occupied until a
rental inspection has been completed and/or a certificate has been
renewed or issued.

violations, including blight, or multiple valid police calls or incidences,
illegal activity or other activity that threatens the health, welfare or
safety of the surrounding residents, whether the result of the activities
of the owner, the agent, the tenants, or their guests, may constitute a
public nuisance under this subparagraph. A rental certificate revoked
under this subparagraph shall be revoked for a minimum period of at
least 12 months. Any property owner who wishes to challenge a finding
of a public nuisance under this subparagraph may utilize the procedure

It is hereby found and declared that:
§ 16-32. Definitions. [Code 1975, § 34-2; Code 1992, § 8-2]
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the
context clearly indicates a different meaning:
ACT — The Rehabilitation of Blighted Areas Act, Public Act No. 344 of 1945

BLIGHTED AREA — A portion of the City, developed or undeveloped,
improved or unimproved, with business or residential uses, marked by
a demonstrated pattern of deterioration in physical, economic, or social
conditions, and characterized by such conditions as functional or economic
obsolescence of buildings or the area as a whole, physical deterioration
of structures, substandard building or facility conditions, improper or
inefficient division or arrangement of lots and ownerships and streets and
(1) Areas in the City have become blighted and are deteriorating in a
manner which leads to severe blight, with the consequent impairment
of taxable values upon which, in large part, City revenues depend;
(2) Those blighted areas are detrimental or inimical to the health, safety,
morals, and general welfare of the citizens, and to the economic welfare
of the City;
(3) In order to improve and maintain the general character of the City, it is
necessary to rehabilitate those blighted areas;
(4) The conditions found in blighted areas cannot be remedied by the
ordinary operations of private enterprise, with due regard to the
general welfare of the public, without public participation in the
planning, property acquisition or disposition, and related
implementation and financing of the remedies;
(5) The purposes of this article are to rehabilitate those areas by improving
or acquiring and developing properties within the areas for the
protection of the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City,
to preserve existing values of other properties within or adjacent to the
areas, and to preserve the taxable value of the property within the
areas; and
(6) The necessity in the public interest for provisions enacted in this article
is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination to be a
public purpose and a public use.

structures, deterioration in the condition of public facilities or services,
or any other similar characteristics which endanger the health, safety,
morals, or general welfare of the City, and which may include any buildings
or improvements not in themselves obsolescent, and any real property,
residential or nonresidential, whether improved or unimproved, the
acquisition of which is considered necessary for rehabilitation of the area.
It is expressly recognized that blight is observable at different stages of
severity and that moderate blight unremedied creates a strong probability
that severe blight will follow. Therefore, the conditions that constitute
blight are to be broadly construed to permit the City to make an early
identification of problems and to take early remedial action to correct a
demonstrated pattern of deterioration and to prevent worsening of blight
conditions.

historic preservation; to authorize the creation and implementation
of development plans in the districts; to promote economic growth;
and to authorize the use of tax increment plans.

and has recommended for approval a tax increment financing and
development plan to the area designated "Amendment No. 2 to

(1) The Downtown Development Authority has approved an overall

and retail growth. Pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Act [MCL
125.1657(c)], the City Council finds that, without the residential
development, as contained in the development plan, the public

blighting factors exist or the blight or blighting factors have not been
removed after service of the removal notice as set forth in this article,

other remedies available, all of the costs of removal of such blight shall
be billed to the owner or occupant of the subject property, and all
invoices which remain unpaid for more than 30 days may become a lien
on the property and assessed as a single lot assessment against such
property.

Subsection (e) of this section involves the demolition of any dwelling or
other structure and such order is not complied with within 10 days after
its issuance, the City Council shall hear such report from the City
Manager, or designee, regarding the determinations previously made in
the matter and based on such report shall make its determination
whether to proceed with the proposed demolition and to issue such
resolution as the Council deems appropriate under the circumstances,
including, but not limited to, the demolition of the structure by the City,
and all of the associated demolition costs shall be billed to the owner or
occupant of the subject property, and all invoices which remain unpaid
for more than 30 days may become a lien on the property and assessed

violation notice, by which, if a violator removes or corrects the blight
violation, the inspector may dismiss the blight violation notice.

remedied within seven days from the issuance of the blight violation
notice, in addition to any other sanctions provided under § 2-903, the

brush, or grass without further notice. All of the costs of removal of
such unlawful growth shall be billed to the owner or occupant of the
subject property, and all invoices which remain unpaid for more than 30
days may become a lien on the property and assessed as a single lot

within five days after the Council shall have affirmed such order, the
Director shall carry out the pruning, spraying or destruction of the
trees or engage the work to be done and shall bill the owner, agent or
occupant of the property for the cost thereof. If the owner of such
property shall fail to pay such bill within 30 days after the bill has been
rendered, the Director shall report the failure to pay to the City Council
for collection as a single lot assessment against such property in
accordance with Chapter 40, Special Assessments. The Director may,
without serving such notice, when the owner or occupant of any private
property shall consent thereto and pay the reasonable cost thereof,
cause trees growing on private property to be sprayed when he or she
deems such spraying necessary on account of any infestation or disease
or threat thereof.
(e) The Director and his or her assistants and employees shall have
authority to enter upon private premises for the purpose of examining
any tree for the presence of destructive insects or plant diseases. No
damages shall be awarded for the destruction of any tree or injury to
the tree, if done by the Director or under his or her direction in

1090; 2-25-2019 by Ord. No. 19-002]
(a) Findings. The City determines that whenever illegal activity, as defined
in Subsection (b) of this section, occurs on any property, as defined in
Subsection (b) of this section, increased criminal activity occurs in the
neighborhood surrounding the property, increased pedestrian and/or
vehicular traffic occurs in the neighborhood surrounding the property,
and the peace and quiet of residents living in the neighborhood
surrounding the property are disturbed, thereby constituting a public
nuisance.
(b) Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this
section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection,
except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
ILLEGAL ACTIVITY — Lewdness, assignation or prostitution or
gambling, or using or keeping a property for the use of prostitutes
or other disorderly persons or using a property for the unlawful
manufacture, storing, possessing, transporting, sale, keeping for sale,
bartering, furnishing or otherwise disposing of any narcotic and/or
§ 34-246 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 34-249
1:445
hypnotic drug and/or drug paraphernalia as defined by law or of any
alcoholic liquor.
OWNER — Any person who possesses or has any legal and/or equitable
interest in the property in question.
PROPERTY — Any structure, house, premises, building, vehicle, boat,
aircraft or place.
(c) Declaration of nuisance.
(1) A property where illegal activity occurs is hereby declared a
nuisance, and the furniture, fixtures and contents of any such
building, vehicle, boat, aircraft, or place and all such alcoholic
liquors therein are also declared a nuisance. All such narcotic and/
or hypnotic drugs and nuisances shall be enjoined and abated as
provided in this section.
(2) Any person or his or her servant, agent or employee who shall
knowingly own, lease, conduct or maintain any building, vehicle or
place used for illegal activity or where any illegal activity is
conducted, permitted or carried on is guilty of maintaining a
nuisance.
(d) Procedure for declaration of nuisance. Whenever the City Council shall
find that there has been repeated illegal activity occurring on any
property, it may declare, by resolution, after notice to the owner and
public hearing and recommendation by the Police Chief or his or her
designee, that the property is a public nuisance.
(1) Public hearing. A public hearing before the City Council shall be
held after publication of notice thereof wherein all interested
parties may present opinions, evidence or other information
bearing on whether the property should or should not be declared a
public nuisance.
(2) Notice of public hearing. A notice of public hearing setting forth
the date, time and location thereof shall be given in the following
manner to the owner of the property at least seven but not more
than 15 days prior to the public hearing:
a. For real property, the notice shall be personally served or sent
by certified mail-restricted delivery or by alternate service as
defined under the Michigan Court Rules if service by mail or
personal service is unsuccessful after three diligent attempts
to the grantee or vendee of the last recorded conveyancing
instrument or memorandum thereof at the county register of
deeds office and, if different, to the taxpayer of record as
indicated in the Building Safety Division, for a rental unit, or
the City Assessor's office, for an owner-occupied dwelling, and,
if different, to the occupants of the premises and to any
mortgagee or lienholder of record.
§ 34-249 PORT HURON CODE § 34-249
1:446
b. For personal property, the notice shall be given to the person
shown to be the owner by certified record of the state or
federal agency where titles to such property are required to be
filed and, if different, to such other person as may be known to
be in possession or control of the property and to any
lienholder of record. Such notice shall be personally served or
sent by certified mail-restricted delivery or by alternate service
as defined in the Michigan Court Rules if service by mail or
personal service is unsuccessful after three diligent attempts.
(e) Abatement of nuisance; costs. If the City Council determines that a
property is a public nuisance, it may, by resolution, in addition to any
other remedies available to the City at law or in equity:
(1) Authorize the building safety division to prohibit the occupancy of
the property by the persons occupying the premises at the time of
the public nuisance by either padlocking that portion of the
building that would prevent the illegal activity or boarding the
property up, whichever is appropriate, for a period until such
person creating the nuisance vacates the premises.
(2) Determine that the persons creating the nuisance shall be liable for
the full cost of any personnel, including police and code compliance
officers, involved in each raid subsequent to the first raid, and the
full cost of any City personnel and materials involved in the
boardup or padlocking and assess those costs against the persons
creating the nuisance and for real property assess those costs
against the real property in the same manner as a special
assessment.
(f) Persuasive presumption of public nuisance. It shall be a persuasive
presumption that a property is a public nuisance if:
(1) The property has been raided by the police and controlled
substances and/or drug paraphernalia or any of the other illegal
items described in the definition of the term "illegal activity" in
Subsection (b) of this section have been found by the police;
(2) A letter, informing the addressee that controlled substances (illegal
drugs) and/or drug paraphernalia or any of the other illegal activity
has been found by the police at the property and the potential
consequences if similar activity recurs at the property, has been:
a. Personally served on the owner as indicated by the last
recorded conveyancing instrument filed with the register of
deeds of the county and, if different, as shown on the records of
the of the Building Safety Department;
b. For a rental dwelling, sent by certified mail-delivery restricted
or alternate service to the owner of record and, if different, the
owner as shown in records of the City Assessor's office as
§ 34-249 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 34-249
1:447
indicated in the Building Safety Division, and a return receipt
card has been received by the City accepted or refused;

restricted to the owner of record, as indicated in the City
Assessor's office, and a return receipt card has been received
by the City accepted or refused; or
d. For personal property, sent by certified mail-delivery restricted
to the owner of record as indicated by the state or federal
agency where titles to such property are required to be filed
and a return receipt card has been received by the City
accepted or refused; and
(3) The same property is raided by the police again within six months
from the date of the first raid and evidence of illegal activity is
found in the subsequent raid by the police.
(g) Receiving or admitting persons to property where illegal activity is
occurring. No person shall receive or admit or offer to receive or admit
any person into any place, structure, house, or vehicle or any property
as defined in Subsection (b) of this section for the purpose of illegal
activity as defined in Subsection (b) of this section or knowingly permit
any person to remain in any such place for any such purpose.
(h) Loitering in places where illegal activity is occurring or about to occur.
No person shall knowingly loiter about a lot that is vacant, street, curb,
lawn, alley, yard, apartment, store, boathouse, or other place where
illegal activity is occurring and, also, in the case of narcotic and/or
hypnotic drug and/or drug paraphernalia, where such illegal activity is

(2) By order of court and/or probation, the person's presence is
prohibited in a high drug activity geographic area.

the City Treasurer for collection. The City Treasurer shall mail statements
of the several assessments to the respective owners of the several lots and
parcels of land assessed, as indicated by the records of the City Assessor,
stating the amount of the assessment and the manner in which it may
be paid; provided, however, failure to mail any such statement shall not
invalidate the assessment or entitle the owner to an extension of time within
which to pay the assessment. The whole or any part of such assessment
may be paid in full at any time after the date of confirmation of the special
assessment roll until such time as the Council shall prescribe, without
interest or penalty. Each special assessment shall be collected by the City
Treasurer with the same rights and remedies as provided in the Charter
for the collection of taxes, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. All
collection fees shall belong to the City and shall be collectible in the same
manner as the collection fee for City taxes.
§ 40-13. Fees and interest. [Code 1975, § 28-13; Code 1992, § 24-13]

of confirmation to the date of payment.
(a) All special assessments contained in any special assessment roll,
including any part thereof to be paid in installments, shall, from the
date of confirmation of such roll, constitute a lien upon the respective
lots or parcels of land assessed and until paid shall be a charge against
the respective owners of the several lots and parcels of land and a debt
to the City from the persons to whom they are assessed. Such lien shall
be of the same character and effect as the lien created by the Charter
for City taxes and shall include accrued interest and fees. No judgment
or decree nor act of the Council vacating a special assessment shall
destroy or impair the lien of the City upon the premises assessed for
such amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against the
premises or as, by a regular mode of proceeding, might be lawfully
assessed thereon.
(b) All special assessments shall become due upon confirmation of the
special assessment roll or in annual installments, not to exceed 20 in
number, as the Council may determine at the time of confirmation. If in
annual installments, the Council may determine the first installment to
be due upon confirmation or upon any other date the Council may
prescribe and the subsequent installments annually thereafter.

may prescribe.

1:497
§ 40-14. Additional assessments. [Code 1975, § 28-14; Code 1992,
§ 24-14]
Should the assessments on any special assessment roll, including the
amount assessed to the City at large, prove insufficient for any reason to
pay the cost of the improvement for which they were made, the Council may
make additional pro rata assessments to supply the deficiency against the
City and the several lots and parcels of land in the same ratio as the original
assessments, but the total amount assessed against any lot or parcel of land
shall not exceed the value of the benefits received from the improvement.
§ 40-15. Disposition of excessive assessments. [Code 1975, § 28-15;
Code 1992, § 24-15; 6-26-2017 by Ord. No. 17-005]
Pursuant to § C8-3 of the City Charter, the excess by which any special
assessment proves larger than the actual cost of the improvement and
expenses incidental thereto may be placed in the general fund of the City if
such excess is 5% or less of the assessment. Should the assessment prove
larger than necessary by more than 5%, the entire excess shall be refunded
on a pro rata basis to the owners of the property assessed. Such refund
shall be made by credit against future unpaid installments to the extent
such installments then exist, and the balance of such refund shall be in
cash. No refunds may be made which contravene the provisions of any
outstanding evidence of indebtedness secured in whole or in part by such
special assessment.
§ 40-16. Division of lots after confirmation of assessment. [Code
1975, § 28-16; Code 1992, § 24-16]
Should any lots or lands be divided after a special assessment thereon
has been confirmed and divided into installments, the City Assessor shall
apportion the uncollected amounts upon the several lots and lands so
divided and shall enter the several amounts as amendments upon the
special assessment roll. The City Treasurer shall, within 10 days after such
apportionment, send notice of such action to the persons concerned, at their
last known address, by first class mail. Such apportionment shall be final
and conclusive on all parties unless protest in writing is received by the City
Treasurer within 20 days of the mailing of such notice.
§ 40-17. Assessment defects. [Code 1975, § 28-17; Code 1992,
§ 24-17]
Whenever the Council deems any special assessment invalid or defective
or whenever a court adjudges an assessment to be illegal, in whole or in
part, the Council may cause a new assessment to be levied for the same
purpose, whether or not the improvement or any part thereof has been
completed, or any part of the special assessment collected. All proceedings
on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be conducted in
the same manner as provided for the original assessment. If any portion
of the original special assessment is collected and not refunded, it shall be
§ 40-14 PORT HURON CODE § 40-17
1:498
applied upon the reassessment, and the reassessment shall, to that extent,
be deemed satisfied. If more than the amount reassessed is collected, the
balance shall be refunded to the person making such payment. If in any
action it shall appear that, by reason of any irregularities or informalities
the assessment has not been properly made against the person assessed or
upon the lot or premises sought to be charged, the court may nevertheless,
on satisfactory proof that expense has been incurred by the City which
is a proper charge against the person assessed or the lot or premises in
question, render judgment for the amount properly chargeable against such
person or upon such lot or premises.
§ 40-18. Additional procedure. [Code 1975, § 28-18; Code 1992,
§ 24-18]
When the sections of this chapter may prove to be insufficient to carry
into full effect the making of any improvement or the special assessment
therefor, the City Council shall provide any additional steps or procedure
required to effect the improvement by special assessment in the resolution
declaring the determination of the City Council to make such improvement
in the first instance.
§ 40-19. Single lot assessments generally. [Code 1975, § 28-19;
Code 1992, § 24-19]
(a) When any expense shall be incurred by the City upon or in respect to
any separate or single lot, parcel of land or premises which, by this
Code, the Council is authorized to charge and collect as a single lot
special assessment against the lot, parcel of land or premises and which
is not of that class of special assessments required to be made pro rata
upon several lots or parcels of land in a special assessment district, an
account of the labor or services for which such expense was incurred,
verified by the officer or person performing the labor or services or
causing the labor or services to be done, shall be reported to the City
Council in a manner it prescribes. The accounting reported to the
Council shall include a description of the lot or premises on or in
respect to which the expense was incurred, the name of the owner or
person chargeable therewith, and the cost of labor or services
performed. The preceding sections of this chapter with reference to pro
rata special assessments generally and the proceedings necessary to be
had before making the improvement shall not apply to single lot
assessments contemplated in this section.
(b) The City Council, after review of the single lot assessment account,
shall determine what amount or part of every such reported expense
shall be charged, and the premises upon which the expense shall be
levied as a single lot special assessment. As often as the City Council
may deem it expedient, it shall require all of the several amounts so
reported and determined and the several lots or premises chargeable
therewith respectively to be reported by the City Clerk to the City
Assessor, who shall spread such amounts against the real property

§ 40-20. Use of single lot assessments for recovery of cost of
abating public nuisances and hazards. [Code 1975, § 28-20; Code
1992, § 24-20]
When any lot, building or structure, because of accumulation of solid waste,
the uncontrolled growing of weeds, age or dilapidation, or because of any
other condition or happening, becomes a public hazard or nuisance which
is detrimental to the health or safety of the inhabitants of the City or of
those residing or habitually going near such lot, building or structure, the
Council may order such hazard or nuisance abated and the cost of such
abatement assessed against the lot, premises or description of real property
upon which such hazard or nuisance was located as a single lot assessment.

chargeable therewith on the next tax roll for the collection of general
City taxes. An owner or party in interest or his or her agent may request
a hearing before the City Council to protest the single lot assessment or
shall be permitted to file his or her appearance or protest by letter, and
his or her personal appearance shall not be required. The hearing date
shall be scheduled no later than 45 days from the City Council action
on the particular single lot assessment.
(a) The City may assess all or a part of the cost of operating parking
improvements and any other public improvement assessment of the
operating expenses of which are provided for by law. If such an
assessment is made, the proceedings shall be as provided for
assessment of the cost of acquiring a public improvement except as
otherwise provided in this section. When the Council determines to
assess the cost of operating a public improvement, it shall, by
resolution, designate the improvement, the operating expenses of
which are to be assessed, the district against which the improvements
shall be assessed and shall direct the City Manager to prepare a
proposed budget for operation of the improvement during the first
fiscal year for which operating expenses are to be specially assessed.
Upon receipt of the proposed budget, the Council shall direct the
Assessor to prepare an assessment roll assessing the cost of operating
to the proposed district for that fiscal year. The Assessor shall file the
assessment roll with the Council when it has been completed, and the
Council shall then call a hearing on the necessity for assessing
operating expenses, the boundaries of the proposed district, the budget
for the first fiscal year and the proposed assessment roll. Notice of the
hearing shall be given in the manner provided in § 40-7. Following the
hearing, the Council shall, by resolution, determine whether to proceed
with the assessment of the operating expenses, finally designate the
district for the assessment and may affirm or modify the proposed
assessment roll or return it to the Assessor for revision.

(a) No person shall permit any sidewalk which adjoins property owned by
him or her to fall into a state of disrepair or to be unsafe.
(b) Whenever the Public Works Director shall determine that a sidewalk is
unsafe for use, notice may be given to the owner of the lot or premises
adjacent to and abutting upon such sidewalk of such determination,
which notice shall be given in accordance with § 2-768. Thereafter, it

§ 48-85. Required sewer and drainage connections. [Code 1992,
§ 31-65; 11-23-1992 by Ord. No. 1028]
(a) Purpose. For the purpose of protecting the public health and safety, the
City Council hereby establishes standards and regulations for the use of
public and private sewers and drains, the installation and connection of
building sewers and the discharge of waters and wastes into the public
sewer system of the City, which standards and regulations are set out in
this article and which are deemed to be the absolute minimum
consistent with the preservation of the public health and safety and to
fulfill the obligations of the City with respect to the state and federal
law and all rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
(b) Scope. This article shall apply to the City and to any person discharging
or proposing to discharge wastewater or other wastes to the POTW,
either by permit or agreement, or otherwise discharge under this
article. Another municipality that discharges into the POTW shall adopt
an ordinance which is substantially equivalent to and shall contain at
least all of the sections and requirements in this article and which is
approved by the utilities manager and State Department of
Environmental Quality as being sufficiently identical.
This article provides for the regulation of discharges into the POTW
through the issuance of permits to significant industrial users and
through enforcement of this article's requirements against all
dischargers into the POTW. This article authorizes monitoring and
enforcement activities and requires discharger reporting.

[Code 1992, § 31-66; 11-23-1992 by Ord. No. 1028]
Where a public sanitary or combined sewer is not available under § 48-85,
the building sewer may be connected to a private sewage disposal system
approved by the Director.
(a) The owner or occupant of any property situated within the City upon
which is located a structure in which water is used or is available for
household, commercial, industrial or other purposes shall, at his or her
own expense, cause such property to be connected to an available
public sanitary sewage collection facility, as where required under the
terms of Part 127 of Public Act No. 368 of 1978 (MCL 333.12701 et
seq.). Such owner or occupant shall also be required to install suitable
toilet facilities within such structure.
(b) The owner or occupant of any property situated within the City may be
prohibited from connecting the property to a sanitary sewer, storm
sewer, combined sewer or other wastewater facility when it is
determined by the Director that there is no capacity available to
properly convey or treat the discharge.
(c) A person operating an existing industrial or commercial enterprise
where a storm sewer or natural or artificial watercourse is available or
becomes available in the future and is within 100 feet of his or her
property line shall be required, at his or her expense, to install a
connection to convey all cooling water and uncontaminated industrial
wastes to such storm sewer or natural or artificial watercourse within
the time set by the Director, upon a determination by the Director that
such a connection is feasible. Upon making a determination that such a
connection is feasible, the Director shall set a reasonable time limit
within which the person is required to make the connection, which time
limit shall not be less than 90 days nor more than two years from the
time of written notice from the Director to the person to make such
connection.
(d) The connection to an available public sanitary sewage collection facility,
as well as a connection to a storm sewer or a conduit to a natural or
artificial watercourse for the transport of stormwater or noncontact
cooling water, shall be considered a private service lead. The
maintenance, operation, and replacement of such private service leads,
including that portion within the City right-of-way and/or under a City
street, shall be the responsibility of the owner from the connection
point at the sewer tap to the premises being served.

(a) Use of land, dwellings, buildings or structures, including tents and
trailer coaches, used, erected, altered, razed or converted in violation
of any section of this chapter is hereby declared to be a nuisance per se.
The owner and/or agent in charge of any such land, dwelling, building
or structure, including tents and trailer coaches, including the lessee or
tenant of any part of a building or land where any such violation has
been committed or shall exist or the architect, builder, contractor, or
any other person who takes part in or assists in any such violation or
who maintains any building or land where any such violation exists shall
be responsible for a municipal civil infraction.
(b) The imposition of any sentence shall not exempt the offender from
compliance with the requirements of this chapter. This chapter may
also be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction through the civil
litigation process. Each day that a violation is permitted to exist shall
constitute a separate offense.
(a) A use certificate shall be obtained from the City Planning Department
before any new or different business can occupy a building, in order to
confirm that the use is allowed in the zone where the property is
located. Application shall be made by the property owner, tenant, or
representative thereof. The use certificate shall indicate the location of
the building, the nature of the use, any physical changes to the building,
parking availability, and barrier free access. The building may need to
be inspected by the Inspection Division or Fire Department before said
certificate can be approved. The City reserves the right to contact the
applicant for a permission to enter the property or building for an
inspection.
(b) The use certificate may be approved contingent upon renovations being
required to comply with the Zoning Ordinance and or other applicable
City or state codes. Approval of the use certificate does not constitute
approval for a building permit. The appropriate permits for any

(a) Before the issuance of a permit for the establishment, erection,
reconstruction, structural alteration, enlargement, addition to or
moving of any use which, as provided by the district regulations and
other regulations in this chapter, shall be permitted in a certain district
as a permitted use after special approval, such use shall be approved by
the Planning Commission after a public hearing. Site plan review shall
be required for all such special approval uses in accordance with
§ 52-697.
(b) Action of the Planning Commission on any such matter shall be taken
only after an application therefor in writing shall be filed with the Chief
Inspector and shall be governed by the required procedure for an
appeal pursuant to Public Act 110 of 2006 (MCL 125.3101 et seq.),
including holding a hearing.
(c) The issuance of any permit shall not be approved unless the Planning
Commission shall find, in each case, that:
(1) All requirements set forth in this chapter will be complied with.
(2) The use and any proposed structures to be utilized in connection
therewith will not create any threat to the public health, safety and
welfare and will not unduly aggravate any traffic problem in the
area.
(3) The proposed use will not be injurious to the surrounding
neighborhood.
(4) The proposed use will not be contrary to the spirit and purpose of
this chapter. The Planning Commission may recommend such
conditions as it may deem reasonably necessary to promote the
spirit and intent of this chapter.
(5) All proposed structures, equipment or material shall be readily
accessible for fire and police protection.
(6) The proposed use shall not cause traffic congestion or movement
out of proportion to that normally prevailing in the particular
district.
(7) The proposed use shall provide sufficient space for the off-street
parking of all vehicles attracted by its presence and shall abide by
the regulations set forth in this chapter for its particular district or
use.

1975, § 39-114; Code 1992, § 32-482; 10-22-2007 by Ord. No. 1280]
Special approval use permits for parking lots for business uses in residential
areas shall be allowed to remain with the business as long as the business is
the same or similar use. A change in ownership will not affect the validity of
a special approval use permit granted for a parking lot for a business use.
Said parking lot shall be allowed only as an expansion of an existing parking
lot and adjacent to said business property.
§ 52-73. Appeal process for special approval use permits. [Code
1992, § 32-483; 8-13-2001 by Ord. No. 1188]
(8) Any proposed building shall not be out of harmony with the
predominant type of building in the particular district by reason of
its size, character, location, or intended use.
(d) The issuance and validity of any special use permit is contingent upon
the conditions/uses existing at the time of issuance. The permit goes
with the building and specific use of the building as authorized on the
permit, except where specifically prohibited. Transfer of property does
not affect the use permit. When property, for which a special permit has
been designated, has a change in ownership or use, another use may
occupy such property provided the proposed use and parking
requirements are similar to the former use for which the special permit
was granted. A use certificate shall be issued from the Planning
Department prior to the new use occupying such property. Change in
use to a nonsimilar activity will result in the use permit becoming null
and void. A new special permit (special approval) shall be required from
the Planning Commission if the following items prevail:
(1) The former use has ceased for a period exceeding six months.
(2) New additions or new structures are required.
(3) The new use is a different character as compared to existing use.
The new use must be a "use allowed after special approval" in such
zoning district.
(4) More parking spaces are required than were necessary for the
previous use.
(5) Home occupations and state licensed care facilities in the home
such as family or group day care, expire upon change of ownership
and are not transferable to a new address or new property owner.
(e) A site plan shall be submitted with an application for the special
approval use permit. The site plan shall show the location of all
structures and parking on the property for the proposed use. Follow the
requirements necessary for submitting a site plan as required in
§ 52-697(d) through (h).

required to pass under any City ordinance adopted pursuant to Public
Act No. 110 of 2006 (MCL 125.3201 et seq.). The concurring vote of a
majority of the members of the members of the Board shall be
necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination
of any such administrative official or to decide in favor of the applicant
any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such ordinance
or to effect any variation in such ordinance. Such appeal may be taken
by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau
of the City. Such appeal shall be taken within such time as shall be
prescribed by the Board by general rule, by the filing with the officer
from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board a notice of appeal
specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is
taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting
the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
(b) The Board shall also hear appeals filed with it by the owner of any real
property in an area for which the City Council has adopted an urban
renewal development plan. The Board may approve a minor deviation in
the urban renewal development plan for the area in any case in which
such Board finds, upon evidence presented to it, that the application of
the plan results in unnecessary hardship or practical difficulties and a
minor deviation from the development plan is required by consideration
of justice and equity, consistent with Section 10 of Public Act No. 344 of
1945 (MCL 125.80).
(c) An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the
Board, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him of her,
that by reason of fact stated in the certificate a stay would, in his or her
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order
which may be granted by the Board or by the circuit court, on
application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and
on due cause shown.

regulations, provisions and restrictions of this chapter, where there is doubt
as to the meaning thereof, and shall determine the location of boundaries
of districts where uncertainty exists after the rules for determining such
boundaries have been applied. Where this chapter provides that uses
similar to those specifically permitted may be permitted in certain districts
and that objectionable uses are prohibited, the Board shall determine
whether or not questionable uses are similar or are objectionable, as the
case may be, in specific instances.

application and notice shall also be provided to all property owners
and occupants of all structures within 300 feet of the property.
Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or by
attorney. The Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify the order, requirement, decision or determination as in its
opinion ought to be made in the premises and to that end shall have
all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. Where
there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way
of carrying out the strict letter of this chapter, the Board shall have
power in passing upon appeals to vary or modify any of its rules,
regulations or provisions relating to the construction, structural
changes in, equipment or alteration of buildings or structures,
including yard, lot area, lot width, lot coverage, open space and
height regulations or the use of land, buildings or structures, so
that substantial justice is done.

shall find such use, height, area, or building or structure
reasonably necessary for the public welfare or public convenience

until the expiration of five days from the date of entry of such order unless
the Board shall find the immediate effect of such order is necessary for
the preservation of property or personal rights and shall so certify on the
record. All variances granted through the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be
valid for six months from the date of final approval and may be transferred
with the ownership of the property. Validation requires the action taken,
permit obtained and/or other process underway.

1:736
(a) Created. In order to execute the purposes declared in this division,
there is hereby created a commission to be called the "Historic District
Commission."
(b) Membership; compensation; removal. The Historic District Commission
shall consist of nine members whose residence is located in the City.
They shall be appointed by the City Council for terms of office of three
years on a staggered-term basis. At least two members of the
Commission shall be appointed from a list of citizens submitted by a
duly organized and existing preservation society. The Commission shall
include, if available, a graduate of an accredited school of architecture
who has two years of architectural experience or who is an architect
registered in this state. A majority of the members of the Commission
shall have a clearly demonstrated interest in and knowledge of historic
preservation. A vacancy occurring in the membership of the
Commission for any cause shall be filled within 60 calendar days by a
person appointed by the City Council for the unexpired term. The
members of the Commission shall serve without compensation. Any
member of the Commission may be removed by vote of the City Council
for inefficiency, neglect of duty, conflict of interest, or malfeasance in
office, after due consideration by the City Council.
(c) Duties and powers. Duties and powers of the Commission shall be as
follows:
(1) It shall be the duty of the Commission to review all plans for the
construction, addition, alteration, repair, moving, excavation or
demolition of structures in the historic district, and it shall have the
power to act upon such plans before a permit for such activity can
be granted. In reviewing the plans, the Commission shall follow the
U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and
Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, as set forth in 36
CFR 67, or their equivalent as approved or established by the State
Historical Center, formerly the Bureau of Michigan History, of the
State Department of History, Arts and Libraries, and shall also give
consideration to the following:
a. The historic or architectural value and significance of the
historic resource and its relationship to the historic value of
the surrounding area.
b. The relationship of the exterior architectural features of such
historic resource to the rest of the resource and to the
surrounding area.
c. The general compatibility of the exterior design, arrangement,
texture and materials proposed to be used.
d. Any other factor, including aesthetics, which it deems
pertinent.
§ 52-580 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 52-580
1:737
(2) The Commission shall review and act upon only exterior features of
a resource and shall not review and act upon interior arrangements
unless specifically authorized to do so by the City Council or unless
interior work will cause visible changes to the exterior of the
historic resource. The Commission shall not disapprove
applications except in regard to considerations as set forth in
Subsection (c)(1) of this section.
(3) The Commission may delegate the issuance of certificates of
appropriateness for specified minor classes of work to its staff, to
the inspector of buildings, or to another delegated authority. The
Commission shall provide to such delegated authorities specific
written standards for issuing the certificates of appropriateness
under this subsection. On at least a quarterly basis, the
Commission shall review the certificates of appropriateness, if any,
issued for work by its staff, the inspector, or another authority to
determine whether or not the delegated responsibilities should be
continued.
(4) If an application is for work that will adversely affect the exterior of
a resource the Commission considers valuable to the City, state, or
nation, and the Commission determines that the alteration or loss
of that resource will adversely affect the public purpose of the City,
state, or nation, the Commission shall attempt to establish with the
owner of the resource an economically feasible plan for
preservation of the resource.
(5) If all efforts by the Commission to preserve a resource fail or if it is
determined by the City Council that public ownership is most
suitable, the City Council, if considered to be in the public interest,
may acquire the resource using public funds, downtown
development association (DDA) funds, public or private gifts,
grants or proceeds from the issuance of revenue bonds. Such an
acquisition shall be based upon the recommendation of the
Commission. The Commission is responsible for maintaining
publicly owned resources using its own funds, if not specifically
designated for other purposes, or public funds committed for that
use by the City Council. Upon recommendation of the Commission,
the City may sell resources acquired under this section with
protective easements included in the property transfer documents,
if appropriate.
(d) Rules. Rules of the Commission are as follows:
(1) The Historic District Commission shall adopt its own rules of
procedure and shall adopt design review standards and guidelines
for resource treatment to carry out its duties under this division.
(2) All meetings of the Commission shall be open to the public, and any
person or his or her duly constituted representative shall be

entitled to appear and be heard on any matter before the
Commission prior to its reaching a decision.
(3) Applicants may file supporting documentation in addition to the
required forms and may be represented by legal counsel. An
applicant may present testimony in support of his or her
application from architects, engineers, or other qualified persons.
If the applicant desires the Commission to consider especially
voluminous testimony, the Commission may require that the
testimony be presented in writing. Two copies of all supporting
documents must be submitted.
(4) Public notice of the time, date and place of meetings shall be given
in the manner required by Public Act No. 267 of 1976 (MCL 15.261
et seq.). A meeting agenda shall be part of the notice and shall
include a listing of each permit application to be reviewed or
considered by the Commission.
(5) The Commission shall keep a record of its resolutions, proceedings,
and actions. A writing prepared, owned, used, in the possession of,
or retained by the Commission in the performance of an official
function shall be made available to the public in compliance with
the Freedom of Information Act, Public Act No. 442 of 1976 (MCL
15.231 through 15.246).
(6) The Commission shall submit an annual report to the City Council
of the general activities of the Commission and shall submit such
special reports as requested by the City Council.
(a) Filing of application. A permit shall be obtained before any work
affecting the exterior appearance of a resource is performed within an
historic district or any work affecting the interior arrangements, if this
work causes visible change to the exterior of the resource. Any person,
individual, partnership, firm, corporation, organization, institution, or
agency of government proposing to do work shall file an application for
a permit with the City Inspection Division. The application shall be
referred together with all required supporting materials that make the
application complete to the Historic District Commission for
consideration at the next regularly scheduled meeting. A permit shall
not be issued and proposed work shall not proceed until the
Commission has acted on the application by issuing a certificate of
appropriateness or a notice to proceed as prescribed in this division.
(b) Contents of application. A complete application shall include the
following:
(1) A completed permit application.
§ 52-580 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 52-581
1:739
(2) A completed Historic District Commission application form,
together with the following:
a. Accurate drawings, photos, color samples, material samples,
or any other exhibits which would be helpful to the
Commission in reviewing the application.
b. Any drawings submitted in support of the application shall be
drawn to scale with accurate dimensions and accurate site
locations. The drawings shall accurately indicate relationships
to adjacent structures; descriptions or samples of colors,
textures, finishes and quality of material to be used on visible
exterior areas.
c. Any other construction documents or samples which the
Commission finds to be necessary for the proper review of the
permit application.
(c) Incomplete applications. If the Historic District Commission application
is incomplete, the Commission shall so inform the applicant and shall
state what additional information and/or documents the Commission
requires to complete the application.
(d) Action upon application. The Historic District Commission shall review
the application according to the duties and powers specified in this
division. In reviewing the application, the Commission must make every
effort to confer with the applicant. No fee shall be charged to process
an application through the Commission beyond the existing Inspection
Division fees. The failure of the Commission to act within 60 calendar
days after the date a complete application is filed with the Commission,
unless an extension is agreed upon in writing by the applicant and the
Commission, shall be considered to constitute approval, and the
Inspection Division shall proceed to process the application as if the
Commission had issued a certificate of appropriateness or a notice to
proceed.
(e) Approval of application. If the Commission finds such proposed work
appropriate, it shall issue a certificate of appropriateness
determination which is to be signed by the Planning Director, attached
to the application for a building permit, application, and all submitted
documentation, and immediately transmitted to the Inspection Division.
After the certificate of appropriateness determination has been issued
and the building permit granted to the applicant, the City Inspection
Division shall inspect the work permitted and shall take such action as
is necessary to enforce compliance with the approved plans. Approval
of the permit shall be in addition to any other building, plumbing,
electrical or mechanical permit required by ordinance or state law.
(f) Denial of application. If the Commission finds proposed work
inappropriate, it shall issue a denial determination and shall state its
reasons for doing so and shall transmit a record of such action and
reasons therefor in writing to the Inspection Division and to the
§ 52-581 PORT HURON CODE § 52-581
1:740
§ 52-582. Appeals. [Code 1992, § 32-735; 2-22-1999 by Ord. No.
1157; 5-24-2010 by Ord. No. 1311]
applicant. The Commission may suggest appropriate alternatives to the
applicant if it issues a denial. The applicant may make modifications
to the permit application and shall have the right to resubmit the
application at any time after so doing. A denial of an application shall
be binding on the Planning Department, Building Inspector or any such
other relevant authority, and a permit shall not be issued. A denial of an
application shall also include a notice to the applicant of the rights of
appeal.
(g) Repair or ordinary maintenance and prior permit work. Nothing in this
division shall be construed to prevent repair or ordinary maintenance,
as defined in § 52-777, of a resource within the historic district or to
prevent work on any resource under a permit issued by the City
Inspection Division before the enactment of the ordinance from which
this division is derived.
(h) Notice to proceed. Work within an historic district which may otherwise
be inappropriate may be permitted through the issuance of a notice to
proceed determination by the Commission if any of the following
conditions prevail and if the proposed work is found by the Commission
to be necessary to substantially improve or correct any of the following:
(1) The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or the
occupants of a structure;
(2) The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program which
will be of substantial benefit to the community and the applicant
proposing the work has obtained all necessary planning and zoning
approvals, financing and environmental clearances;
(3) Retention of the resources would cause undue financial hardship to
the owner when a governmental action, an act of God, or other
events beyond the owner's control created the hardship, and all
feasible alternatives to eliminate the financial hardship, which may
include offering the resource for sale at its fair market value or
moving the resource to a vacant site within the historic district,
have been attempted and exhausted by the owner; or
(4) Retention of the resource would not be in the interests of the
majority of the community.
(a) Any applicant aggrieved by a decision of the Commission may file an
appeal with the State Historic Preservation Review Board of the State
Historic Preservation Office. The appeal shall be filed within 60 days
after the decision is furnished to the applicant.
(b) An applicant aggrieved by the decision of the State Historic
Preservation Review Board may appeal the decision to the county
circuit court having jurisdiction over the Historic District Commission's

§ 52-583. Demolition by neglect. [Code 1992, § 32-736; 2-22-1999
by Ord. No. 1157]
Upon a finding by the Historic District Commission that a historic resource
either in a historic district or in a proposed historic district which is subject
to Commission review pursuant to the terms of § 52-586 is threatened by
demolition by neglect, the Commission may do either of the following:
§ 52-584. Failure to obtain permit. [Code 1992, § 32-737; 2-22-1999
by Ord. No. 1157]
decision that was appealed to the State Historic Preservation Review
Board. Such applicant may only appeal to the county circuit court after
appealing to the State Historic Preservation Review Board.
(c) In addition, any citizen or duly organized historic preservation
organization in the City, other than the resource property owner, jointly
or severally aggrieved by a decision of the Commission may appeal the
decision to the county circuit court.
(1) Require the owner of the resource to repair all conditions contributing
to demolition by neglect; or
(2) If the owner does not make the repairs within a reasonable time, the
Commission or its agents may enter the property and make such repairs
as are necessary to prevent demolition by neglect. The cost of the work
shall be charged to the owner and may be levied as a special
assessment against the property. The Commission or its agents may
enter the property for purposes of this section upon obtaining an order
from the county circuit court.
(a) When work has been done upon a historic resource without a permit
and the Historic District Commission finds that the work does not
qualify for a certificate of appropriateness, the Commission may require
an owner to restore the resource to the condition the resource was in
before the inappropriate work or to modify the work so that it qualifies
for a certificate of appropriateness.
(b) If the owner does not comply with the restoration or modification
requirement within a reasonable time, the Commission may seek an
order from the county circuit court to require the owner to restore the
resource to its former condition or to modify the work so that it qualifies
for a certificate of appropriateness.
(c) If the owner does not comply or cannot comply with the order of the
court, the Commission or its agents may enter the property and conduct
work necessary to restore the resource to its former condition or modify
the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness in
accordance with the court's order. The cost of the work shall be charged
to the owner and may be levied by the City as a special assessment
against the property. When acting pursuant to such order of the county

§ 52-602. Applicability. [12-8-2003 by Ord. No. 1220]
The standards of this division apply to driveway access areas within the
City corporate limits along the M-25/Pine Grove roadway from Scott Avenue
(south) to Krafft Road (north) through the site plan review. The driveway
standards in this division may be more restrictive than other standards of
the City and the State Department of Transportation (MDOT), which have
jurisdiction within the right-of-way. Construction within the public right-ofway
under the jurisdiction of the county or the MDOT must also meet the
permit requirements of the county or MDOT. Where any conflicts arise, the
more stringent standard shall apply. The standards of this division shall
apply during new construction or redevelopment of a vacant lot or the
reconstruction of an existing commercial building that has been vacant for
more than six months.
§ 52-603. Definitions. [12-8-2003 by Ord. No. 1220]
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the
context clearly indicates a different meaning:
DRIVEWAY — Any vehicular access except those serving one dwelling unit
or serving just an essential public service structure.
(a) The intent of this division is to establish standards for driveway spacing
and the number of driveways for application during the site plan review
process for new construction and/or redevelopment and to encourage
access management.
(b) The procedures and standards of this division are intended to:
(1) Promote safe and efficient travel within the designated M-25
corridor within the City as described;
(2) Minimize disruptive and potentially hazardous traffic conflicts;
(3) Separate traffic conflict areas by reducing the number of
driveways;
(4) Provide efficient spacing standards between driveways and
between driveways and intersections;
(5) Implement recommendations of the master plan;
(6) Protect the substantial public investment in the street system; and
(7) Ensure reasonable access to properties, though not always the
most direct access.

movement of traffic, to provide adequate sight distance, and to provide
the most favorable driveway grade.
(b) Driveways, including the radii but not including turn lanes and tapers,
shall be located entirely within the right-of-way frontage, unless
otherwise approved by the City and the MDOT and upon written
certification from the adjacent property owner agreeing to such
encroachment.
(a) Minimum spacing requirements between a proposed commercial
driveway and an intersection either adjacent or on the opposite side of
the street may be set on a case-by-case basis but in no instance shall be
less than the distances listed in this section. The following
measurements are from the near edge of the proposed driveway,

(a) Where noted in § 52-606, or where the City determines that reducing
the number of access points may have a beneficial impact on traffic
operations and safety while preserving the property owner's right to
reasonable access, a shared commercial driveway, frontage road, or
rear service drive connecting two or more properties or uses may be
required. In particular, service drives may be required where
recommended in the master plan or any subarea master plans; near
existing traffic signals or near locations having potential for future
signalization; along major arterial roadways with high traffic volumes;
along segments with a relatively high number of accidents or limited
sight distance.

access easement recorded with the county registrar of deeds.
(c) The number of access points along a service road shall be according to
the standards of this division. The City may allow temporary access
where the service road is not completed if a performance bond or other
financial guarantee is provided which ensures elimination of the
temporary access upon completion of the service road.
(a) Location. Service roads shall be parallel or perpendicular to the front
property line and may be located either in front of, adjacent to, or
behind principal buildings. In considering the most appropriate
alignment for a service road, the City shall consider the setbacks of
existing buildings, anticipated traffic flow for the site, and other related
ordinances.
(b) Access easement. The service road shall be within an access easement
permitting traffic circulation between properties. This easement shall
be 66 feet wide, except an access easement parallel to a public street
right-of-way may be 40 feet wide, if approved by the City. The required
width shall remain free and clear of obstructions.
(c) Construction and materials. Service roads shall have a base, pavement
and curb and gutter in accordance with City standards for public

circulation and may not be used as a parking space or maneuvering
aisle.
(e) Access to service road. The City shall approve the location of all
accesses to the service road, based on the driveway spacing standards
of this division.
(f) Elevation. The site plan shall indicate the proposed elevation of the
service road at the property line and the Department of Public Works
shall maintain a record of all service road elevations so that their
grades can be coordinated.
(g) Landscaping. The area between a service road and the public street
right-of-way shall be a landscaped greenbelt.

Residential Rental Restriction Overlay Districts
§ 52-641. Residential Rental Restriction Overlay Districts
established. [12-16-2013 by Ord. No. 1361]
Residential Rental Restriction Overlay Districts "RO-1" are hereby
established.
§ 52-642. Purpose and objectives. [12-16-2013 by Ord. No. 1361]
§ 52-643. Uses permitted. [12-16-2013 by Ord. No. 1361]
Uses permitted in the Residential Rental Restriction Overlay District RO-1
are as follows:
(a) The Residential Rental Restriction Overlay District RO-1 is a zoning
classification which permits owners of property within R-1 Residential
Zoning Districts to petition City Council to establish an overlay district,
and district use regulations in their residential neighborhood, which
would prohibit or restrict the rental uses of single-family dwellings
within the neighborhood. These districts establish restrictions which
operate to preserve the attractiveness, desirability and privacy of
residential neighborhoods by precluding all or certain types of rental
properties and thereby preclude the deleterious effects rental
properties can have on a neighborhood with regard to property
deterioration, increased density, congestion, crime, noise and traffic
levels and reduction of property values. The goal of the overlay district
is to allow owners of property within residential neighborhoods to
control the types of rental properties, if any, that are permitted in onefamily
dwellings within their neighborhood.
(b) It is also the purpose of the districts to achieve the following objectives:
(1) To protect the privacy of residents and to minimize noise,
congestion and nuisance impacts by regulating the types of rental
properties;
(2) To maintain an attractive community appearance and to provide a
desirable living environment for residents by preserving the owneroccupied
character of the neighborhood; and
(3) To prevent excessive traffic and parking problems in the
neighborhoods.
(1) In Residential Rental Restriction Overlay District RO-1 that overlaps a
portion of a district zoned as an R-1 District (Single- and Two-Family
Residential), permitted uses are all uses permitted in the underlying
zoning district except the use or occupancy of a single-family dwelling
unit as a rental unit within the meaning of § 10-152 et seq. of the City
Code is prohibited and a single-family dwelling converted into a twofamily
dwelling unit after the introduction of an ordinance to create

§ 52-644. Procedures to establish a Residential Rental Restriction
Overlay District RO-1. [12-16-2013 by Ord. No. 1361]
The following procedures must be complied with in order to establish a
Residential Rental Restriction Overlay District:
said overlay district, may not be used or occupied as a rental unit within
the meaning of § 10-152 et seq.
(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the overlay restriction does not impact
properties that already have a valid rental certification, as such will be
considered a preexisting nonconforming use and will be
"grandfathered." However, if a property owner allows a rental
certification to remain expired more than 12 months, then the property
would lose any prior legal, nonconforming grandfathering and the
property will be subject to the restrictions set forth in § 52-643(1) and/
or § 52-645(b).
(1) A petition requesting an overlay district must be submitted to the City
Clerk on forms provided by the City Clerk. The petition requirements
are as follows:
a. The proposed boundaries of the overlay district must be entirely
within an R-1 Zoning District and the parcels within the proposed
district must be contiguous.
b. There must be at least 50 separate lots or parcels within the
proposed district as described in the petition or the proposed
district must constitute a discrete neighborhood geographic area.
c. The proposed boundaries may not overlap a boundary of existing
overlay districts or the boundary of an overlay district that is
already the subject of an introduced ordinance pursuant to this
section.
d. The petition must identify the specific overlay district that is sought
by specifying the proposed boundary of the overlay district. The
proposed boundaries of the overlay district must be described in
the petition and the boundaries must, if practicable, consist of
streets, alleys, platted subdivision boundaries or existing zoning
district lines which totally enclose the proposed district.
e. The petition must accurately advise the signer of the rental
restriction that would be imposed on the property if the overlay
district is established.
f. Each petition must be circulated by a person who owns property
within the proposed district and be signed by the circulator.
g. The petition must contain the signature and address of two-thirds
of the parcel owners within the proposed boundary of the overlay
district, exclusive of public property. Jointly owned parcels will be
§ 52-643 PORT HURON CODE § 52-644
1:758
considered owned by a single person for purpose of petitioning,
and any co-owner may sign a petition for such parcel. Only one
owner of each parcel will count towards the two-thirds
requirement. If a person owns more than one parcel of property
within the proposed district, they may sign the petition for each
parcel they own.
h. Each person signing the petition must also enter on the petition,
adjacent to their signature, the date that the person signed the
petition and the address of the parcel they own.
i. When submitted, no signature dated earlier than six months prior
to the time the petition is filed with the City Clerk shall be counted
in determining the validity of the petition.
(2) Upon presentation to the City Clerk for review, the Clerk shall verify the
signatures and dates on the petitions. If insufficient signatures are
presented, the Clerk shall return the petitions to the person filing the
petitions and identify the valid and invalid signatures. If sufficient valid
signatures are presented, the Clerk shall refer the petitions to the
Zoning Department which shall then, within 30 days, determine
whether the petitions are in conformity with the remaining conditions
of this section.
a. If the petition is determined to be in conformity with the
requirements of this section, the Planning Director shall draft an
appropriate ordinance in accordance with the petition procedures
set forth in § 52-126. All procedures set forth in § 52-126 for zoning
changes by petition shall thereafter be followed.
b. If the petition is not in conformity with the requirements of this
section, the Planning Director shall reject the petition and return it
to the Clerk with a written explanation as to why the petition does
not meet the requirements of this section. The Clerk shall then
forward the petitions, and the explanation, to the person who filed
the petitions.
c. If the petition is rejected for failure to comply with the boundary
requirements, it may be resubmitted with the proper boundary
lines if it is accompanied by certification that a copy of the petition
and written notice was mailed to each property affected by the
change, notifying them that their property was either added to or
deleted from the petition and if by the correction of the boundary
line the petition still meets all other requirements of the code.
d. If the petition is rejected for an insufficient number of valid
signatures, it may be resubmitted with the additional signatures
necessary to have it comply as long as the other signatures remain
valid.
e. If an ordinance is forwarded to City Council pursuant to this
section, after consideration of the petition and the

recommendations of the Planning Commission, if any, the City
Council may make additions or changes in the boundaries of the
proposed overlay district to prevent spot zoning, to include or
exclude areas that logically should have been included or excluded
in the petition, to make the boundaries of the proposed overlay
district abut boundary lines of other zoning districts and overlay
districts, and to adopt an alternate ordinance in conformity with
the suggested changes whether or not the two-thirds majority
requirement of property owners would still be met with the
proposed changes.
f. If the City Council, in adopting an ordinance for an overlay district,
applies the ordinance to fewer parcels of property than the petition
sought, the owners of at least two-thirds of the parcels remaining in
the overlay district must have signed the original petition.
(3) Subsequent to the introduction of an ordinance proposing to establish a
Residential Rental Restriction Overlay District, the circulator(s) of the
petition for the overlay district or a majority of those persons who
signed the petition for an overlay district may file a written request with
the City Council to table consideration or further proceedings toward
the adoption of the ordinance for 60 days in order to allow the
submission of an alternate petition for a modification of the boundaries
of a proposed overlay district. If such a petition is submitted during the
sixty-day period, City Council may introduce an alternate ordinance in
conformity with the subsequent petition, and the ordinances shall, to
the extent possible, be processed simultaneously. In such a case, the
Planning Commission shall include in its recommendations which
ordinance it concludes, after public hearing, has the majority of the
support of the property owners in the proposed districts.
(4) No earlier than one year after the adoption of an ordinance establishing
an overlay district, a petition for a change or removal of the overlay
district may be submitted by following the procedures for establishing
an initial overlay district.
(a) Upon introduction of an ordinance to create an overlay district and at
all times while the ordinance is pending final decision, except as
provided in § 10-178, there shall be a moratorium on the issuance of
initial rental unit certifications to the extent that no initial rental
housing certification shall be issued within the proposed overlay district
to the owner of a single-family dwelling unit that would be precluded if
the overlay district was adopted, or a single-family dwelling converted
into a two-family dwelling unit after the introduction of an ordinance to
create said overlay district, regardless of whether the license was
applied for prior to or subsequent to the ordinance's introduction. If
more than one ordinance is pending seeking alternate types of overlay
districts pursuant to § 52-644(3), no initial certification shall be issued
§ 52-644 PORT HURON CODE § 52-645
1:760
§ 52-646. through § 52-660. (Reserved)
within the proposed district that would be precluded if the most
restrictive ordinance was adopted, regardless of whether the
certification was applied for prior to or subsequent to the ordinance's
introduction.
(b) Upon passage of an ordinance by City Council establishing an overlay
district, except as provided in § 10-178, no initial rental unit
certification shall be issued to an owner of property in the overlay
district inconsistent with the restrictions of the overlay district and it
shall be unlawful to use or allow any property to be used except in
conformity with the requirements of the underlying zoning district and
overlay district. Any property in the overlay district that has an existing
rental housing certification, or has had a rental certification within one
year of adoption of the overlay district, shall be allowed to continue its
use and occupancy in accordance with the law existing prior to the date
of the adoption of the overlay district. No existing rental housing use or
occupancy in an overlay district shall be considered to be a
nonconforming use as the result of adoption of an overlay district unless
the rental license expires for more than one year. If an owner
surrenders an existing certification or allows, either intentionally or
unintentionally, a license to remain expired for more than one year, any
subsequent use of the property shall be subject to the restrictions
imposed by the overlay district.
(c) Except as set forth in § 52-644(3), if an ordinance introduced pursuant
to this section is denied, a subsequent ordinance for an overlay district
that includes the same parcels may not be introduced for one year
following introduction of the previous ordinance.
(d) Any ordinance which is not adopted within six months of its
introduction shall be deemed denied unless the ordinance was tabled or
otherwise delayed for 60 days pursuant to § 52-644(3), in which case it
shall be deemed denied if not adopted within eight months of its
introduction.

to the main structure and be similar in style and construction as the
main structure.
(2) Accessory buildings shall only be erected in a side yard or rear yard and
shall not be closer than three feet to any side lot line or rear lot line.
This may be waived for double-frontage lots as provided in Subsection
(6) of this section.
(3) An accessory building shall not exceed one story or 15 feet in height
(see definition of "height, building"), and in no instance shall the
accessory building exceed the ground floor area of the main building. If
an attic is provided, it shall be used for storage purposes only and shall

for story, half).
(4) No detached accessory building shall be located closer than 10 feet to
any dwelling on the same lot on which the accessory building is to be
constructed.

which is substantially a continuation of the front lot line of the lot to its
rear, such building shall not project beyond the front of the residence
located on the lot to the rear of such corner lot.
(6) For double-frontage lots, accessory buildings shall observe front yard
requirements on both street frontages or be built in-line with existing
adjacent structures. An accessory building can be located between the
main structure and the street, provided it meets front yard setback

storage and automobile storage (garage), the two areas shall be
clearly defined. Each area shall be constructed as a separate
building and shall meet the requirements for such building.
(8) A garage, boathouse, storage, or any other accessory building shall not
be erected upon a lot in any residential district without a residential
structure existing on the same lot. If an accessory building is to be
constructed on a vacant lot adjacent to a residence, the lots shall be
combined and all requirements for an accessory building shall be met
before a building permit shall be issued. A fence may be constructed
per zoning requirements on a vacant lot without a main structure.
(9) In all residential districts, an accessory building shall be owned by the
property owner who owns the property and the dwelling upon which
the accessory building is located. The accessory building can only be

use permit from Planning Commission. In the M-1 or M-2 Zones,
storage pods or trailers used for accessory storage for the owner or
tenant, located on the same property as an existing building, may be
allowed with approval from the Planning Director. Storage pods or
trailers shall be subject to the size and setback regulations for an
accessory structure. An approved rental storage facility in the C-1, M-1,
or M-2 Zone may use storage pods or trailers as an accessory use to the
storage facility.

requirements. A carport can be placed between the house and the
property line, provided the carport meets the front yard setbacks.
(15) A playhouse, playscape, or treehouse shall be considered an accessory
building. A playscape is a grouping of playground equipment connected
together to create one play structure. Due to its size and character, it

approved for storage or maintenance of RVs or OHRVs.
(2) RVs or OHRVs may be parked in any approved parking area on the
premises for loading or unloading purposes for a period not to exceed
48 hours.

property, shall be located on the property, subject to the following:
a. From November 1 to April 30, only in the rear yard, or interior side
yard, three feet from the rear and side property lines, and not
beyond the front of the dwelling. If parked on a corner lot in a side
yard that faces a street, the setback must be 12.5 feet from the
street side yard property line. If there is a neighboring dwelling to
the rear that faces the street on that side yard, then the RV or
OHRV must be set back in line with the front of the neighboring
dwelling. The RV or OHRV shall not project beyond the front of the
residence located on the lot to the rear of such corner lot. For lots
on the water with double frontage, an RV or OHRV may be parked
between the street and the dwelling, provided it is not parked

(4) There shall be compliance with all county and state ordinances and
statutes and Chapter 38, Solid Waste and Recycling.
(5) A refuse container, or dumpster, must be located a minimum of 20 feet

(a) A home occupation is an activity carried out for gainful purposes by a
resident of the dwelling and conducted as a customarily incidental use
to the dwelling unit.
(b) For this chapter, there shall be two distinct types of home occupation:
passive and active home occupations.
(1) Passive home occupations. Passive home occupations shall not
require any client or customer traffic to visit the home. This type of
home occupation shall be allowed in any residential district without
special approval. Examples of a passive home occupation would be
an office of a salesperson who makes telephone calls to clients or
goes out to visit the client.
(2) Active home occupations. Active home occupations generate
customer traffic to the home, and active use shall require a special
approval use permit from the Planning Commission and City
Council. Examples of an active home occupation would be an office
of a tax preparer who receives clients to the home.
§ 52-694 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 52-695
1:783
Certain active home occupations do not require a special permit
from the Planning Commission as the state guarantees them by
right to be allowed in a residential district. These home
occupations allowed by state law are those occupations in
"instruction of the crafts or fine arts." For example a tutor in
mathematics, a music instructor, or a piano teacher is allowed as
a home occupation and can receive clients at the home without
a special permit. Such instructional occupation shall still be
governed by the conditions and criteria for a home occupation as
it is listed in this section and is limited to the hours of operation,
number of students, etc.
(c) Within a community, certain limited home occupation uses can be useful
to both the general community as well as the resident proprietor. There
is a need for some citizens to use their place of residence for limited
nonresidential activities; however, the need to protect the integrity of a
residential area is of primary concern. It is the intent of this chapter to:
(1) Allow freedom of the individual property owner, yet not infringe
upon the security of the community's interest or restrict the
greater good of the public.
(2) Ensure compatibility of such home occupation with other permitted
uses of a residential district.
(3) Retain the residential character of the neighborhood involved.
(4) Defend the privacy of surrounding residents and not create an
inappropriate atmosphere for family life.
(5) Protect the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the adjacent
residents.
(6) Guarantee all residents freedom from excessive noise, excessive
traffic, nuisance, fire hazard, and other possible effects of
commercial uses being conducted in residential areas.
(d) All home occupations, both passive and active, must meet the following
conditions and criteria:
(1) Only members of the immediate family on the premises may be
employed by such occupation.
(2) Such use shall be clearly incidental and secondary to the dwelling
for dwelling purposes. The primary function of the premises shall
be that of the residence of the family, and the occupation shall not
exceed 10% of any one floor of the principal building.
(3) No more than one home occupation shall be permitted within any
single dwelling unit.
(4) All activity shall be operated in its entirety within the preexisting
dwelling and not within any garage or accessory building located
§ 52-695 PORT HURON CODE § 52-695
1:784
upon the premises, except for incidental storage which may be
allowed within a residential-type garage upon the premises. The
warehousing of retail or wholesale merchandise is prohibited.
There shall be no outside storage or processing.
(5) No toxic, explosive, flammable, combustible, corrosive, etiologic,
radioactive, or other restricted materials shall be used or stored on
the site.
(6) No activity is allowed which would constitute a nuisance to
surrounding property or which would endanger the health, safety,
and welfare of any other persons residing in that area by reason of
noise, noxious odors, smoke, fumes, dust, heat, vibrations,
unsanitary or unsightly conditions, fire hazards, electrical
disturbances, night lighting, glare, and the like which is noticeable
at or beyond the property line or beyond the walls of the dwelling
unit if the unit is part of a multifamily structure.
(7) Such home occupation shall be in compliance with all City, county,
and state codes, laws, and regulations.
(8) Such use shall not require internal or external alterations or
construction other than that which may be required to meet City,
county or state safety or construction code standards as authorized
by the City.
(9) There shall be no signage, advertising, or product displayed which
is visible from the street or adjacent property.
(10)No external evidence of such home occupation shall be allowed
indicating from the exterior that it is being used for anything but a
dwelling.
(11)No sale or rental of goods shall be allowed on the premises. Any
goods produced on the premises must be sold off the premises.
Samples, not produced on the premises, may be displayed but not
sold on the premises. No food or beverages shall be sold on the
premises.
(12) Customers for the active home occupation shall be accommodated
on an appointment basis. Walk-in business, where the premises is
generally open to customers without an appointment, shall not be
allowed. Business shall be conducted from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.
There shall be a limit of six customers per day, and the business
shall not service more than one client or customer at a time on the
premises.
(13) Traffic and parking shall be in accordance with the following:
a. Adequate off-street parking shall be provided on site for
residents and customers.
§ 52-695 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 52-695
1:785
b. Paving of any yard area other than normal driveway areas to
accommodate parking for home occupations is prohibited.
c. The home occupation shall not generate a volume or character
of pedestrian or vehicular traffic beyond that normally
generated by homes in the residential neighborhood.
d. Only deliveries normally and reasonably occurring for a
residence shall be made to the home. Delivery vehicles shall
not restrict traffic circulation.
(14) When applying for a special permit for a home occupation, there
shall be no violation against a property or dwelling before such
residence may be issued a special permit for such home
occupation.
(15) Activities specifically prohibited include small engine repair, repair
or service of motor vehicles and other large equipment, and service
or manufacturing processes which would normally require
industrial zoning. The use of equipment or machinery industrial in
nature is prohibited. Only mechanical equipment ordinarily used
for residential, domestic, or household purposes or as deemed
similar to power and type is allowed.
(16) A personal service business requiring physical contact with the
client or a service which is directly performed on or to the client's
body is not considered a home occupation by this chapter.
(17) Any advertising of the home occupation may include the telephone
number, but shall not carry the residential address of such
occupation in order to prevent walk-in customers without
appointment.
(18)Home occupations which have been granted a special permit are
not transferable to the following:
a. Subsequent occupants of the residence.
b. A different residence if the occupant relocates.
(19) Such other reasonable conditions and limitations may be imposed
by the Planning Commission to protect nearby residential premises
and persons.
(20)No home occupation shall involve the care or treatment of animals
or pets.
(21) Some business or professional offices may be used as a home
occupation. It will be the final decision of the Planning Department
to determine what types of offices qualify as a home occupation.
These offices normally serve one client at a time and customer
traffic is minimal. A "home occupation" office shall be the location
where the business owner lives and the office is a minor use. The
§ 52-695 PORT HURON CODE § 52-695
1:786
following offices may be considered a home occupation, provided
all of the regulations of a passive and active home occupation
apply:
a. Typing or secretarial services.
b. Bookkeeping, accounting, or tax preparation services.
c. Home office of a sales representative such as Avon, Mary Kay,
Amway, etc.
d. Insurance agent.
e. Real estate agent.
f. Architect or engineer.
The following offices cannot be considered as home
occupations:
a. Medical office of a doctor, dentist, chiropractor, etc.
b. Veterinarian office or clinic.
c. Office of a physical therapist or massage therapist.
(22) Any home occupation which consists of an occupation which must
be state or federally licensed must first obtain such license before
the home occupation permit can be granted.
(23) Following is a list of examples of home occupations, which is not
intended to limit the kinds of home occupations that can comply
with the conditions of this section:
a. Seamstress.
b. Handicrafts.
c. Typing, secretarial services.
d. Bookkeeping, accounting services.
e. Tutoring and/or instruction of the crafts or fine arts, limited to
one student at a time (does not require a special permit).
f. Home office of a sales representative.
(24) Following is a list of examples of what is not considered a home
occupation by this chapter due to the fact that, by the nature of the
investment or operation, it has a pronounced tendency once started
to rapidly increase beyond the limits permitted for home
occupations and thereby impairs the use and value of a
residentially zoned area for residence purposes and is more suited
to professional or business districts. This list is not intended to limit
the kinds of uses which are deemed not to comply with the
conditions of this section:

The purpose of this section is to establish general minimum standards
regarding landscape plans as part of the site plan review process; enhance
the City's environmental and visual character; preserve or stabilize
ecological concerns with development needs; maintain a healthy
environment, mitigate pollution, and provide natural and aesthetically
pleasing buffers between conflicting land uses; protect public and private

living quarters of the main dwelling is above the garage. This living
space above the garage must not be a separate residential dwelling unit
and must be accessed through the main part of the house not through
a set of stairs in the garage. The roof of the attached garage cannot be
more than three feet higher than the roof peak of the dwelling unless
part of the living space of the main dwelling is built as a second story
over the garage. Garage width may not exceed more than 60% of the
home's front facade width.
(5) Garage walls are to be no more than 10 feet high excluding the portion
of the wall within a gable end. The roof height may not extend more
than three feet above the roof peak of the dwelling. Exception is noted
for those structures that are attached garages with a portion of the
principle structure's living space constructed above the garage.

parking pads to be adjacent to the alley rather than the street frontage
is preferred.
(7) The original scale, proportions, lines and exterior construction
materials of the surrounding environment shall be respected,
compatible and enhanced.
(8) Front entrances and porches must include design elements that are
similar in scale, height and design to those on original existing

"Livestock" means that term as defined in the Animal Industry Act of 1987,
Public Act No. 466 of 1988 (MCL 287.701 through 287.747).
(10) For those uses requiring greater than 20 parking spaces, there shall be
a landscape plan which shows plantings and groups of plantings that
buffer the parking lot areas from adjacent uses. Such a landscape plan
shall include a mixture of planting material appropriate for the space,
so as to not create a visual/safety barrier. Such plan shall be approved
by the Planning Department. Parking lot landscaping shall be no less
than five feet in any single dimension and shall be protected from
parking areas with curbing, or other permanent means to prevent
vehicular encroachment onto landscaped areas. This parking lot
requirement is in addition to landscaping required to comply with the
parking lot screening requirement.
(a) A building permit and/or electrical permit shall be required for all
residential antennas except satellite dish antennas less than three feet
in diameter which are intended for receipt of television or
communication signals.
(b) All antennas and satellite dishes are only allowed in the side or rear
yard. They may not be placed on an easement. The minimum setback
requirement from the side and rear property line is three feet. This
setback shall also pertain to any guy wires to secure the antenna or any
stabilization device the antenna may require. Guy wires shall be firmly
secured to the ground only or the roof of the house if said antenna is
roof mounted.
(c) Satellite dish antennas may be ground, roof, or wall mounted to the
main or accessory building on the property but only along the side or
rear yard. When attached to a building, the dish must be secured
according to the requirements of the City building code. Residential
satellite dishes may not exceed three feet in diameter. The outer edge of
a satellite dish shall be at the setback line, not the pole upon which it is
mounted.
(d) In the R, R-1 and A-1 Districts, domestic radio and television antennas
cannot extend higher than 12 feet above the height limit of the zoning
district in which it is located. In all other districts, the height may not

§ 52-703. Alternative energy devices. [10-22-2007 by Ord. No. 1280;
1-11-2010 by Ord. No. 1305]
To help offset the increasing costs of electricity and heat supplied by fossil
fuels, many property owners may wish to have alternative forms of energy.
This may be accomplished in a number of ways. Due to the close proximity
of buildings within a City, it has been deemed necessary to allow only
certain types of alternative energy devices to be placed on properties and
to have restrictions on these devices for safety and security purposes. The
devices allowed are:
(1) Solar panels. Solar energy is a source of energy that uses radiation
emitted by the sun. A solar panel is a device that collects and converts
solar energy into electricity or heat.
a. Solar energy panels and roof shingles are allowed in all zoning
districts.
b. Solar panels may not be placed on any side of a house or building
facing the street. Panels may only be placed flush along the walls or
roof of a structure and shall be in placed in accordance with the
rules and regulations of Division 16, Schedule of Regulations, in
regards to setbacks, heights, etc., per the district that the panels
are located. The panels may be placed on an accessory building.
Accessory buildings must be built per the requirements of § 52-676.
Solar panel grids on a ground pole may be installed in C-1, CBD, I,
M-1, and M-2 Districts. The size and height are not to exceed
regulations obtained from the Inspection Division.
c. Panels may not be placed so as to reflect glare into any neighboring
property or the street.
(2) Wind turbine. A wind turbine or wind energy conversion system means
any device which converts wind energy to mechanical or electrical
energy.
a. Wind turbine towers are allowed in any zoning district, provided
the property size is a minimum of two or more acres of land. A site
plan indicating the location of the turbine and any ancillary
equipment shall be located on the drawing.
b. The setback of the tower must be equal to the height of the tower
(the distance from the base of the tower to the top of the unit) plus
1/2 the rotor (blade) diameter or within an engineered fall zone.
c. Maximum height of the wind turbine tower shall be that of the
zoning district in which it is located and shall comply with all
Federal Aviation Administration and Michigan Airport Zoning Act
(PA 23 of 1950, MCL 259.431 et seq.) requirements. Wind turbine
§ 52-702 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 52-703
1:799
towers of up to a maximum height of 90 feet shall be allowed
in open areas in excess of two acres and with engineered,
professionally sealed construction plans and proper permits from
the Building Official.
d. The minimum distance between the ground and the blades shall be
20 feet as measured at the lowest point of the arc of the blades.
e. Wind turbines shall have an automatic braking, governing, or a
feathering system to prevent uncontrolled rotation or over
speeding. The maximum wind speed the wind turbine can operate
without incurring structural damage or functioning abnormally
shall be at least 80 mph.
f. All wind towers shall have lightning protection. [6-26-2017 by
Ord. No. 17-005]
g. If a tower is supported by guy wires, the wires shall be clearly
visible to a height of at least six feet above the guy wire anchors.
h. The tower, and any auxiliary mechanical equipment, shall be
enclosed with a six-foot fence unless the base of the tower is not
climbable for a distance of 12 feet.
i. Wind turbines may have a vertical or horizontal rotor.
j. Roof-mount wind turbines are allowed in all zoned districts and
must be installed according to industry standards with engineered,
professionally sealed construction plans and applicable building
codes. Roof-mount turbines may be affixed to the roof of either a
primary structure or an accessory structure and placed so as not to
be easily visible from the front public view. Roof-mount turbines
may not exceed a height of four feet above the rooftop.
(3) Outdoor burning devices. A burning device is any apparatus or
appliance, other than a barbecue grill, that burns a material such as
wood, corn, pellets, waste materials, compost, vegetable oils,
automotive waste oil/fuel, water, or similar material for the purpose of
creating energy and is not located within the walls of the main dwelling
or main structure. Outdoor burning devices for the purpose of
alternative fuel to heat industrial, commercial, or residential structures
is not allowed.
(4) General requirements for any alternative energy device and ancillary
equipment:
a. Any alternative energy device, or ancillary equipment, must be
installed in compliance with all local building, electrical, heating
and plumbing, fire, and zoning codes. A building permit and
appropriate electrical, HVAC, or plumbing permits must be
obtained. Any structural designs must be signed and sealed by a
§ 52-703 PORT HURON CODE § 52-703
1:800
§ 52-704. through § 52-730. (Reserved)
professional, certified engineer. When placing equipment on the
roof of a structure, a load design must be approved.
b. No noise shall be created by any device or ancillary equipment that
can be measured at the property line to exceed 63 decibels.
c. The placement of any device shall not interfere with the reception,
transmission, or broadcast of radio, television, microwave, wireless
or other personal communication systems.
d. The location of any alternative energy device shall not create any
immediate or future danger for any adjacent properties or persons.
e. All equipment must be certified and tested by the Underwriters'
Laboratories, Inc., or other such applicable independent
accrediting agency.
f. If there is a proposed interface with a utility company's existing
grid, if applicable, there shall be a notification in writing given to
that utility company affected prior to the installation of such
interface. A copy of such notification shall be given to the City and
kept on file with all permits.
g. All alternative energy apparatus shall be kept in good repair and
sound condition. Any equipment which has been abandoned or not
utilized for a period of one year shall be dismantled and removed
from the property within 60 days of written notice from the City to
remove.

building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at
the time of adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived
or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
(4) If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure or structure and premises may be changed to another
nonconforming use, provided that the proposed use is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing
nonconforming use. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed
to a conforming use or to a use permitted in a district of greater
restrictions, it shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use.
(5) Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the entire structure shall
eliminate the nonconforming status of land.
(1) No such nonconforming structure's footprint may be enlarged or

(a) In any zoning district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other sections of this chapter, a
new single-family dwelling and customary accessory building may be
erected on any vacant lot which is a lot of record, existing at the
effective date of this ordinance (January 28, 2006), provided said lot of
record is a minimum of 50 feet in width and 5,000 square feet in area.
The placement of the dwelling on the lot must meet all other zoning
restrictions in regard to yard setbacks and lot coverage, etc.
(b) Any single lot of record, that is owned separately from an adjacent lot,
which is 40 feet wide to 49 feet wide and a minimum of 100 feet in
depth must obtain a zoning variance before the lot is buildable for a
new single-family dwelling.
(c) Any lot of record less than 40 feet wide is not buildable and a zoning
variance may not be obtained.
(d) In any instance, on a nonconforming lot of any width, the yard setbacks
for the structures, lot coverage, and other requirements, not involving
area or width or both of the lot, shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which such lot is located.
(e) The expansion of an existing single-family house on a nonconforming
size lot:
(1) The footprint can be enlarged without a variance, provided the 35%
coverage is not exceeded and the setbacks are in accordance with
Division 16.
(2) A second story can be added without a variance.
(3) An accessory structure can be added without a variance, provided
the 35% lot coverage is not exceeded, and the setbacks are in
accordance with Division 16.
(f) A multifamily home on a nonconforming size lot may not be enlarged
without a variance. An accessory structure may be added, provided the
35% lot coverage is not exceeded, and the setbacks are in accordance
with Division 16.
(a) On any nonconforming structure or portion of structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive

No. 1280; 10-24-2016 by Ord. No. 16-005]
Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the reconstruction, repair, or
restoration and the continued use of any nonconforming building or
structure damaged by fire, collapse, explosion, acts of God or acts of public
enemy, subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this
chapter is derived, wherein the expense of such reconstruction does not
exceed 50% of the state equalized valuation of the entire building or
structure at the time such damage occurred, provided that such restoration
and resumption shall take place within six months of the time of such
damage and that it be completed within one year from time of such damage
and provided, further, that such use be identical with the nonconforming
use permitted and in effect directly preceding such damage. In cases where
the damage exceeds 50% of the state equalized value (SEV) of the entire
building, a single-family dwelling which was built on a nonconforming lot
of record may be reconstructed if it is in a zone which allows single-family
dwellings and if it is rebuilt within the same footprint and dimensions of
the original dwelling and will remain as a single-family home. A multifamily
home must be rebuilt according to the current zoning requirements. If the
lot is not buildable, a single-family home could be constructed to the same
footprint of the multifamily home. The footprint may need to be adjusted
to accommodate for required parking on the site. If possible required
yard setbacks shall be applied. Appropriate permits and approvals must
be obtained prior to reconstruction. All other nonconforming buildings or
structures must conform to the appropriate zoning regulations prior to
obtaining a permit for reconstruction. Where pending insurance claims
require an extension of time, the Chief Inspector may grant a time
extension, provided that the property owner submit a certification from the
insurance company attesting to the delay. Until such time as the debris from
the fire damage is fully removed, the premises shall be adequately fenced
or screened from access by children who may be attracted to the premises.
Any structure, which is nonconforming to the current Zoning Ordinance,
that is not intentionally destroyed over 50% of its SEV, can be rebuilt to the
plan that was approved by the City at the initial time of construction, if the
City has an approved building permit or site plan on file or if the property
owner has record of said permit or plan that was approved by the City.
provided that the cubic content (footprint) existing when it became
nonconforming shall not be increased.
(b) If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to a lack
of repairs and maintenance and is declared by the Chief Inspector to be
unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not
thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with
the regulations of the district in which it is located.

part to another location unless such building or structure and the off-street
parking spaces, yard and other open spaces provided are made to conform
to all the regulations of the district in which such building or structure is to
be located.
§ 52-739. Certificate of occupancy. [Code 1975, § 39-106; Code
1992, § 32-434]
(a) At any time, should the City become aware of a nonconforming use, the
owner of such nonconforming use shall be notified by the City Clerk of
this section and that his or her property constitutes a nonconforming
use. Within 30 days after receipt of such notice, the owner shall apply
for and be issued a certificate of occupancy for the nonconforming use.
The application for such certificate shall designate the location, nature,
and extent of the nonconforming use and such other details as may be
necessary for the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. If the owner
of a nonconforming use fails to apply for a certificate of occupancy
within 30 days after receipt of the notice, the use ceases to be
nonconforming and is hereby declared to be in violation of this chapter.
The City Clerk and the City Attorney shall take appropriate action to
enjoin such violation.
(b) If the Chief Inspector shall find, upon reviewing the application for a
certificate of occupancy, that the existing use is illegal or in violation of
any other ordinance or law or if he or she finds that the building for
which the certificate is requested has been constructed or altered for
the existing use or any other use without full compliance with the
building code or the zoning ordinance in effect at the time of
construction or alteration, he or she shall not issue the certificate of
occupancy but shall declare such use to be in violation of this chapter.
(c) After the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived
this chapter or any amendments thereto, the Chief Inspector shall
prepare a record of all known nonconforming uses and occupations of
lands, buildings and structures, including tents and trailer coaches,
existing at the time. Such record shall contain the names and addresses
of the owners of record of such nonconforming uses and of any
occupant, other than the owner; the legal description of the land; and
the nature and extent of use. Such list shall be available at all times in

9-28-2015 by Ord. No. 15-008; 10-24-2016 by Ord. No. 16-005]
(a) Off-street parking in conjunction with all land and building uses shall be
provided as follows:
(1) For the purpose of this article, the size of a parking space shall be
determined in accordance with the table in § 52-773, the minimum
requirements for off-street parking facilities.
An alley may be used as access to a residential parking area,
provided the alley is open to the public. For commercial or
industrial parking lots, an alley may be used for access to the
parking lot, provided the public alley is not located adjacent to
residential properties. The alley must be the minimum width of the
required maneuvering lane in order to be accessible.
(2) When units or measurements determining the number of required
parking spaces result in requirement of a fractional space, any
fraction up to and including 1/2 shall be disregarded, and fractions
over 1/2 shall require one parking space.
(3) The minimum number of off-street parking spaces shall be
determined in accordance with the table in § 52-772. For uses not
specifically mentioned therein, off-street parking requirements
shall be interpreted by the Zoning Board of Appeals from
requirements for similar uses.
(4) Any area once designated as required off-street parking shall never
be changed to any other use unless and until equally required
facilities are provided elsewhere. Off-street parking existing at the
effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived in
connection with the operation of an existing building or use shall
not be reduced to an amount less than would be required for such
building or use.
(5) Off-street parking may be provided either by private or public
parking.
(6) Required off-street parking shall be for the use of occupants,
employees, visitors, and patrons and shall be limited in use to
motor vehicles that are operable and currently licensed, unless for
sale in an approved auto sales lot. The storage of merchandise,
motor vehicles for sale, or the repair of vehicles is prohibited. Not
more than twice a year, a personal motor vehicle can be offered for
sale on any lot, if licensed in the name of the property owner or

the Planning Director, and except in the Central Business District
(CBD District) as defined: beginning in the center line of the street
at the intersection of Glenwood Avenue and Erie Street; thence
proceeding south along the center line of Erie Street, across the

to the intersection of Seventh Street and Court Street; thence east
along the center line of Court Street extended to the west bank
of the St. Clair River; thence north along the west bank of the St.
Clair River to the extended center line of Glenwood Avenue; thence
west along such extended center line to the point of beginning
of this description. There are no off-street parking requirements
within the above-described Central Business District, except for the
following uses:
a. New residential lofts are required to have one parking space
per residential unit on the same property as the unit unless the
building is located within 500 feet of a public parking lot as
determined by the Planning Director. If parking is not provided
on site or in a public parking lot, provisions can be made to
rent space from another property owner in a private lot, if
extra spaces are available. A building permit shall not be
issued until proof of parking is provided to the Planning
Department.
b. Also, any new nonresidential buildings for any use shall require
parking on site per the parking requirements of Article VI
unless the building is located within 500 feet of a public
parking lot as determined by the Planning Director.
c. A new multifamily residential building or development will be
required to have one parking space per unit on site.
(7) Residential off-street parking space shall consist of a parking strip,
garage, or a combination thereof and shall be located on the
premises it is intended to serve. The parking area shall not be in
the required setback for the front yard or street side yard, except
cars are allowed to park in a permitted paved driveway in front of a
garage door within the required setback for the front yard or street
side yard, provided the cars do not overhang into the right-of-way.
Residential driveways can be paved to the interior side property
line, provided the driveway is not leading to a parking lot (see
§ 52-773). For any new construction, all access drives and parking
areas shall be paved with concrete or bituminous concrete
surfacing. A curb cut shall be required.
(8) Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the collective
provision of off-street parking facilities for two or more buildings or
uses in nonresidential districts, provided such facilities collectively

property unless approved by the Planning Director. If the lot is
separated by another private property, access via a public
sidewalk around that private property is required. If the lot is
separated by a public street, signage to the closest intersection
crosswalk will be required to be placed in public in the parking
lot. If a crosswalk mid-block is necessary, it shall be approved

requirements set forth in this chapter as follows: If existing off-street
parking facilities have unused parking capacity and where such
facilities are open to the use of the public free of charge or at
reasonable rates, the City Council may reduce the parking space
requirement for any use within 500 feet from such facility, provided that
the total number of stalls in such reduction shall be not greater than the
total number of stalls of excess capacity.
(a) The amount of required off-street parking space for new uses or
buildings, additions thereto, and additions to existing buildings as
specified in § 52-771 shall be determined in accordance with the

zoning districts. The regulation of outdoor signs is further intended to
enhance the physical appearance of the City, to preserve scenic and

thereby reducing traffic accidents, to reduce hazards that may be
caused by signs overhanging or projecting over the public rights-of-way
and to avoid the canceling out effect of conflicting adjacent signs. The
primary purpose of this article is to permit the identification of uses
permitted by this article.

requirements for signs and outdoor display structures, with respect to
safety, size and attachment or anchorage with respect to appearance
and geographical location.

construction, or alteration of any sign, except as provided in this article,
and all such signs shall be approved by the Building Inspector as to
compliance with the requirements of the zoning district wherein such
sign is to be located with the requirements of this article and with all
applicable City sign regulations as set forth in the local building code as
adopted by the City. All illuminated signs are subject in addition to the
provisions of the local electrical code as adopted by the City and any
permit fees required thereunder.
(b) Application contents, requisites. A building permit can be obtained at
the City Inspection Department and shall be completed by the applicant
