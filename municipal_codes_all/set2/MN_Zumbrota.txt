the following manner:
(1) Replacing section 2.3 with the following:
"2.3 Agreement Effective Date
In general, an Employee must complete and file with the employer a Participation Agreement
prior to the month deferrals begin. Notwithstanding this requirement, the Employer may
establish a cutoff date for receiving Participation Agreements as long as the cutoff is no later
than the deadline provided in section l.457-4(b) of the final 457 regulations and the cutoff date
is applied in a nondiscriminatory manner. Thereafter, during each month in which the
Employee is a Participant in the Plan, that portion of his or her said compensation which is
specified by the Employee in the Participation Agreement, shall be deferred and paid in
accordance with the provisions of this Plan."
City Council 5
(2) Deleting the following portion of section 2.6 and renumbering section 2.6(d) and 2.6(e) as
2.6(c) and 2.6(d) respectively:
"(c) The pre-retirement catch-up provision may not be used during the calendar year that the
Participant ceases to be an Employee."
(3) Replacing section 4.2, 7 .1 and 7 .2 with the following:
"4.2 Unforeseeable Emergency Distribution
A Participant may apply for a lump sum withdrawal of funds from the Plan in the event of an
unforeseeable emergency. The Employer will evaluate the request for conformity with its
interpretation of the applicable regulations. The decision of the Employer concerning whether
an unforeseen emergency exists shall be final.
An unforeseeable emergency is a severe financial hardship of the Participant or Beneficiary
resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant or Beneficiary, the Participant's or
Beneficiary's spouse or the Participant's or Beneficiary's dependent (as defined in Code section
152(a)); loss of the Participant's or Beneficiary's property due to casualty (including the need
to rebuild a home following damage to a home not otherwise covered by homeowner's
insurance, e.g., as a result of a natural disaster); or other similar extraordinary and
unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant
of the Beneficiary.
Examples of unforeseeable emergencies include ( 1) imminent foreclosure of or eviction from
the Participant's or Beneficiary's primary residence, (2) the need to pay for medical expenses
(including nonrefundable deductibles), as well as for the cost of prescription drug medication
and (3) the need to pay for the funeral expenses of a spouse or a dependent (as defined in Code
section 152(a)). Note that the purchase of a home and the payment of college tuition are
typically not unforeseeable emergencies.
The Participant must satisfy the Employer that the facts and circumstances of his or her
situation fall within the definition of unforeseeable emergency. A distribution on account of
an unforeseeable emergency may not be made to the extent the emergency is or may be relieved
through reimbursement or compensation from insurance or otherwise by liquidation of the
Participant's assets (to the extent liquidation would not itself cause sever financial hardship) or
by cessation of deferrals under the Plan."
6 Zumbrota - Administration
"7.1 Transfers In
All or a portion of an Employee's benefit may be transferred from an Eligible Deferred
Compensation Plan maintained by another eligible tax-exempt employer and credited to the
Participant's Account under this plan as long as the transferor plan provides that such transfer
can be made and the employee has severed employment with such other employer.
As it deems necessary, the Employer may require such documentation from the transferor plan
to effect the transfer, to confirm that such plan is an Eligible Deferred Compensation Plan
within the meaning of Code section 475(b) and to ensure that transfers are provided for under
such plan.
The Employer may refuse to accept a transfer in the form of assets other than cash, unless the
Employer agrees to hold such other assets in trust under the Plan.
Any amounts transferred that have been deferred during the current calendar year will be
considered deferrals subject to current calendar year deferral limitation."
"7.2 Transfers Out
All or a portion of a participant account may be transferred to an Eligible Deferred
Compensation Plan maintained by another eligible tax-exempt employer as long as the
transferee plan provides that such transfer can be made and the employee has severed
employment.
Upon the completion of such transfer, the Plan and Employer are discharged of any liability to
the Participant to pay amounts so transferred.
As it deems necessary, the Employer may require such documentation from the other plan to
effect the transfer, to confirm that such plan is an Eligible Deferred Compensation Plan within
the meaning of Code section 457(b) and to assure that transfers are provided for under such
plan. Such transfers shall be mad only under such circumstances as are permitted under Code
section 457 and the applicable regulations."

§ 53.052 PROffiBITED WASTES AND SUBSTANCES.
(A) No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the following described waters or
wastes to any public sewers:
(1) Any liquids, solids, or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be,
sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious
in any other way to the wastewater disposal system or to the operation of the system. At no time shall
two successive readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the system or at any
point in the system, be more than 5% nor any single reading over 10% of the lower explosive limit
(LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha,
benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates,
bromates, carbides, hydrides, and sulfides;
(2) Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150°F (65°C), or causing,
individually or in combination with other wastewater, the influent at the wastewater treatment plant to
have a temperature exceeding 104°F (40°C);
(3) (a) Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids, or gases in
sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, to injure or interfere with any
wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a public nuisance, or
create any hazard in the receiving waters of the wastewater treatment plant, including but not limited to
the following concentrations of materials in the wastes as received at the influent of the wastewater
treatment plant; or any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act:
Pollutant Hazardous Concentration
Arsenic 0.1 mg/I
Cadmium 0.02 mg/I
Chloroform 1.0 mg/I
Chromium, total 3.0 mg/I
Copper 0.20 mg/I
Cyanide (HCN) 1.0 mg/I
Free oil, wax, grease, and fats 25.0 mg/I
Lead 0.1 mg/I
Mercury 0.1 mg/!
Sewers 31
Pollutant Hazardous Concentration
Nickel 1.0 mg/I
Phenolic compounds which cannot be removed 0.01 mg/I
by the city's wastewater treatment processes
Silver 0.1 mg/I
Zinc 2.0 m11:/l
(b) When the influent concentration of any of these pollutants exceeds its limit, the city
shall immediately investigate to determine the source of the loading increase to the collection system and,
once the discharge source has been discovered, shall take necessary corrective action, either by assessing
fines to the discharger if a violation of its discharge permit is in occurrence, or by revising its permit to
more stringent discharge limits. If the discharger's increased loading has not created a violation of its
existing permit limitation, the city may choose not to enforce more stringent limitations, but rather to
relax the treatment plant influent limitation given in this section. If the cause of a higher pollutant
concentration in the treatment plant influent is determined to be loading increases from several
discharges, the city shall deal with each discharger according to its discharge permit by either assessing
a fine, establishing more stringent discharge limits, or relaxing the limitations in this section.
(4) Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or having any other corrosive property capable
of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and personnel of the wastewater disposal system;
(5) Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of a size capable of causing obstruction to the
flow in sewers, or other interference with the proper operating of the sewage works such as, but not
limited to, ashes, spent lime, cinders, stone or marble dust, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass,
rags, feathers, gas, tar, plastics, wood, grease, unground garbage with particles greater than one-half

are capable of creating a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the
sewers for their maintenance and repair;
(7) Any substance which may cause the wastewater disposal system's effluent or any other
product of the wastewater treatment process such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for
reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance
32 Zumbrota - Public Works
discharged to the wastewater disposal system cause the system to be in noncompliance with sludge use
or disposal criteria, guidelines, or regulations developed under Section 405 of the Act, any criteria,
guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Wastes
Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or state standards applicable to the
sludge management method being used;
(8) Any substance which will cause the wastewater disposal system to violate its NPDES or
state disposal system permit or the receiving water quality standards; or
(9) Any wastewater which creates conditions at or near the wastewater disposal system which
violates any statute or any rule, regulation, or ordinance of any public agency or state or federal

§ 53.053 LIMITATIONS ON WASTEWATER STRENGTH.
(A) Federal pretreatment standards. Federal pretreatment standards promulgated by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to the Act shall be met by all users which are subject
to those standards in any instance where they are more stringent than the limitations in this chapter unless
the Public Works Director has applied for, and obtained from the MPCA approval to modify the specific
limits in the federal pretreatment standards. When requested, an application for modification of the
federal pretreatment standards will be considered for submittal by the Public Works Director when the
city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of the pollutants. Consistent removal
shall mean reduction in the amount of pollutant or alteration of the nature of a pollutant which is in the
influent to the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state by the time it is discharged
in the effluent. The reduction or alteration will be demonstrated by averaging the lowest 50 % of the
removals measured by 12 or more samples according to the procedures set forth in40 C.F.R. 403.7(c)(2)
of the General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution.

pedestrian traffic and general recreational use.
12 Zumbrota - General Regulations
TRUNK SIDEWALK. A specially designated sidewalk according to the provisions of this
subchapter which is determined to be of greater importance by reason of the need of its use to gain access
to various important locations within the city, including but not limited to the downtown area, hospital,
schools, parks, trail systems, library, and the churches within the community. TRUNK SIDEWALKS
shall also provide for adequate handicap access where appropriate to be phased in according to a plan
of implementation as from time to time the city is able to develop and pay for within its budget
constraints.
(Ord. 2002-01, passed 7-18-2002)
§ 91.16 PURPOSE.
The City Council declares that the retention, repair, and replacement of existing sidewalks and trails
within the city is in the public interest and that as far as possible, the existing sidewalk and trail system
should be maintained, repaired, and replaced, except in circumstances where the Council determines it
is unnecessary, unfair, or not in the public interest to continue the sidewalk and trail system.
(Ord. 2002-01, passed 7-18-2002)
§ 91.17 SIDEWALK SYSTEM MAP.
The City Council shall, after reasonable consideration, adopt a sidewalk system map of the city
designating existing trunk, secondary, and dispensable sidewalks and trails. The sidewalk system map
may from time to time be amended by the City Council, as is deemed necessary by the Council. The

repaired or replaced immediately by that party at the party's expense. Any damage or destruction to a
sidewalk, which is occasioned by any party whether it be accidental or otherwise, shall be repaired or
replaced immediately by the abutting property owner at the abutting property owner's expense. If the
damage or destruction to a sidewalk was occasioned by the actions of a person other than the abutting
property owner, the abutting property owner shall have the right to recover the cost of repair or
replacement from the responsible person according to applicable law and available remedies, but the
actions of third persons shall not alleviate the abutting property owner of the responsibility to maintain,
replace, or repair damaged, destroyed, or defective sidewalks. The notice and assessment procedures
set forth in § 91.22(C) shall apply to cases where an abutting property owner is required to repair or
replace a sidewalk under this section.

§ 91.20 NEW SIDEWALKS; COUNCIL CONTROL.
The City Council shall review and consider areas of the city that are not presently served by the
sidewalk and' trail system. The City Council shall determine whether or not a sidewalk and trail system
wmdd be appropriate under the circumstance in any of these areas. To the degree the City Council
det~rmines sidewalks or trails to be appropriate, the Council may require the installation of sidewalks
andltrails in accordance with the other provisions of this subchapter. The City Council shall have in its
discretion the right to determine whether sidewalks and trails would not be appropriate and the exercise
of this discretion shall not prevent the Council from enforcing the other provisions of this subchapter
requiring repair, replacement, or maintenance of sidewalks and trails in other areas of the city. As new
subdivisions and areas of the city are developed, the City Council shall review as part of the platting
process these areas and shall require the installation of sidewalks and trails in each area on a case-by-case
basis. As a general rule, the cost of installing new sidewalks and trails within new subdivisions shall
be at the expense of the developer.

in a conspicuous place. The notice shall order the owner of the property to have the sidewalk repaired
and made safe within a period of time as determined by the Public Works Director, but no sooner than
30 days after service or posting of the notice. The notice shall also state that if the property owner fails

power, telephone, telegraph, cable television, and fiber optics is required to be placed underground in
a joint trench, then the costs of excavation and fill and also the costs of conduit, cable, vaults, and other
appurtenant facilities shall be borne on an equal basis, or as agreed, by the utilities, franchise holders,
or other users participating in the undergrounding project.

§ 93.02 SHADE TREE PEST CONTROL.
(A) Declaration of policy. The health of the trees in the city is threatened by shade tree pests, and
the loss or ill health of trees growing upon public and private property substantially depreciates the value
of property within the city and impairs the safety, good order, general welfare and convenience of the
public. In addition to and in accordance with M.S. §§ 89.001, 89.01, and 89.51-89.64, the provisions
of this section are adopted as an effort to control and prevent the spread of these shade tree pests.
(B) Declaration of a shade tree pest. The Council may by ordinance declare any vertebrate or
invertebrate animal, plant pathogen, or plant in the community threatening to cause significant damage
to a shade tree or community forest, as defined by M.S. § 89.001, to be a shade tree pest and prescribe
control measures to effectively eradicate, control, or manage the shade tree pest, including necessary
timelines for action.
(C) Public nuisances defined. A shade tree pest, as defined by§ 93.03, occurring within a defined
control zone is a public nuisance.
(D) Shade tree pest nuisances are unlawful. It is unlawful for any person to permit any public
nuisance as defined in this section to remain on any premises the person owns or controls within the city.
The nuisance may be abated as provided in this section.
(E) Tree Inspector. The City Council may appoint a Tree Inspector to coordinate the activities of
the city relating to the control and prevention of damage by shade tree pests. The Tree Inspector will
recommend to the Council the details of any program for the declaration, control, and prevention of
shade tree pests. The Tree Inspector is authorized to enforce or cause to be enforced the tasks incident
to such a program adopted by the Council. The term "Tree Inspector" includes any person designated
by Council or the Tree Inspector to carry out activities authorized in this section.
(F) Abatement of shade tree pest nuisances.
(1) In abating a nuisance, defined by ordinance under division (B), the organism, condition,
plant, tree, wood, or material identified as injurious to the health of shade trees shall be removed or
effectively treated so as to destroy and prevent as fully as possible the spread of the shade tree pest. Such
abatement procedures shall be carried out in accordance with the control measures and areas prescribed
in§ 93.03.
(2) In addition, if the appropriate abatement procedure is removal, and the tree(s) and/or
hedge(s) are within the limits of a highway in a rural area within the city's jurisdiction, M.S. § 160.22
shall be complied with as necessary.
(G) Reporting discovery of shade tree pest. Any owner or occupier of land or any person engaged
in tree trimming or removal who becomes aware of the existence of a public nuisance caused by a shade
tree pest as defined under division (B) herein shall report the same to the city.

Health and Sanitation; Nuisances 30A
(H) Registration of tree care.firms. Any person, firm, or corporation that provides tree care, tree
trimming, or removal of trees, limbs, branches, brush, or shrubs for hire must be registered with the
Minnesota Commissioner of Agriculture under M.S. § 180.07.
(I) Inspection and application of control measures.
( 1) The Tree Inspector is authorized to inspect premises and places within the city to determine
whether shade tree pests exist thereon and to investigate all reported incidents of shade tree pests. The
Tree Inspector is authorized to take all reasonable measures to prevent the maintenance of public
nuisances and may enforce the provisions relating to abatement in this section. Diagnosis of shade tree
pests may be by the presence of commonly recognized symptoms, by tests as may be recommended by
the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Agriculture or the Commissioner of the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources, or other reliable means.
(2) Except in situations of imminent danger to human life and safety, the Tree Inspector shall
not enter private property for the purpose of inspecting or preventing maintenance of public nuisances
without the permission of the owner, resident, or other person in control of the property, unless the Tree
Inspector has obtained a warrant or order from a court of competent jurisdiction authorizing the entry.
(3) No person, firm, or corporation shall interfere with the Tree Inspector or with anyone
acting under the Tree Inspector's authority while engaged in activities authorized by this section.
(J) Standard abatement procedure. Except as provided in divisions (K) and (M), whenever a Tree
Inspector determines with reasonable certainty that a public nuisance, as described by this section, is
being maintained or exists on premises in the city, the Tree Inspector is authorized to abate a public
nuisance according to the procedures in this division.
( 1) The Tree Inspector will notify in writing the owner of record or occupant of the premises
that a public nuisance exists and order that the nuisance be terminated or abated. The notice may be
given in person or by mail. Failure of any party to receive the mail does not invalidate the service of the
notice. A copy of the notice shall be filed with the City Administrator.
(2) The notice of abatement shall state that unless the public nuisance is abated by the owner
or occupant, it will be abated by the city at the expense of the owner or occupant. The notice shall
specify the control measures to be taken to abate the nuisance, and provide a reasonable amount of time
to abate the nuisance. The notice will also state that the owner or occupant has the right to appeal the
determination that a public nuisance exists by submitting a request in writing to the City Administrator
within seven days after service of the notice, or before the date by which abatement must be completed,
whichever comes first.
(3) If no timely appeal is submitted, and the control measures prescribed in the notice of
abatement are not complied with within the time provided by the notice or any additional time granted,
the Tree Inspector or designated person shall have the authority to obtain permission or an administrative
search warrant, enter the property, and carry out abatement in accordance with the notice of abatement.
2014 S-3
30B Zumbrota - General Regulations
(K) High-cost abatement. If the Tree Inspector determines that the cost of abating a nuisance will
exceed $5,000 based on a reasonable, good faith estimate, the written notice referred to in division (J)
above must provide that if the nuisance is not abated within the reasonable amount of time provided, the
matter will be referred to the City Council for a hearing. The date, time, and location of the hearing must
be provided in the notice.

abatement notice or extend the time by which abatement must be completed. Each owner, agent of the
owner, occupant, and lienholder of the subject property or properties in attendance, if any, shall be given
the opportunity to present evidence at the hearing. After holding the hearing, the City Council may issue
an order requiring abatement of the nuisance.
(M) Abatement procedure in event of imminent danger.
(1) If the Tree Inspector determines that the danger of infestation to other shade trees is
imminent, and delay in control measures may put public health, safety, or welfare in innnediate danger,
the Tree Inspector may provide for abatement without following divisions (J) or (K). The Tree Inspector
must reasonably attempt to notify the owner or occupant of the affected property of the intended action
and the right to appeal the abatement and any cost recovery at the next regularly scheduled City Council
meeting.
(2) Nothing in this section shall prevent the city, without notice or other process, from
innnediately abating any condition that poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.
(N) Recovery of cost of abatement; liability and assessment.
(1) The owner of premises on which a nuisance has been abated by the city shall be personally
liable for the cost to the city of the abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has
been completed and the cost determined, the City Administrator or other official shall prepare a bill for
the cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon the amount shall be innnediately due and payable at the
office of the City Administrator.
(2) After notice and hearing, as provided in M.S. § 429.061 (which may be amended from time
to time), the City Administrator shall, on or before September 1 next following abatement of the
nuisance, list the total unpaid charges as well as other charges for current services to be assessed under

§ 93.03 DECLARED SHADE TREE PESTS, CONTROL MEASURES AND CONTROL AREAS.
(A) Oak wilt.
(1) Oak wilt disease. Oak wilt disease is a shade tree pest and is defined as any living or dead
tree, log, firewood, limb, branch, stump, or other portion of a tree from any species of the genus
Quercus existing within the control area defined that has bark attached and that exceeds three inches in
diameter or ten inches in circumference and contains to any degree any spore or reproductive structures
of the fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum.
(2) Control measures. Control measures that may be taken to abate oak wilt disease are:
(a) Installation of a root graft barrier. A root graft barrier can be ordered installed to
prevent the underground spread of oak wilt disease. The city will mark the location of the root graft
barrier. The barrier disrupts transmission of the fungus within the shared vascular systems of root grafted
trees. The barrier is created by excavating or vibratory plowing a line at least 42 inches deep between
any oak tree infected with oak wilt disease and each nearby and apparently healthy oak tree within 50
feet of the infected tree.
(b) Removal and disposal of trees.
1. On property zoned for residential and commercial use. On property that is zoned
residential and commercial, the city may mark for removal trees that have the potential to produce spores
of the fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum. After, and in no case before, the installation of the root graft
barrier and no later than May 1 of the year following infection, all marked trees must be felled. The
stump from such felled trees must not extend more than three inches above the ground or, if taller, must
be completely debarked. If, however, after the city prescribes the location for a root graft barrier, the
city determines that installation of the barrier is impossible because of the presence of pavement or
obstructions such as a septic system or utility line, the city may mark for removal all oak trees whether
living or dead, infected or not and located between an infected tree and the marked barrier location.
These marked trees must be felled and disposed of no later than May 1 of the year following infection.
The stump from such felled trees must not extend more than three inches above the ground or, if taller,
must be completely debarked.
2. On all other property. On all other property, the city may mark for removal all
oak trees whether living or dead, infected or not and located between an infected tree and the marked
barrier location. These marked trees must be felled and disposed of no later than May 1 of the year
following infection. The stump from such felled trees must not extend more than three inches above the
ground or, if taller, must be completely debarked. All wood more than three inches in diameter or ten
inches in circumference from such felled trees must be disposed of by burying, debarking, chipping, or
sawing into wanefree lumber, or by splitting into firewood, stacking the firewood, and inunediately
covering the woodpile with unbroken four-mill or thicker plastic sheeting that is sealed into the ground
until October 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the tree was felled, or by
burning before May 1 of the year following infection. Wood chips from infected trees may be stockpiled
or inunediately used in the landscape.

30D Zumbrota - General Regulations
(c) Definition of control area. The control area for oak wilt disease is defined as all lands
within the boundaries of the city.
(B) Emerald ash borer.
(1) Emerald ash borer is a shade tree pest and is defined as an insect that attacks and kills ash
trees. The adults are small, iridescent green beetles that live outside of trees during the summer months.
The larvae are grub- or worm-like and live underneath the bark of ash trees.
(2) Control measures that may be taken to abate emerald ash borer are those provided in the
document, Minnesota Emerald Ash Borer Science Advisory Group Recommendations on Preparing for
Emerald Ash Borer in Minnesota.
[ www .mda. state .rnn. us/news/publications/pestsplants/pestrnanagement/ eab-recommends. pdf]
(3) Definition of control areas. The control area for emerald ash borer is defined as all lands
within the boundaries of the city.
(C) Dutch elm disease.
( 1) Dutch elm disease is a shade tree pest and is defined as a disease of elm trees caused by the
fungus Ophiostoma ulmi or Ophiostoma novo-ulmi, and includes any living or dead tree, log, firewood,
limb, branch, stump, or other portion of a tree from any species of the genus Ulmus existing within the
control area defined that has bark attached and that exceeds three inches in diameter or ten inches in
circumference and could contain bark beetles or any spore or reproductive structures of the fungus
Ophiostoma ulmi or Ophiostoma novo-ulmi.
(2) Control measures that may be taken to abate Dutch elm disease are:
(a) Use of fungicide. Fungicides may be effective in preventing Dutch elm disease when
injected into living trees that do not already show symptoms of Dutch elm disease. Fungicide injections
on private lands are optional and, if performed, are at the landowner's expense.
(b) Removal and disposal of trees. Prompt removal of diseased trees or branches reduces
breeding sites for elm bark beetles and eliminates the source of Dutch elm disease fungus. Trees that wilt
before July 15 must be removed within 20 days of detection. Trees that wilt after July 15 must be
removed by April 1 of the following year. Diseased trees not promptly removed will be removed by the
city at the landowner's expense. Wood may be retained for use as firewood or saw logs ifit is debarked
or covered from April 15 to October 15 with four-mill plastic. The edges of the cover must be buried
or sealed to the ground. [Refer to the USDA publication How to Identify And Manage Dutch Elm Disease
(www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/howtos/ht_ ded/ht_ ded.htrn) for further details on management
recommendations.]
(3) Definition of control areas. The control area for Dutch elm disease is defined as all lands
within the boundaries of the city.

CITY OF ZUMBROTA, MN FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE
THREE DISTRICT - ONE-MAP FORMAT1
1A Flood Insurance Rate Map has been published for the community and the Regulatory Floodway boundary is shown on this map. A separate Flood Boundary and Floodway Map has not been published.
SECTION 1.0 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE
1.1 Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minnesota Statutes Chapter 103F and Chapter 462 delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City of Council of the City of Zumbrota, Minnesota does ordain as follows:
1.2 Findings of Fact:
1.21 The flood hazard areas of the City of Zumbrota, Minnesota, are subject to periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures or flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
1.22 Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. This Ordinance is based upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
1.23 National Flood Insurance Program Compliance. This Ordinance is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59 -78, as amended, so as to maintain the communitys eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
1.3 Statement of Purpose: It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in Section 1.21 by provisions contained herein.
SECTION 2.0 GENERAL PROVISIONS
2.1 Lands to Which Ordinance Applies: This Ordinance shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of City of Zumbrota shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or the attachments thereto as being located within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General Flood Plain Districts.
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 100 of 250
2.2 Establishment of Official Zoning Map: The Official Zoning Map together with all materials attached thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Ordinance. The attached material shall include the Flood Insurance Study for Goodhue County, Minnesota And incorporated Areas and Flood Insurance Rate Map Panels therein numbered: 27049C0535E, 27049C0537E, 27049C0541E, 27049C0542E and 27049C0545E, all dated September 25, 2009, and prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Official Zoning Map shall be on file in the Office of the City Administrator and the Community Development Director/Zoning Administrator.
2.3 Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation: The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from designation of a floodway.
2.4 Interpretation:
2.41 In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
2.42 The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the Official Zoning Map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the Official Zoning Map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the decision of the Zoning Administrator, the Board of Adjustment shall make the necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the site at the time the Community adopted its initial floodplain ordinance or on the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the 100-year floodplain if earlier, and other available technical data. Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the Board of Adjustment and to submit technical evidence.
2.5 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this Ordinance to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this Ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this Ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
2.6 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: This Ordinance does not imply that areas outside the flood plain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of City of Zumbrota or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

(b) The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan if one exists and are compatible with the existing neighborhood.
2.814 Equal Degree of Encroachment - a method of determining the location of floodway boundaries so that flood plain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
2.815 Flood - a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
2.816 Flood Frequency - the frequency for which it is expected that a specific flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
2.817 Flood Fringe - that portion of the flood plain outside of the floodway. Flood fringe is synonymous with the term "floodway fringe" used in the Flood Insurance Study for Goodhue County, Minnesota and Incorporated Areas.
2.818 Flood Plain - the beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.
2.819 Flood Proofing - a combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or elimination of flood damages.

2.831 Substantial Improvement - within any consecutive 365-day period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
(a) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
(b) Any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure. For the purpose of this Ordinance, historic structure shall be as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1.
2.832 Variance - means a modification of a specific permitted development standard required in an official control including this Ordinance to allow an alternative development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in a community's respective planning and zoning enabling legislation.
2.9 Annexations: The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference into Section 2.2 above may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the corporate boundaries of the City of Zumbrota at the time of adoption of this ordinance. If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed into the City of Zumbrota after the date of adoption of this ordinance, the newly annexed floodplain lands shall be subject to the provisions of this ordinance immediately upon the date of annexation into the City of Zumbrota.
SECTION 3.0 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS
3.1 Districts:
3.11 Floodway District. The Floodway District shall include those areas designated as floodway on the Flood Insurance Rate Map adopted in Section 2.2.

Page 105 of 250
4.2 Standards for Floodway Permitted Uses:
4.21 The use shall have low flood damage potential.
4.22 The use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists.
4.23 The use shall not obstruct flood flows or increase flood elevations and shall not involve structures, fill, obstructions, excavations or storage of materials or equipment.
4.3 Conditional Uses:
4.31 Structures accessory to the uses listed in 4.1 above and the uses listed in 4.32 - 4.38 below.
4.32 Extraction and storage of sand, gravel, and other materials.
4.33 Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves, and water control structures.
4.34 Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines, and pipelines.
4.35 Storage yards for equipment, machinery, or materials.
4.36 Placement of fill or construction of fences.
4.37 Recreational vehicles either on individual lots of record or in existing or new subdivisions or commercial or condominium type campgrounds, subject to the exemptions and provisions of Section 9.3 of this Ordinance.
4.38 Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and floodwalls constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual structures and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the 10-year frequency flood event.
4.4 Standards for Floodway Conditional Uses:
4.41 All Uses. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected.
4.42 All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and standards contained in Section 10.4 of this Ordinance.
4.43 The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists.
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 106 of 250
4.44 Fill:
(a) Fill, dredge spoil, and all other similar materials deposited or stored in the flood plain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method.
(b) Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
(c) As an alternative, and consistent with Subsection (b) immediately above, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the Governing Body has received an appropriate plan which assures the removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available. The conditional use permit must be title registered with the property in the Office of the County Recorder.
4.45 Accessory Structures:
(a) Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
(b) Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of flood waters:
(1) Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
(2) So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
(c) Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry flood proofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 flood proofing classification in the State Building Code provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size at its largest projection, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All flood proofed accessory structures must meet the following additional standards:
(1) The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
(2) Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly flood proofed; and
(3) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two
automatic openings in the outside walls of the structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
4.46 Storage of Materials and Equipment:
(a) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 107 of 250
(b) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the Governing Body.
4.47 Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be subject to the provisions of Minnesota Statute, Chapter 103G. Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to remove areas from the regulatory flood plain shall not be allowed in the floodway.
4.48 A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream.
SECTION 5.0 FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF)
5.1 Permitted Uses: Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district(s). If no pre-existing, underlying zoning use districts exist, then any residential or non residential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted use in the Flood Fringe District provided such use does not constitute a public nuisance. All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for Flood Fringe District Permitted Uses listed in Section 5.2 and the "Standards for all Flood Fringe Uses" listed in Section 5.5.
5.2 Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses:
5.21 All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one (1) foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least fifteen (15) feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
5.22 As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at its largest projection may be internally flood proofed in accordance with Section 4.45 (c).
5.23 The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of one-thousand (1,000) cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a conditional use, unless said fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with Section 5.21 of this ordinance.
5.24 The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
5.25 The provisions of Section 5.5 of this Ordinance shall apply.
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 108 of 250
5.3 Conditional Uses: Any structure that is not elevated on fill or flood proofed in accordance with Section 5.21 - 5.22 and or any use of land that does not comply with the standards in Section 5.23 - 5.24 shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An application for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures specified in Sections 5.4-5.5 and 10.4 of this Ordinance.
5.4 Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses:
5.41 Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if: 1) the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure; 2) it is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and 3) it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards:
(a) Design and Certification - The structure's design and as-built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State Building Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding.
(b) Specific Standards for Above-grade, Enclosed Areas - Above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
(1) A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a flood proofing technique. There shall be a minimum of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot above grade. The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters without any form of human intervention; and
(2) That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage.
5.42 Basements, as defined by Section 2.812 of this Ordinance, shall be subject to the following:
(a) Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation.
(b) Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry flood proofed in accordance with Section 5.43 of this Ordinance.
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 109 of 250
5.43 All areas of non residential structures including basements to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be flood proofed in accordance with the structurally dry flood proofing classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally dry flood proofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing classification in the State Building Code and this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted.
5.44 When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless the community is enforcing a state approved shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a state approved shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the Governing Body. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the flood plain if adequate flood warning time exists.
5.45 Storage of Materials and Equipment:
(a) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
(b) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the Governing Body.
5.46 The provisions of Section 5.5 of this Ordinance shall also apply.
5.5 Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses:
5.51 All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two (2) feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the Board of Adjustment must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
5.52 Commercial Uses - accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four (4) upon occurrence of the regional flood.
5.53 Manufacturing and Industrial Uses - measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having protracted flood durations. Certain
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 110 of 250
accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in Section 5.52 above. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in flood plain areas.
5.54 Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation - FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
5.55 Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the Official Zoning Map.
5.56 Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in Section 9.3.
5.57 All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
SECTION 6.0 GENERAL FLOOD PLAIN DISTRICT
6.1 Permissible Uses:
6.11 The uses listed in Section 4.1 of this Ordinance shall be permitted uses.
6.12 All other uses shall be subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria pursuant to Section 6.2 below. Section 4.0 shall apply if the proposed use is in the Floodway District and Section 5.0 shall apply if the proposed use is in the Flood Fringe District.
6.2 Procedures for Floodway and Flood Fringe Determinations Within the General Flood Plain District.
6.21 Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the General Flood Plain District, the applicant shall be required to furnish such of the following information as is deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator for the determination of the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use is within the Floodway or Flood Fringe District.
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 111 of 250
(a) A typical valley cross-section(s) showing the channel of the stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water information.
(b) Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground, pertinent structure, fill, or storage elevations, the size, location, and spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site, and the location and elevations of streets.
(c) Photographs showing existing land uses, vegetation upstream and downstream, and soil types.
(d) Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed development.
6.22 The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District and to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation. Procedures consistent with Minnesota Regulations 1983, Parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200 and 44 Code of Federal Regulations Part 65 shall be followed in this expert evaluation. The designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective Department of Natural Resources' Area Hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis. The designated engineer or expert shall:
(a) Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood.
(b) Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.
(c) Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood stages more than 0.5 foot. A lesser stage increase than .5' shall be required if, as a result of the additional stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in computing floodway boundaries.
6.23 The Zoning Administrator shall present the technical evaluation and findings of the designated engineer or expert to the Governing Body. The Governing Body must formally accept the technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood Fringe District boundary or deny the permit application. The Governing Body, prior to official action, may submit the application and all supporting data and analyses to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Department of Natural Resources or the Planning Commission for review and comment. Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District Boundaries have been determined, the Governing Body shall refer the matter back to the Zoning Administrator who shall process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of Section 4.0 and 5.0 of this Ordinance.
SECTION 7.0 SUBDIVISION 7.1 Review Criteria: No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. All lots within the flood plain districts shall be able to contain a building site outside of the Floodway District at or above the
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 112 of 250
regulatory flood protection elevation. All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that comply with the provisions of this Ordinance and have road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. For all subdivisions in the flood plain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting documents.
7.2 Floodway/Flood Fringe Determinations in the General Flood Plain District: In the General Flood Plain District, applicants shall provide the information required in Section 6.2 of this Ordinance to determine the 100-year flood elevation, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries and the regulatory flood protection elevation for the subdivision site.
7.3 Removal of Special Flood Hazard Area Designation: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
SECTION 8.0 PUBLIC UTILITIES, RAILROADS, ROADS, AND BRIDGES
8.1 Public Utilities. All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer, and water supply systems to be located in the flood plain shall be flood proofed in accordance with the State Building Code or elevated to above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
8.2 Public Transportation Facilities. Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges to be located within the flood plain shall comply with Sections 4.0 and 5.0 of this Ordinance. Elevation to the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be provided where failure or interruption of these transportation facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the public health or safety.
8.3 On-site Sewage Treatment and Water Supply Systems: Where public utilities are not provided: 1) On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 2) New or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject to impairment or contamination during times of flooding.

SECTION 18. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
SUBD. 1. PURPOSE.
The purpose of this section is to: (1) encourage a more creative and efficient development of land and the application of zoning requirements such as lot sizes and building setbacks, while at the same time meeting the standards and purposes of the Comprehensive Plan and preserving the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Zumbrota; (2) to allow for a mixture of residential units, or residential and commercial units, in an integrated and well-planned area; and (3) to ensure concentration of open space into more usable areas, and the preservation of natural resources of the site including wetlands, steep slopes, vegetation, and scenic areas. Planned unit development is conceived for use primarily in two basic situations:
A. Vacant Land: Areas of substantial open land where strict pre-regulation may limit good urban design, may restrict the full achievement of the Comprehensive Plan or may not meet those changes in technology and demand that would be consistent with the best interests of the entire city; and in
B. Built-up and Aged Areas: Areas of the city needing rehabilitation and redevelopment including areas which may be deficient in public facilities and services, where it is believed that private investment should be encouraged to contribute to that redevelopment and in recognition that such necessary redevelopment cannot be expected to take place in strict accordance with those uniform regulations appropriated to more viable and established areas of the city.
SUBD. 2. PERMITTED USES.
Each planned unit development shall be comprised of one or more subdistricts which shall be designated as follows: 1) PUD-R - General Residential; 2) PUD-HDR - High Density Residential; and 3) PUD-C - Commercial which definitions are as follows:
A. PUD-R and PUD-HDR: Dwelling units in detached, semi-detached, attached, groups attached or clustered or multi-storied structures, or any combination thereof.
B. PUD-C:
1. Any commercial use which by design, use and restriction is compatible with all adjacent uses.
2. Mixed commercial and residential use located within the same building.
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 123 of 250
Uses other than the principal type of use by area permitted in the zoning district or districts in which the land proposed for such unit is located shall not result in undue adverse effect on surrounding areas, and shall be consistent with the concept of the proposed planned unit development district. The Planning Commission shall evaluate whether the plan would result in an adverse effect on the surrounding area.
SUBD. 3. REGULATIONS
A. Maximum Development Intensity:
1. PUD-R: Site coverage of the underlying residential district shall apply for buildings, tennis courts, swimming pools, roads and other impervious surfaces.
2. PUD-HDR: Site coverage of the underlying high density residential district of the subject tract shall apply for principal and accessory uses.
3. PUD-C: Site coverage regulations for the underlying commercial district shall apply to the PUD-C overlay district.
B. Projects shall be so designed as to provide adequate sewer and water facilities and public access; lots should be of adequate size to provide emergency and/or service vehicle public access. Buildings shall be spaced to allow emergency vehicles freedom to maneuver between buildings.
C. Open Space Requirements: A primary function of the planned unit development provision is to encourage development which will preserve and enhance the worthwhile, natural terrain characteristics and not force intense development to utilize all portions of a given site in order to arrive at the maximum density allowed. In evaluating each individual proposal, the recognition of this objective will be a basic consideration in granting approval or denial including but not limited to the following:
1. The amount and location of common open space shall be consistent with the stated purpose and intent of this section.
2. All common open space shall be labeled as such and as to its intent or design functions.
3. The common open space is for amenity or recreational purposes and the uses authorized are appropriate to scale and character of the planned unit development considering its size, density, expected population, topography, and number and type of dwellings provided.
4. If the required open space is less than 10,000 square feet, all of it shall be located in contiguous portion of the lot and no dimension may by less than thirty (30) feet.
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 124 of 250
5. If the required open space is more than 10,000 square feet, each separate open area shall contain not less than 10,000 square feet and no portion of the space shall be less than fifty (50) feet in width.
6. Off-site permanent recreation space and facilities may be approved as meeting up to one-half (1/2) the open space requirements if it meets the intent of these regulations and it abuts the site.
7. Accessory uses in a planned unit development may include the following; golf course, private park, lake or waterway, recreation area, recreation building, clubhouse or social hall or other accessory structure which the planning and zoning commission finds is designed to serve primarily the residents of the development, and is comparable with the design of the planned unit development.
D. An application for PUD must be filed by the landowner or jointly by all landowners of the property included in a project. The application and all submissions must be directed to the development of the property as a unified whole. In the case of multiple ownership, the approved final plan shall be binding on all owners.

SUBD. 12. VARIANCES.
A. Criteria for granting variances.
A variance to the provision of the Zoning Ordinance may be issued to provide relief to the landowner in those instances where the Ordinance imposes practical difficulties to the property owner in the use of the owners land.
The City Council shall have the exclusive power to order the issuance of variances from the requirements of any official control including restrictions placed on nonconformities. Variances shall only be permitted when they are in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the official control and when the variances are consistent with the comprehensive plan.
Variances may be granted when the applicant establishes:
1. There are practical difficulties in complying with the official control. Practical difficulties, as used in connection with the granting of a variance, means that the property owner proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner not permitted by an official control; and
2. The plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the property not created by the landowner; and,
3. The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality, and,
4. The variance requested is the minimum variance which would alleviate the practical difficulty; and
5. The variance would not be materially detrimental to the purposes of this Ordinance, or to property in the same zone.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Subdivision, no use variances may be issued.

City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 181 of 250
SECTION 25. SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE.
SUBD. 1. OFFICIAL SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE.
The official Subdivision Ordinance regulates and governs the sub-division or platting of land in the City of Zumbrota, Goodhue County, Minnesota.
SUBD. 2. REGULATIONS.
The City of Zumbrota has adopted a comprehensive plan for the future physical development and improvement of the City pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, MSA 362.555, and finds it necessary to regulate the division of land for future development and use. The City finds that the public health, safety and general welfare require that the division of land into two or more parcels requires regulation to assure adequate space, light and air; to provide proper ingress and egress to property; to facilitate adequate provision for water, waste disposal, fire protection, open space, schools, public uses and adequate streets and highways; and to assure uniform monumenting, legal description and conveyance of subdivided land. The Minnesota Statutes authorize municipalities to so regulate the subdivision and platting of land pursuant to MSA 412.221 Subdivision 28; and 462.358.
SUBD. 3. SHORT TITLE.
This ordinance shall be known as the Subdivision Ordinance of the City of Zumbrota and is referred to herein as Subdivision Ordinance.
SUBD. 4 PURPOSE.
This ordinance is adopted in order to safeguard the best interests of the City and to assist the subdivider in harmonizing the subdividers interests with those of the City at large. Because each new subdivision becomes a permanent unit in the basic structure of the expanding community, and to which the community will be forced to adhere, and because piecemeal planning of subdivisions will bring on an undesirable, disconnected patchwork or pattern and poor circulation of traffic unless its design and arrangement is correlated to a comprehensive plan of the City aiming at a unified scheme of community interests, all subdivisions of land hereafter submitted for approval to the City and the Planning Commission shall, in all respects, fully comply with the regulations hereinafter set forth in this ordinance. It is the purpose of this ordinance to make certain regulations and requirements for the platting of land within the City to provide for health, safety, and the general welfare and to:
1. provide for and guide the orderly, economic and safe development of land and urban services and facilities;
2. encourage well planned, efficient, and attractive subdivisions by establishing adequate standards for design and construction;
3. facilitate adequate provision for streets, transportation, City water, City sewer,
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 182 of 250
storm drainage, schools, parks, playgrounds, and other public services and facilities;
4. assure that a reasonable portion of any proposed subdivision is dedicated to the public or preserved for public use as streets; roads; sewers; electric, gas and water facilities; storm water drainage and holding areas or ponds; and similar utilities and improvements;
5. assure that public improvements are constructed to adequate standards;
6. place the cost of improvements against those benefiting from their construction;
7. secure the rights of the public with respect to public land and waters;
8. assure that new subdivisions are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and overall development objectives of the City;
9. achieve a more secure tax base;
10. set the minimum requirements necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
SUBD. 5. APPLICABILITY.
Every division of land for the purpose of lease or sale into two or more lots, parcels or tracts within the incorporated area of the City of Zumbrota or any combination of 2 or more lots which would result in a parcel over 30,000 square feet shall proceed in compliance with this ordinance. It is the purpose of this Title to make certain regulations and requirements for the platting of land within the City pursuant to the authority contained in Minnesota Statutes chapters 412, 429, 471, 505 and 58, which regulations the City Council deems necessary for the health, safety, general welfare, convenience and good order of this community.
SUBD. 6 EXCEPTIONS.

1. a cemetery or burial plot while used for that purpose;
2. any division of land made by testamentary provision, the laws of descent, or upon court order;
3. a parcel which was the subject of a written agreement to convey, entered into prior to the effective date of this Ordinance.
4. land which the Planning Commission or the Council finds to be unsuitable for land
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 183 of 250
subdivision due to flooding, inadequate drainage, steep slopes, rock formations or other features likely to be harmful to the safety and general health of future residents, or land which could not be adequately served by utilities or other public facilities or public access; such land shall not be subdivided unless adequate methods are provided for overcoming such conditions; or the land is platted as outlots;
5. in the case of re-subdivision, this Chapter shall not apply to any lot or lots forming a part of a subdivision recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds, or Registrar of Titles prior to the effective date of this Chapter, unless the area is being re-platted. Nor is it intended by this Chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair or interfere with existing provisions of other laws or ordinances except those specifically repealed by or in conflict with this Chapter, or with private restrictions placed upon property by deed, covenant or other private agreement, or with restrictive covenants running with the land to which the City is a party. Where this Chapter imposes a greater restriction upon land than is imposed or required by such existing provisions of the law, ordinance, contract or deed, the provisions of this Chapter shall control.
6. Divisions of land where the division is to permit the adding of a parcel of land to an abutting lot or to create two (2) lots and the newly created property line will not cause the land or any structure to be in violation of this Ordinance or the Zoning Ordinance, provided Section 6, Minor Subdivision, Waiver of Subdivision Platting Requirements are followed.
7. In the case of a request to divide a base lot upon which a two-family dwelling, townhouse or quadraminium which is part of a recorded plat where the division is to permit individual private ownership of a single dwelling unit with such a structure and the newly created property lines will not cause any of the unit lots or the structures to be in violation of the Ordinance or the Zoning Ordinance.

Subsequent approval will be required of the engineering proposals pertaining to water supply, storm drainage, sewage disposal, grading, gradients and roadways widths by the Public Works Department, City Engineer and other public officials having jurisdiction prior to the approval of the final plat by the City.
H. DRAINAGE: No plat will be approved for a subdivision which is subject to periodic flooding, or which contains poor drainage facilities and which would make adequate drainage to the streets and lots impossible. However, if the subdivider agrees to make improvements which will, in the opinion of the City Engineer, make the area completely safe for residential occupancy and provide adequate street and lot drainage and limit 100 year run off to pre-developed conditions, the preliminary plat of the subdivision may be approved. Plats along the river should show the floodway, 100 year and 500 year floodplain lines on the preliminary plat.

SUBD. 2 STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
A. STREET LOCATIONS:
1. The street layout of every subdivision shall be in conformity with the Comprehensive Plan or circulation element thereof, and shall provide for the continuation of major streets which serve property contiguous to the subdivision. Street networks shall provide ready access for fire and other emergency vehicles, and the Planning Commission may require additional access points if such are found to beneficial or necessary to protect the public safety.
2. Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of a proposed future street system for the un-subdivided portion shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider.
3. Reserved strips controlling access to streets are prohibited.
4. The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either provide for the continuation of existing streets in surrounding areas or conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the City Council to meet a
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 206 of 250
particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance of existing streets impractical.
5. Residential streets or minor streets shall be so arranged as to discourage their use by through traffic. Subdivisions shall be platted to allow for a collector street where deemed desirable by the City. Direct access onto the collector street shall be discouraged.
6. Where a subdivision abuts on or contains an existing or proposed arterial street: marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen plantings, non-access reservations along arterial property lines abutting the arterial streets, deep lots or such other treatment as may be necessary for protection of residential properties should be encouraged. Direct frontage and/or access to arterial streets should be avoided.
7. Street traffic should be designed to flow toward arterial and collector streets. Streets should fit the contours of the land. Street grades, where feasible, shall not be greater than ten (10) percent and not less than 0.5 percent, as defined in Subdivision 2. E. 6.
B. STREET ACCESS: No land situated in the City which as been subdivided or laid out into separate tracts shall be sold for use for dwellings unless such tracts of land shall abut upon a public or private street or public highway. This limitation shall not apply to planned developments approved by the City Council pursuant to the zoning ordinance.
Street access shall not be denied by creation of parcels of land of substandard depth which are held in private ownership.
C. CLASSIFICATION OF STREETS: Classification of streets shall be determined with reference to the Comprehensive Plan and official street maps including highway, arterial, collector and local streets.
1. CUL-DE-SACS/DEAD END STREETS: Cul-de-sacs or Dead End Streets designed to have one end permanently closed or in the form of cul-de-sac, (turn-around) shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around having a minimum right-of-way radius of not less than sixty feet (diameter of 120). Such streets shall not exceed seven hundred feet (700) in length.
2. CURVED STREETS: The location of all curved streets should be so arranged as to fit the natural topography as closely as possible and to make possible desirable land subdivisions and safe vehicular traffic.
3. HALF STREETS: Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to reasonable development of future subdivisions. In cases where the entire right-of-way has been dedicated to the public, but the property of
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 207 of 250
the owner and subdivider is located on one side of such street, the owner and subdivider shall be required to grade the entire street in accordance with the plans to be approved by the City Engineer, but the owner and subdivider shall only be required to deposit payment for one-half of the engineers estimated cost for the improvement required. Building permits shall be denied for lots on the side of the street where the property is owned by persons who have not entered into a development agreement with the City for the installation of the improvements required under this ordinance, or Subdivision Boundary Streets: A street lying along the boundary of a subdivision may be dedicated less than the required width if it is practical to require the dedication of the remaining portion when the adjoining property is subdivided. Whenever there exists a dedicated portion of a street in a subdivision adjoining a proposed subdivision, the other portion shall be dedicated on the proposed subdivision to make the street complete. To assure that this occurs, a one foot reserve strip shall be deeded to the City on the subdivision boundary along the street for the purpose of withholding access from the unsubdivided property to said street until such time as the completed street is constructed. The same procedure will be required when a street dead ends without a cul-de-sac at the boundary of any subdivision.
4. LOCAL STREETS: Local Streets shall be designed so their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
5. PRIVATE STREETS: Private Streets may be permitted of narrower width than public streets where connection with a public street is provided and utility and snow storage easements adjacent to the right-of-way are provided of sufficient width to total the width requirements for similar public streets. Public Improvements shall not be approved for any previously existing private street.
D. CLASSIFICATION OF ALLEYS
Alleys, which may be permitted within re-platted subdivisions, shall have a minimum width of sixteen (16) feet and shall be improved to the same standards provided for streets generally. Dead-end alleys and alleys with sharp changes in direction are prohibited.
E. STREETS
1. CURB RADIUS: The minimum curb radii for thoroughfares, collector streets, local streets and alleys shall be as follows:
a. Arterial Streets, Collector and Local Streets - 14.5 feet.
Where required, curbs and gutters shall be installed as per Minnesota Department of Transportation construction specifications Plate B 6-18.
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 208 of 250
2. REVERSE CURVES: Minimum design standards for collector and arterial streets shall comply with Minnesota State Aid Standards.
3. RESERVE STRIPS: Reserve Strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except under conditions accepted by the City Council.
4. STREET ACCESS: Where a subdivision borders upon a railroad or limited access highway right of way, a street may be required approximately parallel to, and at a distance suitable for, the appropriate use of the intervening land as for park purposes in residential districts or for parking, commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall be determined with regard for the requirement of approach grades and possible features grade separations.
5. STREET ALIGNMENT: Connecting street center lines deflecting from each other at any point more than ten degrees shall be connected by a curve of at least one hundred foot radius for collector and local streets, and at least a three hundred foot radius for arterial streets. A tangent at least one hundred feet long shall be introduced between curves on arterial streets.
6. STREET GRADES: Whenever feasible, street grades shall not exceed the following, with due allowance for reasonable vertical curves:
Street Type Percent Grade Percent Grade
Or Class Maximum Minimum
Arterial 4% .5%
Collector 5% .5%
Local 10% .5%
Marginal Access 10%
7. All streets shall be graded in accordance with the specifications of the City Engineer. Such grading shall be for the full right-of-way width of the dedicated street
8. STREET INTERSECTIONS: Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as is practicable. No street should intersect any other street at less than eighty (80) degrees. Wherever possible, local and collector streets should be designed so as to not intersect with arterial or highways at intersections closer than five hundred (500) feet. In general, provisions shall be made at intervals not exceeding one-half (1/2) mile for through streets (streets running through the subdivision in a fairly direct manner).
9. STREET JOGS: Street jogs with center line offsets of less than one hundred twenty five feet (125) shall be avoided.
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 209 of 250
10. SURFACING: All streets shall be surfaced for the full roadway or curb to curb width as described in this ordinance. Such surfacing shall consist of a gravel base over a suitable sub-grade and an approved bituminous or concrete surface in accordance with the specifications of the City Engineer. Any ditches required for suitable drainage shall be constructed in the unpaved portion of the street and shall be sodded or seeded. Unsuitable soil lying within one foot of the subgrade shall be removed and replaced with suitable material. The drop from the centerline of the street to the outer edge of the street shall be a minimum of 1/4" per foot of street width.
11. TANGENTS: A tangent at least 100 feet long must be introduced between reverse curves on collector streets and a tangent of at least 50 feet in length must be introduced between reverse curves and vertical curves on all other streets.

SUBD. 3 PUBLIC UTILITIES.
Where sewer and water systems are installed, the mains shall be of adequate size to accommodate future growth and utilization. Stubs shall be provided to each lot from the utility main to the lot line for future connection. Wherever practical, similar utilities shall be placed in the same general location on streets of the same direction.
A. SANITARY SEWERS: Sanitary sewers shall be installed to serve all properties in the subdivision where a connection to the City sanitary sewer system is available or where detailed plans and specifications for sanitary sewers to serve the subdivision are available. Sanitary sewer lines shall be extended to the edges of the development to facilitate future subdivisions.
B. WATER: Where a connection to the City water system is presently available, water distribution facilities including pipe fittings, hydrants, valves, etc., shall
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 210 of 250
be installed to serve all properties within the subdivision. Water mains shall be a minimum of eight inches (8) in diameter in residential areas and twelve (12) inches in diameter in Commercial/Industrial areas, unless approved by the City Engineer. Where mains larger than eight (8) inches are required to serve future growth, the City may elect to participate in the cost of such water mains. Looping of all water mains shall be required and shall conform to the Citys Comprehensive Water Plan, as applicable.
C. STORM WATER: All subdivision design shall incorporate adequate provisions for storm water runoff consistent with the Zumbrota Storm Water Plan, as applicable, and be subject to review and approval of the City Engineer.
D. ELECTRIC/TELEPHONE/CABLE: All new electric distribution lines (excluding main line feeders and high voltage transmission lines), telephone service lines, cable television lines and services constructed within the confines of and providing service to customers in a newly platted residential area shall be buried underground. Such lines, conduits or cables shall be placed within easements or dedicated public ways in a manner which will not conflict with other underground services. Transformer boxes shall be located so as not to be hazardous to the public. The City Council may waive the requirements of underground services as set forth in this section if, after study and recommendation by the Planning Commission, the City Council establishes that such underground utilities would not be compatible with the planned development or unusual topography, soil or other physical conditions which would make underground installation unreasonable or impractical.
SUBD 4. EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL.
Grade and drainage requirements for each plat shall be subject to approval of the City Engineer. The following controls shall be practiced to manage erosion and sediment control:
A. Where topsoil is removed, sufficient arable soil shall be set aside for re-spreading over the developed area. Topsoil shall be restored or provided to a minimum depth of six inches (6) and shall be of a quality at least equal to the soil quality prior to development.
B. The development shall conform to the natural limitations presented by topography and soil so as to create the least potential for soil erosion.
C. Erosion and siltation control measures shall be coordinated with the different stages of construction and approved by City Engineer. Appropriate control measures shall be installed prior to development when necessary to control erosion. Silt fences shall be installed in the front of all lots, prior to issuing a building permit. The silt fence shall be installed right behind the curb or if a
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 211 of 250
sidewalk is in place right behind the sidewalk. If a sidewalk is located in the front of the lot the developer will be responsible for sodding the boulevard between the sidewalk and the curb before a Certificate of Occupancy will be issued.
D. Land shall be developed in increments of workable size such that adequate erosion and siltation controls can be provided as construction progresses. The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one period of time.
E. When soil is exposed, the exposure shall be for the shortest feasible period of time, as specified in the development agreement.
SUBD. 5 LOT AND BLOCK STANDARDS.
A. LOTS: Lots shall be designed to meet the following minimum standards:
1. AREA: The minimum lot area, width and depth shall be sufficient to satisfy zoning ordinance requirements.
2. CORNER LOTS: Corner lots for residential uses shall have additional width to permit appropriate building setback from both streets as required in the Zoning Ordinance.
3. DOUBLE FRONTAGE LOTS: Double Frontage Lots (or through lots) should be avoided, except where the subdivision abuts a major highway, major road or arterial. In residential, C1a, I1 and I2 developments, a planting screen easement of at least ten (10) feet in width shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such traffic artery or other disadvantageous use.
4. FEATURES: In the subdividing of land, due regard shall be shown for all natural features, such as tree growth, watercourses, bluffs, historic spots or similar conditions which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and stability to the proposed development.
5. FRONTAGE/ACCESS: Every lot must have the minimum frontage on a City approved street other than an alley, as required by the City Zoning Ordinance, except where permitted under a planned unit development.
6. LOT BOUNDARIES: No lot shall be divided by a boundary line between registered land and abstract property, nor by a boundary line between two owners.
7. LOT CORNERS AT STREET INTERSECTIONS: Curbs at street intersections shall be rounded by an arc, the minimum radius of which shall be fourteen and one-half (14.5) feet or by a straight line not less
City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 212 of 250
than 7 feet in length at approximately 45 degree angles from the lot lines. Lots at corners shall be platted with additional lot width of at least fifteen (15) feet wider to allow appropriate building setbacks from both streets as required by the Zoning Ordinance in effect.
8. LOT LINE ANGLES: Side lot lines shall be straight lines running within twenty (20) degrees of perpendicular to the road upon which the lots front. Side lot lines on curved roads should run at or near radially to the curve.
9. LOT PADS: The top of the foundation and the garage floor of all structures shall be above the grade of the crown of the street upon which the property fronts. Exceptions to this standard may be approved by the Zoning Administrator for special circumstances such as increased setback, site topography, flooding potential, septic system operation and the like, provided that proper site and area drainage is maintained and the elevation of the structure is in keeping with the character of the area.
10. LOT REMNANTS: All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after subdividing of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels.
11. LOTS ALONG THOROUGHFARES: There shall be no direct vehicular access from residential lots to a major arterial street, and residential lots shall be separated from major arterial streets and railroad rights-of-way by a twenty-five (25) foot buffer strip, which may be in the form of added depth or width of lots backing on or siding on the thoroughfares or railroad right-of-way.

SUDB. 6 PARK/PUBLIC LAND DEDICATION
A. INTENT AND PURPOSE: The process of dividing land into separate parcels for parks and open space is one of the most important factors in the growth of any community. Once the land has been dedicated to parks and open space, the basic character of the permanent addition to the City has become firmly established. It is, thereof, in the interest of the general public, the developer, and the residents of the community, that parks and open space areas be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with the highest possible standards of excellence.
All parks and open space areas hereafter dedicated shall comply, in all respects, with the regulations set forth herein. It is the purpose of these regulations to:
1. Provide for a variety of activities within the park system, including various cultural and social activities, and active and passive recreation.
2. Establish and promote high quality design standards in the development of the park system.
3. Encourage cooperative planning development and use of park and recreational facilities by the school district and the City so that the City facilities can be useful to the School District and the School District facilities will be available to city residents.
4. To insure that all areas of the City have equal access to parks and open space areas by providing for equal distribution of parks and open spaces throughout all sections of the City relative to user population densities.
B. General Requirements.
1. Where a proposed park, playground, or open space area is proposed to be located in whole or in part in a subdivision, the Planning Commission shall require that such area or areas be shown on plats in accordance with the requirements specified to the City by the developer if the City Council approves such dedication.
2. The Planning Commission shall require that plats show sites of a character, extent and location suitable for the development of a park, playground, or other recreation purposes. The Planning Commission may require that the developer satisfactorily grade any such recreation areas shown on the plat to insure maximum advantage of natural features, notable waterways, etc.

The City does hereby require that in all plats of subdivisions to be developed for residential, commercial, industrial or other uses, or as a planned unit development which includes residential, commercial and industrial uses, or any combination thereof, a percentage of the property being subdivided shall be dedicated for parks, playgrounds, trails, recreational areas, or public open space. Such percentages shall be in addition to the property dedicated for streets, alleys, drainage ways,
pedestrian ways or other public ways. Storm water ponding areas may be incorporated into the park land but shall not be considered a part of the park land dedication. The percentage of public land dedication shall be as follows:
a. Residential Development (dwelling units per acre)
0-2.5 5%
2.6-5.4 6%
5.4-7.3 7%

City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 224 of 250
1. Streets which currently serve the proposed subdivision and/or streets that are proposed to serve the subdivision are of such a width, grade, stability, site distance and surface conditions that an increase in traffic volume generated by the proposed subdivision would create a hazard to public safety and general welfare and, when with due regard to the advice of the county or state, said roads are inadequate for the intended use.
2. The traffic volume generated by the proposed subdivision as calculated by the City Engineer and subject to generally accepted generation computation formulas and design standards would create unreasonable highway congestion at the time of the application or proposed for completion within the next two (2) years.
D. LACK OF ADEQUATE WASTE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS. A proposed subdivision shall be deemed to lack adequate waste disposal systems if there is inadequate sewer capacity in the present system to support the subdivision if developed to its maximum permissible density after reasonable sewer capacity is reserved for schools, planned public facilities, and commercial and industrial development projected for the next five (5) years.

Page 229 of 250
SECTION 26. ADULT USES.
SUBD. 1. PURPOSE.
The purpose of this Section of the Zumbrota Zoning Ordinance is to control certain land uses that have a direct and detrimental effect on the character of the City's residential and commercial neighborhoods.
SUBD. 2. FINDINGS OF THE CITY COUNCIL
The City Council of the City of Zumbrota makes the following findings regarding the effect adult-oriented businesses have on the character of the City's neighborhoods. In making the findings, the City Council accepts the recommendations of a staff committee that has studied the experiences of other urban areas in the state and nation where adult-oriented businesses have located.
A. Adult-oriented businesses can exert a dehumanizing influence on persons attending places of worship; children attending state-licensed family day care homes, state-licensed group family day care homes, and state-licensed child care centers; students attending schools; and people using public parks and libraries.
B. Adult-oriented businesses can contribute to an increase in criminal activity in the area in which such businesses are located, taxing city crime-prevention programs and law-enforcement services.
C. Adult-oriented businesses can significantly contribute to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and can impair the character and quality of the residential housing in the area in which such businesses are located, thereby exacerbating the shortage of affordable and habitable housing for City residents.
D. The concentration of adult-oriented businesses in one area can have a substantially detrimental effect on the area in which such businesses are concentrated and on the overall quality of urban life. A cycle of decay can result from the influx and concentration of sexually-oriented businesses. The presence of such businesses is perceived by others as an indication that the area is deteriorating and the result can be devastating -- other businesses move out of the vicinity and residents flee from the area. Declining real estate values, which can result from the concentration of such businesses, erode the City's tax base and contribute to overall urban blight.
E. Minnesota Statute §462.357, allows the city to adopt regulations to promote the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community.
SUBD. 3 CONCLUSIONS OF THE CITY COUNCIL
In order to minimize the detrimental effect adult-oriented businesses have on adjacent land uses, the City Council adopts the following land-use regulations, recognizing that it has a great interest in the present and future character of the City's residential commercial neighborhoods.

City of Zumbrota  Zoning & Subdivision Ordinance
Page 243 of 250
(1/2) miles search radius for towers equal to or greater than one-hundred twenty (120) feet in height of the proposed tower due to one or more of the following reasons:
a. The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved tower or building as documented by a qualified registered professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost.
b. Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably as documented by a qualified registered engineer or other qualified professional.
c. The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or building as documented by a qualified registered engineer or other qualified professional.
d. Other unforeseen reasons that make it unfeasible to locate the planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or building.
2. The applicant must demonstrate that a good faith effort to co-locate on existing towers and structures was made, but an agreement could not be reached.
3. Any proposed wireless communications tower shall be designed, structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to accommodate both the applicants antennas and comparable antennas for at least two (2) additional users if the tower is over one hundred (100) feet in height or for at least one (1) additional user if the tower is over seventy-five (75) feet in height, but less than one hundred (100) feet.

SUBD. 1. PURPOSE.
The purpose of this section of the Zumbrota Zoning Ordinance is to regulate and restrict Energy Projects within the City; including Solar, Geothermal and Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS), not otherwise subject to siting and oversight by the State of Minnesota.
SUBD. 2. DEFINITIONS
For the purposes of this ordinance, the terms defined in this section have the following meaning:
1. Closed Loop Ground Source Heat Pump System: A system which circulates a heat transfer fluid through pipes or coils buried beneath the land surface or anchored to the bottom in a body of water.
2. Energy Project: Electric generation projects, subsidiary stations of electricity generation, transmission line and distribution systems. These include wind energy conversion systems (WECS), solar energy systems and geothermal/ground source heat pump systems.
3. Geothermal Project: Ground source heat pump systems which use the relatively constant temperature of the earth or a body of water to provide heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. Systems include open or closed loops of pipe, coils or plates; a fluid that absorbs and transfers heat; a heat pump unit that processes heat for use or disperses heat for cooling and an air distribution system. This includes open and closed loop as well as horizontal and vertical ground source heat pump systems
4. Horizontal Ground Source Heat Pump System: A closed loop ground source heat pump system where the loops or coils are installed horizontally in a trench or series of trenches no more than 20 feet below the land surface.
5. Open Loop Ground Source Heat Pump System: A system using groundwater as a heat transfer fluid by drawing groundwater from a well to a heat pump and then discharging the water over land, directly in a body of water or into an injection well.
6. Passive Solar System: A system which captures solar light or heat without transforming it to another form of energy or transferring the energy via a heat exchanger.
7. Photovoltaic Solar System: A system which converts solar light and heat directly into electricity.
8. Solar Project: A device or structural design feature, a substantial purpose of which is to provide for the collection, storage and distribution of solar energy for space heating or cooling,
