public governmental body.

notice, the reason must be reflected in the minutes. Notice also
shall be given to any representative of the news media who
requests notice of a particular meeting.
5. Each meeting shall be held at a place reasonably accessible to the
public and at a time reasonably convenient to the public, unless for
good cause such a place or time is impossible or impractical. When

it is necessary to hold a meeting on less than twenty-four (24)
hour's notice, or at a place that is not reasonably accessible to the
public, or at a time that is not reasonably convenient to the public,
the nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the
normal requirements shall be stated in the minutes.
6. A formally constituted subunit of a parent governmental body may
conduct a meeting without notice during a lawful meeting of the
parent governmental body, a recess in that meeting, or immediately
following that meeting, if the meeting of the subunit is publicly
announced at the parent meeting and the subject of the meeting
reasonably coincides with the subjects discussed or acted upon by
the parent governmental body.
7. A public body shall allow for the recording by audiotape, videotape
or other electronic means of any open meeting. A public body may
establish guidelines regarding the manner in which such recording
is conducted so as to minimize disruption to the meeting. No audio
recording of any meeting, record or vote closed pursuant to the
provisions of Section 610.021, RSMo., shall be permitted without
permission of the public body; any person who violates this
provision shall be guilty of a Class C misdemeanor.

message relating to public business by electronic means shall also
concurrently transmit that message to either the member's public
office computer or the custodian of records in the same format. The
provisions of this Section shall only apply to messages sent to two
(2) or more members of that body so that, when counting the
sender, a majority of the body's members are copied. Any such
message received by the custodian or at the member's office
computer shall be a public record subject to the exceptions above.
9. The City Clerk shall be the custodian of records and will be
responsible for maintenance and control of all records. The
custodian shall provide public access to all public records as soon
as possible but no later than the third (3rd) business day following
the date the request is received by the custodian. If additional
delay is necessary, the custodian shall give an explanation for the
delay and the date the record will be available for inspection.
If a request for access is denied, the custodian shall provide, upon
request, a written statement of the grounds for such denial. Such
statement shall cite the specific provision of law under which
access is denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later
than the end of the third (3rd) business day following the date the
request for the statement is received.
a. The custodian shall charge ten cents ($.10) per page (not to
exceed ten cents ($.10) for nine (9) by fourteen (14) inch
paper), twelve dollars fifty cents ($12.50) per hour for

duplicating time (not to exceed average hourly rate for clerical
staff), and the actual cost of research time. The custodian may
require payment prior to duplicating copies.
b. Provided however, the City Administrator may adjust the
charges per page for duplication costs and/or the charges per
hour for document search by written notice to the custodian so
long as the charges do not exceed the actual cost of document
search and duplication.
c. Fees for providing access to public records maintained on
computer facilities, recording tapes or disks, videotapes or
films, pictures, maps, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar
audio or visual items or devices, and for paper copies larger
than nine (9) by fourteen (14) inches shall include only the cost
of copies, staff time, which shall not exceed the average hourly
rate of pay for staff of the public governmental body required
for making copies and programming, if necessary, and the cost
of the disk, tape, or other medium used for the duplication.
Fees for maps, blueprints or plats that require special
expertise to duplicate may include the actual rate of
compensation for the trained personnel required to duplicate
such maps, blueprints or plats. If programming is required
beyond the customary and usual level to comply with a request
for records or information, the fees for compliance may include
the actual costs of such programming.
d. Provided further, if the City Administrator determines that
waiver or reduction of the charges is in the public interest
because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the public
governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial
interest of the requester, then, upon written notice to the
custodian, documents may be furnished without charge or at a
reduced charge.
e. The custodian may designate deputy custodians in the
following departments: Police; Municipal Court.
10. Each request for records shall be made in writing and may be made

a. It shall be grounds for disciplinary action for any employee to
(1) violate the confidentiality relating to such records or
information; (2) copy or remove closed and/or confidential
information without the specific consent of the custodian
thereof or in the normal course of performing such employee's
duties for the City; (3) provide or discuss closed records or
confidential information with any person other than as a
necessary part of performing such employee's duties for the
City; or (4) divulge, discuss or disclose information or records
addressed in any closed meeting of a public governmental
body, other than as a necessary part of performing such
employee's duties for the City.
b. Elected and appointed officials are also expected to maintain
the same strict standards of confidentiality required of
employees. Breach of the confidentiality standards established
by this Section and required of employees and elected and
appointed officials of the City may be grounds for removal from
office or other sanctions as may be deemed appropriate by the
body of which such official is a member, or as otherwise
provided for removal of appointed or elected officers in

leave be taken only in a real emergency or in real sickness. All sick
leave shall be granted by the Mayor.

exams or other sickness prevention measures, or to attend funerals as
outlined in this Section.
C. Dental Care. Necessary dental care shall be recognized as a proper
cause for granting sick leave.
D. Ocular Conditions. Ocular conditions necessitating professional
attention may be cause for the granting of sick leave. Routine eye

of business.

three (3) days may be taken in the event of a serious illness in the
employee's immediate family, provided that such illness is of such a
serious nature as to require the attendance of a licensed physician, and
appears to the Mayor and the employee's Department Head that the
employee's absence from the situation would tend to incapacitate the
employee at work. If more time is required, it must be approved by the
Mayor.
F. Death In The Family.
1. An excused absence of not more than three (3) days may be taken
in the event of a death in the employee's immediate family.

discretion of the Mayor.

accrue eight (8) hours of sick leave per calendar month. Provided
however, a new employee hired between the months of July to
December shall be entitled to a total of forty (40) hours, less sick leave
actually used, upon completing employment on December thirty-first
(31st) of the year of hire. All permanent full-time employees hired prior
to February 1, 2009, shall retain their accrued sick leave which has
been accrued at the rate of one (1) day/month. No maximum is placed

by the Mayor to provide a release from their attending physician or
dentist that they are fit to return to work for sick leave over five (5)
consecutive days. Employees shall be required to submit such a
return to work authorization if they had no accrued sick leave but
were absent from the job due to sickness. Any employee unable to
furnish said release shall be considered absent without authority
unless approved by the Mayor.
2. All employees must report to their Department Heads when they
are unable to report to work due to sickness. Department Heads
must report the employee's absence due to sickness to the Mayor.
K. Sick Leave At Termination. No sick leave benefits of any kind shall be
granted or used after notice of termination or submission of notice to
resign unless the need for sick leave is verified by the attending
physician. At separation from City service, accumulated and unused
sick leave benefits will not be reimbursed to the separating employee.

advance to allow the Department Head to arrange work schedules. As a
minimum, it is expected that leave be requested at least ten (10) days in

under his/her supervision. Department Heads will take into
consideration seasonal demand and manpower requirements in their
respective activities. Priority in scheduling will be given based on a
combination of employee seniority and the timeliness of the request.

firm shall be terminated and negotiations shall be started with the next
firm recommended.
G. Exceptions.
1. In view of the fact that special conditions will occasionally arise
that make use of this policy impractical, there can be exceptions
made. Reasons for exceptions may include an emergency situation
which precludes a selection time frame of at least two (2) months,
or an extremely specialized need in which there is only one (1)
feasible source of expertise. If it appears there is a need for an
exception to the policy, the Mayor will inform the Board of
Aldermen to allow them the opportunity to deny the exception.
2. If the number of firms willing and available to perform a specific
task is small, the step involving initial screening may be skipped
and the selection process may go directly to detailed proposals.
A. This amount will include services to be rendered to the City by the firm,
with the exception of certain pass-through expenses that will be
identified by contract, if applicable, and it will be calculated by one (1)
of the following methods, at the preference of the City:
1. Lump sum or fixed fee,
2. Cost per unit, or
3. Hourly basis with total not to exceed a fixed amount.
A. Each contract entered into by the Board of Aldermen for professional
services shall contain a prohibition against contingent fees as follows:
"No firm shall retain a person to solicit or secure a City contract
for professional services upon an agreement or understanding for a
commission, percentage, brokerage or contingent fee, except for
retention of bona fide employees or bona fide established commercial
selling agencies for the purpose of securing business."
B. For the breach or violation of the foregoing provision, the Mayor and
Board of Aldermen shall have the right to terminate the agreement
without liability and, at its discretion, to deduct from the contract price,
or otherwise recover the full amount of such fee, commission,
percentage, gift or consideration.

1-8-1991]
The Mayor and Board of Aldermen may waive any and all aforementioned
procedural requirements in the best interests of the City.
A. The procedures described herein shall be used in all projects requiring
outside professional services. Exceptions to this policy shall be as
follows:
1. After the City has used this process to select a firm with specialized
expertise that is available to do similar required work in that field
of expertise which would fall under Class B type projects, if new
contracts can be negotiated, the firm can be retained for additional
projects requiring that expertise for a period of no longer than
three (3) years. After three (3) years, this procedure shall be used
again for selection of professional services.
2. If, after project completion by a firm already selected by the City
through this process to do a major project, the City requires
professional services on an ongoing consultant basis on that
project, the City may retain the services of that firm on a consultant
basis for a period of three (3) years. After that period of time, the
City shall use this procedure again to select ongoing consultant
services.

provocation, or any animal which, without provocation, in a vicious or
terrorizing manner, approaches any person in apparent attitude of attack
upon the streets, sidewalks, or any public grounds or places; or any animal
which is wild by nature and of a species which, due to size, vicious nature
or other characteristics, constitutes a danger to human life, physical wellbeing,
or property; or any animal which has been found to be vicious,
dangerous, or a danger or menace to persons or other animals by a court
of law of another jurisdiction after a hearing or upon a plea agreement is
hereby deemed to be a dangerous animal. For the purpose of this Chapter,
where the official records of the Animal Control Office or the Police

animal is a dangerous animal. In making a determination as to whether an
animal is dangerous, elements that may be considered, but are not required

the animal is acting protectively, whether the animal was tormented or
abused, the seriousness of an attack, and previous attacks.

regulations of the City. Kennels or cages for dangerous animals
must be sufficient for the breed of the species of animal held within.

house, building or structure when screen windows or screen doors
are the only obstacles preventing the dog from exiting the
structure.

cage or secure structure unless that person has the animal securely
leashed on a leash no longer than four (4) feet in length and that
person has physical control of the leash. Such animals shall not be
leashed to inanimate objects such as trees, posts, buildings, etc.
Additionally, all such animals on a leash outside the animal's
kennel, cage or secure structure must be muzzled by a muzzling
device sufficient to prevent the animal from biting persons or other
animals.

maintain in effect public liability insurance in the amount of one
hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) for bodily injury to or

keeping or maintenance of such animal. All owners, keepers or
harborers of dangerous animals shall present to the Animal Control
Officer a statement or receipt from the insurance company

manufacturer's guidelines, by a licensed veterinarian, may be
required at the owner's expense.
7. The owner of such dog or other animal shall arrange for the
spaying or neutering of such animal at the owner's expense. This
sanction may be imposed to help relieve the aggressive nature of
the animal, the desire to wander and to prevent future offspring
with dangerous tendencies.
8. Any dog or other animal that inflicts a severe or fatal injury on a
human being on any public or private property may be deemed an
imminent threat to the public and ordered humanly euthanized by
the court.

any part of the Section if the threat, injury or damage caused by
such animal was sustained by a person who, at the time, was
committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises
occupied by the owner of the animal or was tormenting, abusing or
assaulting the animal or has in the past been observed or reported
to have tormented, abused or assaulted the animal or was
committing or attempting to commit a crime. Nor shall any dog or
other animal be declared dangerous if it was responding to pain or
injury or was protecting itself, its kennel or cage, or its offspring.
Dogs utilized as part of a K-9 Police dog program by a Police official
are exempted while performing their duty.
10. Upon conviction of any person of a violation of the requirements of
these sanctions, the Municipal Judge may, in addition to the usual
judgment upon conviction, order the Animal Control Officer to
forthwith take up and humanely euthanize such animal.

provided in Section 100.230 may be imposed in addition to any
sanctions set forth in this Section.
12. Sanctions imposed by the court are to be implemented to the
Animal Control Officer's satisfaction within seven (7) days after the
court ruling or the dog or other animal may not be reclaimed, (if
allowed) and may be disposed of pursuant to Section 205.166.

1.
An omission to perform an act of which the actor is physically capable.
A person is not guilty of an offense based solely upon an omission
to perform an act unless the law defining the offense expressly so
provides, or a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by
law.
2.
A. Guilt for an offense may be based upon an attempt to commit an offense
if, with the purpose of committing the offense, a person performs any
act which is a substantial step towards the commission of the offense. A
"substantial step" is conduct which is strongly corroborative of the
firmness of the actor's purpose to complete the commission of the
offense.
B. It is no defense to a prosecution under this Section that the offense
attempted was, under the actual attendant circumstances, factually or
legally impossible of commission, if such offense could have been
committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed
them to be.
A. Guilt for an offense may be based upon a conspiracy to commit an
offense when a person, with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the
commission of an offense, agrees with another person or persons that
they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes
such offense.
B. It is no defense to a prosecution for conspiring to commit an offense
that a person, who knows that a person with whom he or she conspires
to commit an offense has conspired with another person or persons to
commit the same offense, does not know the identity of such other
person or persons.
C. If a person conspires to commit a number of offenses, he or she can be
found guilty of only one offense so long as such multiple offenses are
the object of the same agreement.

is alleged and proved to have been done by him or her or by a person
with whom he or she conspired.
E. Exceptions.
1. No person shall be convicted of an offense based upon a conspiracy
to commit an offense if, after conspiring to commit the offense, he/
she prevented the accomplishment of the objectives of the
conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a renunciation of his/
her criminal purpose.
2. The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the issue of
renunciation of criminal purpose under Subsection (E)(1).
F. For the purpose of time limitations on prosecutions:
1. A conspiracy to commit an offense is a continuing course of conduct
which terminates when the offense or offenses which are its object
are committed or the agreement that they be committed is
abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom he or she
conspired;
2. If an individual abandons the agreement, the conspiracy is
terminated as to him/her only if he/she advises those with whom he/
she has conspired of his/her abandonment or he/she informs the
law enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and
of his/her participation in it.
G. A person shall not be charged, convicted or sentenced on the basis of
the same course of conduct of both the actual commission of an offense
and a conspiracy to commit that offense.
A. Except as provided in Section 562.026, RSMo., a person is not guilty of
an offense unless he/she acts with a culpable mental state, that is,
unless he/she acts purposely or knowingly or recklessly or with criminal
negligence, as the Statute defining the offense may require with respect
to the conduct, the result thereof or the attendant circumstances which
constitute the material elements of the crime.
B. A person "acts purposely", or with purpose, with respect to his/her
conduct or to a result thereof when it is his/her conscious object to
engage in that conduct or to cause that result.
C. A person "acts knowingly", or with knowledge,
1. With respect to his/her conduct or to attendant circumstances
when he/she is aware of the nature of his/her conduct or that those
circumstances exist; or

that his/her conduct is practically certain to cause that result.
D. A person "acts recklessly" or is reckless when he/she consciously

or that a result will follow, and such disregard constitutes a gross
deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person would
exercise in the situation.
E. A person "acts with criminal negligence" or is criminally negligent
when he/she fails to be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
circumstances exist or a result will follow, and such failure constitutes a
gross deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person
would exercise in the situation.
A. Upon conviction of any provision of this Chapter where a penalty is not
specified, the penalty shall be a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars
($500.00) plus costs, or confinement in the City or County Jail or City
workhouse not to exceed ninety (90) days, or by both such fine and
confinement as the Court may judge appropriate.

than the five hundred dollar ($500.00) maximum fine or ninety (90) day
maximum confinement, the penalty shall be the statutory penalty alone.
This Subsection shall apply to offenses specified by the State as "Class
C Misdemeanors" and "Infractions".
1. The penalty for an offense which is classified by the State as a
"Class C" misdemeanor shall be a fine not to exceed three hundred
dollars ($300.00), or confinement in the City or County Jail not to
exceed fifteen (15) days, or both.
2. The penalty for an offense which is classified by the State as an
"Infraction" shall be a fine not to exceed two hundred dollars
($200.00).
C. The Court hearing offenses arising from this Chapter shall adhere to all
provisions of Chapters 557 through 560, RSMo., 1986, as amended,
inasmuch as said provisions of the State law are pertinent to the case
before the Court. The intent of this Subsection is to allow the Court to
impose probation as sentence and stipulate conditions of probation
which will be beneficial to the community and, it is hoped, to the
offender.

purpose of determining if a violation of this Section has occurred,
leasing contracts which provide options to buy the merchandise are
owned by the owner of the property until such time as the owner
endorses the sale and transfer of ownership of the leased property to
the lessee.
C. Evidence that a lessee used a false, fictitious, or not current name,
address, or place of employment in obtaining the property or that a
lessee fails or refuses to return the property or pay the lease charges to

person set forth in the lease agreement, or in the absence of the
address, to the person's last known place of residence, shall be

return the motor vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of the intent of
the offense of stealing leased or rented property. Where the leased or
rented property is a motor vehicle, if the motor vehicle has not been
returned within seventy-two (72) hours after the expiration of the lease
or rental agreement, the lessor may notify the local law enforcement
agency of the failure of the lessee to return such motor vehicle, and the
local law enforcement agency shall cause such motor vehicle to be put
into any appropriate State and local computer system listing stolen
motor vehicles. Any Law Enforcement Officer which stops such a motor

Board of Adjustment that all of the following conditions have
been met. The Board of Adjustment shall make a determination

created by an action or actions of the property owner or
applicant.
(2) The granting of the permit for the variance will not
adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or
residents.
(3) The strict application of the provisions of the zoning

represented in the application.
(4) The variance desired will not adversely affect the public
health, safety, quality of life, order, convenience,
prosperity or general welfare.
(5) The granting of the variance desired will not be opposed to

while stabilizing the established residential patterns of the area. The
City seeks to ensure that any location that must accommodate intense
urban uses shall be subject to site plan review by the City Clerk, City
Engineer, Public Works Superintendent, Commission and the Board of
Aldermen. Site plan review shall help ensure compliance with the
meaning and intent of the zoning regulations.
The site plan review regulates the development of structures and sites
in a manner which considers the following concerns:
1. The balancing of landowners' rights to use their land with the
rights of abutting and neighboring landowners to live without
undue disturbances (e.g., noise, smoke, fumes, dust, odors, glare,
stormwater runoff, etc.);
2. The convenience and safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement
within the site and in relation to adjacent areas or roads;
3. The adequacy of waste disposal methods and protection from
pollution of surface or ground water.
4. The protection of historic and natural environmental features on
site under review and in adjacent areas;
5. The stability of the built environment — particularly residential
neighborhoods — by promoting urban development which is
compatible with clearly identified natural resources; and
6. The development guidelines set out in the City Comprehensive
Plan.

subdivider presents evidence or data satisfactory to the Commission
establishing that the methods proposed to meet any such condition are
adequate to avoid any danger to heath, life or property.
D. Amendment Of Subdivision Regulations.
1. A proposal for an amendment of the text of the subdivision
regulations is normally initiated by either the Planning Commission
or the Board of Aldermen. However, a private citizen may request
that the Planning Commission initiate the amendment process by
submitting a proposed change to the City Clerk.
2. If the change is requested by a private citizen, the normal
procedure is for the City to permit the individual to present the
proposed amendment to the City Planning Commission at a regular
meeting. The City Planning Commission, based on the information
presented, will determine whether the proposal is worthy of
consideration as an amendment. If it is determined that the
proposal has merit, the City Planning Commission may set a date
for the public hearing and authorize the publication of the
necessary public notice.

Aldermen, the City Planning Commission and the Mayor of the City of
Carl Junction, and their approval thereof shall be endorsed upon the
plat, under the hand of the City Clerk and the Seal of the City, and by
the Secretary of the City Planning Commission.
B. Application Of Regulations. No lot in a subdivision, as defined herein,
may be conveyed unless a final plat of the property has been approved
according to the requirements and provisions of this Section and a
building permit shall not be issued unless public utilities (water, sewer,
electricity, gas, storm water drainage) are available at the site. This is
supplemental to and not in derogation of the Revised Statues of

Section 410.060. Minimum Standards of Design. [Ord. No. 99-10 §3,
5-18-1999; Ord. No. 04-65 §1, 9-21-2004]
A. No preliminary subdivision plat shall be approved unless it conforms to
the following minimum standards of design.
1. Streets.
a. Relation to adjoining streets. The arrangement of right-of-ways
in a subdivision shall provide for the continuation of the
existing streets or right-of-ways in adjoining areas, unless the
Commission deems such continuation undesirable for reasons
of topography or design. Where subdivision streets or right-ofways
are continuations or extensions of existing streets or
right-of-ways, the width thereof, where practical, shall be at
the same or greater width or width sufficient to adequately
serve the subdivision of the existing street or right-of-way,
except that in no case shall the street or right-of-way in the
subdivision be of less width than hereinafter provided in
Subsection (1)(c)(2).
b. Projection of streets. Where, in the opinion of the Commission,
it is desirable to provide future street access to adjoining
areas, the streets and right-of-way in the subdivision shall be
extended by the developer by the provision of a right-of-way for
street purposes from the end of the pavement to the property
line of the subdivision. If deemed necessary by the
Commission, the developer shall provide such dead-end street
with a temporary turnaround or "Y" intersection. The street
arrangements shall not be such as to cause hardship to owners
of adjoining property in platting their own land and providing
convenient access to it. However, except to avoid land locking
property, nothing herein shall be construed to require that
private streets in one (1) subdivision shall provide access to
adjacent lands.
c. Classification of streets and widths of right-of-ways.
(1) All streets shall be classified as either highway,
thoroughfare, street-collector, street-minor or alleys
(marginal access service way) in accordance with their use
and function, the standards of public safety and
topographic conditions. The classification of each street
designated on a plat shall be reviewed by the Commission
and revised as necessary to conform to the standards of
these regulations.
(2) Streets shall have the following right-of-way widths:

Street Type and
Purpose
Right-of-Way
Minimum Width
Highway 100 feet
Thoroughfare 80 feet
Collectors 50 feet
Minor streets 50 feet
Alleys 20 feet
(3) Subdivision adjacent to existing deficient streets or roads
shall provide additional right-of-way to meet the minimum
width requirements set forth.
(4) A subdivision located on only one (1) side of an existing
street or County road shall provide one-half (½) of the
required right-of-way width, measured from the centerline
of the existing roadway.
(5) Marginal access streets. Where the subdivision abuts on or
contains an existing proposed major street, the
Commission may require marginal access streets to be
provided according to City standards to avoid lot frontage
on major streets.
d. Intersections.
(1) Streets shall intersect, as nearly as possible, at right
angles.
(2) Street curb intersections shall be rounded by radii of at
least twenty-five (25) feet. When the smallest angle of
street intersections is less than sixty degrees (60°), the
Commission shall require curb radii of greater length.
e. Curves and grade changes in streets — horizontal.
(1) A tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet long shall be
introduced between reversed curves on major and
collector streets.
(2) Where there is a deflection angle of more than ten degrees
(10°) in the alignment of a street, not including
intersections with any street, a curve with a radius
adequate to insure safe sight distance shall be made. The
minimum radii of curves shall be:

(b) Collector: 10%.
(c) Minor and marginal access: 12%.
except as otherwise provided by the
City Engineer and Director of Public
Works because of adverse topographic
conditions.
(2) All curb and guttering shall be designed to provide for
surface water drainage from the surrounding area,
buildings and pavement and must comply with the
requirements set forth in the Standard Specifications for
Public Improvement document for the City of Carl
Junction.
(3) The Commission shall not approve streets which will be
subject to frequent or repeated inundation or flooding.
g. Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one
hundred (100) feet are prohibited.
h. Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall be no longer than six hundred
(600) feet and shall terminate in a circular open space having a
radius at the outside of the pavement of at least forty (40) feet
and a diameter at the outside of the right-of-way of at least one
hundred (100) feet. In the event the topography dictates
excessive grades for side streets, a cul-de-sac greater than six
hundred (600) feet in length, such extension shall require
approval of the City Planning Commission based on the
following criteria: low density development such as "R-1" or
"R-2", topography and environmental factors as determined by
the City Planning Commission.
i. Street names.
(1) Proposed streets which are continuations of, or in
alignment with, existing named streets shall bear the
names of such existing streets, unless otherwise approved
by the Commission.
Section
410.060
CARL JUNCTION CITY CODE Section
410.060
AO:458
(2) The name of a proposed street which is not in alignment
with an existing street shall not duplicate the name of any
existing or platted street.
(3) All names of streets proposed by the subdivider shall be
approved or disapproved by the Board in accordance with
this Section.
j. Alleys. Alleys shall be provided to give access to the rear of all
lots used for commercial and industrial purposes except where
other provisions are made for access. Alleys may be required in
certain residential subdivisions by the City Planning
Commission and Board.
k. Streets in relation to railroads, expressways and freeways.
When the area to be subdivided adjoins or contains, for a
considerable distance, a railroad right-of-way, an expressway
or freeway, a street shall be provided by the developer
approximately parallel to the side of such right-of-way. In
determining the distance of such parallel street from the rightof-
way, consideration shall be given to the distance required for
approach grades to future grade separations.
l. Design for persons with disabilities. Access ramps for disabled
persons shall be installed whenever new curbing or sidewalks
are constructed or reconstructed in the City of Carl Junction.
Such ramps shall conform with Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) standards subject to review and approval by the Director
of Public Works. These standards shall apply to any City street
or connecting street for which curbs and sidewalks have been
prescribed by the Board of Aldermen.
2. Blocks.
a. Length. Block lengths shall not exceed one thousand four
hundred (1,400) feet nor be less than four hundred (400) feet
in length. If the topography justifies a departure from the
stated maximum length, such variance shall require approval
of the City Planning Commission. Excess grades on
intersecting streets may be considered justification.
b. Width. Blocks shall be at least wide enough to allow two (2)
tiers of lots of minimum lot depth. The Commission may
approve double frontage lots that would otherwise front on a
major street or where topographic or other tract conditions
prevent single frontage design. Where double frontage lots are
permitted, a twenty (20) foot landscaped buffer shall be
provided and access from the "rear" street prohibited.
c. Pedestrian way. Pedestrian ways may be required across blocks
which exceed nine hundred (900) feet in length, to connect
dead-end streets, or to provide access to parks, schools,
Section
410.060
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
410.060
AO:459
shopping areas or similar facilities. If a pedestrian way is
required, a ten (10) foot right-of-way shall be set aside with a
four (4) foot pavement and at a grade no steeper than fifteen
percent (15%) unless steps of adequate design are provided.
3. Lots.
a. Frontage — minimum width. The minimum width of an "R-1" or
"R-2" residential lot shall be eighty (80) feet at the front
setback line provided where a lot had less width than herein
required at the time of passage of this Chapter, this regulation
shall not prohibit the erection of an "R-1" or "R-2" dwelling.
b. Arrangement. Each lot shall be free from flooding. No lot shall
be impractical of improvement due to steepness of terrain,
dangerous soil conditions, storm water collection or other
adverse natural physical conditions. Side lot lines shall be at
right angles to street lines and radial to curved street lines
where practical.
c. Dimensions.
(1) The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be designed to
provide desirable building sites, property related to
topography, natural features, streets and land uses. All lot
dimensions shall comply with the applicable zoning district
standards.

consideration will be given to a flexible lot, street and
utility arrangement in order to allow for the needs of
particular industries.
d. Utility and drainage easements.
(1) Except where alleys are permitted or required, there shall
be easements of a minimum of twelve (12) feet in width
along rear or side lots for public utilities. If necessary for
the extension of main water or sewer lines or similar
utilities, easements of greater width may be required.

for approval plans for a planned residential development, including
residential neighborhood units, clusters, condominiums, and zero lot
line developments, if it finds that the variations from these regulations
will not adversely affect the health, welfare, safety, and convenience of
the individuals occupying said development. Final action on such
development plan shall be taken by the Board of Aldermen.
B. Lot Split. A lot split is sought to provide for the issuance of building
permits for a parcel of land to be divided into not more than two (2) lots
without having to replat said parcel, provided that the resulting lots
shall not again be divided without replatting. The City Engineer and
City Clerk may approve or disapprove a lot split in accordance with the
following procedure and guidelines:
Section
410.060
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
410.070
AO:461
1. Application procedure. Request for a lot split approval shall be
made by the owner of the land to the City Clerk. Four (4) copies of a
scale drawing and legal description of the lots involved; the
location of any structures(s) thereon together with their precise
nature, location and dimensions; name, signature, and seal of
registered land surveyor who prepared the lot split, and the
appropriate fee shall accompany the application. If deemed
necessary by the City Engineer or City Clerk, other supplementary
information may be requested.
2. Approval guidelines. Approval of the lot split may be given based on
all of the following criteria:
a. No new street or alley is needed or proposed.
b. No vacation of streets, alleys, setback lines, access control or
easements is required or proposed.
c. Such action will not result in significant increases in service
requirements (e.g., utilities, schools, traffic control, streets,
etc.) or will not interfere with maintaining existing service
levels (e.g., additional curb cuts, repaving, etc.).
d. There is sufficient street right-of-way as required by current
regulations.
e. All easement requirements have been satisfied.
f. Such split will not result in a tract without direct access to a
public street.
g. No substandard-sized lot or parcel will be created.
h. The lot has not been previously split in accordance with these
regulations.
3. The City Engineer or City Clerk shall review their proposed action
with the Commission at its regular scheduled meeting. Thirty (30)
days thereafter the City Clerk shall, in writing, advise the applicant
on the approval or non-approval of the lot split application. If the lot
split application is not approved, the City Engineer and City Clerk
may make recommendations to the owner that are deemed
necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of existing land
development regulations and Board of Aldermen policy.
Requirements of the owner of the land may include dedication of
right-of-ways and easements and submission of covenants for the
protection of other landowners in the original subdivision. If
additional action is needed beyond their recommendations to carry
out the development of subject land, the lot split application is
declared void and the subdivision platting process should be
followed.

hardships by reason of the unusual shape of a specific parcel or
property, exceptional topographic conditions or other reason deemed
sufficient by said Board of Aldermen. In granting any exception or
modification, said City Engineer, Planning and Zoning Commission and/
or Mayor may recommend, and the Board of Aldermen may prescribe
such conditions as will secure the objectives of these regulations. No
exception shall be granted unless said Board of Aldermen find that no
detriment will be caused to the public welfare and no injury will be
caused to other property in the area in which the property for which the
exception is requested is situated, and that the exception will not
substantially impair the intent and purpose of these regulations;
provided however, there shall be an additional fee of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) imposed upon the applicant for any such exception
which requires the review and recommendation of the City Engineer;
provided further, that before any such exception is granted, duly

lighting systems which traverse privately owned property, shall be
protected by easements granted by the developer to the
appropriate public utility and approved by the public utility. Such
easements shall be so located as to not interfere with the use of any
lot or other part of the subdivision. The size of, and restrictions
pertaining to, such easements shall be in accordance with the
standards and specifications of the agency having jurisdiction over
the utility lines in the subdivision and shall be indicated on the
preliminary plat submitted for approval.
8. Street signs. The subdivider shall install street signs at all
intersections within the subdivision. Such street signs shall follow
the street names designated on the approved final plat and shall

Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Objectives
Section 420.010. Statutory Authorization. [Ord. No. 06-10 §1,
3-7-2006]
The legislature of the State of Missouri has in Chapter 89, RSMo., 1978,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general
welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Aldermen of the City of Carl
Junction, Missouri, does ordain as follows.
Section 420.020. Findings of Fact. [Ord. No. 06-10 §1, 3-7-2006]
Section 420.025. Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. [Ord. No.
06-10 §1, 3-7-2006; Ord. No. 12-26 §1, 7-3-2012; Ord. No. 12-36 §1,
9-18-2012]
A. The flood hazard areas of the City of Carl Junction, hereinafter City, are
subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and
relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards
to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise unprotected from food damages.
A. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of this Section uses a
standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consists
of a series of interrelated steps.
1. Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering
calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as
its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the
depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can
be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this
Chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could be
expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any
one (1) year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's
FIS, and illustrative materials for Jasper County dated November 2,
2012, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
2. Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard
hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream
channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.

Section 420.040. Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. [Ord. No.
06-10 §1, 3-7-2006]
3. Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without
increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point.
4. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no
development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood
height.
5. Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway
encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base
flood.
A. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare; to minimize those losses described in Article I, Section
420.020(A); to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as
defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to
meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of
this Chapter to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood
heights or velocities;
2. Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that
serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of
initial construction; and
3. Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the
intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.
A. In order to accomplish its purposes, this Chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
1. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety and property due to water or erosion or to flood heights or
velocities.
2. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction.
3. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of floodwaters.
4. Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase erosion or flood damage.

is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the
site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security
devices and has no permanently attached additions.
A. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section
420.070 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:
1. The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based
on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway
must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without
increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one
(1) foot at any point.
2. Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments within the adopted
regulatory floodway are prohibited unless certification by a
registered professional engineer or architect is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase
in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge.
3. If Subsection (2) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of Section 420.160 through Section

Erosion and Sediment Control
Section 425.030. Introduction and Purpose. [Ord. No. 13-32 §1,
7-16-2013]
Section 425.040. Definitions. [Ord. No. 13-32 §1, 7-16-2013]
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Article shall
be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this Article its most reasonable application.
CERTIFIED CONTRACTOR — A person who has received training and is
licensed by the City of Carl Junction to inspect and maintain erosion and
sediment control practices.
CLEARING — Any activity that removes the vegetative surface cover.
DRAINAGE WAY — Any channel that conveys surface runoff throughout the
site.
EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PLAN — A set of plans prepared
by or under the direction of a licensed professional engineer indicating
the specific measures and sequencing to be used to control sediment and
erosion on a development site during and after construction.
EROSION CONTROL — A measure that prevents erosion.
GRADING — Excavation of fill of material, including the resulting conditions
thereof.
PERIMETER CONTROL — A barrier that prevents sediment from leaving a
site by filtering sediment-laden runoff or diverting it to a sediment trap or
basin.
PHASING — Clearing a parcel of land in distinct phases, with the
stabilization of each phase completed before the clearing of the next.
A. During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by
wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing
water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and
other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers
and ditches and the dredging of waterways. In addition, clearing and
grading during construction cause the loss of native vegetation
necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat.
B. As a result, the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard persons,
protect property, and prevent damage to the environment in Carl
Junction. This chapter will also promote the public welfare by guiding,
regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use, and
maintenance of any development or other activity that disturbs or
breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in Carl
Junction.

STABILIZATION — The use of practices that prevent exposed soil from
eroding.
START OF CONSTRUCTION — The first land-disturbing activity associated
with a development, including land preparation such as clearing, grading,
and filling; installation of streets and walkways; excavation for basements,
footings, piers, or foundations; erection of temporary forms; and installation
of accessory buildings such as garages.
WATERCOURSE — Any body of water, including, but not limited to, lakes,
ponds, rivers, streams, and bodies of water delineated by the City of Carl
Junction.

discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
B. Access To Facilities.
1. The City of Carl Junction shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this Article as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this Article. If a discharger
Section
425.260
ADOPTING ORDINANCE Section
425.290
AO:547
has security measures in force which require proper identification
and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall
make the necessary arrangements to allow access to
representatives of the City of Carl Junction.
2. Facility operators shall allow the City of Carl Junction ready access
to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept
under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater,
and the performance of any additional duties as defined by State
and Federal law.

permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of
the City of Carl Junction to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of
the facility's stormwater discharge.
4. The City of Carl Junction has the right to require the discharger to
install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling
and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own
expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality
shall be calibrated to ensure accuracy.
5. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the City of
Carl Junction and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such
access shall be borne by the operator.
6. Unreasonable delays in allowing the City of Carl Junction access to
a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit
and of this Article. A person who is the operator of a facility with an
NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial
activity commits an offense if the person denies the City of Carl
Junction reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose
of conducting any activity authorized or required by this Article.
7. If the City of Carl Junction has been refused access to any part of
the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is
able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this Article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this Article or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the City of Carl Junction may seek
issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.

Stormwater Pollutants by Use of Best Management Practices. [Ord.
No. 13-32 §1, 7-16-2013]
The City of Carl Junction will adopt requirements identifying best
management practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may
cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm
drain system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a
commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at its own expense,
reasonable protection from accidental discharge or prohibited materials or
other wastes into the municipal storm drain system of watercourses through
the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person
responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of
an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense,
additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further
discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity,
to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of
this Section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention
plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES
permit.
Section 425.310. Watercourse Protection. [Ord. No. 13-32 §1,

Communications Commission; or

Availability. [Ord. No. 93-20 §II, 8-24-1993]
4. The establishment or enforcement of any local ordinance or
regulation concerning customer service that imposes customer
service requirements that exceed, or address matters not
addressed by the standards set forth by the Federal
Communications Commission in Title 47 of the Code of Federal
Regulations Part 76, Subpart H.
A. Any operator of a cable system within the City of Carl Junction shall
maintain their system subject to the following minimum requirements:
1. The cable operator will maintain local, toll free or collect call
telephone access lines which will be available to the cable operator
subscriber twenty-four (24) hours per day seven (7) days a week.
a. Trained company representatives will be available for
customer telephone inquiries during normal business hours.
b. After normal business hours, the access line may be answered
by a service or an automated response system, including an
answering machine. Inquiries received after normal business
hours must be responded to by a trained company
representative within the first (1st) four (4) hours of the next
business day.
2. Under normal operating conditions, telephone answer time by a
customer representative, including wait time, shall not exceed
thirty (30) seconds when the connection is made. If the call needs
to be transferred, transfer time shall not exceed thirty (30)
seconds. These standards shall be met no less than ninety percent
(90%) of the time under normal operating conditions, as measured
on a weekly basis.
a. If a customer complains that their telephone call has not been
answered within the time limits herein established, the cable
television operator shall have the burden of proving either that
the telephone was answered within the time limits herein
established, or that the cable company does answer its
telephone calls within these time standards. In the absence of
affirmative evidence from the operator, demonstrating
compliance with this rule, credible evidence that a particular
call was not answered within these standards shall establish a
presumption that the operator is in violation of said rule.
b. The operator is hereby required to acquire telephone
equipment and perform surveys to measure compliance with
the telephone answering standards above, it being clear that
the operator has a historical record of complaints indicating a

Section 625.030. Customer Service Center. [Ord. No. 93-20 §III,

clear failure to comply with these types of standards in the
past.
3. The customer will receive a busy signal on the telephone no more
than three percent (3%) of the time. If a customer alleges that he/
she made two (2) successive telephone calls and each was the
subject of a busy signal, it shall be presumed that this standard has
been violated. However, on an affirmative showing by the company
of some extraordinary operating condition (a temporary outage due
to a storm is not an extraordinary operating condition) or that the
average for the customer for a busy signal is less than three
percent (3%), this presumption shall be overcome.
A. Under normal operating conditions, each of the following three (3)
standards will be met no less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the time
measured on a weekly basis.
1. Standards installation will be performed within seven (7) business
days after an order has been placed. "Standard" installations are
those that are located up to one hundred twenty-five (125) feet
from the existing distribution system. Other installations will be
performed within fourteen (14) business days after an order has
been placed. If a customer complains that he/she placed an order
and the installation was not completed within that period of time,
the company shall have the burden of proving compliance with this
standard, or providing a reasonable explanation of why the
standard was not met. Merely demonstrating statistical
compliance, without a specific reason why this particular
installation did not occur will not overcome the presumption of
neglect of these customer service standards.
2. Excluding conditions beyond the control of the operator (storm
damage is not a condition unexpected to the operator and is a
circumstance that the operator should anticipate and be within the
operator's control) the cable operator will begin working on
"service interruptions" promptly after being notified and shall
initiate a response no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the
interruption becomes known. The service interruption work should
be completed promptly thereafter as conditions require.
3. The cable operator shall establish an "appointment window" for
installations, service calls and other installation activities at a
specific time or, at maximum, a two (2) hour time block during
normal business hours. The operator may schedule service calls
and other installation activities outside of normal business hours
for the express convenience of the customer.

a. The cable operator may not cancel an appointment with a
customer after the close of the business day prior to the
scheduled appointment.
b. If a cable operator representative is running late for an
appointment with a customer and will not be able to keep the
appointment as scheduled, the customer will be contacted and
the appointment will be rescheduled as necessary. However,
this rescheduled appointment will be at a time which is
convenient for the customer and the cable operator will
provide a service representative at that time.
c. If the cable operator cancels an appointment less than two (2)
hours before the scheduled time or the beginning of the
"appointment window" the cable operator shall compensate
the customer for the inconvenience created by the cancellation
an amount equal to twenty-five dollars ($25.00) or twice the
customer's missed wages from work required to meet the
appointment, whichever is the greater amount. This
compensation shall be made to the customer within one
hundred twenty (120) hours of the canceled appointment; in
addition, the company shall provide credit for the customer
against its bill for the time that service was disconnected to the
extent that service was unavailable for twenty-four (24) hours
or more.
A. The cable operator shall provide written information on each of the
following areas at the time of installation of service; at least annually to
all subscribers; at any time upon request of any person; and shall
provide copies to the City which shall be available for distribution at the
City Hall:

system and in writing. Notice must be given to subscribers a minimum
of thirty (30) days in advance of such changes, unless the change is not

the burden of demonstrating that the change is not within his/her control,
and in so doing must make available documents showing previous costs
and increased costs, and when the cable operator became aware of them.
In addition to changes in cable rates, the cable operator shall notify

response shall be provided to the City. In the case of a telephone

Cross-Connection Control
Section 705.200. Cross-Connection Control — General Policy. [Ord.
No. 91-21 §I, 6-25-1991]
A. Purpose. The purpose of this Article is:
1. To protect the public potable water supply from contamination or
pollution by containing within the consumer's internal distribution
system or private water system contaminants or pollutants which
could backflow through the service connection into the public
potable water supply system.
2. To promote the elimination, containment, isolation, or control of
existing cross-connections, actual or potential, between the public
or consumer's potable water system and non-potable water
systems, plumbing fixtures, and industrial-process system.
3. To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of crossconnection
control which will systematically and effectively
prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
B. Application. This Article shall apply to all premises served by the public
potable water system of the City of Carl Junction.
C. Policy.
1. This Article will be reasonably interpreted by the Water Purveyor. It
is the Water Purveyor's intent to recognize the varying degrees of
hazard and to apply the principle so that the degree of protection
shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard.
2. The Water Purveyor shall be primarily responsible for the
protection of the public potable water distribution system from
contamination or pollution due to backflow or contaminants or
pollutants through the water service connection. The cooperation
of all consumers is required to implement and maintain the
program to control cross-connection. The Water Purveyor and
consumer are jointly responsible for preventing contamination of
the water system.
3. If, in the judgment of the Water Purveyor or his/her authorized
representative, cross-connection protection is required through
either piping modification or installation of an approved backflow
prevention device, due notice shall be given to the consumer. The
consumer shall immediately comply by providing the required
protection at his/her own expense; and failure, refusal, or inability
on the part of the consumer to provide such protection shall
constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises
until such protection has been provided.

units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
Superintendent and shall be located so as to be readily and easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection.
All grease traps shall be cleaned out as needed and inspected annually
with the inspection to be documented to the Public Works
Superintendent on an approved form. The inspections may be
completed by the company providing the cleaning and removal of
grease from the grease trap or in the case of small, under-sink grease
traps, the owner or manager of the facility may provide the
certification.
Facilities required to have a grease trap shall maintain records of the
cleaning and maintenance of all grease traps on the approved forms.
Such records shall be kept at the location of the facility required to have
a grease trap.
Failure to provide the certification and maintenance records shall result
in a one hundred dollar ($100.00) to one thousand dollar ($1,000.00)
fine.
If a City sewer backs up due to grease in the main, the facilities
connected to that portion of the collection system would be subject to
inspection including a review of the cleaning records.
Any facilities that have not cleaned the grease trap properly, or the
grease trap is not working properly, may be held liable for any damage
caused by the sewer back-up, even if the damage is to another facility
or property.

trap for the purpose of inspection during normal business hours.
Sizing and installation of grease traps shall meet current International
Building and Plumbing Code requirements.
G. Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided
for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his/her expense.
H. When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole together with such necessary metes and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling,
and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be
accessible and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance
with plans approved by the Superintendent. The manhole shall be
installed by the owner at his/her expense, and shall be maintained by
him/her so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
I. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of water
and wastes to which reference is made in this Chapter shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods
for the Examination of Water and Wastewater", published jointly by the
American Public Health Association, the American Water Works
Association, and the Water Pollution Control Federation, and shall be
determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has
been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the
nearest downtown manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by
customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon
the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life,
limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine
whether a twenty-four (24) hour) composite of all outfalls of a premise
is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD suspended solids analyses are obtained
from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are
determined from periodic grab samples).
J. No statement contained in this Chapter shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City
and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the City for treatment,
subject to payment, therefore, by the industrial concern.
