CHAPTER 48 – MARIJUANA ESTABLISHMENTS 
History: Added 10-16-2017 ATM, Article 12, approved by Attorney General 1-3-2018 
A. 	By vote approving Question 4 at the State election on November 8, 2016, the voters of the Commonwealth approved a law allowing the non-medical cultivation, distribution, possession and use of marijuana for recreational purposes (Chapter 334 of the Acts of 2016). Revised/amended law on the subject was enacted by the General Court and the Governor effective December 15, 2016 (Chapter 334 of the Acts of 2016) and, thereafter, on July 28, 2017 (Chapter 55 of the Acts of 2017). The new law is codified at G.L. c. 94G, and municipalities are authorized by Section 3 thereunder to adopt bylaws for the purpose of regulating said activities. The recently appointed Cannabis Control Commission is presently required to issue final State regulations regarding implementation of said law by March 15, 2018. Currently under the Mashpee Bylaws, Marijuana Establishments and Marijuana Retailers are not permitted uses in the Town and the regulations to be promulgated by the State Cannabis Control Commission are expected to provide significant guidance to the Town with respect to local regulation of Marijuana Establishments and Marijuana Retailers. 
The regulation of Recreational Marijuana Establishments and Marijuana Retailers raises novel and complex legal, planning, and public safety issues and the Town needs time to study and consider the regulation of Recreational Marijuana Establishments and Marijuana Retailers and address such novel and complex issues, as well as to address the potential impact of the prospective State regulations on local regulatory authority, and to undertake a planning process to consider amending the Town Bylaws regarding regulation of Recreational Marijuana Establishments and Marijuana Retailers and other uses related to the regulation of recreational marijuana. The Town intends to adopt a temporary moratorium on the local permitting and use of land and structures in the Town for Recreational Marijuana Establishments and Marijuana Retailers to allow the Town sufficient time to engage in a planning process to address the effects of such establishments and uses in the Town and to adopt Bylaw provisions in a manner consistent with sound public policy planning goals and objectives. 
B. 	Definitions 
The following definitions shall apply to Marijuana Establishments regulated hereunder:

CHAPTER 107-NITROGEN CONTROL BYLAW 
History: Added 10-20-2014 ATM, Article 13, approved by Attorney General 2-23-2015 
History: Amended 5-1-2017 ATM, Article 34, approved by Attorney General 10-31-2017 

§107-1 	Purpose: 
A town bylaw to conserve valuable waterways and other resources that increase our property values, that protect our unique environment vital to our economy, and that reduce the financial burden on taxpayers and property owners by regulating the outdoor application of nitrogen and phosphorous on turf. The regulation of fertilizer applications will reduce the overall amount 
of excess nitrogen and phosphorous entering the town’s resource areas as defined in the 
Mashpee Wetlands Protection Bylaw (§174-2) and regulations. Reducing excess phosphorous 
helps protect the water quality of Mashpee’s ponds and streams. Reducing excess nitrogen helps protect and improve water quality of Mashpee’s two (2) valuable estuaries-Waquoit Bay and Popponesset Bay-and their associated bays, coves and waterways; as well as Mashpee’s many ponds and streams. 
This town bylaw is also critical to reducing Mashpee’s Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) 
of nitrogen. Mashpee waters do not meet the Clean Water Act standards because of excess 
nitrogen entering the town’s estuaries. The Cape Cod Commission has estimated that reducing 
nitrogen from outdoor lawn applications to coastal estuaries and embayments by fifty (50) percent could save the taxpayers of Mashpee forty ($40,000,000) million dollars in sewering and other wastewater treatment expenses. Scientifically we know can be done without affective the quality of turf in Mashpee. 
§107-2 	Applicability: 
This bylaw shall apply to and regulate any and all applications of nitrogen and/or phosphorous (phosphate) fertilizer on managed turf areas within the Town of Mashpee. 
§107-3 	Definitions: 
“Agriculture” includes farming in all its branches, generally as the cultivation and tillage of the 
soil, dairying, the production, cultivation, growing and harvesting of any agricultural, floricultural, viticultural or horticultural commodities, and shellfishing, including preparations and delivery to storage or to market or to carriers for transportation to market. 
“Best Management Practices” (BMP”, means a sequence of activities designed to limit a 
nonpoint pollution source. For the purposes of the bylaw, BMP, means the most current edition 
of “Best Management Practices for Soil and Nutrient Management in Turf Systems”, prepared 
by University of Massachusetts Extension, Center for Agriculture, Turf Program. 
“Certified Fertilizer Applicator” means a person certified by the Cape Cod Commission, Cape Cod Cooperative Extension, or Town of Mashpee departments, or any combination thereof, to apply fertilizer and manage turf in conformance with BMP. 
“Compost” or “Organic Compost” means the biologically stable, humus-like material derived from composting or the aerobic, thermophilic decomposition of organic matter. 
“Fertilizer” means a substance that enriches the soil with elements essential for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium or other substances; fertilizer does not include those nutrients that are normally excluded from fertilizer such as chemicals that are part of horticultural gypsum, dolomite, limestone, lime, Jersey greensand, grass clippings, or compost topdressing; compost tea and liquid seaweed, as defined and applied in accordance with standards in Section 5(f), is also excluded from the definition of fertilizer. 
“Heavy Rain” is a rainfall greater than 0.25 inches per hour during the next twenty four (24) hour period or a rainfall of greater than one (1”) inch total in the next twenty four (24) hour 
period. 
“Impervious Surface” means any structure, surface, or improvement that reduces or prevents absorption of storm water into land, and includes concrete, asphalt, paver blocks, gravel, decks, patios, elevated structures, and other similar structures, surfaces, or improvements. 
“Lawn Patch Product” is premixed blend of grass seed, fertilizer, and mulch. 
“MDAR Fertilizer Regulations” means the most recent regulations of Mass General Law 330 CMR 31.00: “Plant Nutrient Application Requirements for Agricultural Land and Land Not Used for Agricultural Purposes”, developed by the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources (MDAR) pursuant to its authority under MGL c.128, Sections 2(k) and Section 65(A), as amended by St. 2012, c. 262. 330 CMR 31.00 
“Natural Organic Fertilizer” is a fertilizer product that is derived from either a plant or animal product containing one (1) or more elements, other than carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, which are essential for plant growth. These materials may be subject to biological degradation processes under normal conditions of aging, rainfall, sun-curing, air drying, composting, rotting, enzymatic or anaerobic or aerobic bacterial action or any combination of those conditions. These materials are not mixed with synthetic materials or changed in any physical or chemical manner from the material’s initial state except by manipulations such as drying, cooking, chopping, grinding, shredding, hydrolysis or pelleting. 
“Naturally Vegetated Buffer Zone” means areas of indigenous vegetation. Plantings may be 
considered as naturally vegetated if they meet the standards of the Mashpee Conservation Commission and include a low-growing herbaceous layer of vegetation, which includes grassland, heathland or meadow plantings. 
“Nitrogen” (N) means an element essential to plant growth. For the purposes of the bylaw, nitrogen may be available as slow-release, controlled-release, timed-release, slowly available, or water insoluble nitrogen, which means nitrogen in a form that delays its availability for plant uptake and use after application and is not readily available to turf and other plants; and/or quick-release, water soluble nitrogen which means nitrogen in a form that does not delay it availability for turf and other plant uptake and is rapidly available for turf and other plant uptake and use after application. 
“Natural-Based Fertilizer” is a fertilizer product that is derived primarily from either a plant or animal product containing one (1) or more elements, other than carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, which are essential for plant growth. These materials may be mixed with lesser amounts of synthetic materials. For the purposed of this bylaw, Natural-Based Fertilizers are exempt from the restrictions on the application of phosphorous containing fertilizers, if and only if, the phosphate or phosphorous is derived from a natural-organic source. 
“Person” is any individual, partnership, corporation, firm, association, authority, trust or group, 
including, but not limited to, a municipality, county, the Commonwealth and its agencies, and the federal government. 
“Phosphorus” (P) is one (1) of three (3) primary nutrients needed by turfgrasses. Although it 
is present in small amounts in turfgrass tissues (0.3-0.55 percent on a dry weight basis), phosphorous is extremely important for rooting, seedling development, cell division, and the synthesis of various compounds used by plants. Phosphorus (phosphates) can be supplied to turf as inorganic (synthetic) and/or natural organic fertilizers. Inorganic phosphorus fertilizers include superphosphates and ammonium phosphates. Natural organic fertilizers typically contain phosphorus derived from plant or animal by-products. 
“Phosphorus Containing Fertilizer” is turf fertilizer labeled for use on lawn or non-agricultural turf in which the available phosphate content is greater than 0.67% by weight, excluding Organic Compost, Natural Organic Fertilizer or Natural-Based Fertilizers where the phosphate is derived from natural-organic sources. 
“Saturated Ground” means soil soaked with moisture so that it cannot absorb any more liquid. 
“Soil Test” is a technical analysis of soil conducted by a laboratory using methods and 
procedures recommended by the University of Massachusetts Amherst Extension Program as appropriate for Commonwealth soils. 
“Turf, Lawn, or Sod” means any non-crop land area that is covered by any grass species, excluding meadows, grasslands, flower or vegetable gardens, pasture, hay land, trees, shrubs, turf grown on turf farms or any form of agricultural production or use. 
§107-4 Performance Standards

A. 	Any person who desires to obtain a CERTIFICATE from the COMMISSION shall file with the COMMISSION, in care of the office of the Town Clerk, an application for a CERTIFICATE of Appropriateness, of Non-Applicability or of Hardship, as the case may be. The application shall be accompanied by such plans, elevations, specifications, material and other information, including in the case of demolition or removal a statement of the proposed condition and appearance of the property thereafter, as may be reasonably deemed necessary by the COMMISSION to enable it to make a determination on the application. The Town Clerk shall certify the date of receipt of said application and shall forthwith transmit said application to the Chairman of the COMMISSION or another person designated by the COMMISSION. 
B. 	The COMMISSION or its designee shall determine within fourteen (14) days of the filing of an application for a CERTIFICATE whether said application involves any EXTERIOR ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES which are within the jurisdiction of the COMMISSION. 
C. 	If the COMMISSION or its designee determines that an application for a CERTIFICATE does not involve any EXTERIOR ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES, or involves an EXTERIOR ARCHITECTURAL FEATURE which is not subject to review by the COMMISSION under the provisions of this Chapter, the COMMISSION shall forthwith issue a CERTIFICATE of Non-Applicability. 
D. 	If the COMMISSION or its designee determines that such application involves any EXTERIOR ARCHITECTURAL FEATURE subject to review under this Chapter, the COMMISSION shall hold a public hearing on the application, except as may otherwise be provided in this Chapter, within forty five (45) days from the date of the filing of the application. At least fourteen (14) days before said public hearing, public notice shall be given by posting in a conspicuous place in Town Hall. Such notice shall identify the time, place and purpose of the public hearing. Concurrently, a copy of said public notice shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to: the applicant; to the owners of all adjoining properties and of other properties deemed by the COMMISSION to be materially affected thereby, all as they appear on the most recent applicable tax list; to the Planning Board; to any person filing a written request for notice of hearings, such request to be renewed yearly in December; and to such other persons as the COMMISSION shall deem entitled to notice. 
E. 	A public hearing on an application for a CERTIFICATE need not be held if such hearing is waived in writing by all persons entitled to notice thereof. In addition, a public hearing on an application for a CERTIFICATE may be waived by the COMMISSION if the COMMISSION determines that the EXTERIOR ARCHITECTURAL FEATURE involved, or its category, is so insubstantial in its effect on the DISTRICT that it may be reviewed by the COMMISSION without a public hearing. If the COMMISSION dispenses with a public hearing on an application for a CERTIFICATE, notice of such application shall be given to the owners of all adjoining property and of other property deemed by the COMMISSION to be materially affected thereby as above provided, and ten (10) days shall elapse after the mailing of such notice before the COMMISSION may act upon such application. 
F. 	Within sixty (60) days after the filing of an application for a CERTIFICATE, or within such further time as the applicant may allow in writing, the COMMISSION shall issue a CERTIFICATE or a disapproval. In the case of a disapproval of an application for a CERTIFICATE, the COMMISSION shall set forth in its disapproval the reasons for such disapproval. The COMMISSION may include in its disapproval specific recommendations for changes in the applicant's proposal with respect to the appropriateness of design, arrangement, texture, material and similar features that, if made and filed with the COMMISSION in a subsequent application, would make the application acceptable to the COMMISSION. 
G. 	The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the COMMISSION, including any Alternate Members designated to hear the application, shall be required to issue a CERTIFICATE. 
H. 	In issuing CERTIFICATES, the COMMISSION may, as it deems appropriate, impose certain conditions and limitations, and may require architectural or plan modifications consistent with the intent and purpose if this Chapter. 
I. 	If the COMMISSION determines that the CONSTRUCTION or ALTERATION or DEMOLITION for which an application for a CERTIFICATE of Appropriateness has been filed will be appropriate for or compatible with the preservation or protection of the DISTRICT, the COMMISSION shall issue a CERTIFICATE of Appropriateness. 
J. 	If the CONSTRUCTION or ALTERATION or DEMOLITION for which an application for a CERTIFICATE of Appropriateness has been filed shall be determined to be inappropriate and therefore disapproved, or in the event of an application for a CERTIFICATE of Hardship, the COMMISSION shall determine whether, owing to conditions especially affecting the BUILDING or STRUCTURE involved, but not affecting the DISTRICT generally, failure to approve an application will involve a substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the applicant and whether such application may be approved without substantial detriment to the public welfare and without substantial derogation from the intent and purposes of this Chapter. If the COMMISSION determines that owing to such conditions failure to approve an application will involve substantial hardship to the applicant and approval thereof may be made without such substantial detriment or derogation, the COMMISSION shall issue a CERTIFICATE of Hardship. 
K. 	The COMMISSION shall send a copy of its CERTIFICATES and disapprovals to the applicant and shall file a copy of its CERTIFICATES and disapprovals with the office of the Town Clerk and the Building Inspector. The date of issuance of a CERTIFICATE or disapproval shall be the date of the filing of a copy of such CERTIFICATE or disapproval with the office of the Town Clerk. 
L. 	If the COMMISSION should fail to issue a CERTIFICATE or a disapproval within sixty 
(60) days of the filing of the application for a CERTIFICATE, or within such further time as the applicant may allow in writing, the COMMISSION shall thereupon issue a CERTIFICATE of Hardship Due to Failure to Act. 
M. 	Each CERTIFICATE issued by the COMMISSION shall be dated and signed by its chairperson or such other person designated by the COMMISSION to sign such CERTIFICATES on its behalf. 
N. 	A PERSON AGGRIEVED by a determination of the COMMISSION may, within twenty days of the issuance of a CERTIFICATE or disapproval, file a written request with the COMMISION for a review by a person or persons of competence and experience in such matters, acting as arbitrator and designated by the regional planning agency. The finding of the person or persons making such review shall be filed with the Town Clerk within forty-five (45) days after the request, and shall be binding on the applicant and the COMMISSION, unless a further appeal is sought in the Superior Court as provided in Chapter 40C, §12A. The filing of such further appeal shall occur within twenty (20) days after the finding of the arbitrator has been filed with the office of the Town Clerk. 
§110-7 Criteria for Determinations: 
A. 	In deliberating on applications for CERTIFICATES, the COMMISSION shall consider, among other things, the historic and architectural value and significance of the site, BUILDING or STRUCTURE; the general design, proportions, detailing, mass, arrangement, texture, and material of the EXTERIOR ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES involved; and the relation of such EXTERIOR ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES to similar features of BUILDINGS and STRUCTURES in the surrounding area. 
B.

CHAPTER 126 – PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES 
History: Added 10-17-2016 ATM Article 26, approved by Attorney General 3-20-2017 
ARTICLE I – SINGLE-USE PLASTIC BAG 
§126-1 Purpose and Intent: 
The production, use and disposition of single-use plastic bags, as defined herein, has significant impacts on the marine and terrestrial environment of all coastal communities, including but not limited to: 
A. 	Contributing to the injury and even death of marine and terrestrial animals through ingestion and entanglement; 
B. 	Contributing to pollution and degradation of the terrestrial and coastal environment; 
C. 	Clogging our storm drainage systems; 
D. 	Creating mechanical and disposal of burdens for solid waste collection and recycling facilities; and 
E. 	Requiring the use of millions of barrels on on-renewable, polluting, fossil fuel nationally for their manufacture. 
1. 	
Studies have shown that even those plastic bags made from “biodegradable,” “compostable” or oxo-biodegradable” materials, which all require very specific and controlled environments to fulfill their claims, are for all intents and purposes identical to single-use high or low-density polyethylene plastic bags in their potential impacts to the environment as set forth above. Bags of these types are therefore also subject to the requirements here. 

2. 	
The goal of this bylaw is to join our neighboring towns on Cape Cod in protecting, conserving and enhancing our unique natural beauty and irreplaceable natural resources by phasing out, within the retail sector, the use of certain single-use plastic bags, as defined herein, and by encouraging the use of reusable bags within the retail and municipal sectors. Therefore, the Town of Mashpee seeks to phase out the use of single-use plastic bags by December 31, 2017.

History: Amended 10-2-1995 ATM, Article 10, approved by Attorney General 12-1-1995. History: Amended 5-6-1997 ATM, Article 34, approved by Attorney General 9-25-1997. 
1. 	Lands within one hundred (100’) feet of specific resource areas, and lands within two hundred (200’) feet of rivers, are presumed important to the protection of these resources because activities undertaken in close proximity to wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, creeks, estuaries, the ocean and/or other resource areas have a high likelihood of adverse impact upon them, either immediately, as a consequence of construction, or over time, as a consequence of daily operation or existence of activities. These adverse impacts from construction and use can include, without limitation, erosion, siltation, loss of groundwater recharge, poor water quality, and loss of wildlife habitat. The Commission therefore may require that the applicant maintain a continuous naturally vegetated buffer strip (NVBS) within the aforesaid one hundred (100’) foot (or two hundred (200’) feet for rivers) area with the aim of minimizing adverse impacts to resource areas and the wetland values of Chapter 172. (This requirement will not preclude access pathways through said NVBS, as determined by regulations for this Chapter.) Said NVBS shall be a minimum of fifty (50’) feet in width unless the applicant convinces the Commission (as per the provisions of Section 12 of this Chapter) that: 
(a) 	
The NVBS (or part of it) may be disturbed and/or diminished without harm to the values protected by this Chapter, or 

(b) 	
That reducing the scope of work/alteration is not possible. 


2. 	Areas within two hundred (200’) feet of rivers. 
(a) 	Notwithstanding the above, in the case of areas within two hundred (200’) feet of rivers, no permit issued hereunder shall permit any activities unless the applicant, in addition to meeting the otherwise applicable requirements of this Chapter, has proved by a preponderance of credible evidence that there is no practicable alternative to the proposed project with less adverse effects, and, as well, should there be no such practicable alternative, that such activities, including proposed mitigation measures, will have no significant adverse impact on the areas or values protected by this bylaw. The Commission shall regard as practicable an alternative which is reasonably available and capable of being done after taking into consideration the proposed property use, overall project purposes, logistics, existing technology, costs of the alternatives, and overall project costs. 
3. 	Waivers of Requirements. 
History: Amended 10-2-2000 ATM, Article 25, approved by Attorney General 1-12-2001. History: Amended 5-7-2001 ATM, Article 27, approved by Attorney General 8-17-2001. 
(a) 	
The Commission may, at its discretion for good cause shown, grant waivers from the requirements of one or more of the regulations and/or performance standards pursuant to Chapter 172. Such waivers are intended to be granted only in rare and unusual cases, and only when resource protection would be enhanced relative to preexisting conditions. 

(b) 	
A waiver shall be granted only for the following reasons and conditions: 

(1) 	
It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to provide the 

Commission with the necessary information and plans which the Commission may request in writing and/or at a public hearing, in order to enable the Commission to ascertain impacts to the wetland values of Chapter 172. The failure of the applicant to furnish any information which has been so requested shall result in the denial of a request for a waiver pursuant to this subsection. 

(2) 	
The Commission may grant a waiver from the regulations for Chapter 172 when portions of the Buffer Zone between the proposed project and adjacent resource area(s) are previously altered and/or are not within the control of the project owner/applicant, such as public or semi-public pedestrian and vehicular access-ways. 

(3) 	
The Commission may grant a waiver from the regulations for Chapter 172 only upon a finding by the Commission that a project will improve the natural capacity of a resource area to protect the wetland values identified in Section 1 of this bylaw.  Further, any waiver pursuant to this sub-section, will only be granted when: 




1) 	best-available technologies/methodologies are utilized to improve the natural capacity of any resource area to protect the relevant wetland values inherent to the site, and 
2) 	any adverse effects on wetland values are minimized, to the greatest extent feasible, by carefully considered conditions. However, no such waiver may be permitted for any project which could have an adverse effect on rare wildlife species. 
(4) 	The Commission may impose additional conditions in granting a permit pursuant to this Section, as deemed necessary or desirable to protect the wetland values of Chapter 172. Said conditions may include (but are not limited to) imposing limits on project size or effect, or requiring other compensatory measures, such as wetland replication, wildlife habitat enhancement and pollution attenuation measures. 
B. 	The Commission is empowered to deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements of this chapter; for failure to submit necessary information and plans requested by the Commission; for failure to meet the design specifications, performance standards and other requirements in regulations of the Commission; for failure to avoid or prevent unacceptable significant or cumulative effects upon the wetland values protected by this chapter; and where no conditions are adequate to protect those values. 
C. 	Unless a certificate of compliance is issued, a permit shall expire three (3) years from the date of issuance. Notwithstanding the above, the Commission, in its discretion, may issue a permit expiring five (5) years from the date of issuance for recurring or continuous maintenance work, provided that annual notification of time and location of work is given to the Commission. Any order of conditions may be extended an additional three (3) years through the filing of a request for an Extension of Order of Conditions (WPA Form 7), provided that a request for renewal is received in writing by the Commission prior to the original date of expiration. Approval of permit extension requests shall be at the discretion of the Commission. 
History: 	Amended 5-4-2015 ATM, Article 23, approved by Attorney General 8-11-2015 
1. a written request for renewal is received at least thirty (30) days prior to the 
expiration date of the original permit (issued under Chapter 172); 
and that the Commission finds that: 
2. 	
delays in initiating or completing the originally permitted work were unavoidable (including, but not limited to, appeals or inability to obtain other, applicable permits); 

3. 	
current information indicates that the provisions of the original permit remain adequate to protect wetland values of Chapter 172. The Commission may, if it deems it necessary, require updated plans and/or other information to make this determination; 

4. 	
permitted incomplete work meets the current provisions and regulations of Chapter 172 (as in effect at the time of the receipt of the written request for renewal); 

5. 	
incomplete work is not causing damage to the wetland values of Chapter 172; 

6. 	
work already completed is in compliance with the provisions of the original permit. 


History: Amended 5-5-2003 ATM, Article 17, approved by Attorney General 8-27-2003. 
D. 	For good cause the Commission may revoke or modify a permit issued under this chapter after public notice and public hearing and notice to the holder of the permit. The time requirements specified in §172-5 shall be applicable. 
E. 	The Commission, in an appropriate case, may combine the permit or other action on an application issued under this chapter with the order of conditions issued under the Wetlands Protection Act. 
F. 	The Commission shall require that a permit issued hereunder (an Order of Conditions) be recorded in the Registry of Deeds, or, if the land affected thereby be registered land, in the registry district of the Land Court for the district wherein the land lies.  The work proposed in said Order of Conditions shall not begin until the holder of the Order of Conditions provides documentation in a form prescribed by the Commission as proof that said Order of Conditions has been recorded.

J. 	Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers/Registered Marijuana Dispensary 
By vote at the State Election on November 6, 2012, the voters of the Commonwealth approved Ballot Question 3 authorizing legislation regulating the cultivation, distribution, possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes and the establishment of Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers. Said law became effective on January 1, 2013. 
The Commonwealth has adopted regulations implementing said law under 105 CMR 
725.000. Subsection 725.004 defines Medical Marijuana Treatment Center as “a not-for-profit entity registered under 105 CMR 725.000, to be known as a registered marijuana dispensary (RMD) that acquires, cultivates, possesses (including development of related products such as edible MIPs, tinctures, aerosols, oils, or ointments), processes, transfers, transports, sells, distributes, dispenses, or administers marijuana products containing marijuana, related supplies, or educational materials to registered qualifying patients or their personal caregivers. Unless otherwise specified, RMD refers to the site(s) of dispensing, cultivation, and preparation of marijuana.” An MIP as defined by Subsection 725.004 is a “Marijuana-Infused Product” meaning ‘a product infused with marijuana that is intended for use or consumption, including but not limited to edible products, ointments, aerosols, oils and tinctures.” 105 CMR 725.100(A)(4) also provides that an RMD may have two (2) locations if marijuana will be cultivated or MIPs will be prepared at any location other than the dispensing location of the proposed RMD. 105 CMR 725.000 contains additional definitions and regulations relative to the registration, establishment, operations and regulations of such Centers/Dispensaries, as 
well as “hardship cultivation registration” by the Massachusetts Department of Public 
Health. Nothing in this Chapter is intended to regulate or prohibit uses or activities under 
a “hardship cultivation registration”. 
105 CMR 725.600 provides that a RMD shall comply with all local rules, regulations, ordinances, and bylaws and that nothing in 105 CMR 725.000 shall be construed so as to prohibit lawful oversight and regulations including fee requirements, that does not conflict or interfere with the operation of 105 CMR 725.000. Pursuant to those provisions, the following standards shall apply to Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers/Registered Marijuana Dispensaries proposed for approval under this Zoning Bylaw. 
1. 	Any such Center/Dispensary shall require approval of a Special Permit for said use, pursuant to the provisions of §174-24. Any application for such Special Permit shall include all plans and other materials required under §174-24 and under Special Permit regulations adopted by the applicable Special Permit granting authority, including a detailed floor plan of the premises that identifies the square footage available and describes the functional area of the Center/Dispensary and, if applicable, such information for the single allowable off-premises location, if located in Mashpee, where marijuana will be cultivated of MIPs will be prepared. If two (2) locations are involved, both shall be located in an I-1 Industrial Zoning District and each shall require a separate Special Permit. The Special Permit granting authority for a second location where marijuana will be cultivated or MIPs will be prepared shall be based on the size of the facility, as provided in §174-24 
C.1. 
2. 	
If the Center/Dispensary is proposed to be located in an existing building or commercial center, a separate Special Permit shall be required for said Center/Dispensary, in addition to that previously approved for the building or commercial center, which may also serve as a modification of the previously-approved Special Permit. In such situations, the Special Permit granting authority which approved the most recent Special Permit, if any, for the existing building or commercial center, shall be the Special Permit granting authority for the proposed Center/Dispensary. 

3. 	
Any such Center/Dispensary shall not be located within five hundred (500’) feet of a public or private kindergarten, primary or secondary school, a place of worship, a day nursery, nursery school, etc. as listed in §174-25 B.(10) or a public park or playground.  No other specific separation requirements will apply. 

4. 	
Any such Center/Dispensary shall be compliant with requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines and the regulations of the Massachusetts Architectural Access Board. 

5. 	
No such Center/Dispensary may be approved for operation, or remain in operation, without a certificate of registration issued by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Should said certificate not be renewed, or be revoked, the Special Permit shall lapse and the Center/Dispensary shall be closed forthwith. The certificate of registration shall be posted in a conspicuous location inside the premises at each approved location. 


6. 	Any such Center/Dispensary shall be compliant at all times with the security measures required by 105 CMR 725.000. A description of such measures, including any updates, shall be provided to the Mashpee Police Department, along with after-hours contact information. Security measures shall be implemented to deter and prevent unauthorized entrance into areas containing marijuana and theft of marijuana, and to protect the premises, registered qualifying patients, persona caregivers, and dispensary agents of the Center/Dispensary. Security measures shall include sufficient lighting of the outside perimeter of the Center/Dispensary to facilitate surveillance. In addition, notwithstanding any other provisions of the Chapter regarding required landscaping or vegetated buffers, trees, bushes and other foliage located on the site outside the Center/Dispensary shall be located (or removed) so they do not allow for a person or persons to conceal themselves from sight within fifty (50’) feet of any entrance or any parking spaces designated to be utilized by registered qualifying patients, personal caregivers, and dispensary agents of the Center/Dispensary. 
7. 	Storage of marijuana shall be in compliance with 105 CMR 725.105(D) and cultivation, production, preparation, transport or analysis shall be done in a manner to prevent diversion, theft or loss.  All phases of the cultivation of marijuana shall take place in designated, locked, limited access areas that are monitored by a surveillance camera system in accordance with 105 CMR 725.110(D)(1)(d)-(i). Inside the Center/Dispensary, all marijuana and MIPs shall be kept in a limited access area inaccessible to any persons other than dispensary agents, with the exception of displays allowable under 105 CMR 725.105(L)(10). Inside the 
Center/Dispensary, all marijuana shall be stored in a locked, access-controlled 
space in a limited access area during non-business hours. 
8. 	
Any such Center/Dispensary shall adopt emergency procedures, including a disaster plan with procedures to be followed in case of fire or other emergencies, copies of which shall be filed with the Mashpee Police and Fire Departments. 

9. 	
External signage shall not be limited except for a period of thirty (30) minutes before sundown until closing, and shall comply with the provisions of Article X of this bylaw, except that only one (1) building sign and one (1) freestanding sign 

shall be allowed, neither of which may exceed ten (10’) square feet in signboard area (freestanding sign may be two (2) sided, with each side limited to ten (10’) square feet, or may be included in a ladder sign or similar sign identifying the business within a multi-tenant property). Neon or other internally-lit signage is prohibited at all times.  Pursuant to 105 CMR 725.000, signage may only identify the Center/Dispensary by its Massachusetts DPH registered name and there shall be no display on the exterior of the facility of any advertisements for marijuana or any brand name, nor any graphics related to marijuana or paraphernalia. 

10. 	
Marijuana, MIPs and associated products shall not be displayed or clearly visible to a person from the exterior of the Center/Dispensary. No more than one (1) sample of each product offered for sale may be displayed in secure, locked cases, which may be transparent, in the interior of the Center/Dispensary. 

11. 	
Parking requirements for a Center/Dispensary shall be those applicable to retail establishments for that portion of the floor designated for sales, and to manufacturing or other industrial buildings for floor area designated for storage or for cultivation of marijuana or preparation of MIPs.

K. 	Where a use is not specifically listed in the §174-25 Table of Use Regulations, said use may be allowed if a finding is made by the Zoning Board of Appeals that said use may be allowed in a specific district on the basis that it is substantially similar in its construction, operation, traffic and environmental impact to a specific use allowed as of right or by Special Permit in said district and it is substantially dissimilar in those respects from any uses prohibited in the district. Where the Zoning Board of Appeals cannot make a clear determination, such uses shall be considered prohibited. No use specifically listed in the Table of Use Regulations shall be allowed by the Zoning Board of Appeals in any district where it is prohibited. In reviewing an application for a finding under this subsection, the procedure applicable for a Special Permit shall be followed by the applicant and the Zoning Board of Appeals, although the finding itself shall not constitute a Special Permit as defined by the general laws and this by-law. Where the use to which he Board determines the proposed use is similar requires a Special Permit or approval under the Plan Review process, any development including said use shall then require approval from the board specified under the provisions of §174-24 C or by the Plan Review Committee under the provisions of §174-24 B, as appropriate.

Or loading per person: five (5) pounds nitrogen per person per year; four-tenths (0.4) pound phosphorus per person per year, assuming two and one-half (2.5) persons per dwelling unit. 

(b) 	
Non-residential wastewater loading: For commercial and industrial developments, nitrogen and phosphorus calculations shall be derived from expected wastewater generation as specified by Title V of MGL C. 21A, §13. 

(c) 	
Loading from lawn fertilizer: 1.08 pounds nitrogen and 0.0069 pound phosphorous per one thousand (1,000’) square feet per year, with five thousand (5000’) sq. ft. average lawn size assumed per lot in a single-family subdivision. 

(d) 	
Loading from stormwater: 1.5 mg/l nitrogen for road runoff 0.75 mg/l for roof runoff and 0.072 mg/l for natural areas; or alternately, nine-hundredths (0.09) pound nitrogen per road mile per day. Phosphorous 0.00048 pound per road mile per day. 


5. 	The existing condition of the receiving water body or water supply (existing or proposed), including physical characteristics and water chemistry. Data may be derived from the Massachusetts Estuaries Project final reports referenced in Section B(1)d. above and associated reports, or on more recent data acceptable to the Planning Board. Any new measurement of existing surface water quality must include sampling during summer (peak population) conditions. Measurements shall specifically include concentrations of nitrate and sodium in public water 
supply wells, phosphorus in freshwater bodies and total nitrogen in saltwater 
bodies. 
History: Amended 10-16-2006 ATM, Article 27, approved by Attorney General 2-13-2007. 
6. 	
The expected change in the condition of the water body or water supply as a result of the proposed development. 

7. 	
The comparison, on a total kilograms and a kilograms per-acre basis, of the total nitrogen loading from the proposed development with the TMDL (total maximum daily load) target nitrogen loading established for the sub-watershed in which the project is located by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. 


History: Amended 10-16-2006 ATM, Article 27, approved by Attorney General 2-13-2007. 
8. 	Test well completion reports and logs, including elevation of top of casing and static groundwater elevation based on United States Geological Survey datum, surveyed location based on the Massachusetts Coordinate Plane or true North and tied to an established roadway or property bound, water quality reports on levels of sodium, iron, manganese, chloroform, benzene, phosphorous, total chloroform bacteria, pH, conductivity, nitrate-nitrogen, carbon tetrachloride, lead, phenolics, PCB (1254), PCB(1260), Trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene and 1,1,1,­trichloroethane and depth ranges of the various soils and sediment layers found in development of each well. Unless the Board of Health recommends otherwise, such information shall be provided for at least two (2) pairs of test wells per ten 
(10) proposed lots or units or per ten (10) acres of commercial or industrial land to be developed [with one (1) well installed to a depth of six (6’) feet below the groundwater table and one (1) installed to a depth of one hundred (100’) feet below the ground surface], with such wells to be installed using PVC or other casing approved by the Board of Health with a protective locking cover grouted in place.  No wells will be required for fewer than ten (10) lots or units or ten (10) acres of commercial or industrial land unless the Board of Health determines that there is sufficient cause to believe that there may be significant groundwater contamination present at the site. Such walls shall be installed at locations approved by the Board of Health and shall be left permanently in place for future water quality monitoring. 
History: Amended 10-16-2006 ATM, Article 27, approved by Attorney General 2-13-2007. 
C. 	No definitive subdivision plan or Special Permit subject to the provisions of this section may be approved by the Planning Board unless it has determined, after reviewing the water quality report and any comments from the Board of Health, that the proposed project will not have a significant adverse effect on public health or safety, aquatic vegetative resources, any fisheries or shellfish beds or other wildlife due to hazardous or toxic materials, roadway drainage or sedimentation or excessive nutrient levels.  Where feasible, the Board shall ensure that the nutrient contribution of the proposed development, when added to the existing and potential nutrient level of other development and acreage within the specific recharge area, will not result in nutrient levels that exceed the receiving surface waters’ critical eutrophic level or, in the case of well-recharge areas, nitrate-nitrogen concentrations in the well in excess of five (5) parts per million. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate that any proposed mitigating measures required to produce a negative determination regarding the above items will work as designed, and the Planning Board may require, as a condition of any approval, that the applicant or his successor demonstrate on an annual basis that said mitigating measures are operating satisfactorily. The Board may also require the submission of an appropriate performance bond to guarantee satisfactory operation of said mitigating measures, the development, implementation and funding of an appropriate water quality monitoring program to measure any impacts of the 
development or to safeguard the health of the development’s occupants, or any other 
measures they deem necessary to ensure no significant adverse impact on the items noted above.

§174-27.2 	Stormwater Management History: Added -5-3-1999, ATM, Article 45, approved by Attorney General 7-29-1999. 
A. 	For any new residential or non-residential development requiring either subdivision approval, a Special Permit, plan review under the provisions of §174-24.B., or a Building Permit for a building over one thousand (1000’) square feet in area a system of stormwater management and artificial recharge of precipitation shall be required which is designed to achieve the following purposes: prevent untreated discharges to wetlands and surface waters, preserve hydrologic conditions that closely resemble pre-development conditions, reduce or prevent flooding by managing the peak discharges and volumes of runoff, minimize erosion and sedimentation, not result in significant degradation of groundwater, reduce suspended solids, nitrogen, volatile organics and other pollutants to improve water quality and provide increased protection of sensitive natural resources. 
History: Amended 10-4-1999, ATM, Article 32, approved by Attorney General 1-11-2000. 
B. 	These standards may be met using the following or similar best management practices: 
1. 	For new single or two-family residences, recharge shall be attained through site design that incorporates natural drainage patterns and vegetation in order to maintain pre-development stormwater patterns and water quality to the greatest extent possible. Stormwater runoff from rooftops, driveways and other impervious surfaces shall be routed through vegetated water quality swales, as sheet flow over lawn areas or to constructed stormwater wetlands, sand filters, organic filters and/or similar systems capable of removing nitrogen from stormwater. 
History: 	Amended 10-4-1999, ATM, Article 32, approved by Attorney General 1-11-2000. 
2. 	For new subdivision roadways or for lots occupied or proposed to be occupied by uses other than single or two-family homes, a stormwater management plan which; 
(a) 	
utilizes site planning and building techniques, such as minimizing impervious surfaces and disturbance of existing natural areas, pervious reserve or overflow parking areas, multi-level buildings, parking structures, “green roofs” and storage and re-use of roof runoff, to minimize runoff volumes and the level treatment required to reduce contaminants, 

(b) 	
minimizes erosion and runoff from disturbed areas during construction and 

(c) 	
provides for artificial recharge or precipitation to groundwater through site design that incorporates natural drainage patterns and vegetation and through the use of constructed (stormwater) wetlands, bioretention facilities, vegetated filter strips, rain gardens, wet (retention) ponds, water quality swales, organic filters or similar-site-appropriate current best management practices capable of removing significant amounts of nitrogen and other contaminants from stormwater. Said stormwater treatment facilities shall be designed and sized to retain up to the first inch of rainfall from their catchment area within the area designed for nitrogen treatment, before any overflow to subsurface leaching facilities and otherwise meet the Stormwater Management Standards and technical guidance contained in the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection’s Stormwater Management Handbook, Volumes 1 and 2, dated March 1997, for the type of use proposed and the soil types present on the site. Such runoff shall not be discharged directly to rivers, streams, other surface water bodies, wetlands or vernal pools. Except for overflow from stormwater treatment facilities as described above and when there are no other feasible alternatives, dry wells shall be prohibited. Except when used for roof runoff from non-galvanized roofs and for runoff from minor residential streets, all such wetlands, ponds, swales or other infiltration facilities shall be preceded by oil, grease and sediment traps or forebays or other best management practices to facilitate control of hazardous materials spills and removal of contamination and to avoid sedimentation of treatment and leaching facilities. All such artificial recharge systems shall be maintained in full working order by the owner(s) under the provisions of an operations and maintenance plan approved by the permitting authority to assure that systems function as designed. Infiltration systems shall be located so that no part of any leaching system is located less than one hundred (100) feet from drinking water wells. Any infiltration basins or trenches shall be constructed with a three (3’) foot minimum separation between the bottom of the leaching system and maximum groundwater elevation.

§174-40 	Accessways in Non-Residential Districts: 
In the C-1, C-2, C-3 and I-1 zoning districts, there shall be required a minimum separation of two hundred (200’) feet between the centerline of any accessway to Routes 28, 151 or 130 or to Great Neck Road North and any other such accessway or to the sideline of any street intersecting said roadways. Said minimum separation shall also be maintained between any accessway to a street intersecting said roadways and the sideline of said roadways. Where a lot in existence on October 7, 1996 has inadequate frontage to meet these separation requirements, the maximum feasible separation shall be maintained and only one (1) accessway shall be allowed to the lot.  Where a lot has frontage on said roadways as well as on a street or streets intersecting said roadways, accessways shall be allowed only onto said intersecting streets, except where a right-turn-only entrance is approved by the Massachusetts Highway Department or Mashpee Director of Public Works, as appropriate. No accessway for parking may enter into a main road leading into Mashpee Circle (Pine Tree Corner) at a point closer than six hundred (600’) feet from the center of Mashpee Circle, provided that all existing uses and accessways may be maintained in their current conditions.

§174-41 	Parking Lot Design History: Amended 10-20-2003 ATM, Article 12, approved by Attorney General 11-14-2003. 
A. 	Where drive-through window facilities are proposed, stacking lanes of an appropriate length shall be provided separately from any parking aisle or emergency access lane. 
B. 	Access for Fire Department vehicles to all structures shall be provided as recommended by the Fire Department and shall provide sufficient inside and outside radius to 
accommodate the Department’s ladder truck, including truck overhangs. 
C. 	Interconnection between parking areas on adjacent commercial properties shall be required where appropriate. 
D. 	All parking stalls shall be provided with adequate space for backing out, including turnarounds or Ts at the end of dead-end parking aisles. 
E. 	Driveways and parking aisles shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles.  No driveways or aisles shall intersect at less than sixty (60°) degrees. 
F. 	Unless alternate paving is approved by the permitting authority, all parking areas and driveways shall be constructed on a base of not less than eight (8”) inches of good binding gravel or other suitable road base material, properly shaped and compacted. Where the subsoil consists of peat or similar spongy material, it shall be excavated and replaced with solid fill as necessary to support the finished surface. All parking areas and driveways required to meet the minimum parking space requirements of §174-39 shall be paved with a minimum of two and one half (2½”) inches of bituminous concrete, type I, consisting of one and one-half (1½”) inches of binder course and one (1”) inch of surface course, both properly compacted by a ten-ton roller.  Where additional overflow parking areas are proposed, the base shall be constructed as above, but alternate materials or grass may be used as a finished surface if approved by the permitting authority. 
G. 	The perimeter of any parking area over ten (10) spaces and any driveway or parking lot islands shall have curbs and gutters of granite, cast-in-place concrete or other edge treatment, not including bituminous concrete, suitable to control parking lot drainage, prevent erosion and maintain the pavement edge in good condition. A minimum five (5’) foot radius shall be required for all vertical barrier curbs adjacent to parking lot driveways, islands and planting areas, with a fifteen (15’) foot radius preferred along major driveways or those expected to be used by significant numbers of trucks or large vehicles. 
H. 	Parking facilities shall be sloped a minimum of three quarter (¾%) percent to drainage grate inlets, catch basins or curb inlets and in all cases shall be constructed so that ponding of drainage within the paved surface shall not occur.  Stormwater from parking areas shall be treated to minimize the amount of nitrogen reaching groundwater to the greatest extent feasible. 
I. 	No structure, fence, post or other solid object other than curbing shall be allowed within three (3’) feet of the paved surface of any parking area or driveway, except for shopping cart storage areas and handicapped access or preferred parking signs authorized by the permitting authority. 
J. 	Sidewalks shall be provided where appropriate along the perimeter of the parking area and within parking lot islands to facilitate safe movement of pedestrians. 
K. 	No parking area will be allowed within ten (10’) feet of the property line of abutting property owners, or such larger buffer area distance as may be required by the Zoning By-law. The minimum buffer area may be reduced by the permitting authority if written endorsement of such reduction is received from the owner of the abutting property. Such setback area shall be left in its natural state, or revegetated in conformance with the requirements of the Zoning By-law in accordance with plans approved by the permitting authority. Larger buffer areas may be required where the parking area abuts residential property, publicly-owned parcels, water bodies or wetlands or where such buffer is required to maintain existing scenic or historic vistas from public ways or public lands. 
L. 	In addition to any undisturbed buffer areas required by the permitting authority or the Zoning By-law, the use of landscaped berms or additional plantings to screen parking areas from view from abutting properties or public roadways is encouraged. 
M. 	For projects involving more than ten (10) parking spaces, any parking area (i.e. the area within any proposed parking field) shall have a minimum ratio of 1:5 of landscaping or natural area to paved area unless the permitting authority determines that, due to the shape or configuration of the parking area such landscaping would be impractical. Natural vegetation shall be retained in any such landscaped area to the greatest extent possible. 
N. 	Site and parking lot design should preserve any large or outstanding trees, specimen trees or groves of trees to the greatest extent possible. No trees over ten (10) inches in diameter at breast height may be removed without approval of the permitting authority for the project.  Large parking lot islands are encouraged to help accomplish such preservation, to provide opportunities for denitrification of stormwater runoff and to improve the visual character of the parking area. 
O. 	Plantings shall not be located within three (3’) feet of the curb or pavement edge, to allow for car overhangs, unless low-lying ground cover is used. 
P. 	Plantings shall be installed in exact accordance with planned dimensions to avoid any adverse change in parking due to improper location. 
Q. 	Irrigation facilities shall be installed, unless the permitting authority determines that it is infeasible or unnecessary, to ensure proper maintenance of parking lot landscaping.  Water for in-ground irrigation shall be provided from private wells unless the Mashpee Water District specifically authorizes connection to the municipal water system for irrigation use. 
R. 	No more than forty (40%) percent of the area within the drip line of any tree to be planted or retained within or adjacent to a parking area, when fully grown, may be made impervious, unless a certified arborist or landscape architect can demonstrate that the long-term health of such tree will not be adversely affected. 
§174-42 Loading facilities: 
Appropriately sized and designed off-street truck loading/unloading and parking spaces shall 
be provided for all retail and industrial projects, for any “dumpster” location and for other development as required. Loading docks shall be constructed with eight (8’) inches of suitable road base material and a three (3’) inch bituminous concrete surface or twelve (12’) inches of suitable road base material and six (6”) inches of reinforced cement concrete as appropriate to the use. Loading docks should be sloped, and may be required to incorporate a stormwater capture structure capable of capturing and holding hazardous materials spills, with sizing dependent upon use. Loading facilities shall not interfere with use of, or circulation within, roadways, driveways or parking areas. If approved by the Planning Board as part of a Commercial Center, OSID or other mixed-use project, appropriately sized on-street loading zones may be used 
§174-43 Spaces for commercial centers: 
For commercial centers with less than fifty thousand (50,000’) square feet of gross leasable floor area, parking shall be provided as required for the individual uses under §174-39. For Commercial centers containing at least fifty thousand (50,000’) square feet of gross leasable floor area, parking requirements shall be computed as follows unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the permitting authority by means of data and studies from similar projects, that shared parking, staggered hours of operation or peak parking use and multi-purpose trips justify a reduced number of required spaces.

F. 	No site for such use may have more than one (1) direct vehicle access way to Routes 28 or 151 or more than two (2) direct vehicle accesses to any other abutting street not created as part of the commercial center, and such access ways shall intersect the abutting street at a ninety (90°) degree angle, unless the Planning Board approves a different intersection angle. Additional access ways may be approved by the Planning Board, where they are found to be necessary for reasons of safety or proper traffic flow. Where the commercial center will be subdivided into multiple lots, there shall be no separate vehicle access from any individual lot within the development onto Route 28, Route 151 or Great Neck Road North. 
A traffic impact report, indicating projected traffic flows from the project at its build out, projected traffic flows and levels of service on nearby roadways in five (5) years and at build out of the development, current traffic flows, levels of service and accident records for said roadways, projected capacity, service level and safety problems anticipated in five (5) years and at project build out, proposed mitigation measures and approximate costs in current dollars and other relevant information shall be submitted as part of the application and explained to the Board at a public meeting by a competent professional traffic engineer or transportation planner. The Planning Board may require traffic signals, traffic or turn lanes, sidewalks, bikeways or any other mitigation measures that it believes necessary to protect public safety and maintain proper traffic flow on roadways within or impacted by the development. 
Streets and drives within the development shall be constructed in accordance with the Planning Board’s subdivision and Special Permit regulations, except that the Board may require additional sidewalks, traffic lanes, turn lanes, traffic signals or other items as necessary. Projected traffic may be calculated on the basis of firm projections of uses and floor areas when available, on the basis of one hundred sixty six (166) average weekday trip ends per one thousand (1000’) square feet of gross leasable floor area, or on shopping center vehicle trip generation rates contained in the latest edition of Trip Generation by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. In performing such calculations where there is no firm estimate of gross leasable floor area, estimated area shall be calculated based on twice the maximum lot coverage allowed for the project.

H. 	A commercial center may be approved as a single-phase project or may be approved as a master plan involving multiple phases. Prior to construction or installation of structures, signage and landscaping plans shall be submitted to the Design Review Committee for its review at a public meeting. Upon receiving the recommendations of the Design Review Committee, the Planning Board may approve said plans, approve with modifications or deny approval and require resubmission to the Design Review Committee. Until the Planning Board has finally approved said plans, no Building Permits may be issued nor shall any of the proposed work be begun. The Planning Board shall require that a schedule of architectural, signage and/or landscaping controls be adopted for the development, enforceable by the Town's Special Permit authority as well as deed restrictions on the development and any lots to be sold, unless specific building, signage and landscape designs are submitted for all portions of the project. Such controls shall have the effect of promoting design that is in keeping with the character of the Town and of Cape Cod. Any proposed schedule of architectural, signage and landscaping controls shall require review by the Design Review Committee and its report to the Planning Board prior to approval of the Special Permit application for the development. If such a schedule of architectural, signage and/or landscaping controls is required, it shall be recorded as a deed restriction on the property at the same time as the Special Permit is recorded and the Planning Board shall be provided forthwith a copy of the recorded documents indicating the registry book and page at which each is recorded.

When any personal wireless service facility or portion thereof is proposed to exceed forty (40’) feet in height, Special Permit or plan review approval shall require a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Determination of No Hazard or evidence of exemption from the determination process. 
History: 10-16-2006 ATM, Article 30, approved by Attorney General 2-13-2007. 
2. 	
Height, Ground-Mounted Facilities -Ground-mounted personal wireless service facilities shall not project higher than ten (10’) feet above the average building height or, if there are no buildings within three hundred (300’) feet, these facilities shall not project higher than ten (10’) feet above the average tree canopy height, measured from ground level (AGL). If there are no buildings within three hundred (300’) feet of the proposed site of the facility, all ground-mounted personal wireless service facilities shall be surrounded by dense tree growth to screen views of the facility in all directions. These trees may be existing on the subject property or planted on site. 

3. 	
Height, Side-and Roof-Mounted Facilities -Side-and roof-mounted personal wireless service facilities shall not project more than ten (10’) feet above the height of an existing building nor project more than ten (10’) feet above the height limit of the zoning district within which the facility is located. Personal wireless service facilities may be located on an existing building that is legally nonconforming with respect to height, or has received a height variance, provided that the facilities do not project above the existing building height. 

4. 	
Height, Existing Structures -New antennas located on any of the following structures existing on the effective date of this bylaw shall be exempt from the height restrictions of this bylaw provided that there is no increase in height of the existing structure as a result of the installation of a personal wireless service facility: water towers, guyed towers, lattice towers, fire towers and monopoles. 

5. 	
Height, Existing Structures, (Utility) -New antennas located on any of the following existing structures shall be exempt from the height restrictions of this bylaw, provided that there is no more than a twenty (20’) foot increase in the height of the existing structure as a result of the installation of a personal wireless service facility: electric transmission and distribution towers, telephone poles and similar existing utility structures. This exemption shall not apply in Historic Districts, within three hundred (300’) feet of structures or places listed in the Massachusetts State Register of Historic Places, within one hundred (150’) feet of the 

right-of-way of any designated scenic roadway, or within three hundred (300’) feet of any Great Pond or tidal water body. 

6. 	
Height, Wireless Facility Overlay District -Within the Wireless Facility Overlay District (as described in §174-5.C.), personal wireless service facilities of up to one hundred (100’) feet in height may be permitted by Special Permit, except that the Planning Board may grant a waiver to allow a height of up to two hundred (200’) feet where circumstances warrant (e.g. no serious impact on neighboring properties, residential areas, historic districts, historic places or scenic vistas, along with the opportunity to eliminate a larger number of towers of lower height which might result in such impacts). Monopoles are the preferred type of mount for such taller structures. Such structures shall comply with all setback and Special Permit Regulations set forth in this Bylaw.  

7. 	
Setbacks -All personal wireless service facilities and their equipment shelters shall comply with the building setback provisions of the zoning district in which the facilities are located. In addition, the following setbacks shall be observed: 

(a) 	
In order to ensure public safety and prevent hazards to people and neighboring property from potential facility collapse or falling ice or other debris, the minimum distance from the base of any ground-mounted personal wireless service facility to any property line, road, habitable dwelling, business or institutional use, or public recreational area shall be the height of the facility/mount, including any antennas or other appurtenances. This setback is considered a "fall zone". 

(b) 	
In the event that an existing structure is proposed as a mount for a personal wireless service facility, a fall zone shall not be required, but the setback provisions of the zoning district shall apply. In the case of pre-existing non-conforming structures, personal wireless service facilities and their equipment shelters shall not increase any non-conformities, except as provided in Subsection (8) below. 



8. 	
Flexibility -In reviewing a Special Permit application for a personal wireless service facility, the Planning Board may reduce the required fall zone and/or setback distance of the zoning district by as much as fifty (50%) per cent of the required distance if it finds that a substantially better design will result from such reduction. In making such a finding, the Planning Board shall consider both the visual and safety impacts of the proposed use. 


F. 	Design standards: The design of a personal wireless service facility determines its visibility and its impact on community character. Height and fall zone/setback standards will have an impact on the visibility of personal wireless service facilities, but they may still be visible from public areas and surrounding residential properties. All personal wireless service facilities shall comply with the following design standards in order to limit negative visual impacts from these facilities through effective design: 
1. 	Visibility/Camouflage -Personal wireless service facilities shall be camouflaged as follows: 
(a) 	
Camouflage by Existing Buildings or Structures: When a personal wireless service facility extends above the roof height of a building on which it is mounted, every effort shall be made to conceal the facility within or behind existing architectural features to limit its visibility from 

public ways. Facilities mounted on a roof shall be stepped back from the front facade in order to limit their impact on the building's silhouette. 

(b) 	
Personal wireless service facilities that are side mounted shall blend with the existing building’s architecture and, if over five (5’) square feet, shall be painted or shielded with material which is consistent with the design features and materials of the building. 

(c) 	
Camouflage by Vegetation: If personal wireless service facilities are not camouflaged from public viewing areas by existing buildings or structures, or are not located on existing structures or along a high tension power line right of way, they shall be surrounded by buffers of dense tree growth and understory vegetation in all directions to create an effective year-round visual buffer. Ground-mounted personal wireless service facilities shall have a vegetated buffer of fifty (50’) feet or more, and of sufficient height to effectively screen the facility. Trees and vegetation may be existing on the subject property or installed as part of the proposed facility or a combination of both. The Planning Board shall determine the types of trees and plant materials and depth of the needed buffer based on site conditions and the height of the proposed tower. 

(d) 	
Color: Personal wireless service facilities that are side-mounted on buildings shall be painted or constructed of materials to match the color of the building material directly behind them. To the extent that any personal wireless service facility extends above the height of the vegetation immediately surrounding it, it shall be painted in a light gray or light blue hue that blends with sky and clouds. 


2. 	Equipment Shelters: Equipment shelters for personal wireless service facilities shall be designed consistent with one of the following design standards: 
(a) 	
Equipment shelters shall be located in underground vaults; or

(c) 	
All ground mounted personal wireless service facilities shall be surrounded by a security barrier. 


4. 	Historic buildings and districts. 
(a) 	
Any personal wireless service facilities located on or within an historic structure shall not alter the character-defining features, distinctive construction methods, or original historic materials of the building. 

(b) 	
Any alteration made to an historic structure to accommodate a personal wireless service facility shall be fully reversible. 

(c) 	
Personal wireless service facilities within an historic district shall be concealed within or behind existing architectural features, such as towers, cupolas or spires, or shall be located so that they are not visible from public roads and viewing areas within the district. 

(d) 	
Copies of all plans for any personal wireless service facility proposed in a historic district, or within one thousand (1000’) feet of a historic district or a structure or place listed on the Massachusetts State Register of Historic Places, shall be provided to the Mashpee Historical Commission before or at the same time that they are submitted to the Town for approval, in order to facilitate their review and comment on the proposal. Applicants are encouraged to meet with the Commission to solicit their input and advice prior to seeking permit approvals. 


5. 	Scenic roads and vistas. 
(a) 	
Except along an existing cleared high tension power line right-of-way, personal wireless service facilities shall not be located within open areas that are visible from public roads, recreational areas or residential development. As required in Section F(1) above, all ground-mounted personal wireless service facilities that are not camouflaged by existing buildings or structures shall be surrounded by a buffer of dense tree growth. 

(b) 	
Any personal wireless service facility that is located within 300 feet of a scenic road as designated by the town shall not exceed the height of vegetation at the proposed location. If the facility is located farther than 300 feet from the scenic road, the height regulations described elsewhere in this bylaw will apply.

In no case shall such area be used for roads, play-grounds, golf courses, tennis courts or other uses requiring significant amounts of clearing, structures or paving. In any OSID, all upland within three hundred (300) feet of the mean high-water line of great ponds or the rivers listed in Subsection A, as well as any upland within one hundred fifty (150) feet of other water bodies, streams, bogs or wetlands as noted in Subsection A above, shall be included within such dedicated undisturbed natural open space, except that where the developed portion of the OSID exceeds one hundred (100) acres, upon approval of the OSID Special Permit by the Planning Board in consultation with the Conservation Commission, Shellfish Commission and Harbormaster, and upon approval of any permits required from the Conservation Commission, up to one hundred (100) feet of the shoreline and a corresponding one-hundred-foot-wide (100) corridor roughly perpendicular to the shoreline through any open space may be developed for use as a dock, marina, boat launch or other water-related facility, such as a waterfront park or picnic area not involving active recreation facilities, enclosed structures or paved areas covering more than ten percent (10%) of such corridor area. The area of such corridor and facilities shall not count toward the required fifty percent (50%) of open space or be credited for bedrooms under Subsection D.

Said buffer may not be used for parking or active recreational activities. The Planning Board may waive or reduce the requirement for said buffer strip where the legal owner of the abutting property has certified, in writing, that he has no objection to the elimination or reduction of said buffer strip. In addition, all wetlands, as defined by MGL C. 131, §40, shall be permanently preserved under the same ownership as the majority of the minimum open space required under Subsection C(1). All other land uses not allowed in the open space area described by Subsection C(1) shall be considered part of the developed area of the OSID.

History: Amended 10-19-2015 ATM, Article 22, approved by Attorney General 1-19­2016 
(b) 	Ownership by a nonprofit organization: The open space may be conveyed to a nonprofit organization, the principal purpose of which is the conservation of open space. The nonprofit organization shall execute a conservation restriction, approved by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and enforceable by the Town of Mashpee, which shall be recorded at the Barnstable County Registry of Deeds or Land Court Registry, as appropriate, providing that such land shall be kept in an open and natural state and shall not be built on for residential use or developed for accessory uses such as roadway or any other uses not allowed by this section in minimum open space areas.

Said restriction shall provide that such land shall be kept in an open and natural state and not be built on for residential use or developed for accessory uses such as roadway or any other uses not allowed by this section in minimum open space areas.  The corporation or trust shall own and maintain the common open space and shall not dispose of any of the common space by sale or otherwise, except that said corporation or trust may offer to convey such open space to the Mashpee Conservation Commission for acceptance by it for open space use.

The developer’s declaration of his choice of the three (3) methods described in Subsection C(4) above shall be included in his application to the Planning Board for a Special Permit to develop an OSID, along with the required maps and plans describing the open space areas and the proposed uses within said areas Before the issuance of any occupancy permits for structures within the development, the developer shall also file with the Board a copy of the conservation restriction approved by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and recorded in the appropriate Registry necessary to secure the permanent legal existence of the open space, if it is not to be owned by the Mashpee Conservation Commission, and a copy of any recorded deed for transfer in fee to the Town or to a nonprofit organization. Approval of the OSID shall require approval by the Planning Board of said covenants and restrictions after consultation with the Town Attorney. 
History: Amended 10-19-2015 ATM, Article 22, approved by Attorney General 1-19-2016 
6. 	In the event that the organization established to own and maintain the open space, or any successor organization, shall, at any time after establishment of the open space residential development, fail to maintain the open space in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the plan, the Town of Mashpee will serve written notice upon such organization or upon the residents of the open space residential development setting forth the manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the open space in reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within thirty (30) days thereof and shall state the date and place of hearing hereon which shall be held within fourteen (14) days of the notice. At such hearing the Town of Mashpee may modify the terms of the original notice as to the deficiencies and may give an extension of time within which they shall be cured.  If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the modifications thereof are not cured within said thirty 
(30) days, the Town of Mashpee, in order to preserve the taxable values of the properties within the open space residential development and to prevent the open space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon said open space and maintain the same for a period of one (1) year. Said entry and maintenance shall not vest in the public any right to use the open space except when the same is voluntarily dedicated to the public by the owners. Before the expiration of said year, the Town of Mashpee shall, upon its initiative or upon the request of the organization theretofore responsible for the maintenance of the open space, call a public hearing upon notice to such an organization or to the residents of the open space residential development, to be held by the Town of Mashpee Planning Board, at which hearing such organization or the residents of the open space residential development shall show cause why such maintenance by the Town of Mashpee shall not, at the election of the Town of Mashpee, continue for a succeeding year. If the Planning Board of the Town of Mashpee shall determine that such organization is ready and able to maintain said open space in reasonable condition, the Town of Mashpee shall cease to maintain said open space at the end of said year.  If the Planning Board of the Town of Mashpee shall determine such organization is not ready and able to maintain said open space in reasonable condition, the Town of Mashpee may, in its discretion, continue to maintain said open space during the next succeeding year and, subject to a similar hearing and determination, in each year thereafter. The decision of the Planning Board of the Town of Mashpee in any such case shall constitute a final administrative decision subject to review in accordance with any applicable statute of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The cost of such maintenance by the Town of Mashpee shall be assessed pro rata against the properties within the open space residential development that have a right to enjoyment of the open space. Such assessment shall become a lien on the properties. The Town of Mashpee, at the time of entering upon the open space for a purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice of such entry with the Town Clerk and at the principle office of the corporation, trust or association owning the open space, which notice shall contain a statement that the individual owners within the open space residential development may become subject to an assessment and lien for their pro rata share of the total cost of the maintenance. 
D. 	Incentive Bonus and Affordable Housing Provisions – In order to encourage the preservation of critical open space and natural resource areas within the Town of Mashpee for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Town, as well as to provide affordable housing, certain increases in density of dwellings within an open space incentive development may be allowed in accordance with MGL C. 40A, §9. Such increase in density, in the form of bonuses allocated for transfer of development rights from portions of parcels within an OSID, which will be preserved as open space, to those portions of parcels of the OSID which will be developed, shall require approval by the Planning Board as part of its approval of a Special Permit for the OSID in conformance with the following guidelines:

F. 	Phasing, Expiration and Extension. An open space incentive development may be subdivided, developed and constructed in phases according to a phasing schedule approved by the Planning Board as part of the OSID Special Permit.  Within any OSID, no more than fifty (50) residential units or twenty percent (20%) of the total number of residential units approved under the Special Permit, whichever is greater, may be constructed during any calendar year, and Building Permit shall not be issued for more than that number of units.  The phasing schedule shall be included in the master plan of the OSID and shall indicate the surveyed and bounded open space area required by Subsection C (3), the approximate boundaries of each phase for which subdivision approval will be sought (if subdivision is to be done in phases) and the proposed year of such subdivision application, the general location of all roads projected to carry over two hundred (200) vehicles per day and the proposed year of their construction, the general location of any proposed recreation facilities, road improvements, sewage treatment plants, commercial uses and similar major structures and amenities and the year in which they are proposed to be built in a general master plan showing the clusters or areas of residential development and the number and type of dwellings approved for development within each area. Where the developer of an OSID continues file definitive plans of each phase, constructs required improvements and performs all other actions required by the Special Permit and this chapter in conformance with the phasing schedule, the Special Permit shall remain in effect. Otherwise a Special Permit for an open space incentive development shall become void if the developer has not applied for a Building Permit for or constructed the proposed improvements contained in the phasing schedule and conditions of the permit within two (2) years of the dates specified on the phasing schedule, excluding any time required to pursue or wait the determination of an appeal. If the permit does become void, there shall be no effect on the ownership and location of the required open space areas or on the number of bedrooms originally approved under the bonus provisions of this section. However, the developer shall resubmit plans for the developed portion of the OSID, and any such plans shall be reviewed by the Conservation Commission, Board of Health, Planning Board and any other agencies having applicable regulatory powers under the regulations in effect at the time of resubmission. The developer may also apply to the Planning Board for a extension of the two-(2) year expiration date for any element of the OSID, and the Board may grant such request after a properly advertised public hearing if it determines that there is a reasonable justification for the extension, that the developer is acting in good faith regarding the provisions of the OSID Special Permit and that there will be no adverse impact on the public health, safety and welfare or on the town’s environment and natural resources.

A. 	Within the Groundwater Protection District, unless prohibited by a specific provision of Article VI, the following uses may be permitted by the Planning Board under any Special Permit issued by that Board, or otherwise by a Special Permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals following the procedures specified in Subsection B. below, under such conditions as each Board, acting as the permitting authority, may require: 
History: Amended 5-4-1998 ATM, Article 34, approved by Attorney General 8-12-1998. 
1. 	
Commercial and industrial activities permitted in the underlying district and involving the manufacture, storage, transportation or use of any hazardous material other than hazardous wastes as defined in Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21C. 

2. 	
The application of pesticides for uses that are nondomestic and nonagricultural, provided that all necessary precautions shall be taken to prevent hazardous concentrations of pesticides in the water and on the land within the Groundwater Protection District as a result of such application, such precautions to include, but not limited to, erosion control techniques, the control of runoff water (or the use of pesticides having low solubility in water), the prevention of volatilization and redisposition of pesticides and the lateral displacement (i.e., winddrift) of pesticides. 

3. 	
The application of fertilizers for uses that are nondomestic and nonagricultural, provided that such application shall be made in such a manner as to minimize adverse impacts on surface water and groundwater to nutrient transport and deposition or sedimentation. 

4. 	
The rendering impervious of greater than fifteen percent (15%) or two thousand five hundred (2,500’) square feet of any lot, whichever is greater, provided that a system of stormwater management and artificial recharge of precipitation is developed which is designed to: prevent untreated discharges to wetlands and surface waters, preserve hydrologic conditions that closely resemble pre­development conditions, reduce or prevent flooding by managing the peak discharges and volumes of runoff, minimize erosion and sedimentation, not result in significant degradation of groundwater, reduce suspended solids and other pollutants to improve water quality and provide increased protection of sensitive natural resources. These standards may be met using the following or similar best management practices: 


For lots occupied, or proposed to be occupied, by single or two-family residences, recharge shall be attained through site design that incorporates natural drainage patterns and vegetation in order to maintain pre-development stormwater patterns and water quality to the greatest extent possible. Stormwater runoff from rooftops, driveways and other impervious surfaces shall be routed through grassed water quality swales, as sheet flow over lawn areas or to constructed stormwater wetlands, sand filters, organic filters and/or similar systems capable of removing nitrogen from stormwater. 
For lots occupied or proposed to be occupied by other uses, a stormwater management plan shall be developed which provides for the artificial recharge of precipitation to groundwater through site design that incorporates natural drainage patterns and vegetation and through the use of constructed (stormwater) wetlands, wet (retention) ponds, water quality swales, sand filters, organic filters or similar site-appropriate best management practices capable of removing nitrogen and other contaminants from stormwater and meeting the Stormwater Management Standards and technical guidance contained in the Massachusetts Department of 
Environmental Protection’s Stormwater Management Handbook, Volumes 1 and 
2, dated March 1997, for the type of use proposed and the soil types present on the site. Such runoff shall not be discharged directly to rivers, streams, other surface water bodies, wetlands or vernal pools. Dry wells shall be prohibited. Except when used for roof runoff from non-galvanized roofs, all such wetlands, ponds, swales or other infiltration facilities shall be preceded by oil, grease and sediment traps or other best management practices to facilitate control of hazardous materials spills and removal of contamination and to avoid sedimentation of treatment and leaching facilities. All such artificial recharge systems shall be maintained in full working order by the owner(s) under the provisions of an operations and maintenance plan approved by the permitting authority to ensure that systems function as designed. Infiltration systems greater than three (3’) feet deep shall be located at least one hundred (100’) feet from drinking water wells. Any infiltration basins or trenches shall be constructed with a three (3’) foot minimum separation between the bottom of the structure and maximum groundwater elevation. 
History: Added 5-4-1998 ATM, Article 34, approved by Attorney General 8-12-1998. 
B. 	Any application for a Special Permit shall be made, reviewed and acted upon in accordance with the following procedures: 
1. 	
Each application for a Special Permit shall be filed, in writing, with the Board of Appeals and shall contain a complete description of the proposed use, together with any supporting information and plans which the Board of Appeals may require. 

2. 	
The Board of Appeals shall refer copies of the application to the Board of Health, Planning Board, Conservation Commission and Town Engineer or Department of Public Works, which shall review, either jointly or separately, the application and shall submit their recommendations to the Board of Appeals. Failure to make recommendations within thirty-five (35) days of the referral of the application shall be deemed lack of opposition. 

3. 	
The Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on the application, in conformity with the provisions of MGL C 40A, within sixty-five (65) days after the filing of the application with the Board of Appeals. 

4. 	
After notice and public hearing, and after due consideration of the reports and recommendations of the local boards/departments, the Board of Appeals may issue such a Special Permit, provided that it finds that the proposed use: 

(a) 	
Is in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter and will promote the purposes of the Groundwater Protection District. 

(b) 	
Is appropriate to natural topography, soils, and other characteristics of the site to be developed. 

(c) 	
Will not, during construction or thereafter, have an adverse environmental impact on the aquifer or recharge area. 

(d) 	
Will not adversely affect an existing or potential water supply

Section I 

PURPOSE 
The Massachusetts Subdivision Control Law (Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 41, Sections 81K – 81GG) was enacted for the purpose of protecting the safety, convenience and welfare of the inhabitants of the cities and towns in which it is, or may hereafter be, put in effect by regulating the laying out and construction of ways in subdivisions providing access to the several lots therein, but which have not become public ways, and ensuring sanitary conditions in subdivisions and in proper cases parks and open areas. 
The powers of a Planning Board and of a (Subdivision) Board of Appeals under the Subdivision Control Law shall be exercised with due regard for the provision of adequate access to all of the lots in a subdivision by ways that will be safe and convenient for travel; for lessening congestion in such ways and in the adjacent public ways; for reducing danger to life and limb in the operation of motor vehicles; for securing safety in the case of fire, flood, panic and other emergencies; for insuring compliance with the applicable zoning ordinances or by-laws; for securing adequate provision for water, sewerage, drainage and other requirements where necessary in a subdivision; and for coordinating the ways in a subdivision with each other and with the public ways in the city or town in which it is located and with the ways in neighboring subdivisions. 
It is the intent of the Subdivision Control Law that any subdivision plan filed with the Planning Board shall receive the approval of such Board if said plan conforms to recommendation of the Board of Health and to the reasonable rules and regulations of the Planning Board pertaining to subdivisions of land; provided, however, that such Board may, when appropriate, waive, as provided for in Section 81R, such portions of the rules and regulations as is deemed advisable. 
Section II 
PREAMBLE 
These Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Mashpee have been adopted pursuant to sec. 81Q of Ch. 41 of the General Laws and are published to assist landowners and developers in complying with the provisions of the Subdivision Control Law (Massachusetts General Laws Ch. 41, Sec. 81K – 81GG). Reference should be made to that statute, to the Zoning Enabling Act (General Laws Ch. 40A) and to the zoning by-law of the Town of Mashpee for applicable provisions not set out in these regulations. 
Section III 

DEFINITIONS 

For the purpose of these Rules and Regulations, the following words and terms herein are hereby defined or the meaning thereof is explained or limited as follows: 
Applicant The person who applies for the approval of a plan of a subdivision and his administrators, executors, heirs, devisees, successors and assigns. The applicant or applicants must be owner or owners of all land included in the proposed subdivision. 
Board The Planning Board of the Town of Mashpee. 
Definitive Plan A plan of a proposed subdivision or re-subdivision prepared by a Registered Land Surveyor and Registered Engineer. 
Final Approval Approval by the Board of a Definitive Plan of a subdivision. 
Flood Zone An area of land designated as a special flood hazard area inundated by the 100-year flood as determined by calculation and/or as shown on a Flood Insurance Rate Map by the National Flood Insurance Program. 
Lot An area of land in one ownership, with definite boundaries, used or available for use, as the site of one or more buildings complying with the area, frontage and other requirements of the Zoning By-laws of the Town of Mashpee. 
Low Impact Development (LID) Term used to describe a land planning and engineering design approach to managing storm water runoff. It emphasizes conservation and use of on-site natural features to protect water quality. It implements engineered small-scale hydrologic controls to replicate the pre-development hydrologic regime of watersheds through infiltrating, filtering, storing, evaporating, and detaining runoff close to its source. 
Dead-end Street A street with only one access which serves also as the only exit. 
Owner The owner of record as shown by the records in the Barnstable County Registry of Deeds or Land Registry District. 
Person An individual, two or more individuals, a partnership, association or corporation. 
Preliminary Plan A plan of a proposed subdivision or re-subdivision of land drawn on tracing paper, or a print thereof, submitted for tentative approval, not suitable or intended to be recorded. 
Profile A complete and accurate representation of the finished vertical profile of a road or roads to be constructed within a subdivision, drawn on profile ("gridded) drawing (not tracing) paper, and copies or prints thereof, not suitable or intended to be recorded. 
Standard Specifications Shall mean the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Standard Specification for Highways and Bridges, latest edition 
Street A public way laid out by the town under MGL C. 82, §21, or other authority or laid out by the state or county, which is open to travel by the general public and is on record at the Registry of Deeds, or a public or private way duly approved, or proposed to be approved, by the Planning Board under the Subdivision Control Law. For the purposes of these regulations, streets are further classified as follows: 
Minor Residential Access A street whose sole function is to provide access to abutting properties. It serves, or is designed to serve no more than nine (9) dwelling units or nine single family lots. 
Residential Access A street whose sole function is to provide access to abutting properties. It serves or is designed to serve at least ten (10) but no more than twenty-five (25) dwelling units or single family lots. 
Minor Collector A street which is not intended for, nor does it have the potential for use by, through traffic. Rather it will be used solely for access to serve at least twenty five (25), but no more than one hundred (100), residential lots within the subdivision and / or to connect Minor Residential and Residential Access streets to Collector or Arterial streets. 
Collector A street which is used primarily as access from subdivisions to the Arterial street network, or as a major connector between Arterial streets, while also providing limited access to adjacent land. (Typically a Town road.) 
Arterial A street whose primary function is to carry through traffic from other parts of the Town and between towns, rather than provide direct land access, and which has the potential to service a substantial amount of traffic. (Typically a State or Town road.) 
Commercial A street within a commercially zoned subdivision or development that, in the opinion of the Board, will carry significant amounts of mixed traffic from vendors, delivery vehicles and the general public and which may require increases in layout width and/or travel way widths for the intended use of the subdivision or development area. 
Industrial A street within an industrially zoned subdivision or development site that carries or is intended to carry significant amounts of traffic such as from tractor trailer vehicles, heavy delivery vehicles or the like and which, in the opinion of the Board, may require increases in layout width and/or travel surfaces or increases in road base and pavement to accommodate heavy loads for the intended use of the subdivision or development. 
Other A street not otherwise defined herein that, due to its particular nature or use, requires special consideration by the Board. Such streets shall be considered only when the applicant demonstrates the need and includes in the application such details as to location, traffic demands, design, and construction that pertain to the proposed use of the street. 
Subdivision The division of a tract of land into two or more lots, which shall include re-subdivision, and, when appropriate to the context, shall relate to the process of subdivision or the land or territory subdivided: provided, however, that the division of a tract of land into two or more lots shall not be deemed to constitute a subdivision within the meaning of the Subdivision Control Law if, at the time when it is made, every lot within the tract so divided has frontage on (a) a public way or a way which the Town Clerk certifies is maintained and used as a public way, or (b) a way shown on a plan theretofore approved in accordance with the Subdivision Control Law, or (c) a way in existence when the Subdivision Control Law became effective in Mashpee (March 7, 1966) having, in the opinion of the Planning Board, sufficient width, suitable grades and adequate construction to provide for the needs of vehicular traffic in relation to the proposed use of the land abutting thereon or served thereby, and for the installation of municipal services to serve such land and the buildings erected or to be erected thereon. Such frontage shall be of at least such distance as is then required by the Mashpee zoning by-law for erection of a building on such lot, and if no distance is so required, such frontage shall be of at least twenty feet. Conveyances or other instruments adding to, taking away from, or changing the size and shape of, lots in such a manner as not to leave any lot so affected without the frontage above set forth, or the division of a tract of land on which two or more buildings were standing when the Subdivision Control Law went into effect in Mashpee into separate lots, on each of which one of such buildings remains standing, shall not constitute a subdivision. (per MGL Chapter 41, Section 81L). 
Subdivision Control Law Sections 81K -81GG, inclusive of Chapter 41 of the General Laws, and any acts in amendment thereof, in addition thereto, or in substitution thereof. 
Tentative Approval Approval by the Board of a Preliminary Plan of a proposed subdivision. 
Town Engineer A Registered Professional Civil Engineer and Registered Land Surveyor designated by the Board and acting on behalf of the Town of Mashpee.

Section VI 

PROCEDURE FOR THE SUBMISSION 
AND APPROVAL OF A PRELIMINARY PLAN 

A. 	No plan of a subdivision of land shall be approved unless, after adequate investigation, the Board determines that the land can be used without danger to health, life or property, and that the plan is compatible with neighboring conditions. Preliminary Plans, showing the proposed subdivision in a general manner, are required for non-residential subdivisions, and shall be submitted to the Board and to the Board of Health. Preliminary Plans for residential subdivisions are not required; however, submission of such a plan will enable the applicant, the Board and other Town agencies to discuss and clarify the problems of the subdivision before costly engineering and drawings for a Definitive Plan are prepared. 
B. 	The applicant shall: 
1. 	
Prepare Form B and Form N in triplicate, the original and one copy to go to the Board with two copies of the Preliminary plan, and one duplicate of Form B to go to the Board of Health with one copy of the Preliminary Plan. 

2. 	
Give written notice using Form N signed by an authorized member of the Board to the Town Clerk by delivery or registered mail, postage prepaid, that applicant has submitted such a plan. 

3. 	
Submit the required fees (see schedule). 

4.

"I certify that this topographic survey was made (on the ground) (by aerial survey) on _______________(date)." 
Signed by Registered Land Surveyor. 
i. 	
Any site features such as buildings, ponds, streams, marshes and areas subject to seasonal flooding. 

j. 	
A title block in the lower right hand corner. 


C. 	If the applicant owns or controls un-subdivided land adjacent to that shown on the Preliminary Plan, the Board may require that the applicant submit a sketch plan showing a possible or prospective street layout for all such adjacent land. This sketch plan may be submitted separately from the Preliminary Plan. Failure to provide such a sketch in a timely manner, except for good cause, may result in disapproval of the Preliminary Plan. 
D. 	Approval or Disapproval of Preliminary Plan. 
Within forty-five (45) days after submission of a preliminary plan, the Planning Board, and Board of Health shall notify the Town Clerk and the applicant, by certified mail, either that the plan has been approved, or that the plan has been approved with modifications suggested by each Board or agreed upon by the person submitting the plan, or that the plan has been disapproved and in the case of disapproval, each board shall state in detail its reasons therefor. 
E. 	Relation of Preliminary Plan to Definitive Plan and Zoning Provisions. 
Approval of a Preliminary Plan does not constitute approval of a subdivision, and a Preliminary Plan may not be recorded in the Registry of Deeds. Provided that if a Definitive Plan is duly submitted within seven months from the date of submission of the Preliminary Plan, the zoning rules and regulations in effect at the time of submission of the Preliminary Plan shall govern the Definitive Plan. 
Section VII 
PROCEDURE FOR THE SUBMISSION 
AND APPROVAL OF A DEFINITIVE PLAN

It is the intent of these regulations that streets designed in accordance with these standards will also be compliant with the design standards of the Town of Mashpee Department of Public Works as minimum design standards for acceptance as Town ways. 
No plan of a subdivision shall be approved unless the ways and streets shown on the plan comply with the following requirements: 
A. Location and Alignment 
1. 	
All streets in the subdivision shall be designed so that, in the opinion of the Board, they will provide safe vehicular travel.

Dead end streets shall not be longer than eight hundred feet unless, in the opinion of the Board, a greater length is desirable due to topography or other local conditions. 

8. 	
Reserve strips prohibiting access to streets or adjoining property shall not be permitted, except where, in the opinion of the Board, such strips shall be in the public interest. 

9. 	
Street jogs with center line offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five feet should be avoided. 

10. 
Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. No street shall intersect any other street at an angle of less than sixty degrees. 


B. Width 

1. The minimum width of street rights-of-way shall be as follows: 
Minor Residential or Residential Access streets 40 feet Minor Collector or Collector streets 50 feet Arterial streets, Commercial or Industrial streets 50 feet or such greater 
width deemed necessary by the Board for present and future vehicular travel due to the proposed use. 
Other Streets 	To be considered on a case by case basis. 
2. 	
Street lines at intersections shall be cut back so as to provide for a curb radius of not less than thirty-five feet except in cases where the Board considers an alternate radius necessary. 

3. 	
Roadway pavement shall be constructed for the full length of all streets within the subdivision using the following minimum widths. 


Minor Residential Access Street 20 feet Residential Access Street 20 feet Minor Collector Street 22 feet Collector Street 22 feet Arterial Street 24 feet or greater Commercial Street 22 feet or greater Industrial Street 24 feet or greater 
The Board may require greater pavement widths in any case where it is deemed necessary for public safety, where additional travel lanes are required or where on-street parking is proposed. 
4. 	
The center of pavements shall coincide with the centerline of the right of way insofar as possible but in no case shall it vary by more than four feet in either direction. 

5. 	
Where Cape Cod Berms are used, the full pavement width shall be increased by two (2) feet 


C. Grade 
1. 	
Grades of all streets shall be the reasonable minimum, but shall not be less than 1.0% nor more than 6% for Minor Collector, Collector, Arterial, Commercial or Industrial streets and dead end streets, nor more than 10% for Minor Residential Access or Residential Access streets. 

2. 	
Grades at intersections shall not be more than 2% for the first forty feet measured from the nearest exterior line of the intersecting street nor more than 4% for the next thirty feet. 

3. 	
Vertical curves are required wherever the algebraic differences in grade between center line tangents is 2% or more. Vertical curves shall be one hundred feet long for every 4% algebraic difference in grade. 

4. 	
Sight distances shall be not less than two hundred feet but in any case shall not be less than the stopping sight distances for wet pavement determined by the design speed of the roadway and the recommendations of the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO). 


D. Easements 
1. 	
Easements for utilities across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided where necessary and shall be at least twenty feet wide. 

2. 	
Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage way, channel or stream, the Board may require that there be provided a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way of adequate width to conform substantially to the lines of such water course, drainage way, channel or stream, and to provide for construction or other necessary purposes. 

3. 	
Proof of valid regulation or restriction for the protection of any required open spaces must be provided in accord with the Mashpee Zoning By-law or any amendment or revision thereof.

4. 	
RS-1 tack coat shall be applied to all binder courses prior to the placement of the wearing surface except if waived by the Planning Board or its designee. 

5. 	
No paving shall be done during rainy weather, upon saturated surfaces, where water is standing, where the temperature is lower than 40°F or where frost is in the ground. 

6. 	
Where pavement is to be left without a wearing surface over the winter months and where access is required to abutting lots within the developed area, all castings such as catch basins, manholes, valve boxes shall temporarily be made flush with the binder surface to facilitate snow plowing. 

7. 	
Castings shall be brought to grade prior to the placement of the wearing surface by raising the casting with the use of brick, barrel block or cylindrical risers. The casting and all shim materials shall be securely mortared in place. Casting shims which only raise the grate or cover and not the entire casting shall not be used except when no other alternative is possible and only when approved by the Board. 

8. 	
Castings shall be set to finish grade and mortared in place by removing the binder around the casting for a distance of 12 inches and to a depth of 12 inches and filling the opening with cement concrete flush with the top of the binder surface. 

9. 	
Cape Cod berm shall be placed integral with the wearing surface and shall be a minimum of twelve (12) inches in width and three (3) inches high at the back edge. Berms of greater width may be required where deemed necessary in the opinion of the Board to adequately control surface runoff. 

a. 	Where the binder course of mix is to be used as a temporary travel surface for more than 3 months, a temporary twelve (12) inch berm shall be installed on the binder. It shall be removed at the time the wearing surface is applied. 

10. 

a. 	
The owner’s engineer shall certify to the Board in writing that the completed pavement surfaces contain the minimum thickness of bituminous asphalt shown on the approved plans. 

b. 	
As a minimum weight slips for mix delivered to the job site shall be used to compute the tonnage of mix delivered to the amount of mix required and as approved in the definitive plan submittal. 

c. 	
The pavement surface will not be considered as final until such computation and certification has been delivered to the Board for approval. 

d. 	
All pavement surfaces not meeting the minimum thickness requirement shall be modified accordingly prior to final approval of construction and the modifications re-certified. 

e. 	
At the Board’s discretion, core samples may be required as proof of pavement thickness. For pavement surfaces to be approved, core samples shall be taken at the rate of one (1) for every two hundred (200) feet of road length. In no case shall the total number of core samples be less than three. 




E. 	Pavement Width 
The width of the finished surface shall be not less than twenty feet or other width required herein, and its center line shall coincide with the center line of the full right­of-way insofar as possible, but in no case shall it vary by more than four feet in either direction. 
F. 	Shoulders and Berms 
1. 	
On each side of the finished pavement there shall be provided shoulders, not less than two feet wide, constructed of road base material, properly shaped and compacted. The slope of the shoulders away from the center line shall be no greater than two inches per foot. 

2. 	
Cape Cod berms twelve inches wide shall be installed on both sides of the roadway regardless of slope. In such cases, the road shoulders shall be moved outward an additional 12 inches from the centerline to accommodate the berm. Where berms are required, the road surface shall be expanded to minimum of twenty-two feet and the berms placed thereon. 

3. 	
Cape Cod berm may not be required for those instances where low impact street designs are utilized within projects that are designed as low impact developments and where the longitudinal slope is such that erosion of the 


shoulders can be prevented. The design shall indicate how slopes are to be protected when low impact designs are proposed. 
G. 	Right-of-way Clearing 
The areas between the finished surface and the outer boundaries of the layout shall be cleared of all brush, stumps, debris and all trees or shrubs not suitable for retention for shade or ornamental purposes. 
H. Cut and Fill Slopes 
The slopes of any cuts and fills required in the construction of the roadway shall not be greater than two feet horizontal to one foot vertical and shall be properly seeded and protected to prevent erosion. The foot of the slope of any cut and the top of the slope of any fill shall not be nearer than four feet to the edge of the finished surface of the roadway. 
I. 	Sidewalks 
Sidewalks with a minimum width of 4’ shall be installed on at least one side of a street. Sidewalks shall be designed to conform to the minimum dimensions and materials as shown on the design plates included herein. 
J. 	Storm Water Management 
1. 	
Storm water shall be managed for all streets and roadways by the use of catch basins, manholes, pipe, culverts, headwalls, low impact design, infiltration, detention or retention facilities, sediment control, nutrient control for ground water or any combination of the above which is most compatible with particular site conditions and which conforms with other storm water requirements of the Town of Mashpee. 

2. 	
Details for the construction of storm water facilities shall be as depicted in the appropriate templates at the end of these regulations. 

3. 	
Where they are used in the design, catch basins shall be provided on both sides of the roadway at intervals of not more than 300 feet, and at low points and sags in the roadway, and at the corners of the roadway at intersecting streets. 

4. 	
Infiltration systems, bio-retention areas and other such designs shall be protected during construction by the use of hay bales, silt fence, temporary berms, sediment traps or other measures designed to prevent the buildup of sediment and failure of the system. Should any system be found to be contaminated during the construction phase by sediment for any reason, it shall be corrected before the construction is approved. 

5. 	
All drainage systems shall be designed so as to reduce the impacts of nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, to the ground water. Methods to be employed shall include, overland flow over vegetated areas, bio retention areas and swales, natural drainage patterns or other recognized means prior to conveyance to any infiltration device. 

6. 	
Drainage systems for streets shall be designed so as to provide adequate removal of runoff and to prevent pavement flooding for the 2-year, and 25-year storm events. Designs shall include adequate provision to prevent off street flooding of adjacent land and property from the 100 year storm event. Off street areas shall be provided as necessary for receiving storm water for treatment and containment. These areas shall be noted on the plans either as separate non-building lots or as defined easements. 

7. 	
Appropriate methods for determining pre-construction and post-construction storm water runoff shall be employed which takes into consideration topography, soil types, land slope and cover, impervious surfaces and other pervious surfaces and shall include calculations for the 2-year, 25-year, and 100-year storm events. All designs shall be capable of handling up to and including the 25-year storm event without overtopping, flooding of the adjacent landscape or containment areas or the backup of stormwater in piping systems. Pre-construction runoff from the site for the 100-year storm event shall not be exceeded for post-construction conditions. 

8. 	
New storm water runoff generated from the project shall not be directed to existing storm drainage facilities without proper treatment to prevent additional nutrients from entering the ground water and without fulfilling the requirements of paragraph J.7. above. 

9. 	
Test pits shall be dug at the location of all sub-surface drainage facilities to insure adequate soil conditions and depth to ground water. The bottom of all drainage systems shall be maintained at least 2’ above maximum high ground water. Test pit logs shall be shown on the definitive plan.
