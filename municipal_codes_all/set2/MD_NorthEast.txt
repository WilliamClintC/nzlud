Section 1-102. How the Code is Cited
The catchlines of the several sections of this code printed in boldface type are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the sections and shall not be taken to be titles of such sections, nor as any part of such sections, nor unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or re-enacted. The code shall be cited by the word "Section" followed by the numerical designation of the ordinance. This ordinance is Section 1-102 of the Code of Ordinances of The Town of North East, Maryland.
1-2
Article 2. Violations Defined/Penalties Designated
Section 1-201. Definitions
For purposes of this code, any violations of its provisions is a misdemeanor unless specifically declared by these ordinances to be a municipal infraction. An infraction is any violation of this code which has been specifically declared to be an infraction. For purposes of this code, an infraction is a civil offense.
Section 1-202. Penalties
Unless otherwise provided in these ordinances, any person found guilty of violating any provision of this Code for which violation is a "misdemeanor" as defined in Section 1-201, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 and imprisonment not to exceed ninety (90) days or both such fine and imprisonment for each offense. Any person violating a provision of this Code for which violation is an "infraction" as defined in Section 1-201 shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $400.00 for first offenders and a fine not to exceed $400.00 for each repeated offense. Each day a violation continues shall, unless otherwise provided, constitute a separate and repeated offense.
If an Ordinance should recite penalties greater than this, they shall be deemed to mean these maximum penalties. If the penalties as set forth in a particular Ordinance are less than those set forth herein, then the lesser penalties as set forth in said Ordinances shall be effective.
1-3
Article 3. Municipal Infraction Procedures
Section 1-301. Authority to Declare Infractions and Set Fines
The President and Commissioners of The Town of North East, hereinafter referred to as the Board, shall by official act declare the violation of which ordinances shall be an infraction and for each such violation a specific fine shall be set. This fine shall never exceed $100.00 for any single, initial violation, or $200.00 for each repeat or continuing violation. The fine shall be expressed as a discrete amount rather than being expressed in terms of a maximum or minimum amount. The authority to declare infractions and set fines shall not be delegated by said board to any other administrative or legislative body.
Section 1-302. Enforcement
Those officials authorized by the Board to enforce this code may deliver a citation to any person alleged to be committing an infraction. A copy of the citation shall be retained by the Town and shall bear the certification of the enforcing official attesting to the truth of the matter set forth in the citation. The citation shall contain at least the following information:
1. Name and address of the person charged;
2. The nature of the infraction;
3. The location and time that the infraction occurred or was observed;
4. The amount of the fine assessed;
5. The manner, location, and time in which the fine may be paid to the town:
6. The right of the accused to stand trial.
Section 1-303. Payment of Fines
The fine for an infraction shall be as specified in the law violated. The fine is payable within 20 calendar days or receipt of the citation.
Section 1-304. Adjudication, Right to Trial
Whereas the District Court of Maryland is empowered by Article 23A, Section 3, to adjudicate all cases involving infractions, the Town shall not conduct any formal hearing for those persons charged with municipal infractions. Any offender so charged may pay the fine as indicated in the citation or stand trial for the offense. This provision shall not prevent an offender from requesting additional information concerning the infraction.
1-4
Section 1-305. Notification of Decision to Stand Trial
A person charged with a municipal infraction may elect to stand trial for the offense by notifying the Town in writing of his intention at least five (5) days prior to the date of payment set forth in the citation. Upon receipt of the notice stating intent to stand trial, the Town shall forward to the District Court of Maryland having venue, a copy of said notice.
Section 1-306. Failure to Satisfy a Citation
Should a person charged with a municipal infraction fail to pay the assessed fine and fail to file notice of intent to stand trial for the offense, the Town shall send a formal notice of the infraction to the offender's last known address. If the citation has not been satisfied within 15 days of the date of the formal notice, the offender shall be liable for an additional fine not to exceed twice the original fine. If after 35 days, the citation has not been satisfied, the Town may request adjudication of the case through the District Court of Maryland.
Section 1-307. Court Trials and Rights of the Accused
In any trial for a municipal infraction the accused shall have the same rights as for the trial of criminal cases. The accused shall have the right to cross-examine witnesses, to testify or introduce evidence in his own behalf and to be represented by an attorney of his choice at his own expense.
Section 1-308. Conviction
Conviction of a municipal infraction, whether by the District Court of Maryland or by payment of a fine to the Town, is not a criminal conviction for any purpose, nor does it impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by a criminal conviction.
Section 1-309. Authorized Enforcement Officials
The following officials are hereby authorized and empowered to enforce this ordinance:
1. The Chief Executive Officer of the Town of North East;
2. Any officer of The Town of North East Police Department, The Maryland State Police or the Cecil County Sheriff's Department;
3. The designated representative of the Chief Executive Officer.

Article 4. Alterations in the Code
Section 1-401. Effect of the Repeal of an Ordinance
The repeal of an ordinance shall not revive any ordinance in force before or at the time the ordinance repeal took effect. The repeal of an ordinance shall not affect any punishment or penalty encumbered before the repeal took effect, nor any suit, prosecution or proceeding pending at the time of the repeal, for an offense committed under the ordinance repealed.
Section 1-402. Provisions Deemed Continuations of Existing Ordinances
The provisions appearing in this code, so far as they are the same in substance as ordinances existing at the effective date of this code, shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as new enactments.
Section 1-403. Severability of Parts of the Code
It is hereby declared to be the intention of the Board of Commissioners that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, and words of this code are sever able and if any word, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this code shall be declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by valid judgement or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining words, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, and sections of this code, since the same would have been enacted by the Board of Commissioners without the incorporation into this code of any such unconstitutional or invalid word, clause, sentence, paragraph or section.

ARTICLE 6. Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance
Section 7-601. Grading Permits
1. When required:
A grading permit, issued by the Cecil County Department of Public Works (hereinafter called DPW) shall be required prior to the start of any development or activity where such proposed development or activity may, in the judgement of DPW:
a. Introduce sediment into any watercourse of the County or State;
b. Move more than 100 cubic yards of earth, and disturb less than 5,000 square feet of earth;
c. Create undue erosion and sediment damage to lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the subject site or the stream itself.
Where the proposed development or activity requires a building permit, no such permit shall be granted unless a valid grading permit exists for the subject development or activity.
Any clearing or grading in the Critical Area requires a grading permit. Forest cleared in the Critical Area Buffer without first obtaining a grading permit shall be replanted at three times the area extent of the cleared trees.
2. Exceptions:
No grading permit shall be required for the following:
a. Agricultural land management practices approved by and installed under supervision of the Cecil Soil Conservation District. This exception, however, shall not apply to agriculture land management practices and agriculture activities that do not conform to the applicable provisions of the Cecil County Critical Area Program.
b. Construction or maintenance of County roads for which an erosion and sediment control plan has been approved by the Cecil Soil Conservation District.
c. Quarry operations and the mining of stockpiling of sand, stone and gravel at quarries, concrete, asphalt and material processing plants or storage yards, and all other operations of which a surface mining permit has been issued by the State of Maryland, Department of the Environment, provided sediment and erosion control measures are employed to protect off-site damage in accordance with a plan approved by the Cecil Soil Conservation District.
7-10
d. No exceptions shall be granted for the requirement of a grading permit for any grading, stripping, excavations or filling of land in the Buffer portion of the Cecil County Critical Area District. However, upon evaluation of the site, the inspector may grant the exception for those portions of the site located outside the designated Buffer if the inspector determines that the development activity is classified as "insignificant" in impact to water quality and plant, fish and wildlife habitats as set forth in the County's Critical Area Program.
3. Application Procedure:
The applicant for a grading permit shall complete an application form, which forms are available in the Department of Public Works Office. The applicant shall submit with the application, documented evidence that an erosion and sedimentation control plan (and when required, a stormwater management plan) for the proposed development or activity has been prepared by land surveyor, engineer, architect, or landscape architect licensed by the State of Maryland, and has been approved by the Cecil Soil Conservation District. Such plan(s) shall be considered a part of the grading permit, and any violation of the provisions of said plan(s) shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance. For a single residential lot, the signature of the applicant on a Standard Sediment and Erosion Control Plan for Minor Earth Disturbances may serve in lieu of such documentation.
4. Approvals:
The Department of Public Works may impose such conditions on the grading permit as may be reasonable to prevent creation of a nuisance or dangerous conditions, and to deny the grading permit where the proposed work would cause hazards adverse to the public safety and welfare. Issuance of the grading permit does not eliminate the requirement for compliance with any other applicable County, State or Federal law or regulation.
5. Existing Activities and Structures:
Whenever and wherever the Department of Public Works finds that any existing grading, drainage, or ground condition (irrespective of when, or by whom brought about, or of its resulting from work accomplished under proper permit) is defective or deficient under the requirements of this Ordinance, and constitutes or creates a nuisance, or endangers, or adversely affects the safety, use or stability of any public or private property on site or elsewhere, then, and in such event, the owner or lessee or both of the property upon which such condition is located, upon receipt of notice in writing from the Department of Public Works shall, within the period specified herein, secure the required plan approval by the Cecil Soil Conservation District and permit, perform or cause to be performed the required remedial work, repairs or maintenance so as to correct and remedy the defect or condition, and to be in conformance with the requirement of this Ordinance.

Such notice shall set forth the nature of the corrections required and the time within which corrections shall be made, not to exceed fourteen (14) days after receipt of notification by certified mail, unless otherwise extended by action of the Maryland Department of the Environment. Failure to comply with such written notice shall be deemed justification for suspension of the permit, shall require that all work stop except that necessary for correction of the violation. Upon correction of the violation, the permittee may re-apply for renewal of the grading permit.
The Maryland Department of the Environment may post a site with an order directing the permittee to cease all land disturbing activity being performed under the Sediment and Erosion Control Plan approved by the Soil Conservation District when such activity does not conform to the specifications, including modifications thereof, of an approved plan or other conditions of the permit issued hereunder, provided that:

b. Said notice includes the nature of the corrective measures required and the time within which corrections shall be made.
The Maryland Department of the Environment may also post any site with order directing owner or contractor to cease all land disturbing action which requires an approved Sediment and Erosion Control Plan, but a plan has not been obtained.
7. Permit Cancellation:
After suspension of a grading permit, if corrections required are not completed within the time period specified in Paragraph F above, the permit shall be cancelled. In the event of cancellation, any bonds or cash deposits posted with the County shall be used for work on the site to prevent erosion and to otherwise protect the side as approved by the Cecil Soil Conservation District.
8. Guarantee of Completion:
a. The permittee shall be required, prior to the issuance of a grading permit, to post with the County a cash deposit performance bond from an approved corporate surety, or other collateral acceptable to the County in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the

(ADOPTED PER ORDINANCE 2008-03-03) 
 
1. Purpose of the District  
 
While existing land uses in the Town’s Corporate limit provide for a variety of residential uses, it is the Town’s intent to provide opportunities for Multifamily Residential uses interspersed with commercial uses along the Route 272 and Route 40 corridor.  Residents within the Multifamily residential district would benefit by the close proximity of goods and services to the residents.  These neighborhoods would provide and encourage multi-modal transportation opportunities, unique to the Route 272 and Route 40 corridor, as the road systems in these areas have been designed to handle traffic volumes, which can support the multi-family residential district.     
 
Any tract of land so developed shall be in one ownership or in the case of multiple ownership of the tract, it shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.  If the developer/owner has received approval for a development project, then opts at a later time, to not proceed with the project as proposed, future phases may be developed in accordance with the regulations which are current at the time of development, provided the landscaping, bufferyards, setbacks, open space provisions, etc., provided on the original plan remain in the subsequent phases.  All property owners shall be signators on the development plan.   (AMENDED BY ORDINANCE 2013-07-01)

Within this district intensive business, commercial and industrial uses, as well as multiple-mixed uses which both serve the traveling public; production, manufacture and movement of industrial goods and services are all contemplated.  Permitted uses in this district will only be restricted as set forth below and by prevailing State and Federal regulations, if any. 
 
The traffic control problems associated with major truckstop facilities and travel plazas are a cause for concern and in order to protect adequately the free access to and from the interstate highway and the combination of uses contemplated within this district, truckstop facilities and travel plazas and  facilities catering primarily to tractor trailers and other large highway vehicles, are therefore, permitted only by special exception.  It is recognized that travel plazas and other interstate related commercial uses rely on all modes of travel along the interstate highway.  Accordingly, those uses are expected to market to and solicit the business of said interstate highway traffic. 
 
The only restrictions on use within this district shall be that the treatment or processing of hazardous waste will not be permitted within this district.

PART II – SPECIAL DISTRICTS 
 
Section 5-12.  “CAO” Critical Area Overlay District Regulations (REPEAL AND ADOPTION OF ORDINANCE 2008-03-01) 
 
1. Purpose  
 
 In 1984 the Maryland General Assembly passed the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Protection Program to establish a resource protection program for the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries by fostering more sensitive development activity by setting forth standards requiring the minimization of adverse impacts on water quality and protection of the natural plant, fish and wildlife habitats.   
 
2. Intent and Goal 
 
 The intent of the Critical Area Program is to provide special regulatory  
 protection for the resources located within the Town Critical Area and to foster more sensitive development activity for shoreline areas.  The goals of the Program are to accomplish the following: 
 
. Minimize adverse impacts on water quality that result from pollutants that are discharged from structures or run off from surrounding lands; 

. Conserve fish, wildlife, and plant habitat; and 

. Establish land use policies for development in the Critical Area which accommodate growth as well as address the environmental impacts that the number, movement, and activities of people may have on the area. 


 
3. Implementation of the Critical Area Provisions 
 
a. Local Implementation.  These provisions regulate development activities and resource utilization activities, eg., agriculture and forestry, within the Critical Area.  They supplement existing land use regulations by imposing specific standards and requirements as set forth in the Critical Area Act and Criteria.  The Critical Area provisions as set forth herein and in any other applicable regulations, supersede any inconsistent law, section, or plan of the Town.  In the case of conflicting provisions, the stricter provisions shall apply. 
 
b. Critical Area Program.  The Town adopted its Critical Area Program June 26, 1988.  The Program consists of this ordinance, the Town’s Critical Area maps, the Comprehensive Plan and Subdivision Regulations. 
 
 
 
 
4. Application 
 
 The requirements of the Critical Area Overlay District shall apply to all areas shown on the zoning Map Overlay District to include, at a minimum, all areas within 1,000 feet of tidal waters and state or private wetlands and the heads of tides and such additional areas as designated to meet the purpose of the district. 
 
5. Applicability and Findings Requirements. 
 
 Any applicant for a permit or license to pursue activities within the Critical Area, including but not limited to, development or redevelopment, grading, sediment and erosion control, timber harvesting, shoreline erosion control, installation of a septic system and drain field, operation of a waste collection or disposal facility, operation of a commercial or private  marina or other water-related commercial or industrial operation (whether public or private), mining (whether surface of sub-surface) or quarrying, farming or other agriculture related activities shall have such permits or licenses issued by the Zoning Administrator or their designee after review and approval under the Town’s Critical Area Program. No person shall develop, alter or use any land for residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional uses, nor conduct agricultural, fishery or forestry activities in the Town’s Critical Area except in compliance with the applicable provisions contained herein and the North East Comprehensive Plan.  To ensure this end, no development or resource utilization activity shall be permitted until the applicable approving authority shall make specific findings that the proposed development or activity is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Critical Area Program.  
 
6. State and Local Projects.  
 
 For all development in the Critical Area resulting from State and local agency projects, the Town shall adhere to COMAR 27.02.02 and COMAR 27.02.06. If applicable, consistency reports shall be submitted to the Critical Area Commission. 
 
7. Program Enforcement. 
 
a. Consistency. The Critical Area provisions of this Ordinance, in accordance with the Critical Area Act and Criteria supersede any inconsistent law, Chapter or plan of the Town of North East.  In the case of conflicting provisions, the stricter provisions shall apply. 
 
b. Responsible agencies.  These provisions shall be implemented and enforced by the Zoning administrator with the assistance of the Critical Area Circuit Rider.  Should an infraction under the Critical Area Program, or under any law, ordinance or plan related to a Critical Area 
Program provision or requirement, be brought to the attention of any official of the Town, said official shall immediately contact the Zoning administrator or designee who may consult with the Critical Area Circuit Rider, and if necessary the Town Attorney, to determine the proper remedial course of action.  The Zoning Administrator shall send a copy of the course of action taken under the provisions of this section to the Critical Area Commission.  The Commission, at its discretion, may also take action under its authority in the State Critical Area law.  
 
c. Violations.  In addition to any other penalty applicable under State or municipal law, a person who violates a provision of Natural Resources Article, Title 8 Subtitle 18, or the Town’s Critical Area Program, ordinances, or regulations is subject to a fine not to exceed $10,000.  In determining the amount of the penalty to be assessed under paragraph c, the Town may consider the following: 
 
 (1) The gravity of the violation;  
 
          (2) The willfulness or negligence involved  in  the violation;  
                     and  
 
 (3) The environmental impact of the violation.  
 
d. Responsible Persons. The owner or occupant of any land, building, structure, premises, or part thereof, or any architect, builder, contractor, agent, realtor, or other persons who commits, participates in or assists, any violation of the terms of the Town Critical Area Ordinance may each be chargeable with such violation. 
 
e. Implementation. All fines imposed under this section are supplemental to any mitigation requirements that may be imposed and shall not be deemed to substitute for the mitigation requirements stated in any section of the Ordinance. 
 
(1) For purposes of assessing fines under this section, each day that the violation continues unabated shall be considered a separate violation. 


 
(2) The imposition of fines for violations shall be supplemental to, and not as a substitute for compliance with any and all development requirements imposed by the Zoning Ordinance, including but not limited to any requirements for afforestation, reforestation, mitigation, planting, construction of stormwater management facilities, 


and site design limitations, including such requirements that are imposed only upon a violation of the provisions of this Ordinance. 


 
(3) In addition to the civil penalties set forth above, the Zoning Administrator or designee may seek the abatement of the conditions which are the basis of the violation. The Zoning Administrator may require the restoration of the disturbed area to the conditions existing prior to the violation and may include an order for the removal of any structures. The restoration shall be undertaken in a manner which is consistent with the Critical Area requirements of the Natural Resources Article, COMAR and the Town’s Local Critical Area Program found in the Town Ordinance. 


 
f. Clearing Violations.  Clearing of vegetation is defined as removal of trees, understory trees, saplings, shrubs or herbaceous plants. Clearing includes using a mechanical device to remove vegetation (e.g., bushhogging). Clearing as defined above shall not be interpreted to restrict the removal of hazardous, dead, dying or diseased trees as approved in advance by the Zoning Administrator or designee in consultation with the Critical Area Circuit Rider or as otherwise specified in the Town's ordinance. At the Town’s discretion, replacement of trees may be required.  Horticultural practices necessary to maintain the health of individual trees are not restricted, but must be approved if associated with any Buffer cutting.   
  
g. Clearing or Disturbance in the 110-foot Buffer or Special Buffer Area.   Any person or persons, who remove vegetation and/or trees within the Buffer or alter the slope of the land surface within the Buffer without a valid zoning certification, grading permit, or required authorization from the Town, shall be subject to a fine of $1000. Any subsequent Buffer clearing violations by the same party shall be assessed a fine of $5,000 for the second violation and a fine of $10,000 for any further Buffer violations.  
 
h. Unauthorized Tree Removal Within the IDA.  Any person or persons, who remove trees within the IDA without a valid zoning certification, grading permit, or required authorization from the Town, shall be subject to a fine of $100. Any subsequent violation of tree removal by the same party shall be subject to a fine of $500 for the second violation and a fine of $1,000 for any further tree removal violations.  
 
i. Unauthorized Tree and Vegetation Removal Within the RCA and LDA.   Any person or persons, who remove trees or vegetation within the RCA and LDA without a valid zoning certification, grading permit, or required authorization from the Town, shall be subject to a fine of $1000. Any subsequent violation by the same party shall be subject to a fine of $2,500 for the second violation and a fine of $5,000 for any further unauthorized tree and vegetation removal within the RCA and LDA. Any person or persons, who remove trees or vegetation within the RCA and LDA on a grandfathered lot in excess of what may be authorized in accordance with the forest and woodland protection provisions of the Town’s zoning ordinance shall be subject to fine of  $500.   Any person or persons, who remove trees or vegetation within the RCA and LDA associated with projects requiring site plan review in excess of what may be authorized in accordance with the forest and woodland protection provisions of the Town’s zoning ordinance shall be subject to a  fine of $10,000. 
 
j. Disturbance of Steep Slopes Within the RCA and LDA (Not Expanded Buffer).   Any person or persons who disturb steep slopes by clearing, grading, or unauthorized development activities in excess of 250 square feet on a grandfathered lot shall be subject to  a fine of $500. Any person or persons, who disturb greater than 250 square feet and less than 2,500 square feet shall be subject to a fine of $1,000. Any person or persons who disturbs greater than 2,500 square feet shall be subject to  a fine of $5,000. Any person or persons who disturb steep slopes in excess of 250 square feet by clearing, grading or unauthorized development activities associated with projects requiring site plan review shall be subject to a  fine of $10,000.

the amount of $1.00 per square foot of the development activity.  Any subsequent violation on any property by the same person shall be assessed a fine of $5.00 per square foot for the second violation and a fine of $10.00 per square foot for any further violations.  
 
8. General Regulations and Development in the Critical Area 
 
a. Except within the Resource Conservation Area (RCA) as provided below, uses, accessory uses   and special exception uses shall be those permitted within the applicable underlying base zoning district as shown on the Official Zoning Maps. 
 
b. General Policies. In order to accommodate already existing land uses and growth in the Town Critical Area while providing for the conservation of habitat and the protection of water quality, the Town has identified and mapped three separate land use management districts for the purpose of planning, regulating and monitoring the type and intensity of land use, development, and redevelopment activities occurring within the Critical Area. The three land use management categories are: 
 
. Intensely Development Areas (IDAs) 

. Limited Development Areas (LDA) 

. Resource Conservation Areas (RCA) 


 
 These land use management areas correspond to the definitions established in the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Criteria, as amended, for each area and specifically as identified on the Town’s Critical Area Maps, adopted as part of the Town’s Critical Area Program.  Mapped land use management area classifications are based on land uses that existed on or before 1 December 1985, except for areas where the land classification may be changed through the use of Growth Allocation. Growth Allocation of 41.09 acres was granted to the Heron Cove Subdivision on February 26, 2007.  At the time of the adoption of this Ordinance, the Town has a total of 274.78 Critical Area acres: 156.59 acres of IDA and 118.19 acres of LDA.  The following regulations shall be applied based on the specific land management classification. 
 
(1) Intense development should be directed outside of the Critical Area.  Future intense development activities, when proposed in the Critical Area,  shall be directed towards the Intensely Developed Areas. 
 
(2) Additional low intensity development may be permitted in the Limited Development Areas, but shall be subject to strict regulation to prevent adverse impacts on habitat and water quality. 
 
(3) Development shall be limited in the Resource Conservation Area, which shall be chiefly designated for agriculture, forestry, fisheries activities, other resource utilization activities and for habitat protection. 
 
c. Grandfathering.  
 
(1) Continuation of existing uses. The Town shall permit the continuation, but not necessarily the intensification or expansion of any use in existence as of June 26, 1988, unless the use has been abandoned for more than one year or is otherwise restricted by this Ordinance. If any existing use does not conform to the provisions of this ordinance, its intensification or expansion may be permitted only in accordance with the Critical Area variance procedures outlined in the applicable article of this ordinance.  
 
(2) Residential Density.  Except as otherwise provided, the Town shall permit the types of land described in the following subsections to be developed in accordance with the density requirements in effect prior to the adoption of the North East Critical Area Program notwithstanding the density provisions of the Program. The Town shall permit a single lot or parcel of land that was legally of record on the date of Program approval to be developed with a single family dwelling if a dwelling is not already placed there (notwithstanding that such development may be inconsistent with the density provisions of this Ordinance) provided that: 
 
(a) It is  on  land where the  development  activity has progressed to the point of the pouring of foundation footings or the installation of structural members. 


  
 (b) It is a legal parcel of land, not being part of a  recorded or approved subdivision, that was  recorded as of December 1, 1985 and the land  was subdivided into recorded, legally buildable  lots,   where  the     subdivision    received  the  
Town’s final approval prior to June 1, 1984 if: 
[1] At the time of development, the land is brought into conformance with the Critical Area Program insofar as possible, including the consolidation or reconfiguration of lots not individually owned and these procedures are approved by the Critical Area Commission; or 
 
[2] The land received a building permit subsequent to December 1, 1985, but prior to Program approval. 
 
 (c) It is on land that was subdivided into legally  recorded lots,  where  the subdivision received  final  approval between June 1, 1984 and  December 1,  1985; and 
 
(d) It is on land that was subdivided into recorded, legally buildable lots, where the subdivision received final approval after December 1, 1985 and provided that either development of such land conforms to the IDA, LDA or RCA requirements in this Ordinance or the area of the land is counted against growth allocation permitted under this Ordinance. 
 
(3) Consistency. Nothing in this section may be interpreted as altering any requirements for development activities in the Water Dependent Facilities Section or Habitat Protection Areas Section of this Ordinance. 
 
d. Activities permitted only in IDA.  Certain new development, redevelopment  or expanded activities or facilities, because of their intrinsic nature, or because of their high potential for adverse impact on plant and wildlife habitats and water quality, may not be  permitted in the Critical Area except in Intensely Developed Areas under regulations of this section, and only after the activity or facility has demonstrated to all appropriate local and State permitting agencies that there will be a net improvement in water quality to the adjacent body of water. These activities include the following: 
 
(1) Non-maritime heavy industry; 
 
(2) Transportation and utility transmission facilities, except those necessary to serve permitted uses, or where regional or interstate facilities must cross tidal 
water (utility transmission facilities do not include power plants); 
 
(3) Permanent sludge handling storage, and disposal facilities, other than those associated with wastewater treatment facilities.  However, agricultural or horticultural use of sludge under appropriate approvals when applied by an approved method at approved application rates may be permitted in the Critical Area, except in the 110-foot Buffer. 
 
(4) The Town may preclude additional development activities that it considers detrimental to water quality, fish, wildlife, or plant habitats within the Critical Area. 
 
e. Activities not permitted.  Certain new development activities or facilities, or the expansion of certain existing facilities, because of their intrinsic nature, or because of their potential for adversely affecting habitat and water quality, may not be permitted in the Critical Area unless no environmentally acceptable alternative exists outside the Critical Area, and these development activities or facilities are needed in order to correct an existing water quality or wastewater management problem.  These include: 
 
(1) Solid or hazardous waste collection or disposal facilities, excluding dumpsters and trash receptacles; or 
 
(2) Sanitary landfills.  Continuation of existing, permitted facilities of the type noted above shall be subject to the standards and requirements of the Department of the Environment, under COMAR, Title 26. 
 
f. Continuation of existing, permitted facilities.  Existing, permitted facilities of the type noted in paragraph (e) above shall be subject to the standards and requirements of the Department of Environment, under COMAR Title 26. 
 
g. Reasonable accommodations for the needs of disabled citizens.  The Board of Appeals may make reasonable accommodations to avoid discrimination on the basis of a physical disability.  Reasonable accommodations for the needs of disabled citizens may be permitted in accordance with the evidentiary requirements set forth in the following paragraphs: 
 (1) An applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating the following: 
 
  (a) The existence of a physical disability; 
 
 (b) Literal enforcement of the provisions of this  ordinance would result in discrimination by  virtue  of such disability; 
 
 (c) A reasonable accommodation would reduce or  eliminate the discriminatory effect of the  provisions of this ordinance; 
 
(d) The accommodation request will not substantially impair the purpose, intent, or effect of the  provisions of this ordinance as applied to the property; 
 
(e) Environmental impacts associated with the accommodation are the minimum necessary to address the needs resulting from the particular disability of the applicant. 
 
(2) The Board of Appeals shall determine the nature and scope of any accommodation under this section and may award different or other relief than requested after giving due regard to the purpose, intent, or effect of the applicable provisions of this ordinance.  The Board may also consider the size, location, and type of accommodation proposed and whether alternatives exist which accommodate the need with less adverse effect. 
 
(3) The Board of Appeals may require, as a condition of approval, that upon termination of the need for accommodation, that the property be restored to comply with all applicable provisions of this ordinance.  Appropriate bonds may be collected or liens placed in order to ensure the Town’s ability to restore the property should the applicant fail to do so. 
 
9. Water-Dependent Facility Requirements. 
 
a. Definition.  “Water dependent facilities” means those structures or works associated with industrial, maritime, recreational, educational or fisheries activities that require location at or near the shoreline within the 110-foot Buffer. An activity is water-dependent if it cannot exist outside the 
Buffer and is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature of its operation. 
 
b. Identification.  Water dependent facilities include, but are not limited to, ports, the intake and outfall structures of power plants, water-use industries, marinas and other boat docking structures, public beaches and other public water-oriented recreation areas, and fisheries activities.  Excluded from this regulation are individual private piers installed or maintained by riparian landowners, and which are not part of a subdivision that provides community piers. 
 
c. General Policies.  The policies of the Town with regard to water-dependent facilities shall be to limit development activities in the Buffer to those that are water-dependent and provide by design and location criteria that these activities will have minimal individual and cumulative impacts on water quality, fish, wildlife, and plant habitat in the Critical Area. 
 
d. Standards. The following standards shall apply to new or expanded development activities associated with water-dependent facilities: 
 
(1) New or expanded development activities may be permitted in the Buffer in the Intensely Developed Areas and Limited Development areas provided that it can be shown: 
 
 (a) That they are water-dependent; 
 
 (b) That the project meets a recognized private or  public need; 
 
(c) That adverse effects on water quality, fish, plant  and wildlife habitat are minimized; 
 
(d) That, insofar as possible, non-water dependent  structures or operations associated with water- dependent projects or activities are located  outside the Buffer; and 
 
 (e) They meet the requirements of the Critical Area Provisions and comply with the requirements of the underlying zoning district. 
 
(2) Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, new or expanded development activities may not be 
permitted in those portions of the Buffer that occur in the Resource Conservation Areas. 
 
e. Implementation.  Applications for new or expanded water-dependent facilities in Intensely Developed Areas or Limited Development Areas shall be outlined in the application how the above requirements are met.  Applicants for water-dependent facilities in a Resource Conservation Area, other than those specifically permitted herein, must apply for a portion of the Town's growth allocation as set forth in this ordinance. 
 
f. Evaluating plans for new and expanded water-dependent facilities.  The Town shall evaluate on a case-by-case basis all proposals for expansion of existing or new water-dependent facilities.  The Town shall work with appropriate State and federal agencies to ensure compliance with applicable regulations.  The following factors shall be considered when evaluating proposals for new or expanded water dependent facilities: 
 
(1) That the activities will not significantly alter existing water circulation patterns or salinity regimes; 
 
(2) That the water body upon which these activities are proposed has adequate flushing characteristics in the area; 
 
(3) That disturbance to wetlands, submerged aquatic plant beds, or other areas of important aquatic habitats will be minimized; 
 
(4) That adverse impacts to water quality that may occur as a result of these activities, such as non-point source run-off, sewage discharge from land activities or vessels, or from boat cleaning and maintenance operations, is minimized; 
 
(5) That shellfish beds will not be disturbed or be made subject to discharge that will render them unsuitable for harvesting; 
 
(6) That dredging shall be conducted in a manner, and using a method which causes the least disturbance to water quality and aquatic and terrestrial habitats in the area immediately surrounding the dredging operation or within the Critical Area generally; 
 
(7) That dredged spoil will not be placed within the Buffer or elsewhere in that portion of the Critical 
area which has been designated as a Habitat Protection Area except as necessary for: 
 
 (a) Backfill for permitted shore erosion protection  
  measures; 
 
(b) Use in approved vegetated shore erosion projects; 
 
 (c) Placement on previously approved channel  maintenance spoil disposal areas; and 
 
 (d) Beach nourishment. 
 
 (8) That interference with the natural transport of sand  will be minimized; and 
 
(9) That disturbance will be avoided to historic areas of waterfowl staging and concentration or other Habitat Protection areas identified in the Habitat Protection Area sections of this ordinance. 
 
g. Availability of information.        The information necessary for evaluating the above factors, if not available locally, shall be obtained from appropriate State and Federal agencies.  
 
h. Industrial and port-related facilities.  New, expanded or redeveloped industrial or port-related facilities and the replacement of these facilities may be permitted only in those portions of Intensely Developed Areas that have been designated as Special Buffer Areas as described in this ordinance and are subject to the provisions set forth in that section. 
 
i. Marinas and other commercial maritime facilities.  Newly expanded or redeveloped marinas may be permitted in the Buffer within Intensely Developed Areas and Limited Development Areas subject to the requirements set forth in this section. New marinas or related maritime facilities may not be permitted in the Buffer within Resource Conservation Areas except as provided in i, j, and k below.  Expansion of existing marinas may be permitted by the Town within Resource Conservation Areas provided that it is sufficiently demonstrated that the expansion will not adversely affect water quality, and that it will result in an overall net improvement in water quality at or leaving the site of the marina.  New and existing marinas shall meet the sanitary requirements of the State Department of Environment as required in COMAR 26.04.02.  New 
marinas shall establish a means of minimizing the discharge of bottom wash water into tidal waters. 
 
j. Community Piers.  New or expanded community marinas and other non-commercial boat-docking and storage facilities may be permitted in the Buffer subject to the requirements in this section of the zoning ordinance provided that: 
 
(1) These facilities do not offer food, fuel, or other goods and services for sale and shall provide adequate and clean sanitary facilities;  
 
(2) The facilities are community-owned and established and operated for the benefit of the residents of a platted and recorded riparian subdivision and shall not be rented, leased, sold or conveyed in any way to any individual not owning a unit or lot within the subdivision; 
 
(3) The facilities are associated with a residential development approved by the Town for the Critical Area and consistent with all State requirements and program requirements; 
 
(4) Disturbance to the Buffer is the minimum necessary to provide a single point of access to the facilities; and; 
 
(5) If community piers, slips, or moorings are provided as part of the new development, private piers in the development shall not be allowed. 
 
k. Number of slips or piers permitted.  Where community piers are permitted, the number of slips or piers shall be the lesser of (1) or (2) below: 
 
(1) One slip for each 50 feet of shoreline in the subdivision in the Intensely Developed and Limited Development Areas and one slip for each 300 feet of shoreline in the subdivision in the Resource Conservation Area; or 
 
(2) A density of slips, or piers to platted lots or dwellings within the subdivision in the Critical Area according to the following schedule: 
 
 
 
 
Platted Lots or Dwelling Units in the Critical Area 
  
Number of Slips Permitted 
 
Up to 15 
 1 for each lot

l. Public Beaches, Recreation or Education Areas.  Public beaches or other public water-oriented recreation or education areas including, but not limited to publicly owned boat launching and docking facilities and fishing piers may be permitted in the Buffer in Intensely Developed Areas.  These facilities may be permitted within the Buffer in Limited Development Areas and Resource Conservation Areas provided that: 
 
(1) Adequate sanitary facilities exist; 
 
(2) Service facilities are, to the extent possible, located outside the Buffer; 
 
(3) Permeable surfaces are used to the extent practicable, if no degradation of groundwater would result; 
 
(4) Disturbance to natural vegetation is minimized; and 
 
(5) Areas for passive recreation, such as nature study, and hunting and trapping, and for education, may be permitted in the Buffer within Resource Conservation Areas if service facilities for these uses are located outside the Buffer. 
 
m. Research Areas.  Water-dependent research facilities or activities operated by State, Federal, or local agencies or educational institutions may be permitted in the Buffer, if non-water dependent structures or facilities associated with these projects are, to the extent possible, located outside of the Buffer. 
  
n. Fisheries Activities.  Activities associated with new or expanded fisheries or aquaculture facilities are permitted in the Buffer upon identifying land and water areas with high potential for this use in cooperation with the State.  Commercial water-dependent fisheries including, but not limited to structures for crab shedding, fish off-loading docks, shellfish culture operations and shore-based facilities necessary for aquaculture operations and fisheries activities may be permitted in the Buffer in Intensely 
Developed, Limited Development and Resource Conservation Areas. 
 
10. Structures on Piers.  
 
a. Definition. "Pier" means any pier, wharf, dock, walkway, bulkhead, breakwater, piles or other similar structure.  "Pier" does not include any structure on pilings or stilts that was originally constructed beyond the landward boundaries of State or private wetlands. 
 
b. Standards. Except as provided in (1), (2) and (3) below, a Construction Authorization shall not be issued for any project involving the construction of a dwelling unit or other non-water dependent structure on a pier located on State or private wetlands within the Critical Area. 
 
(1) The Town may issue a Construction Authorization for a project involving the construction of a dwelling unit or other non-water-dependent-structure on a pier located on State or private wetlands within the Critical Area that was issued by the Department of Natural Resources on or before January 1, 1989. 
 
(2) The Town may issue a Construction Authorization for a project involving the construction of a dwelling unit or other non-water dependent structure on a pier located on State or private wetlands within the Critical Area if the following conditions exist: 
 
(a) The structure was located on a pier in existence as of December 1, 1985 and can be verified by a Department of Natural Resources aerial photograph dated 1985; 
 
(b) The project does not require an expansion of the pier greater than 25% of the area of piers or dry docks removed on the same property; however, additional expansion may be allowed in the amount of 10% of the water coverage eliminated by removing complete piers from the same or other properties.  If the horizontal surface of a pier to be removed is not intact, but pilings identify its previous size, then that area may be used in determining the additional expansion permitted.  The project expansion based on water coverage eliminated can be considered only if all non-functional piers on the property are removed except for the project pier. The total expansion may not 
exceed 35% of the original size of the piers and dry docks removed; 
 
(c) The project is approved by the Planning Commission; 
 
(d) The project is located in an Intensely Developed Area (IDA) as designated in programs approved by the Critical Area Commission. 
 
(3) The Town may issue a Construction Authorization for the repair of an existing dwelling unit or other non-water-dependent-structure on a pier located on State or private wetlands within the Critical Area. 
 
(4) If a structure that is not water-dependent is to be permitted by the Town under the exceptions included in this Section, an applicant is required to demonstrate that the project will meet the following environmental objectives using the standards established under this ordinance and relevant chapters in the Town’s Comprehensive Plan. 
 
(a) The construction and operation of the project will not have a long-term adverse effect on the water quality of the adjacent body of water; 
 
(b) The quality of stormwater runoff from the project will be improved; and 
 
(c) Sewer lines or other utility lines extended for the pier will not affect the water quality of adjoining waters. 
 
11. Shore Erosion Control Measures. 
 
a. Definition. Shoreline erosion protection works means those structures or measures constructed or installed to prevent or minimize erosion of the shoreline in the Critical Area.  The use of structural devices to protect the shoreline from erosion can result in a significant disturbance to the aquatic environment and increase erosion downstream.  This section sets forth a plan for limiting the use of structural erosion control devices to only those areas where major erosion problems exist.  As an alternative to structural erosion controls, the Town encourages the use of non-structural controls such as marsh creation, maintenance of buffer zones, and the establishment of natural barriers to prevent intrusion on fragile vegetated 
shorelines.  The criteria set forth in this chapter are not intended to apply to those structures necessarily associated with water-dependent facilities as discussed in the water-dependent facilities section of this ordinance. 
 
b. General Policies. In protecting shore areas from erosion, the Town shall follow these policies: 
 
(1) Encourage the protection of rapidly eroding portions of the shoreline in the Critical Area by public and private landowners.   
 
(2) Where such measures can effectively and practically reduce or prevent shore erosion, the use of non-structural shore protection measures should be encouraged in order to conserve and protect plant, fish and wildlife habitat.  
 
c. Standards: The following standards shall be followed: 
 
(1) A site evaluation shall be conducted based on actual site conditions, including aerial photography, and available information on Historic Shoreline Erosion Rates as may be available from the Maryland Geological Survey, the Maryland Department of the Environment, and the Department Natural Resources.  Sites shall be classified based on the following criteria and shoreline characteristics: 
 
(a) Areas where no appreciable erosion appeared; 
 
(b) Areas where appreciable erosion appeared and where non-structural measures would be practical and effective; and 
 
(c) Areas where appreciable erosion appeared and where  only structural measures would provide effective and  practical erosion control. 
 
(2) Structural control measures shall only be used in areas where appreciable erosion occurs and where non-structural measures would not be practical or effective as determined by the site evaluation. 
 
(3) Where structural erosion control is required, the measure that best provides for conservation of fish and plant habitat, and which is practical and effective shall be used. 
 
(4) Non-structural measures shall be utilized in areas of erosion where they would be a practical and effective method of erosion control. 
 
(5) Structural erosion measures shall not be encouraged in areas where no significant erosion occurs. 
 
(6) Shore erosion projects must include appropriate authorization from the Maryland Department of the Environment and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prior to issuing any local Construction Authorization. 
 
(7) Projects involving shoreline clearing of natural vegetation shall be required to replant the impacted area of the Buffer, replacing trees and understory on a 2:1 basis.  Trees shall be balled and burlap or containerized 1 ½” to 2” caliper.  A shrub and tree combination may be used to accomplish this requirement. 
 
(8) The criteria set forth in this section are not intended to apply to those structures necessarily associated with water-dependent facilities as discussed in other sections of this ordinance. 
 
12. Intensely Developed Areas (IDAs). 
 
a. Description.  Intensely Developed Areas are those areas where residential, commercial, institutional, and/or industrial developed uses predominate and where relatively little natural habitat occurs.  At the time of the initial mapping, these areas shall have had at least one of the following features. 
 
(1) Housing density equal to or greater than four dwelling units per acre. 
 
(2) Industrial, institutional or commercial uses concentrated in the area; or 
 
(3) Public sewer and water collection distribution systems serving the area and housing density greater than three dwelling units per acre.  In addition, these features shall be concentrated in an area of at least 20 adjacent acres, or the entire upland portion of the Critical Area within the boundary of a municipality, whichever is less. 
 
b. General Policies.   The Critical Area ordinance for the Town hereby incorporates the following policies for 
Intensely Developed Areas.  New or expanded development or redevelopment shall take place in such a way as to: 
 
(1) Improve the quality of runoff from developed areas that enters the Chesapeake Bay or its tributary streams; 
 
(2) Accommodate additional development of the type and intensity designated by the Town provided that water quality is not impaired; 
 
(3) Minimize the expansion of Intensely Developed Areas into portions of the Critical Area designated as Habitat Protection Areas and Resource Conservation Areas; 
 
(4) Conserve and enhance fish, wildlife, and plant habitats, as identified in the Habitat Protection Area sections of this ordinance to the extent possible within Intensely Developed Areas; and 
 
(5) Encourage the use of retrofitting measures to address existing stormwater management problems. 
 
c. Development Standards.  All uses in the IDA shall be subject to the following development standards/or conditions in addition to those established in other sections of this ordinance.  Development and redevelopment in those areas designated Intensely Developed Areas (IDAs) shall be subject to the following standards: 
 
(1) Density in the Intensely Developed Areas (IDAs) shall be as established in the underlying base zoning district. 
 
(2) All sites for which development activities are proposed, and which requires subdivision approval or site plan review and approval, shall identify environmental or natural features on that portion of the site within the Critical Area.  This information shall be made part of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report as part of the application for site plan review.  (See Appendix CA-1 for information to be included in the Environmental Assessment.) 
 
(3) All plans shall be assessed for their impacts on water quality and other biological resources. 
 
(4) Alterations in the plans shall be made to mitigate any negative impacts. 
(5) Urban best management practices shall be considered and, where appropriate, implemented as part of all plans for development and redevelopment. 
 
(6) Development and redevelopment shall be subject to the Habitat Protection Area requirements prescribed in those sections of this ordinance. 
 
(7) Stormwater shall be addressed in accordance with the following provisions: 
 
(a) The Town shall require, at the time of development or redevelopment, that technologies as required by applicable State and local ordinances be applied by anyone undertaking development activities in order to minimize adverse impacts to water quality caused by stormwater. 
 
(b) In the case of redevelopment, if these technologies do not reduce pollutant loadings measured by use of the keystone pollutant method by at least 10 percent below the level of pollution on the site prior to redevelopment, then offsets shall be provided.  Guidance for compliance with this requirement is provided in the Maryland Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area 10% Rule Guidance - Fall, 2003 and as may be subsequently amended. 
 
(c) In the case of new development, offsets as determined by the Town shall be used if they reduce pollutant loadings by at least 10 percent of the predevelopment levels. Guidance for compliance with this requirement is  provided in the Maryland Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area 10% Rule guidance - Fall 2003 and as may be subsequently amended. 
 
(d) Offsets may be provided either on or off site, provided that water quality benefits are equivalent, that the benefits are obtained within the same watershed, and that the benefits can be determined through the use of modeling, monitoring or other computation of mitigation measures.  Guidance regarding offsets is provided in the Maryland Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical 
Area 10% Rule Guidance - Fall 2003 and as may be subsequently amended. 
 
(e) Residential single family lots disturbing 250 square feet or less shall be exempt from implementing stormwater practices unless there is a water quality concern as determined by the Zoning Administrator or their designee. 
 
(8) If practicable, permeable areas shall be established in vegetation and wherever possible redevelopment shall reduce existing levels of pollution. 
 
(9) Areas of public access to the shoreline, such as foot paths, scenic drives and other public recreational facilities, should be maintained and, if possible, encouraged to be established within IDAs. 
 
(10) Ports and industries which use water for transportation and derive economic benefits from shore access shall be located near existing port facilities.  The Town may identify other sites for planned future port facility development and use if this use will provide significant economic benefit to the State or Town and is consistent with the provisions of the Water Dependent Facilities Section of this ordinance and other State and federal regulations. 
 
(11) The Town shall promote with the assistance from State agencies, participation in programs and activities for the enhancement of biological resources within the Critical Area for their positive effects on water quality and urban wildlife habitat.  These programs may include urban forestry, landscaping, gardens, wetlands and aquatic habitat restoration elements. 
 
(12) To the extent practicable, future development in the Critical Area shall use cluster development as a means to reduce impervious areas and to maximize areas of natural vegetation. 
 
(13) Cutting or Clearing of Trees:  When cutting or clearing of trees outside the Buffer for any purpose, the following shall be required: 
 
(a) Trees cut shall be replanted either on site or in areas established by the Town for the 
enhancement of forest and developed woodland resources. 
 
(b) Where trees cannot be replaced on site, the Town may require the developer to plant in accordance with programs for urban forestry, street tree plantings, garden, landscaping or Buffer planting. 
 
(c) Alternative provisions may include a fee-in-lieu of planting.  The fee to be paid should be based on the average of three estimates that include the planting of the trees (or shrub), staking, mulching and a one year guarantee. 
 
(d) Development activities shall be designed and implemented to minimize destruction of forest and woodland vegetation; and 
 
(e) Development activities shall address the protection of existing forests and developed woodlands as identified as Habitat Protection Areas according to the Habitat Protection Section of this Ordinance. 
 
(f) Replacement trees shall be of native species and planted on a 1:1 ratio with balled and burlap or containerized trees of 2 inch caliper. 
 
13. Limited Development Areas (LDAs). 
 
a. Description.  Limited Development Areas are those areas which are currently developed in low or moderate intensity uses. They also contain areas of natural plant and animal habitats. The quality of runoff from these areas has not been substantially altered or impaired.  At the time of the initial mapping, these areas shall have had at least one of the following features: 
 
(1) Housing density ranging from one dwelling unit per five acres up to four dwelling units per acre; 
 
(2) Areas not dominated by agricultural, wetland, forest, barren land, surface water or open space; 
 
(3) Areas meeting the conditions of Intensely Developed Area but comprising less than 20 acres; 
 
(4) Areas having public sewer or public water, or both. 
 
b. General Policies.  The Town's Critical Area ordinance hereby incorporates the following policies for Limited Development areas.  New or expanded development or redevelopment shall take place in such a way as to; 
 
(1) Maintain, or, if possible, improve the quality of runoff and groundwater entering the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries; 
 
(2) Maintain, to the extent practicable, existing areas of natural habitat; and 
 
(3) Accommodate additional low or moderate intensity development if: 
 
(a) The development conforms to the water quality and habitat protection criteria in this ordinance; and 
 
(b) The overall intensity of development within the Limited Development area is not increased beyond the level established in a particular area  so as to change its prevailing character as identified by density and land use currently established in the area. 
 
c. Development Standards.  The following criteria are hereby adopted for Limited Development Areas:  
 
(1) The density of development and minimum lot sizes permitted within the LDA shall be governed by prescriptive densities and dimensions within the applicable underlying base zoning districts. 
 
(2) All sites for which development activities are proposed, and which require subdivision approval or site plan review and approval, shall identify environmental or natural features on that portion of the site within the Critical Area.  This information shall be made part of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report as part of the application for site plan review (See Appendix CA-1). 
 
(3) Site development shall be designed to assure that features or resources identified as Habitat Protection Areas are afforded protection as prescribed in the Habitat Protection Provisions of this Ordinance and comply with the provisions for water dependent facilities in this Ordinance. 
 
(4) Roads, bridges and utilities serving development that must cross a Habitat Protection Area shall be located, designed, constructed, and maintained so as to provide maximum erosion protection and minimize negative impacts to wildlife, aquatic life and their habitats and maintain hydrologic processes and water quality.  Roads, bridges, or utilities may not be located in any Habitat Protection Area unless no feasible alternative exists.  When no alternative exists and such infrastructure must cross or be located in Habitat Protection Areas, the developer shall demonstrate that no feasible alternative location for such infrastructure exists and must show how these standards will be met at each phase of the project, i.e., location, design, construction and maintenance. 
 
(5) All development activities that must cross or affect streams shall be designed to: 
 
(a) Reduce increases in flood frequency and severity; 
 
 (b) Retain tree canopy so as to maintain stream  water  temperature within normal variation; 
 
 (c) Provide for the retention of natural streambed  substrate; 
 
 (d) Minimize adverse water quality and quantity  impacts of stormwater. 
 
(6) All development sites shall incorporate a wildlife corridor system that connects the largest undeveloped or most vegetative tracts of land within and adjacent to the site in order to provide continuity of existing wildlife and plant habitats with offsite habitats.  The wildlife corridor system may include Habitat Protection Areas identified in this ordinance.  The Town shall ensure the maintenance of the wildlife corridors by requiring the establishment of conservation easements, restrictive covenants, or similar instruments approved by the Town attorney through which the corridor is preserved by public or private groups, including homeowners associations, nature trusts and other organizations.  
 
(7) For the cutting or clearing of trees in forests and developed woodland areas that are associated with 
current or planned development activities in a Limited Development Area, the Town shall: 
 
(a) Require that the applicant consider the recommendations of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources when planning development on forested land; 
 
(b) Design and implement development activities to minimize the destruction of woodland vegetation; and 
 
(c) Provide protection for forests and developed woodlands identified as Habitat Protection areas in this Program. 
  
(d) Replacement trees shall be of native species and planted on a 3:1 ratio with balled and burlap or containerized trees of 2 inch caliper. 
 
(8) For the alteration of forest and developed woodland in the Limited Development Area, the Town shall apply all of the following requirements: 
 
(a) The total acreage in forest coverage within the Critical Area shall be maintained or preferably increased; 
 
(b) All forests that are allowed to be cleared or developed shall be replaced in the Critical Area on not less than an equal area basis; 
 
(c) No more than 20 percent of any forest or developed woodland may be removed from forest use, except as provided in paragraph (9) below.  The remaining 80 percent shall be maintained through recorded, restrictive covenants or similar instruments approved by the Town attorney; and 
 
(d) Developed woodland vegetation shall be conserved to the greatest extent practicable. 
 
(9) For replacement of forest and developed woodland, if more than 20 percent is to be removed from forest use, an applicant may clear or develop not more than 30 percent of the total forest area provided that the afforested area shall consist of 1.5 times the total surface acreage of the disturbed forest or developed woodland area, or both.  
(10) In addition, applicants shall adhere to the following criteria for forest and woodland development: 
 
(a) A Letter of Credit in an amount determined by the Town to assure satisfactory replacement of cleared forest as required in (8) and (9) above; 
 
(b) Grading permits shall be required before forest or developed woodland is cleared; 
 
(c) Forests that have been cleared before obtaining a grading permit or that exceed the maximum area allowed in (9) above shall be replanted at three times the areal extent of the cleared forest; 
 
(d) If the areal extent of the site limits the application of the reforestation guidelines in (7) and (8) and (9) above, alternative provisions or reforestation guidelines may be permitted by the Town if they are consistent with the intent of the Forest and Woodland Element of this Program to conserve the forest and developed woodland resources of the Critical Area.  Alternative provisions may include fee-in-lieu provisions or use of a forest mitigation bank if the provisions are adequate to ensure the restoration or establishment of an equivalent forest area; 
 
(e) If no forest is established on proposed development sites, these sites shall be planted to provide a forest or developed woodland cover of at least 15 percent; 
 
(f) All forests designed on development plans shall be maintained to the extent practicable, through conservation easements, restrictive covenants or other protective instruments approved by the Town attorney; 
 
(g) The applicant shall designate, subject to the approval of the Town, a new forest area on a part of the site not forested; and 
 
(h) The afforested area shall be maintained as forest cover through easements, restrictive covenants or other protective instruments approved by the Town attorney. 
 
(11) Development on slopes greater than 15 percent, as measured before development, shall be prohibited unless the project is the only effective way to maintain or improve the stability of the slope and is consistent with the policies for LDA set forth above. 
 
(12) Man-made impervious surfaces shall not exceed 15% of the portion of the lot or parcel within the Critical Area proposed to be developed, except for the following:  
 
(a) If a parcel or lot one-half acre or less in size existed on or before December 1, 1985, then man-made impervious surfaces are limited to 25% of the parcel or lot. 
 
(b) If a parcel or lot greater than one-half acre and less than one acre in size existed on or before December 1, 1985, then man-made impervious surfaces are limited to fifteen percent (15%) of the parcel or lot. 
 
(c) If an individual lot one acre or less in size is part of a subdivision approved after December 1, 1985, man-made impervious surfaces of the lot may not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the lot.  However, the total of the impervious surfaces of the entire subdivision may not exceed fifteen percent (15%). 
 
(d) Limitations on impervious surfaces provided in subsections (a) and (b) above may be exceeded, upon findings by the Planning Commission or their designee that the following conditions exist: 
 
          [1] New impervious surfaces on the property have been minimized; 
 
[2] For a lot or parcel ½ acre or less in size, total impervious surface area does not exceed impervious surface limits in Section 12-a above  by more than twenty five percent (25%) or five hundred square feet (500 square feet), whichever is greater; 
 
[3] For a lot or parcel greater than one half acre and less than one acre in size, total  impervious surface area does not 
exceed impervious surface limits in Section 12-b or 5,445 square feet, whichever is greater; 
 
[4] The following table summarizes the limits set forth in paragraph 1 through   3 above: 
 
                       Lot/Parcel Size 
                      In square feet 
                            Impervious Surface Limit 
 
 
        0-8,000 
                             25% of parcel + 500 sq. ft 
 
                   8,001 – 21,780 
               31.25% of parcel 
 
                     21,781 – 36,300 
       5,445 sq ft. 
 
                     36,301 – 43,560 
          15% of parcel 
 

 
[5] Water quality impacts associated with runoff from the impervious surface have been minimized  through site design or the use of best  management practices to improve water quality; and 
 
[6] The property owner performs on-site mitigation to offset potential adverse water quality impacts from the new impervious surfaces, or the property owner pays a fee to the Town in lieu of performing the on-site mitigation.  The amount of  the fee shall be $3.50 per square foot of new impervious surface area on the property.  The town shall use all fees collected under this provisions to fund  projects that improve water quality within the Critical. 
 
 (13) Development may be allowed on soils having development constraints if the development includes mitigation measures that adequately address the identified constraints and that will not have significant adverse impacts on water quality or plant, fish or wildlife habitat. 
 
(14) To reduce the extent of impervious areas and maximize areas of natural vegetation, cluster development shall be considered when planning for future development. 
 
(15) Consideration should be given for modifications in road standards on a case-by-case basis to reduce potential impacts to the site and Critical Area 
resources, where the reduced standards do not significantly affect safety. 
 
d. Complementary State laws and regulations. In applying this Critical Area Program, the Town refers to all the following complementary existing State laws and regulations: 
 
(1) For soil erosion and sediment control (COMAR 26.17.01) 
 
(a) In order to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation, a Soil erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan shall be required whenever a development within the Critical Area will involve any clearing, grading, transporting, or other form of disturbance to land by the movement of earth.  This plan shall be consistent with the requirements of the Natural Resources article and Environmental article of the Annotated Code of Maryland and local ordinances.  Sediment control practices shall be appropriately designed to reduce adverse water quality impacts. 
 
(b) The Town requires erosion control as the basis of sediment control plans within the Critical Area. 
 
(2) For stormwater runoff (COMAR 26.17.02) 
 
(a) The Town requires limitations on stormwater runoff such that development may not cause downstream  property, watercourses, channels or conduits to receive stormwater runoff at a higher  volume or  rate than would have resulted from a 10-year storm  where the land is in its predevelopment state. 
 
(b) All stormwater storage facilities shall be designed with the sufficient capacity to achieve water quality goals of this Section and to eliminate all runoff caused by the development in excess of that  which would have come from the site if it were in its pre-development state. 
 
(c) Stormwater management measures shall be consistent with the requirements of 
Environment Article 4-201 et seq., Annotated Code of Maryland. 
 
14. Resource Conservation Areas (RCAs) 
 
a. Description.  Resource Conservation Areas are those areas which are characterized by natural-dominated environments (that is wetlands, forests, abandoned fields) and resource-utilization activities (that is agriculture, forestry, fisheries activities or aquaculture).  At the time of the initial mapping, these areas shall have had at least one of the following features. 
 
(1) Existing density is less than one dwelling unit per five acres; or 
 
(2) Dominant land use is in agriculture, wetland, forest, barren land, surface water or open space.

Protection Area Section and the Forest and Woodlands Protection Section of this ordinance. 
 
(2) Agricultural and conservation easements shall be promoted in Resource Conservation Areas. 
 
(3) Land within the Resource Conservation area may be developed for residential uses at a density not to exceed one dwelling unit per 20 acres.  Within this limit of overall density, minimum lot sizes may be determined by the Town.  Such mechanisms as cluster development, transfer of development rights, maximum lot size provisions and/or additional means to maintain the land areas necessary to support the protective uses will be encouraged by the Town and implemented as necessary. 
 
(4) Existing industrial and commercial facilities, including those that directly support agriculture, forestry, aquaculture or residential development not exceeding the density specified above, shall be allowed in Resource Conservation Areas. 
 
(5) New commercial, industrial, and institutional uses shall not be permitted in Resource Conservation areas, except as provided for in the Town’s growth allocation provisions. Additional land may not be zoned or used for industrial, commercial, or institutional development, except as provided by the Town’s growth allocation provisions. 
 
(6) The Town shall ensure that the overall acreage of forest and woodland within the RCA does not decrease. 
 
(7) Development within the Resource Conservation Areas shall be consistent with the requirements for Limited Development Areas as specified in this ordinance. 
 
(8) Nothing in this section shall limit the ability of a participant in the Agricultural Easement Program to convey real property impressed with such an easement to family members provided that no such conveyance will result in a density greater than one dwelling unit per 20 acres. 
 
(9) In calculating the 1 in 20 acre density of development that is permitted on a parcel located within the Resource Conservation Area, the Town 
may permit the area of any private wetlands located on the property to be included under the following conditions: 
 
(a) The density of development on the upland portion of the parcel may not exceed one dwelling unit per eight acres; and 
 
(b) The area of private wetlands shall be estimated  on the basis of vegetative information    as  designated on the State wetlands maps    or    by  private survey approved   by   the     Town   and   the    State Department of Natural Resources. 
 
d. Land use in the Resource Conservation Area.  In addition to the uses specified above, certain nonresidential uses may be permitted in Resource Conservation Areas if it is determined by the Zoning Administrator or their designee that the proposed use is one of the following: 
 
(1) A home occupation as an accessory use on a residential property and as provided for in the Town's Zoning Ordinance. 
 
 
(2) A golf course developed in accordance with the guidance provided by the Critical Area Commission, excluding main buildings and/or structures such as the clubhouse, pro-shop, parking lot, etc.,  
 
(3) A cemetery that is an accessory use to an existing church; provided impervious surfaces are limited to 15% of the site or 20,000 square feet, whichever is less;  
 
(4) A bed and breakfast facility located in an existing residential structure, where meals are prepared only for guests staying at the facility. 
 
(5) A gun club and skeet-shooting range or similar use but not including main buildings and/or structures, such as  clubhouse, pro-shop, etc. 
 
(6) A day care facility in a dwelling where the operators live on the premises and there are no more than eight children; 
 
(7) A group home or assisted living facility with no more than eight residents; 
(8) Other uses determined by the Town and the Critical Area Commission to be similar to those listed above. 
 
15. Intrafamily Transfers 
 
Notwithstanding the one (1) unit per twenty (20) acre density limitation in the RCA, the Town may permit a bona fide intrafamily transfer   (as defined in the Definitions Section of this Ordinance), subject  to the following conditions: 
 
a. Bona fide intrafamily transfers shall be made only from parcels of land that were of record on May 1, 1986; and are seven (7) acres or more and less than 60 acres in size. 
 
b. The transfer shall be subject to all the requirements of the Town Subdivision Regulations and a notation shall be placed on the final subdivision plat denoting the lot(s) that are created under these provisions. 
 
c. Subdivision of land under the bona fide intrafamily transfer provisions contained herein shall be subject to the following limitations. 
 
 (1) A parcel that is seven acres or more and less than 12  acres in size may be subdivided into two lots. 
 
(2) A parcel that is 12 acres or more and less than 60 acres  in size may be subdivided into three lots.  The lots may be created at different times. 
 
d. As a condition of approval, the Town shall require that any deed for a lot that is created by a bona fide intrafamily transfer shall contain a covenant approved by the Town attorney stating that the lot is created subject to the provisions of Natural Resources Article Section 8-1808.2, Annotated Code of Maryland. 
 
e. A lot created by a bona fide intrafamily transfer may not be conveyed subsequently to any person other than a member of the owner’s immediate family, except under provisions set forth  below. 
 
f. The lot created by a bonafide intrafamily transfer does not prevent the conveyance of the lot to a third party as security for a mortgage or deed of trust. 
 
g. The following standards and procedures are established as part of this section to permit the subsequent conveyance of lots to persons other than immediate family members under 
certain circumstances.  The application shall demonstrate to the Planning Commission that: 
 
 (1) The lot was created as part of a bona fide intrafamily  transfer and not with the intent of subdividing the  original parcel of land for purposes of ultimate  commercial sale; and 
 
(2) A change in circumstances has occurred since the original transfer was made that is not inconsistent with the subtitle and that warrants an exception; or there are other circumstances that are consistent with this Program to maintain land areas necessary to support the protective uses of agriculture, forestry, open space and natural habitats in Resource Conservation Areas and thus warrant an exception. 
 
16. Habitat Protection Areas. 
 
a. Description.  The Habitat Protection Areas Sections of the Town's Critical Area Ordinance address protection of the following four habitats: 
 
(1) The 110-foot Buffer 
 
(2) Threatened and endangered species or species in need of conservation. 
 
(3) Plant and Wildlife Habitat Protection Areas including non-tidal wetlands; 
 
(4) Anadromous Fish Propagation Waters.  
 
          a.  Identification.    Maps illustrating the general location, extent and configuration of Habitat  Protection  Areas   in the Town are on file in Town Hall. They will be used as a  flagging     device to assist property owners, developers, any person proposing development activity, Planning Department, Planning Commission and other agencies of the Town government when reviewing development plans.  While these maps give a general indication of the area, they do not excuse any property owner or operator from establishing to the satisfaction of the Town Planning Commission, whether or not the property or activity will affect the element of habitat to be protected.    At the time of development the applicant will be responsible for providing an on-site analysis and inventory.   
                              
17. The 110 foot Buffer. 
 
a. Definition.  The Buffer is an existing, naturally vegetated area or an area established in vegetation and managed to protect aquatic, wetlands, shore like and terrestrial environments from man-made disturbances. 
 
b. Identification of the Buffer.  The establishment of a minimum 110-foot Buffer in width as measured from mean high water line of tidal waters, the edge of bank of tributary streams, and the landward extent of tidal wetlands shall be required.  
 
c. General Policies. The town adopts the following policies with regard to the functions of the Buffer: 
 
(1) Provide for the removal or reduction of sediments, nutrients and potentially harmful or toxic substances in runoff entering the Bay and its tributaries; 
 
(2) Minimize the adverse effects of human activities on wetlands, shoreline, stream banks, tidal waters and aquatic resources; 
 
(3) Maintain an area of transitional habitat between aquatic and upland communities; 
 
(4) Maintain the natural environment of streams; and 
 
(5) Protect riparian wildlife habitat. 
 
d. Standards.  The following criteria apply to land use activities within the Buffer: 
 
(1) The Buffer shall be established at a minimum distance of 110 feet landward from the mean high water line of tidal waters, the edge of the bank of tributary streams and the landward edge of tidal wetlands within the Critical Area. 
 
(2) The Buffer shall be determined on a site-by-site basis as part of the environmental review and site analysis and shall be expanded beyond 110 feet to include contiguous sensitive areas of steep slopes, hydric soils or highly erodible soils where development or disturbance may impact streams, wetlands or other aquatic environments. In the case of contiguous slopes of 15 percent or greater, the Buffer shall be 
expanded four feet for every one percent of slope or to the top of the slope, whichever is greater in extent. 
 
(3) New development activities including structures, roads, parking areas and other impervious surfaces, mining and related facilities or septic tanks may not be allowed in the Buffer except for those necessarily associated with water-dependent facilities as set forth in this ordinance. 
 
(4) The Buffer shall be maintained in natural vegetation, but may include planted vegetation where necessary to protect, stabilize, or enhance the shoreline.  When land proposed for development or converted to new uses, the Buffer shall be established. In establishing the Buffer, management measures shall be undertaken to provide forest vegetation that assures that the Buffer functions as set forth in this section. 
 
e. Buffer Management Plans.  When the Buffer is required to be established on a development site, when a proposed development activity will impact the Buffer or when the removal of trees or vegetation in the Buffer is proposed, the Town will require that the applicant prepare a Buffer Management Plan. The Plan shall show existing vegetation, any vegetation proposed to be removed, and the proposed plantings required for mitigation. The planting plan shall include the size, species, and location of all plantings. 
 
f. Planting Agreements. For all projects that require establishment of the Buffer or mitigation plantings that exceed 2,000 square feet or 10 trees, the applicant shall execute a planting agreement with the Town.  The planting agreement shall include provisions for the collection of a surety or letter of credit that will permit the Town to accomplish the required planting on the applicant's property or another location selected by the Town should the applicant fail to meet the requirements of the agreement.   
 
g. Tree Cutting in the Buffer.  The Buffer shall be managed to achieve or enhance the policies stated above.  Individual trees may be cut for personal use provided the cutting does not impair water quality or existing habitat value or other functions of the Buffer.  Any cutting in compliance with the provisions specified herein shall require a Buffer Management Plan submitted to the Town of North East, reviewed by the Critical Area Circuit Rider and approved by the Zoning Administrator or their designee prior to any clearing or removal of vegetation.  A Maryland Certified Tree 
Care Expert or a Certified Arborist must perform tree cutting as approved under this provision. Cutting of trees or clearing of vegetation within the Buffer shall be prohibited except that: 
 
(1) Cutting of trees or removal of natural vegetation may be permitted where necessary to provide access to private piers or to install or construct a shore erosion protection device or measure or a water-dependent facility, provided that the device, measure or facility has received all necessary state and federal permits and provided that a Buffer Management Plan has  been reviewed by the Critical Area Circuit Rider and approved by the Zoning Administrator or their designee. 
 
(2) Individual trees may be cut for personal use, provided that this cutting does not impair the water quality or existing habitat value or other functions of the Buffer, and provided that the trees are replaced on an equal basis  for each tree cut.  Planting guidelines for replacement trees are given in Appendix CA-2 of this Ordinance. 
 
(3) Individual trees may be removed which are in danger of falling and causing damage to dwellings or other structures or which are in danger of falling and therefore causing the blockage of streams or resulting in accelerated shore erosion.  Individual trees removed must be replaced on an equal basis for each tree cut as approved by the Critical Area Circuit Rider. 
 
 (4) Horticultural practices may be used in the Buffer to  maintain the health of individual trees. 
 
(5) Other cutting techniques may be undertaken within the Buffer under the advice and guidance of the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources, if necessary to preserve the forest from extensive pest or disease infestation or threat from fire. 
 
(6) Any other tree trimming or cutting must be performed by a licensed tree expert or arborist. 
 
18. Special Buffer Areas (SBA).  
 
 The following provisions apply to new development or redevelopment within 110 feet of tidal waters, tidal wetlands and tributary streams on lots of record as of December 1, 1985. The areas shall have been officially 
identified as Special Buffer Areas by the Town, and approved by the Critical Area Commission.  
 
a. Single Family Detached Residential Area: For single-family, detached residential areas designated as Special Buffer Areas, new development or redevelopment activities on developed lots or parcels will not be permitted in the Buffer unless efforts have been made to minimize Buffer impacts and the development complies with the following standards: 
 
(1) The applicant can demonstrate that there is no feasible alternative for the location of the new development or redevelopment activities, including structures, roads, parking areas and other impervious surfaces. 
 
(2) New development or redevelopment shall minimize the shoreward extent of intrusion into the Buffer. New development and redevelopment shall not be located closer to the water (or the edge of tidal wetlands) than principal structures on adjacent properties or the local setback for the zoning district, whichever is greater. In no case shall new development or redevelopment be located less than 25 feet from the water (or the edge of tidal wetlands). 
 
(3) Existing principal or accessory structures in the Buffer may be replaced in the same location. Any increase in impervious area within the Buffer shall comply fully with the requirements of this section. 
 
(4) New accessory structures may be permitted in the Buffer in accordance with the following setback requirements: 
 
(a) New accessory structures may be located closer  to the water or edge of tidal wetlands than the dwelling only if there are no other locations for  the accessory structures; 
 
(b) The area of the accessory structures within the Buffer shall be minimized and the cumulative total area  of  all  new and existing accessory structures  within the Buffer shall not exceed 500 square feet  within 50 feet of the water and 1,000 square feet total; and 
 
(c) In no case shall new accessory buildings or structures be located less than 25 feet from the water or edge of tidal wetlands. 
 
(5) Fences shall be reviewed independently for water quality and quantity issues as determined by the Zoning Administrator or their designee. 
 
(6) Variances to other setback requirements have been considered before additional development within 110 feet of mean high tide is approved. 
 
(7) No natural vegetation may be removed in the Buffer except that required by the proposed construction.  The applicant will be required to maintain any other existing natural vegetation in the Buffer. Any clearing of trees or other removal of vegetation shall be completed consistent with provision set forth above. 
 
(8) Development does not impact any other habitat protection area other than the Buffer, including non-tidal wetlands, other state and federal permits notwithstanding. 
 
(9) Special Buffer Area designations shall not be used to facilitate the filling of tidal or non-tidal wetlands that are contiguous to the Buffer to create additional buildable land for new development or redevelopment. 
 
(10) Mitigation for development or redevelopment in the Special Buffer Area approved under this section shall be implemented as follows:  
 
(a) Natural vegetation of an area twice the extent of the  footprint of the development activity within the 110-foot Buffer shall be planted on-site in the Buffer or other location as may be determined by the Zoning Administrator or their designee. If it is not possible to carry out offsets or other mitigation within the Critical Area, any planting or other habitat/water quality improvements should occur within the affected watershed. 
 
(b)  Applicants who cannot comply with the     planting requirements may use offsets to meet the mitigation requirements.   Offsets may include the removal of an equivalent area of 
existing impervious surfaces in the Buffer,   the construction of best management practices for stormwater, wetland creation or restoration or other  measures,  approved by the Zoning Administrator or their designee in consultation  with the Critical Area Circuit Rider, that improve water quality or habitat. 
 
(c) Applicants who cannot comply with either the planting or offset requirements above on-site or off-site within the Critical Area shall pay a fee in lieu of $2.50 per  square  foot  for the  areas to be planted. 
 
(d) Any required reforestation, mitigation or offset areas must be designated under a development  agreement or other instrument and recorded among the land records.  Cost of recordation shall be paid by the applicant/owner. 
 
(e) Monies collected under this section shall be deposited in a separate account and shall be used  for plantings or water quality Best Management  Practices within the Town’s Critical Area and  shall  not revert to the general fund. 
 
b. Commercial Industrial, Institutional, Recreational and Multi-family Residential Areas: In designated Special Buffer Areas (SBA), new development and redevelopment activities will not be permitted in the Buffer unless efforts have been made to minimize Buffer impacts and the development complies with the following standards: 
 
(1) The applicant can demonstrate that there is no feasible alternative for the location of the new development or redevelopment activity, including structures, roads, parking areas and other impervious surfaces or septic systems. 
 
(2) The applicant can demonstrate that efforts have been made to minimize Buffer impacts by locating activities as far as possible from mean high tide, the landward edge of tidal wetlands or the edge of tributary streams, and variances to other local setback requirements have been considered before additional intrusion into the Buffer. Convenience or expense shall not be factors considered when   
evaluating the extent   of allowable impacts to the Buffer. 
 
(3) New development, including accessory structures, shall minimize the extent of intrusion into the Buffer. New development shall not be located closer to the water (or edge of tidal wetlands) than the zoning district setback or 25 feet, whichever is greater. Structures on adjacent properties shall not be used to determine the setback line.  The 25-foot setback shall be maintained on all subsequent development or redevelopment of the property. 
 
(4) Redevelopment, including accessory structures, shall minimize the extent of intrusion into the Buffer.  Redevelopment shall not be located  closer to the water (or edge of tidal wetlands) than the zoning district setback or 25 feet, whichever is greater.  Structures on adjacent properties shall not be used to determine the setback line.  Existing structures located within the setback may remain or a new structure may be constructed on the footprint of an existing structure or impervious surface.  Opportunities to establish a 25-foot setback should be maximized. 
 
(5) Development and redevelopment may not impact any Habitat Protection Areas other than the Buffer, including nontidal wetlands, other state or federal permits notwithstanding. 
 
(6) No natural vegetation may be removed in the Buffer except that required by the proposed construction.   
 
(7) Special Buffer Area designation shall not be used to facilitate the filling of tidal or non-tidal wetlands that are contiguous to the Buffer or to create additional buildable land for new development or redevelopment. 
 
(8) Any development or redevelopment in the Special Buffer Area approved under this subsection shall be implemented as follows: 
 
(a) A forested or landscaped buffer yard, 25 feet wide  shall be established on the project site between the development and the water.  This buffer yard  shall be densely planted with trees and shrubs in accordance with Table 1. 
 
(b) On redevelopment sites, if existing structures or those  rebuilt on an existing footprint limit the area available for planting, then appropriate modifications to the width of the planted bufferyard may be made on a case-by-case basis as approved by the Zoning Administrator or their designee in consultation with the Critical Area Circuit Rider. 
 
(9) In addition to the 25-foot buffer yard on site as described above, one of the following mitigation measures shall be implemented based on the following order of preference: 
 
(a) Natural forest vegetation of an area twice the extent of the footprint of the development activity shall be planted within the 110-foot Buffer on-site, or at another location approved by the Planning Commission. 
 
(b) Applicants who cannot comply with the planting requirements in (a) above may use offsets to meet mitigation requirements.  Offsets include the removal of an equivalent area of existing impervious surfaces in the Buffer,      the    construction  of best management practices for stormwater, wetland creation or restoration or other measures  recommended by the Critical Area Circuit Rider and  approved by the Zoning Administrator or their  designee that improve water quality or habitat.  If it  is not possible to carry out offsets or other mitigation within the Critical Area, any planting or other habitat/water quality improvements should occur within the affected watershed. 
 
(c) Applicants who cannot meet either the                     planting or offset requirements shall pay a fee    in lieu of $2.50 per square foot for the area to be planted. 
 
(d) Any required reforestation/mitigation offset areas  must be designated under a development  agreement or other instrument and recorded among the land records. Cost of recordation shall be paid by applicant/owner. 
 
(e) Monies collected under this section shall be deposited in a separate account and shall be used for plantings in the Critical Area and  shall not revert to the general fund.

All new commercial, industrial, institutional, recreational, multi-family residential development or redevelopment projects shall be submitted to the Critical Area Commission in accordance with COMAR 27.03.01.03.  Mitigation plans shall be included as part of the project submission. 
 
d. Review Process for Projects in SBAs. The Planning Commission shall make written findings documenting that all the Criteria in this section are met including that the disturbance to the Buffer is the least intrusion necessary.  These findings shall be available to the Commission upon request. 
 
19. Threatened or Endangered species and Species in Need of Conservation. 
 
a. Definition. Areas of threatened and endangered species and areas with species in need of conservation are those areas where these species, as designated by the Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources, are found or have historically been found and their surrounding habitats.  In this section, the following words have the meanings indicated: 
 
(1) "Threatened species" means any species of fish, wildlife, or plants designated as such by regulation by the Secretary of the Department of Natural 
Resources which appear likely, within the foreseeable future, to become endangered, including any species of wildlife or plant determined to be a "threatened" species pursuant to the Federal Endangered Species Act, 16 USC '1531 et seq., as amended. 
 
(2) "Endangered species" means any species of fish, wildlife, or plants which have been designated as such by regulation by the Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources.  Designation occurs when the continued existence of these species as viable components of the State's resources are determined to be in jeopardy.  This includes any species determined to be an "endangered" species pursuant to the Federal Endangered Species Act, cited above. 
 
(3) "Species in need of conservation" means those fish and wildlife whose continued existence as a part of the State's resources are in question and which may be designated by regulation by the Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources as in need of conservation pursuant to the requirements of Natural Resources Articles, 10-2A-903 and 4-2A-03, Annotated Code of Maryland. 
 
b. General policies. The Town shall provide protection for threatened and endangered species, those species in need of conservation and their habitats, which occur in the Critical Area. 
 
c. Standards. The Town shall provide for the protection of the known habitats of species in need of conservation and threatened and endangered species and also habitats of these species that may be identified in the future.   If a development activity is proposed for a site within the Critical Area, then the Town shall review the proposed activities on a case-by-case basis and seek technical advice from the Department of Natural Resources. Based on the Department’s recommendations, additional research and site analysis may be required to identify the location of threatened and endangered species on a site.  If any habitats are identified on a project site, the applicant shall coordinate with the Department of Natural Resources to develop a Habitat Protection Plan to protect and conserve the habitats identified. The applicant shall obtain approval of the habitat Protection Plan from the Planning Commission.  This information concerning habitats will be 
incorporated into the Town’s Resource Inventory Maps for future reference. 
 
d. Implementation.     The owner of any property containing a portion of, or adjacent to, a habitat of a threatened or endangered species or a species in need of conservation, on which a land altering or land development activity, is proposed shall prepare a Habitat Protection Plan, as described in paragraph (g) below. It shall be submitted to and approved by the Town Planning Commission prior to beginning the activity.  The Planning Commission will request a review by and comments from the Department of Natural Resources. A land altering activity, shall include, but not be limited to, such activities as subdivision, timbering, sand and gravel mining, clearing new farmlands, the construction of homes or commercial structures. 
 
(1) The Town shall maintain a list of landowners who have endangered species on their land.  The Town and State policy is to encourage cooperative management agreements with private landowners as the best way to preserve and protect critical habitats for endangered or threatened species.  In the long term, however, easements or acquisition of the lands for preservation of these habitats should be sought. 
 
(2) Management agreements, easements, and acquisition efforts shall be coordinated with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and other appropriate public agencies, private organizations and affected landowners.  
 
e.      Public notice.  The determination of the existence and extent of these habitats and protection areas shall result from a cooperative effort between the Town and public agencies or private organizations.  If the Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources designates additional species by regulation in the future, public hearings, as appropriate, shall be held to consider comments on these areas and the protection measures proposed for these species.  The protection measures shall be adopted within 12 months of the date of the Secretary’s designation. 
 
(1) The establishment of Habitat Protection Areas shall not be intended to restrict or affect, beyond any existing local, State or Federal laws or regulations or on private land, any private restrictions, such activities as non-commercial passive recreation (for example, hiking and nature photography), 
educational pursuits, scientific observation, or non-commercial hunting, trapping or fishing.   
 
(2) Development activities in areas of threatened or endangered species in need of conservation may be subject to other provisions and requirements of this program. 
 
20. Plant and Wildlife Habitat and Nontidal Wetlands Protection Plan. 
 
a. Definitions.  In this section, the following words have the meanings indicated: 
 
(1) "Plant habitat" means a community of plants commonly  identifiable by the composition of its vegetation and its  physiographic characteristics. 
 
(2) "Wildlife habitat" means those plant communities and  physiographic features that provide food, water and  cover,  nesting, and foraging or feeding conditions  necessary to  maintain populations of animals in the Critical Area. 
 
b. Description.   The following plant and wildlife habitats shall be identified in the Critical Area: 
 
 (1) Colonial water bird nesting sites; 
 
 (2) Historic waterfowl staging and concentration areas in  tidal waters, tributary streams or tidal and non-tidal  wetlands; 
 
(3) Existing riparian forests (example: relatively mature forests of at least 300 feet in width which occur adjacent to streams, wetlands, or the bay shoreline and which are documented breeding areas); 
 
(4) Forest areas utilized as breeding areas by forest interior dwelling  birds and other wildlife species (example:  relatively mature forested areas within the Critical Area  of 100 acres or more, or forest connected with such areas); 
 
(5) Other areas which may, in the future, be identified by the State and Federal agencies as important plant and wildlife habitat areas;  
 
 (6) Other plant and wildlife habitats determined to be of  local significance; and 
 
 (7) Natural Heritage Areas which have been designated; 
 
 (8) Non-tidal wetlands. 
 
c. General policies. The policies of the Town regarding plant and wildlife habitat in the Critical area shall be to: 
  
(1) Conserve wildlife habitat in the Critical Area; 
 
(2) Protect those wildlife habitats that tend to be least abundant or which may become so in the future if current land-use trends continue; 
 
(3) Protect those wildlife habitat types which are required to support the continued present of various species; 
 
(4) Protect those wildlife habitat types and plant communities which are determined by the Town to be of local significance; 
 
(5) Protect Natural Heritage Areas; and  
 
(6) Protect and conserve non-tidal wetlands. 
 
d. Standards. The Towns Critical Area Program and ordinance will serve to accomplish the goals of the Critical Area Program to protect water quality and wildlife habitat. In addition to the standards set forth in this ordinance for the protection of the Buffer, the following standards shall apply to new development and redevelopment within the Critical Area: 
 
(1) Any development or significant land use change of property located within the Critical Area of the Town will require a site specific survey to determine the presence of any  plant and wildlife habitat areas.  The survey shall be submitted along with design plans and a written description of the measures the property owner proposed to take to protect the habitats identified.  This information concerning habitats will be incorporated onto the Resource Inventory Maps for future reference. 
 
(2) The Town may seek additional information and comments from the Department of Natural Resources and other appropriate agencies and adjacent jurisdictions. 
 
(3) When proposing development activities within riparian forests or forest areas utilized as breeding areas by forest interior dwelling birds, applicants are advised to review and utilize the guidance found in the Critical Area Commission publication entitled, A Guide to the Conservation of Forest Interior Dwelling Birds in the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area, dated June 2000, and as may be subsequently amended.  In addition, the Department of Natural Resources may make specific recommendations based on an evaluation of the site and the proposed development. 
 
(4) The Town will encourage the conservation of rough areas, e.g., depressions, swales, non-tidal wetlands or other areas unsuitable for development or agriculture as wildlife cover. Using cluster development, the developer shall leave these areas in natural vegetation or where this is not feasible, replant with native vegetation. 
 
(5) For development activities in RCA and LDA, wildlife corridors shall be established and used to connect areas left in forest cover with any large forest tracts which are located outside of the area of the property being developed or subdivided.  The area left in forest cover (at least 70 percent of the tract in LDAs or RCAs as required by this ordinance) shall be adjacent to larger forest, not left as an isolated island of trees.  Planting required as a mitigation measure shall also be adjacent to other habitat.  
 
(6) Buffer areas for colonial water bird (heron, egret, tern, and glossy ibis) nesting sites shall be established (if such birds are found to exist in the Critical Area) so that these sites are protected from the adverse impacts of development activities and from disturbance during the breeding season. 
 
(7) New water-dependent facilities shall be located to prevent disturbance to sites of significance to wildlife such as historic, aquatic staging and concentration areas for waterfowl. 
 
(8) Protection measures, including a buffer area, shall be established where appropriate, for other plant and wildlife habitat sites identified in this ordinance.  
 
(9) Forested areas required to support wildlife species identified as threatened and endangered, or in need of conservation, shall be protected and conserved by 
developing management programs which have as their objective, conserving the wildlife that inhabit or use the areas. Development activities, or the clearing or cutting of trees which might occur in the areas, shall be conducted so as to conserve riparian habitat, forest interior wildlife species and their habitat.  Management measures may include incorporating appropriate wildlife protection elements into Timber Harvest Plans, Forest Management Plans, cluster zoning or other site design criteria which provide for the conservation of wildlife habitat.  Measures may also include Soil Conservation Plans which have wildlife habitat protection provisions appropriate to the areas defined above, and incentive programs which use the acquisition of easements and other similar techniques. 
 
(10) When development activities, or the cutting or clearing of trees, occurs in forested areas, to the extent practical, corridors of existing forest or woodland vegetation shall be maintained to provide effective connections between wildlife habitat areas. 
 
(11) Those plant and wildlife habitats considered to be of local significance by the Town shall be protected. Examples of these are those whose habitat values may not be of statewide significance, but are of importance locally or regionally because they contain species uncommon or of limited occurrence in the jurisdiction, or because the species are found in unusually high concentrations. 
 
(12) Natural Heritage Areas shall be protected from alterations due to development activities or cutting or clearing so that the structure and species composition of the areas are maintained    
 
(a) Development  activities or cutting and clearing in Natural Heritage Areas shall be prohibited unless an analysis is performed and measures proposed to mitigate any adverse impacts of the proposed activities.  The analysis and mitigation measures shall be prepared by qualified professionals (e.g., ornithologists, zoologoists, environmental engineers and planners) at the expense of the applicant and shall address the expected effects on the natural environment within the Natural Heritage Area.   
(b) The analysis shall be submitted to the Town Planning Commission which will then submit it to the State Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.  Upon receiving said comment and, if appropriate, upon seeking the advice of expert consultants, the Planning  Commission shall find against or in favor of the activities or may make suggestions for changing  the analysis and ask the applicant to resubmit the analysis.  The initial review between the Planning Commission and State Department of Natural Resources should be completed within  sixty (60) days from submission. 
 
e. Standards for non-tidal wetland protection.   In addition to the standards set forth in this ordinance for protection of the Buffer and expansion of the Buffer for hydric soils, the following shall apply to new development and re-development in the Critical Area: 
 
(1) Maintain at least a 25-foot buffer around identified non-tidal wetlands where development activities or other activities that may disturb the wetlands or the wildlife contained therein, shall be prohibited unless it can be shown that these activities will not adversely affect the wetland.  This requirement is not intended to restrict the grazing of livestock in these wetlands. 
 
(2) Protect the hydrologic regime and water quality of identified non-tidal wetlands by providing that development activities or other land disturbances in the drainage area of the wetlands shall minimize alterations to the surface or subsurface flow of water into and from the wetlands and not cause impairment of the water quality or the plant and wildlife and habitat value of the wetland. 
 
(3) If an applicant demonstrates that activities or operations that impact non-tidal wetlands are water-dependent or of substantial economic benefit, but will cause unavoidable and necessary impacts to the wetlands, a Mitigation Plan is required.  The Plan shall specify mitigation measures that will provide water quality benefits and plant and wildlife habitat equivalent to those of the wetland destroyed or altered and shall be accomplished, to the extent possible, on site or near the affected wetland. In 
evaluating a proposal involving wetland impacts, the Planning Commission shall consider the following: 
 
(a) Avoiding the impact by not taking a certain action or parts of an action; 
 
(b) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree of magnitude of action and its implementation; 
 
(c) Remediation for the impact by repairing, rehabilitation, or restoring the affected environments; 
 
(d) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action; and 
 
(e) Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments. 
 
(4) For all activities or operations that impact non-tidal wetlands or the non-tidal wetland buffer, the applicant shall seek comments on Mitigation Plans from the Department of Natural Resources, and where appropriate, State departments including the Departments of the Environment and Agriculture, the local Soil Conservation Districts and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Upon finding that the plan as proposed, or as may be modified to address the comments of these agencies, provides mitigation sufficient to accomplish the objectives of this section, then the proposer shall implement the plan. 
 
f. Public notice.  The determination of the existence and extent of these habitats and protection areas shall result from a cooperative effort between the Town and public agencies or private organizations.  If the Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources designates additional species by regulation in the future, public hearings, as appropriate, shall be held to consider comments on these areas and the protection measures proposed for these species.  The protection measures shall be adopted within 12 months of the date of the Secretary’s designation. 
 
(1) The establishment of Habitat Protection Areas shall not be intended to restrict or affect, beyond any existing local, State or Federal laws or regulations or on private land, any private restrictions, such activities as non-commercial passive recreation (for 
example, hiking and nature photography), educational pursuits, scientific observation, or non-commercial hunting, trapping or fishing.   
 
(2) Development activities in areas of threatened or endangered species in need of conservation may be subject to other provisions and requirements of this program. 
 
21.      Anadromous Fish Propagation Waters. 
 
a. Definition. Anadromous fish propagation waters are those streams that are tributary to the Chesapeake Bay where spawning of anadromous species (e.g., rockfish or striped bass, yellow perch, white perch, shad and river herring) occurs or has occurred.   
 
b. Identification.  The Town has identified and mapped anadromous fish propagation waters as defined in this section, and these maps are available at Town Hall. 
  
c. General policies.  The policies of the Town with regard to anadromous fish propagation waters shall be to: 
 
(1) Protect the instream and streambank habitat of anadromous fish propagation waters; 
 
(2) Promote land use policies and practices in the watershed of spawning streams within the Critical Area which will minimize the adverse impacts of development on the water quality of the streams; and 
 
(3) Provide for the unobstructed movement of spawning and larval forms of anadromous fish in streams. 
 
d. Standards. Within anadromous fish propagation watersheds, the following measures are required: 
 
(1) The installation or introduction of concrete riprap or other artificial surfaces onto the bottom of natural streams shall be prohibited unless it can be demonstrated that water quality and fisheries habitat can be improved. 
 
(2) Channelization or other physical alterations which may change the course or circulation of a stream and thereby interfere with the movement of fish, shall be prohibited. 
 
(3) The Town shall require each development activity that occurs within a watershed draining to anadromous fish propagation waters to fulfill the following objectives: 
 
(a) Minimize development activities or land disturbances within the watershed; 
 
(b) Maintain, or if practicable, improve water quality in affected streams or other water bodies; 
 
(c) Minimize to the extent possible the discharge of sediments into affected streams or other water bodies; 
 
(d) Maintain, or if practicable, increase the natural or native vegetation of the watershed and tree canopy over the streams; 
 
(4) The Town shall ensure coordination and compliance with complementary State laws and regulations: 
 
(a) Prohibit the construction or placement of dams or other structures that would interfere with or prevent the movement of spawning fish or larval forms in streams or other designated water bodies.  If practical, existing structures shall be removed; and 
 
(b) Ensure that the construction, repair or maintenance activities associated with bridges, or other stream crossing or with utilities and roads, which involve disturbance within the buffer or which occur instream, as described in COMAR 08.05.03.11B(5), shall be prohibited between March 1 and June 15 of each year. 
 
22. Special Buffer Area Mapping Standards (SBA) 
 
 The following standards shall apply for the mapping of new Special Buffer Areas: 
 
a. Only lots of record as of December 1, 1985 are eligible for mapping as Special Buffer Areas (SBAs) 
 
b. The area being considered for SBA designation shall contain a Buffer that was significantly impacted by 
development at the time of program adoption and that prevents the Buffer from fulfilling its functions. 
 
c. Developed parcels or lots shall contain a Buffer intrusion by the principal structures (excluding utilities or septic systems).  
 
d. Undeveloped or vacant parcels or lots (i.e., infill) may be designated as a SBA if development within the Buffer can not be avoided based on the size of the parcel or lot, area of the parcel or lot within the Buffer, or the surrounding pattern of development. 
 
e. If only part of a parcel or lot meets the criteria for designation as a SBA, then only those portions of a parcel or lot shall be designated as a SBA.  The portion of the parcel designated as a SBA will be subject to the SBA development restrictions.  Portions of the property that are not designated as a SBA shall comply fully with the 110 foot Buffer restrictions. 
 
f. Any proposal by a jurisdiction for designation of an area as a SBA shall include, at a minimum, the jurisdiction's written findings and supporting reasons which demonstrate the degree to which the proposed SBA does not perform each of the following Buffer functions: 
 
(1) Provide for the removal or reduction of sediments, nutrients, and potentially harmful or toxic substances in runoff entering the Bay and its tributaries; 
 
(2) Minimize the adverse effects of human activities on wetlands, shorelines, stream banks, and aquatic resources; 
 
(3) Maintain an area of transitional habitat between aquatic and upland communities; 
 
(4) Maintain the natural environment of streams; and 
 
(5) Protect riparian wildlife habitat. 
 
23. Forest and Woodland Protection Standards. 
 
a. General Policies. The following policies for forest and woodland protection recognize the value of forested land for its water quality benefits and for habitat protection while accommodating the utilization of forest resources:  
 
(1) Maintain and increase the forested vegetation in the Critical Area; 
 
(2) Conserve forests and developed woodlands and provide for expansion of forested areas; 
 
(3) Provide that the removal of trees associated with development activities shall be minimized and, where appropriate, shall be mitigated; and 
 
(4) Recognize that forests are a protective land use and should be managed in such a manner so that maximum values for wildlife, water quality, timber, recreation, and other resources can be maintained, even when they are mutually exclusive. 
 
b. Identification. The Town has identified and mapped forests and developed woodlands within the Critical Area and has identified and mapped habitat protection areas as described.  More detailed evaluation of forest resources on specific sites shall be accomplished as part of the environmental analysis required prior to site plan and subdivision approval. 
 
c. Policies for the Protection of Riparian and Forest  Habitat. The Town adopts the following policies for the protection of riparian habitat: 
 
(1) Vegetation shall be maintained in its natural condition along all streams to provide wildlife corridors.  
 
(2) A minimum 110-foot Buffer shall extend landward from the mean high water line of tidal water, and the edge of tributary streams and tidal wetlands.  This area is to be conserved for wildlife protection. 
 
(3) Non-tidal wetland forests should be left in a natural state for wildlife and water quality protection. 
 
(4) Forest areas utilized as breeding areas by forest interior dwelling birds and other wildlife species (for example relatively mature forested areas within the Critical Area of 100 acres or more, or forest connected with these areas) shall be conserved. 
 
(5) Existing riparian forests (for example, those relatively mature forest of at least 300 feet in width which occur adjacent to streams, wetlands, or the Bay 
shoreline) and/or which are documented breeding areas shall be conserved. 
 
d. Process. If a forest is to be developed or to be harvested, a site-specific field investigation shall be conducted to determine if important sensitive species present and to make sure that appropriate protection measures are incorporated into the development plan or Timber Harvest Plan. When proposing development activities within riparian forests or forest areas utilized as breeding areas by forest interior dwelling birds, applicants are advised to review and utilize the guidance found in the Critical Area Commission publication entitled, A Guide to the Conservation of Forest Interior Dwelling Birds in the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area, dated June 2000, and as may be subsequently amended. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources may make specific recommendations based on an evaluation of the site and the proposed development.  In general, the following measures are recommended:  
 
(1) Minimize forest and woodlands disturbance from off-road vehicles, public use or logging from May through August of each year; 
 
(2) Focus all development on the periphery of the forest or woodlands; 
 
(3) Retain the forest canopy as well as shrub understory; 
 
(4) Retain snag and mature seed trees as dens for woodpeckers and as nests for bald eagles; 
 
(5) Discourage the creation of small clearings and expansion of forest edge habitats; 
   
(6) Encourage re-establishment of native forests and woodlands; and 
 
(7) Adopt harvest techniques to maintain or improve habitat. 
 
e. Policies for the establishment or replacement of forest. The following policies should be used for afforestation and reforestation: 
 
(1) The replacement or establishment of forest or developed woodlands should ensure a diversified 
plant community and should include canopy trees, understory trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. 
 
(2) Native species should be used for all reforestation and afforestation. 
 
f. Buffer protection standards for timber for personal use. Individual trees may be cut for personal use if the trees cut are replaced on an equal basis and provided the cutting does not impair the water quality or existing habitat value or other functions of the Buffer set forth in that section. Any cutting or removal of natural vegetation as permitted by the provisions specified herein shall require a Buffer Management Plan approved by the Planning Commission or their designee. Cutting or clearing of trees and removal of natural vegetation within the Buffer shall be prohibited except that: 
 
(1) Cutting of trees or removal of natural vegetation may be permitted where necessary to provide access to private piers, or to install or construct a shore erosion protection device or measure, or a water-dependent facility, providing the device, measure or facility has received all necessary State and Federal permits and the trees are replaced on an equal basis for each tree cut. 
 
(2) Individual trees may be cut for personal use providing that this cutting does not impair the water quality or existing habitat value or other functions of the buffer as set forth in the policies of this plan and provided that the trees are replaced on an equal basis for each tree cut. 
 
(3) Individual trees may be removed which are in danger of falling and causing damage to dwellings or other structures, or which are in danger of falling and therefore causing the blockage of streams, or resulting in accelerated shore erosion. 
 
(4) Horticultural practices may be used to maintain the health of individual trees. 
 
(5) Other cutting techniques may be undertaken within the Buffer and under the advice and guidance of the State Departments of Agriculture and Natural Resources, if necessary to preserve the forest from extensive pest or disease infestation or threat from fire. 
 
g. Enforcement. Unauthorized clearing, cutting, or removal of vegetation; unauthorized clearing, cutting, or removal of vegetation in the Buffer; and clearing, cutting or removal of vegetation in excess of the area permitted to be cleared by this ordinance is considered a civil violation of this ordinance and shall result in fines and mandatory planting.  The Zoning Administrator, or their designee, shall have the authority to issue a citation and are hereby declared to be the officials with the duty of enforcing these provisions. 
 
(1) For unauthorized clearing, cutting, or removal of vegetation that does not exceed the area that could be authorized in accordance with this ordinance, fines shall be assessed as set forth in 5-12.6, of this ordinance and reforestation shall be required on an equal area basis if less than 20 percent of the forest cover is removed.  For clearing between 20 percent and 30 percent of the existing forest cover, reforestation shall be required at 1.5 times the total surface acreage of forest cleared. 
   
(2) For unauthorized clearing, cutting, or removal of vegetation that exceeds the area that could be authorized in accordance with this ordinance, fines shall be assessed as set forth in Section 5-12.6,  of this ordinance, and reforestation shall be required at 3 times the total surface acreage of forest cleared. 
 
(3) For unauthorized clearing, cutting, or removal of vegetation in the Buffer or another Habitat Protection Area, fines shall be assessed as set forth in the Section 5-12.6 of this ordinance, and reforestation shall be required at 3 times the total surface acreage of forest cleared. 
 
(4) When trees or vegetative cover cannot be fully replaced on site because of existing vegetation, existing development, or the size of the parcel, then fees-in-lieu of planting may be collected.  Fees shall be assessed at $2.50 per square foot of required mitigation or $250.00 per tree. 
 
(5) Fines collected from enforcement actions in the Critical Area shall be maintained in a separate account to be used by the Town for reforestation or other habitat enhancing efforts. 
 
 
24. Agriculture.  
 
 The   Town  of   North East  does not include any areas that are currently undergoing   or  are  proposed for  agricultural use.    At such time in the future  that  an  area  within the Town would be proposed for this type of  use through annexation or a change in current land use, then appropriate modifications  would  be  made  to  the  Town's Program at the same time that the annexation or approval of the change in land use takes place. 
 
25. Surface Mining in the Critical Area. 
 
 Surface mining is not allowed in the Town of North East.  Should the Town amend their Zoning Ordinance to allow surface mining in any zone within the Critical Area, the Town shall amend its Critical Area  Ordinance to include appropriate language. 
 
26. Amendments in Critical Area Overlay District 
 
a. Program Amendments: The Mayor and Commissioners may from time to time amend the Town Critical Area Regulations.  All such amendments shall also be approved by the Critical Area Commission as established in Section 8-1809 of the Critical Area Act.  The Town shall comprehensively review their entire Critical Area Program including Critical Area Maps and propose necessary amendments at least every six years. No such amendment shall be considered by the Mayor and Commissioners until a recommendation has been made by the Planning Commission on the program amendment. 
 
b. Zoning Map Amendments:  Except for program amendments or program refinements developed during a six-year comprehensive review, a zoning map amendment may only be granted by the Mayor and Commissioners upon proof of a mistake in the existing zoning.  No such amendment shall be considered by the Mayor and Commissioners until a recommendation has been made by the Planning Commission on the map amendment.  This requirement does not apply to proposed changes to a zoning map that meet the following criteria: 
 
(1) Are wholly consistent with the land classifications in the adopted Program; or 
 
(2) Propose the use of growth allocation in accordance with the adopted Program. 
 
c. Process:  When an amendment is requested, the applicant shall submit the amendment to the Planning Commission for review and recommendation. Upon completing Findings 
of Fact, these documents shall be forwarded to the Mayor and Commissioners.  The Mayor and Commissioners shall hold a public hearing at which time parties of interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard.  At least fifteen (15) days notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town.  The Mayor and Commissioners shall forward the approved amendment request to the Critical Area Commission for final approval.  
 
d. Program Amendments and Refinements.  When the town submits a request for review and approval of changes to any element of the Town's Critical Area Program including, but not limited to, amendments, revisions, and modifications to the Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Regulations, Critical Area Maps, implementation procedures, and local policies that affect the Town's program, the request shall include all relevant information necessary for the chairman, and as appropriate, the Commission, to evaluate the changes.  The chairman, and as appropriate, the Commission shall determine if the request for program changes are consistent with the purposes, policies, goals, and provisions of the Critical Area Law and all criteria of the Commission. 
 
 In accordance with the Commission's determination of consistency as outlined above, the Commission shall: 
  
 (1) Approve the proposed program amendment or  refinement  and notify the local jurisdiction; 
 
(2) Deny the proposed program amendment or refinement; 
 
 (3) Approve the proposed program amendment or  refinement  subject to one or more conditions; or 
 
(4) Return the proposed program amendment or refinement to the local jurisdiction with a list of changes to be made. 
 
e. Comprehensive Reviews.  The Town will review its entire Program and propose any necessary amendments to its entire Program, including Critical Area Maps, at least every six years.  The anniversary of the date that the Program became effective shall be used to determine when the review shall be completed.  Within 60 days after the completion of the review, the Town will send the following information in writing to the Commission: 
 
(1) A statement certifying that the required review has been  accomplished; 
 
(2) Any necessary request for program amendments, program refinements, or other matters that the Town wishes the Commission to consider; 
 
 (3) An updated resource inventory; 
 
(4) A statement quantifying acreages within each land classification, the growth allocation used, and the growth allocation remaining. 
 
27. Variance in the Critical Area Overlay District 
 
a. Applicability: The Town has established provisions where, owing to special features of a site or other circumstances, implementation of the Critical Area Program would result in unwarranted hardship to an applicant, a variance may be obtained.  In considering an application for a variance, the Town shall presume that the specific development activity in the Critical Area, that is subject to the application and for which a variance is required, does not conform with the general purpose and intent of Natural Resources Article, Title 8 Subtitle 18, COMAR Title 27, and the requirements of the Town’s Critical Area Program. 
 
b. Standards:  The provisions for granting such a variance shall include evidence submitted by the applicant that the following standards are met: 
 
(1) Special conditions or circumstances exist that are peculiar to the land or structure involved and that a literal enforcement of provisions and requirements of the Town’s Critical Area Program would result in unwarranted hardship. 
 
(2) A literal interpretation of the provisions of the Critical Area Program and related Chapters will deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in similar areas within the Critical Area. 
 
(3) The granting of a variance will not confer upon an applicant any special privilege that would be denied by the Town Critical Area Program to other lands or structures within the Critical Area. 
 
(4) The variance request is not based upon conditions or circumstances which are the result of actions by the applicant, nor does the request arise from any condition relating to land or building use, either permitted or non-
conforming on any neighboring property. 
 
(5) The granting of a variance shall not adversely affect water quality or adversely impact fish, wildlife or plant habitat within the Critical Area and the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general spirit and intent of the Critical Area Act and the Town Critical Area Program. 
 
(6) Applications for a variance will be made in writing to the Town Board of Appeals with a copy provided to the Critical Area Commission. 
 
c. Process:  After hearing an application for a Critical Area Program variance, the Board of Appeals shall make written findings reflecting analysis of each standard.  The applicant has the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion to overcome the presumption of nonconformance established above.  The Town shall notify the Critical Area Commission of its findings and decision to grant or deny the variance request. 
 
d. Findings:  Based on competent and substantial evidence, the Town shall make written findings as to whether the applicant has overcome the presumption of nonconformance as established above.  With due regard for the person’s technical competence, and specialized knowledge, the written findings may be based on evidence introduced and testimony presented by the applicant, Town, a government agency, or anyone deemed appropriate by the town. 
 
e. Conditions and Mitigation:  The Board of Appeals shall impose conditions on the use or development of a property which is granted a variance as it may find reasonable to ensure that the spirit and intent of the Critical Area Program is maintained including, but not limited to the following: 
 
(1) Adverse impacts resulting from the granting of the variance shall be mitigated by planting on the site per square foot of the variance granted at no less than a three to one basis or as recommended by the Critical Area Circuit Rider. 
 
(2) New or expanded structures or impervious surfaces shall be located the greatest possible distance from mean high water, the landward edge of tidal wetlands, tributary streams, nontidal wetlands, or steep slopes. 
 
f. Appeals:  Appeals from decisions concerning the granting or denial of a variance under these regulations shall be taken in accordance with all applicable laws and procedures of the town for variances. Variance decisions by the Board of Appeals may be appealed to the Circuit Court in accordance with the Maryland Rules of 
Procedure.  Appeals may be taken by any person, firm, corporation or governmental agency aggrieved or adversely affected by any decision made under this section. 
 
28. “GA” Growth Allocation Floating Zone District 
 
a. Purpose and Intent:  The “GA” Growth Allocation Floating Zone District is not mapped, but is designated for use areas classified as Resource Conservation Areas (RCA) and/or Limited Development Areas within the Town’s Critical Area Overlay District.  The purpose of the Floating Zone District is to permit a change in the land use management classification established in the Critical Area Overlay District on specified sites so that they may be developed to the extent permitted by the underlying zoning classification or the land use management classification.  Only projects that have been approved by the Mayor and Commissioners for award of the Critical Area Growth Allocation are eligible for this Floating Zone District. The Town will coordinate with the Cecil County Department of Planning on projects being considered for Growth Allocation. 
 
b. Related Approvals. Approval of development plans, e.g., site plan, subdivision plat, PRD plans or master plans shall not be construed as approval of the "GA" Growth Allocation Floating Zone District. An applicant may be approved for such plans and not be approved for the "GA" Growth Allocation Floating Zone District. 
 
c. Guidelines.  When locating new Intensely Developed or Limited Developed Areas, the following guidelines shall be used: 
 
(1) Locate a new Intensely Developed Area in a Limited Development Area or adjacent to an existing Intensely Developed Area; 
 
(2) Locate a new Limited Development Area adjacent to an existing Limited Development Area or an Intensely Developed Area; 
 
(3) New Intensely Developed Areas (IDA) shall be at least 20 acres in size unless: 
 
(a) They are contiguous to an existing IDA, LDA; or 
 
(b) They are a grandfathered commercial or industrial use that existed as of the date of local Program approval. The amount of growth 
allocation  deduction shall be the equivalent to the area of the entire parcel or parcels subject to the growth allocation request. 
 
(4) Locate a new Limited Development Area or an Intensely Developed Area in a manner that minimizes impacts to a Habitat Protection Area as defined in COMAR 27.01.09, and in an area and manner that optimizes benefits to water quality; 
 
(5) New Intensely Developed Areas should be located where they minimize their impacts to the defined land uses of the Resource Conservation Area; 
 
(6) Locate a new Intensely Developed Area or a Limited Development Area in a Resource Conservation Area at least 300 feet beyond the landward edge of tidal wetlands or tidal waters; 
 
(7) New Intensely Developed Areas and Limited Development Areas to be located in Resource Conservation Areas shall conform to all criteria of the Town for such areas, shall be so designed on the Town Zoning Map and shall constitute an amendment to this program subject to review and approval by the Town Planning Commission, the Town Commissioners and the Critical Area Commission. 
 
(8) Growth Allocation located in the RCA shall be coordinated with the County to ensure that no more than 50 percent of Cecil County's Growth Allocation is located within the RCA except as provided for in 8-1808.1 of the Natural Resources Article of the Annoted Code of Maryland.  
 
(9) It is the intent that only those development projects that the Planning Commission concludes are good examples of sensitive development in the Critical Area shall be given growth allocation. 
 
(10) Conditions of approval may be placed on a project prior to granting Growth Allocation. 
 
d.  Application of Guidelines:  When the Town submits a request for the Commission to review and approve the use of growth allocation, the request shall state how the Town has applied the preceding guidelines.  The Commission shall ensure that guidelines set forth in this section have been applied in a manner that is consistent with the 
purposes, policies, goals and provisions of the Critical Area Law and all Criteria of the Commission. 
 
e.   Process:  Applicants for growth allocation shall submit a request for growth allocation accompanied by appropriate plans and environmental reports in accordance with the following: 
 
(1) All applications for growth allocation shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator according to the site plan review schedule available from the Town office. Requests shall be accompanied by a concept plan and appropriate environmental reports and/or studies so as to provide sufficient information to permit the Zoning Administrator who shall review the plans with the assistance of the Critical Area Circuit Rider for compliance with these regulations. At a minimum the following information must be provided: 
 
 (a) An environmental assessment of the site  including impacts to Habitat Protection Areas  and  mitigation for impacts. 
 
(b) Delineation of the Critical Area boundary and the 110-foot Buffer around tidal waters, tidal wetlands and tributary streams. 
 
(c) The acreage in the Critical Area and the acreage to be considered for Growth Allocation. 
 
(d) A discussion on issues of adjacency (e.g., LDAs  adjacent to IDAs). 
 
 The Zoning Administrator shall transmit said documents to the Planning Commission with comments for review at their next regular meeting. The Planning Commission shall review the application for consistency with the Town’s Critical Area regulations and Comprehensive Plan.  
 
(2) The subdivision history of parcels, designated as RCA, must be provided as part of the growth allocation application.  The date of December 1, 1985, is the date used for the original Critical Area mapping and shall be used as a beginning point of analysis. 
 
(3) The Planning Commission can approve, deny or approve with conditions the application for Growth Allocation.  Conditions for approval may be placed on the project to ensure the conservation of sensitive areas and important habitat.  
 
(4) The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the growth allocation request prior to making a recommendation on the proposal to the Mayor and Commissioners. At least fifteen (15) days notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town.   
 
(5) The applicant shall address the Planning Commission’s comments and recommendations and may revise the concept plan accordingly. The growth allocation request shall then be forwarded to the Mayor and Commissioners with a recommendation from the Planning Commission including conditions recommended by the Planning Commission.   
 
(6) The Mayor and Commissioners shall hold a public hearing within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Planning Commission’s recommendation.  At least fifteen (15) days notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town.  The hearing shall include the following: 
 
 (a) Presentation of the project by the developer or  consultant.  
 
 (b) Planning Commission recommendations; 
 
 (c) Public comments; and 
 
 (d) The recommendations of the Critical Area  Commission 
 
(7) The Mayor and Commissioners shall send the approved project to the Cecil County Commissioners to award a portion of the growth allocation designated for the Town to the applicant.  The request shall be accompanied by pertinent plans and environmental reports and/or studies.  Once approved by the County, a copy of the County’s approval shall be sent to the Critical Area Commission with the pertinent plans and environmental report and/or studies.  The Critical 
Area Commission shall notify the Town regarding the processing of the request as an amendment or refinement to the Town’s Critical Area Program.  Refinements shall be acted on within 30 days of the Commission’s notification to the Town of a completed submission.  Amendments shall be acted on within 90 days of the Commission’s notification to the Town of a completed submission.  When the Town submits a request for the Commission to review and approve the use of growth allocation, the request shall ensure how the local jurisdiction has applied the preceding guidelines.  The Commission shall ensure that the guidelines set forth in this section have been applied in a manner that is consistent with the purposes, policies, goals, and provisions of the Critical Area Law and all Criteria of the Commission. 
 
(8) Following approval of the growth allocation request by the Critical Area Commission, the Town Commissioners may implement the change, and the applicant may proceed to the preparation of the final site plan or subdivision plat for recordation.   
 
(9) Prior to approving the final site plan or subdivision plat, the Planning Commission or their designee shall ensure that all conditions of approval are incorporated into the final plan, public works agreement, deed covenants, etc. 
 
(10) The Town’s official Critical Area maps shall be amended to reflect the new land classification, and a copy of the new map shall be provided to the Critical Area Commission. 
 
(11) After a project is approved and Growth Allocation   awarded,  the Growth Allocation so awarded will   expire within two (2) years of the approval date if  no substantial construction or  change of use has   taken place in accordance with the plans for which the Growth Allocation was granted unless an extension has been approved. 
 
f.  Standards for Review of Growth Allocation Projects:  In addition to the requirements listed above, all projects requesting growth allocation shall be reviewed and evaluated for their conformance with the following factors: 
 
(1) The amount of forested area and other vegetative cover that is left undisturbed and in a natural state on the site. 
(2) Additional public improvements and the specific nature of such improvements that will be provided with the proposed development (examples of these would include public access facilities to water front areas, trails to the downtown, dedication of lands for public park purposed, etc.). 
 
(3) Use of innovative and environmentally sensitive site design and construction design features that minimize the disturbance of natural areas and reduce potential impacts on habitat protection areas.  These features could include, but are not limited to: 
 
 (a) The use of cluster development; 
 
 (b) The use of innovative stormwater management  measures; 
 
(c) The use of buffer areas to minimize impacts on existing habitats and wildlife corridors and protect adjacent natural and developed areas from  impacts of the proposed development; 
 
 (d) The use of appropriate landscaping plans and  materials to enhance the establishment of  vegetated buffer areas on the project site. 
 
g. Deduction Methodology: The following standards shall be used to determine the area of Growth allocation to be deducted when the designation of a parcel or a portion of a parcel is changed through the Growth Allocation process:   
 
(1) Subdivision of any parcel of land that was recorded as of December 1, 1985, as classified as RCA where all or part of the parcel is identified by the Town as a Growth Allocation area, shall result in the acreage of the entire parcel not in tidal wetlands counting against the Growth Allocation, unless the development concept outlined in item (b) below is used. 
 
(2) In order to allow some flexibility in the use of Growth Allocation when development is only proposed on a portion of the property, the following methodology may be used.  On a parcel proposed for the use of Growth Allocation, a single development envelope may be specified, and the acreage of the development envelope rather than the acreage of the entire parcel shall be deducted from the Town’s Growth Allocation 
if the development envelope meets the following criteria:  
 
(a) The development envelope shall include individually owned lots, required buffers, impervious surfaces, roads, utilities, stormwater  management measures, on-site sewage disposal  measures, any acres subject to human use such  as active recreation acres, and any additional acreage needed to meet the development  requirements of the criteria. The required buffers refer to a minimum 110-foot Buffer and the 25-foot non-tidal wetlands buffer. 
 
 (b) Only one development envelope shall be  established per parcel of land. 
 
(c) If a development envelope is proposed in the RCA, a minimum of 20 acres must remain outside of the   development envelope or the acreage of  the entire  parcel must be deducted.    If the original parcel in the RCA is less than 20 acres, then the acreage of the entire parcel must be deducted.  If there is a permanently protected Resource Conservation Area (an area protected by easement) adjacent and contiguous to a residue that is less than 20 acres, that will result in a minimum 20 acre residue, then the entire parcel does not have to be deducted. 
 
(d) The minimum 20 acre residue outside of the development envelope may be developed at an RCA  density unless some type of permanent protection  exists that restricts development. 
 
(3) For Growth Allocation areas proposed in the RCA, a 300-foot naturally vegetated Buffer is strongly encouraged and where it is provided it shall not be deducted even if the Buffer does not meet the 20 acre minimum requirement.

SECTION 1.0 GENERAL PROVISIONS 
1.1 Findings 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified special flood hazard areas within the boundaries of the Town of North East.  Special flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.  Structures that are inadequately elevated, improperly floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage also contribute to flood losses. 
The Town of North East, by resolution, agreed to meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program and was accepted for participation in the program on October 15, 1981.  As of that date, or as of October 15, 1981 the initial effective date of the Town of North East’s Flood Insurance Rate Map, all development and new construction as defined herein, are to be compliant with these regulations.     
1.2 Statutory Authorization 
The Maryland General Assembly, in Md. Code Ann., Land Use Article, Title 4, has established as policy of the State that the orderly development and use of land and structures requires comprehensive regulation through the implementation of planning and zoning control, and that planning and zoning controls shall be implemented by local government in order to, among other purposes, secure the public safety, promote health and general welfare, and promote the conservation of natural resources.    Therefore, the Mayor and Commissioners of the Town of North East does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
1.3 Statement of Purpose 
It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to: 
(A) Protect human life, health and welfare; 

(B) Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future; 

(C) Minimize flooding of water supply and sanitary sewage disposal systems; 

(D) Maintain natural drainage; 

(E) Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units and its residents, by discouraging unwise design and construction of development in areas subject to flooding; 


(F) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 

(G) Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 

(H) Minimize damage to public facilities and other utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges; 

(I) Reinforce that those who build in and occupy special flood hazard areas should assume responsibility for their actions;  

(J) Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and near flood-prone areas; 

(K) Provide that the flood storage and conveyance functions of floodplains are maintained; 

(L) Minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains; 

(M) Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally incompatible; and 

(N) Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 44 CFR Section 59.22. 


1.4 Areas to Which These Regulations Apply 
These regulations shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the Town of North East, and identified in Section 1.5. 
1.5 Basis for Establishing Special Flood Hazard Areas and BFEs 
(A) For the purposes of these regulations, the minimum basis for establishing special flood hazard areas and base flood elevations is the Flood Insurance Study for Cecil County, Maryland and Incorporated Areas dated July 8, 2013 and May 4, 2015, or the most recent revision thereof, and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map(s) and all subsequent amendments and revisions to the FIRMs.  The FIS and FIRMs are retained on file and available to the public at the North East Town Hall.  

(B) Where field surveyed topography or digital topography indicates that ground elevations are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard on the FIRM, the area shall be considered as special flood hazard area.   

(C) To establish base flood elevations in special flood hazard areas that do not have such elevations shown on the FIRM, the Floodplain Administrator may provide the best available data for base flood elevations, may require the applicant to obtain available information from Federal, State or other sources, or may require the applicant to establish special flood hazard areas and base 


flood elevations as set forth in Section 3.3, Section 3.4, and Section 3.5 of these regulations.   


1.6 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions 
These regulations are not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing regulations and ordinances, including subdivision regulations, zoning ordinances, building codes, or any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.  In the event of a conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern.   
1.7 Interpretation 
In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions shall be: 
(A) Considered as minimum requirements; 

(B) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and, 

(C) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes. 


Notes referencing publications of the Federal Emergency Management Agency refer to the most recent edition of those publications, are intended only as guidance, and do not bind or alter the authority of the Floodplain Administrator to interpret and apply these regulations. 
1.8 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability 
The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.  Larger floods can and will occur, and flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes.  These regulations do not imply that land outside of the special flood hazard areas or uses that are permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage.  
These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the Town of North East, any officer or employee thereof, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
1.9 Severability 
Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
SECTION 2.0 DEFINITIONS 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these regulations shall be interpreted to have the meaning they have in common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application. 
Accessory Structure:  A building or structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.  For the purposes of these regulations, an accessory structure shall be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage.  
Agreement to Submit an Elevation Certificate:  A form on which the applicant for a permit to construct a building or structure, to construct certain horizontal additions, to place or replace a manufactured home, to substantially improve a building, structure, or manufactured home, agrees to have an Elevation Certificate prepared by a licensed professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor, as specified by the Floodplain Administrator, and to submit the certificate:  
(1) Upon placement of the lowest floor and prior to further vertical construction; and  

(2) Prior to the final inspection and issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. 


Alteration of a Watercourse:  For the purpose of these regulations, alteration of a watercourse includes, but is not limited to widening, deepening or relocating the channel, including excavation or filling of the channel.  Alteration of a watercourse does not include construction of a road, bridge, culvert, dam, or in-stream pond unless the channel is proposed to be realigned or relocated as part of such construction.     
Area of Shallow Flooding:  A designated Zone AO on the Flood Insurance Rate Map with a 1-percent annual chance or greater of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident; such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
Base Building:  The building to which an addition is being added.  This term is used in provisions relating to additions.   
Base Flood:  The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year; the base flood also is referred to as the 1-percent annual chance (100-year) flood.   
Base Flood Elevation:  The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to the datum specified on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map.  In areas of shallow flooding, the base flood elevation is the highest adjacent natural grade elevation plus the 
depth number specified in feet on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, or at least four (4) feet if the depth number is not specified.   
Basement:  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.   
Building Code(s):  The effective Maryland Building Performance Standards (COMAR 05.02.07), including the building code, residential code, and existing building code.   
Coastal A Zone:  An area within a special flood hazard area, landward of a coastal high hazard area (V Zone) or landward of a shoreline without a mapped coastal high hazard area, in which the principal source(s) of flooding are astronomical tides and storm surges, and in which, during base flood conditions, the potential exists for breaking waves with heights greater than or equal to 1.5 feet.  The inland limit of the Coastal A Zone may be delineated on FIRMs as the Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiWMA). 
Coastal High Hazard Area:  An area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms.  Coastal high hazard areas also are referred to as “V Zones” and are designated on FIRMs as zones VE or V1-30. 
Community:  A political subdivision of the State of Maryland (county, city or town) that has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations within its jurisdictional boundaries. 
Critical and Essential Facilities:  Buildings and other structures that are intended to remain operational in the event of extreme environmental loading from flood, wind, snow or earthquakes. [Note:  See Maryland Building Performance Standards, Sec. 1602 and Table 1604.5.]  Critical and essential facilities typically include hospitals, fire stations, police stations, storage of critical records, facilities that handle or store hazardous materials, and similar facilities.  
Declaration of Land Restriction (Nonconversion Agreement):  A form signed by the owner to agree not to convert or modify in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of the permit and these regulations, certain enclosures below the lowest floor of elevated buildings and certain accessory structures.  The form requires the owner to record it on the property deed to inform future owners of the restrictions.  
Development:  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, placement of manufactured homes, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
Elevation Certificate:  FEMA form on which surveyed elevations and other data pertinent to a property and a building are identified and which shall be completed by a 
licensed professional land surveyor or a licensed professional engineer, as specified by the Floodplain Administrator.  When used to document the height above grade of buildings in special flood hazard areas for which base flood elevation data are not available, the Elevation Certificate shall be completed in accordance with the instructions issued by FEMA.  [Note:  FEMA Form 086-0-33 and instructions are available online at http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=1383.]   
Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor:  An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure that is located below an elevated building, is surrounded by walls on all sides, and is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations.  Also see “Lowest Floor.” 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):  The Federal agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program. 
Flood or Flooding:  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1) The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or 

(2) The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 


Flood Damage-Resistant Materials:  Any construction material that is capable of withstanding direct and prolonged contact with floodwaters without sustaining any damage that requires more than cosmetic repair.  [Note:  See NFIP Technical Bulletin #2, “Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements.”] 
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM):  An official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated special flood hazard areas to indicate the magnitude and nature of flood hazards, to designate applicable flood zones, and to delineate floodways, if applicable.  FIRMs that have been prepared in digital format or converted to digital format are referred to as Digital FIRMs (DFIRM).  
Flood Insurance Study (FIS):  The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided flood profiles, floodway information, and the water surface elevations.    
Flood Opening:  A flood opening (non-engineered) is an opening that is used to meet the prescriptive requirement of 1 square inch of net open area for every square foot of enclosed area.  An engineered flood opening is an opening that is designed and certified by a licensed professional engineer or licensed architect as meeting certain performance characteristics, including providing automatic entry and exit of floodwaters; this certification requirement may be satisfied by an individual certification for a specific 
building or issuance of an Evaluation Report by the ICC Evaluation Service, Inc.  [Note:  See NFIP Technical Bulletin #1, “Openings in Foundation Walls and Walls of Enclosures.”] 
Flood Protection Elevation:  The base flood elevation plus two (2) feet of freeboard.  Freeboard is a factor of safety that compensates for uncertainty in factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, climate change, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.   
Flood Protection Setback:  A distance measured perpendicular to the top of bank of a watercourse that delineates an area to be left undisturbed to minimize future flood damage and to recognize the potential for bank erosion.  Along nontidal waters of the State, the flood protection setback is:   
(1) 100 feet, if the watercourse has special flood hazard areas shown on the FIRM, except where the setback extends beyond the boundary of the flood hazard area; or 

(2) 50 feet, if the watercourse does not have special flood hazard areas shown on the FIRM.   


Flood Zone:  A designation for areas that are shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps:   
(1) Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent annual chance (100-year) flood; base flood elevations are not determined. 

(2) Zone AE and Zone A1-30:  Special flood hazard areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent annual chance (100-year) flood; base flood elevations are determined; floodways may or may not be determined.  In areas subject to tidal flooding, the Limit of Moderate Wave Action may or may not be delineated. 

(3) Zone AH and Zone AO:  Areas of shallow flooding, with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding or sheet flow on sloping terrain), with or without BFEs or designated flood depths. 

(4) Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas subject to inundation by the 0.2-percent annual chance (500-year) flood; areas subject to the 1-percent annual chance (100-year) flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected from the base flood by levees. 

(5) Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas outside of Zones designated A, AE, A1-30, AO, VE, V1-30, B, and X (shaded). 


(6) Zone VE and Zone V1-30:  Special flood hazard areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent annual chance (100-year) flood and subject to high velocity wave action (also see coastal high hazard area). 


Floodplain:  Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of “Flood” or “Flooding”).  
Floodproofing or Floodproofed:  Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to buildings or structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents, such that the buildings or structures are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.  [Note: State regulations at COMAR 26.17.04.11(B)(7) do not allow new nonresidential buildings in nontidal waters of the State to be floodproofed.] 
Floodproofing Certificate:  FEMA form that is to be completed, signed and sealed by a licensed professional engineer or licensed architect to certify that the design of floodproofing and proposed methods of construction are in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 5.5(B) of these regulations.  [Note:  FEMA Form 086-0-34 is available online at http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=1600.]  
Floodway:  The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height.  When shown on a FIRM, the floodway is referred to as the “designated floodway.” 
Free-of-Obstruction:  A term that describes open foundations (pilings, columns, or piers) without attached elements or foundation components that would obstruct the free passage of floodwaters and waves beneath structures that are elevated on such foundations.  [Note:  See NFIP Technical Bulletin #5, “Free-of-Obstruction Requirements.”] 
Functionally Dependent Use:  A use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water; the term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
Highest Adjacent Grade:  The highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed foundation of a structure. 
Historic Structure:  Any structure that is: 
(1) Individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listings on the National Register; 

(2) Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; or 

(3) Individually listed on the Maryland Register of Historic Places.   


Hydrologic and Hydraulic Engineering Analyses:  Analyses performed by a licensed professional engineer, in accordance with standard engineering practices that are accepted by the Maryland Department of the Environment (Nontidal Wetlands & Waterways) and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood profiles. 
Letter of Map Change (LOMC):  A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, that amends or revises an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map or Flood Insurance Study.  Letters of Map Change include: 
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA):  An amendment based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area.  A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property or structure is not located in a special flood hazard area. 
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical data that may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.  A Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F), is a determination that a structure or parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, no longer exposed to flooding associated with the base flood.  In order to qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in accordance with the community’s floodplain management regulations. 
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR):  A formal review and comment as to whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies with the minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special flood hazard areas.  A Conditional Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (CLOMR-F) is a determination that a parcel of land or proposed structure that will be elevated by fill would not be inundated by the base flood if fill is placed on the parcel as proposed or the structure is built as proposed.  A CLOMR does not revise the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map or Flood Insurance Study; 
upon submission and approval of certified as-built documentation, a Letter of Map Revision may be issued by FEMA, to revise the effective FIRM. 
Licensed:  As used in these regulations, licensed refers to professionals who are authorized to practice in the State of Maryland by issuance of licenses by the Maryland Board of Architects, Maryland Board of Professional Engineers, Maryland Board of Professional Land Surveyors, and the Maryland Real Estate Appraisers and Home Inspectors Commission.   
Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA):  Inland limit of the area affected by waves greater than 1.5 feet during the base flood.  Base flood conditions between the VE Zone and the LiMWA will be similar to, but less severe than those in the VE Zone. 
Lowest Floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a building or structure; the floor of an enclosure below the lowest floor is not the lowest floor provided the enclosure is constructed in accordance with these regulations.  The lowest floor of a manufactured home is the bottom of the lowest horizontal supporting member (longitudinal chassis frame beam).  
Manufactured Home:  A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term manufactured home does not include a recreational vehicle.    
Market Value:  The price at which a property will change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither party being under compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. For the purposes of these regulations, the market value of a building is determined by a licensed real estate appraiser or the most recent, full phased-in assessment value of the building (improvement) determined by the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation.    
Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE):  A principal department of the State of Maryland that is charged with, among other responsibilities, the coordination of the National Flood Insurance Program in Maryland (NFIP State Coordinator) and the administration of regulatory programs for development and construction that occur within the waters of the State, including nontidal wetlands, nontidal waters and floodplains, and State and private tidal wetlands (Tidal Wetlands).  Unless otherwise specified, “MDE” refers to the Department’s Wetlands and Waterways Program.  
Mixed-use Structure:  Any structure that is used or intended for use for a mixture of nonresidential and residential uses in the same structure. 
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The program authorized by the U.S. Congress in 42 U.S.C. §§4001 - 4129.  The NFIP makes flood insurance coverage 
available in communities that agree to adopt and enforce minimum regulatory requirements for development in areas prone to flooding (see definition of “Special Flood Hazard Area”). 
New Construction:  Structures, including additions and improvements, and the placement of manufactured homes, for which the start of construction commenced on or after October 15, 1981, the initial effective date of the Town of North East’s Flood Insurance Rate Map, including any subsequent improvements, alterations, modifications, and additions to such structures. 
NFIP State Coordinator:  See Maryland Department of the Environment. 
Nontidal Waters of the State:  See “Waters of the State.”  As used in these regulations, “nontidal waters of the State” refers to any stream or body of water within the State that is subject to State regulation, including the “100-year frequency floodplain of free-flowing waters.”  COMAR 26.17.04 states that “the landward boundaries of any tidal waters shall be deemed coterminous with the wetlands boundary maps adopted pursuant to Environment Article, §16-301, Annotated Code of Maryland.”  Therefore, the boundary between the tidal and nontidal waters of the State is the tidal wetlands boundary. 
Person:  An individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including State and local governments and agencies.  
Recreational Vehicle:  A vehicle that is built on a single chassis, 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA):  The land in the floodplain subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.  Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood Insurance Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99.  The term includes areas shown on other flood maps that are identified in Section 1.5. 
Start of Construction:  The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor 
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory structures, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For substantial improvements, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.  
Structure:  That which is built or constructed; specifically, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.      
Substantial Damage:  Damage of any origin sustained by a building or structure whereby the cost of restoring the building or structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the building or structure before the damage occurred.  Also used as “substantially damaged” structures.  [Note:  See “Substantial Improvement/Substantial Damage Desk Reference” (FEMA P-758).] 
Substantial Improvement:  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a building or structure the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building or structure before the start of construction of the improvement.  The term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.  For purposes of this definition, substantial improvements/repairs shall be documented and tracked on a cumulative basis for a period of two (2) years. The term does not, however, include either:  
(1) Any project for improvement of a building or structure to correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official prior to submission of an application for a permit and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 

(2) Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure.  


[Note:  See “Substantial Improvement/Substantial Damage Desk Reference” (FEMA P-758).] 
Temporary Structure:  A structure installed, used, or erected for a period of less than 180 days.  
Variance:  A grant of relief from the strict application of one or more requirements of these regulations. 
Violation:  Any construction or development in a special flood hazard area that is being performed without an issued permit.   The failure of a building, structure, or other development for which a permit is issued to be fully compliant with these regulations and 
the conditions of the issued permit.  A building, structure, or other development without the required design certifications, the Elevation Certificate, or other evidence of compliance required is presumed to be a violation until such time as the required documentation is provided. 
Watercourse:  The channel, including channel banks and bed, of nontidal waters of the State. 
Waters of the State:  [See Environment Article, Title 5, Subtitle 1, Annotated Code of Maryland.] Waters of the State include: 
(1) Both surface and underground waters within the boundaries of the State subject to its jurisdiction; 

(2) That portion of the Atlantic Ocean within the boundaries of the State; 

(3) The Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries; 

(4) All ponds, lakes, rivers, streams, public ditches, tax ditches, and public drainage systems within the State, other than those designed and used to collect, convey, or dispose of sanitary sewage; and

3.3 Use and Interpretation of FIRMs 
The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of special flood hazard areas, floodplain boundaries, and floodway boundaries. The following shall apply to the use and interpretation of FIRMs and data: 
(A) Where field surveyed topography indicates that ground elevations:   

(1) Are below the base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as special flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of these regulations;  

(2) Are above the base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a Letter of Map Change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area. 


(B) In FEMA-identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and floodway data have not been identified and in areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, any other flood hazard data available from a Federal, State, or other source shall be reviewed and reasonably used. 


(C) Base flood elevations and designated floodway boundaries on FIRMs and in FISs shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway boundaries by any other sources if such sources show reduced floodway widths and/or lower base flood elevations.     

(D) Other sources of data shall be reasonably used if such sources show increased base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FIRMs and in FISs. 

(E) If a Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or a Preliminary Flood Insurance Study has been provided by FEMA:  

(1) Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, if the preliminary flood hazard data is more restrictive than the effective data, it shall be used and shall replace the flood hazard data previously provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these regulations.  

(2) Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall be deemed the best available data pursuant to Section 1.5(C) and used where no base flood elevations and/or floodway areas are provided on the effective FIRM.   

(3) Prior to issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data is permitted where the preliminary base flood elevations, floodplain or floodway boundaries exceed the base flood elevations and/or designated floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided by FEMA.  Such preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.   



3.4 Permits Required and Expiration 
(A) It shall be unlawful for any person to begin any development or construction which is wholly within, partially within, or in contact with any flood hazard area established in Section 1.5, including but not limited to:  filling; grading; construction of new structures; the substantial improvement of buildings or structures, including repair of substantial damage; placement or replacement of manufactured homes, including substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage of manufactured homes; erecting or installing a temporary structure, or alteration of a watercourse, until a permit is obtained from the Town of North East.  No such permit shall be issued until the requirements of these regulations have been met.  

(B) In addition to the permits required in paragraph (A), applicants for permits in nontidal waters of the State are advised to contact MDE.  Unless waived by 


MDE, pursuant to Code of Maryland Regulations 26.17.04, Construction on Nontidal Waters and Floodplains, MDE regulates the “100-year frequency floodplain of free-flowing waters,” also referred to as nontidal waters of the State.  To determine the 100-year frequency floodplain, hydrologic calculations are based on the ultimate development of the watershed, assuming existing zoning.  The resulting flood hazard areas delineated using the results of such calculations may be different than the special flood hazard areas established in Section 1.5 of these regulations.  A permit from the Town of North East is still required in addition to any State requirements. 

(C) A permit is valid provided the actual start of work is within 180 days of the date of permit issuance.  Requests for extensions shall be submitted in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated.  The Floodplain Administrator may grant, in writing, one or more extensions of time, for additional periods not exceeding 90 days each and provided there has been no amendment or revision to the basis for establishing special flood hazard areas and BFEs set forth in Section 1.5.

Upon consideration of the purposes of these regulations, the individual circumstances, and the considerations and limitations of this section, the Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations. 
The Board of Appeals shall notify, in writing, any applicant to whom a variance is granted to construct or substantially improve a building or structure with its lowest floor below the elevation required by these regulations that the variance is to the floodplain management requirements of these regulations only, and that the cost of Federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk, with rates up to $25 per $100 of insurance coverage. 
A record of all variance actions, including justification for issuance shall be maintained pursuant to Section 3.2(K) of these regulations. 
7.2 Application for a Variance 
(A) The owner of property, or the owner’s authorized agent, for which a variance is sought shall submit an application for a variance to the Floodplain Administrator. 

(B) At a minimum, the application shall contain the following information: name, address, and telephone number of the applicant and property owner; legal description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use; description of the proposed use; site map showing the location of flood hazard areas, designated floodway boundaries, flood zones, base flood elevations, and flood protection setbacks; description of the variance sought; and reason for the variance request.  Variance applications shall specifically address each of the considerations in Section 7.3.  

(C) If the application is for a variance to allow the lowest floor (A Zones) or bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member (V Zones and Coastal A Zones) of a building or structure below the applicable minimum elevation required by these regulations, the application shall include a statement signed by the owner that, if granted, the conditions of the variance shall be recorded on the deed of the property.  


7.3 Considerations for Variances 
The Floodplain Administrator shall request comments on variance applications from MDE (NFIP State Coordinator) and shall provide such comments to the Board of Appeals.  
In considering variance applications, the Board of Appeals shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, requirements specified in other sections of these regulations, and the following factors: 
(A) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others. 

(B) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. 


(C) The susceptibility of the proposed development and its contents (if applicable) to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner. 

(D) The importance of the services to the community provided by the proposed development. 

(E) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to, or are subject to less, flooding or erosion damage. 

(F) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable, or if the facility is a functionally dependent use. 

(G) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development. 

(H) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and hazard mitigation plan for that area. 

(I) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for passenger vehicles and emergency vehicles. 

(J) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site. 

(K) The costs of providing government services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 

(L) The comments provided by MDE (NFIP State Coordinator). 


7.4 Limitations for Granting Variances 
The Board of Appeals shall make an affirmative decision on a variance request only upon: 
(A) A showing of good and sufficient cause.  Good and sufficient cause deals solely with the physical characteristics of the property and cannot be based on the character of the improvement, the personal characteristics of the owner/inhabitants, or local provision that regulate standards other than health and public safety. 

(B) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.  Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant. 


(C) A determination that the granting of a variance for development within any designated floodway, or flood hazard area with base flood elevations but no designated floodway, will not result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations. 

(D) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances, fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws. 

(E) A determination that the building, structure or other development is protected by methods to minimize flood damages. 

(F) A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief, considering the flood hazard.

Section 5-14 "PRD" Planned Residential Development District Regulations 
 
1. Purposes: 
 
 The provisions of this article are enacted in order that the purposes of the ordinance be furthered in an era of increasing urbanization and of growing demand for housing of all types and design; to ensure that the provisions of this ordinance which are concerned in part with the uniform treatment of dwelling type, bulk, density and open space within each zoning district, shall not be applied to the improvement of land by other than lot by lot development in a manner that would distort the objectives of this ordinance; to encourage innovations in residential development and renewal so that the growing demand for housing may be met by greater variety in type, design and layout of dwellings and by the conservation and more efficient use of open space ancillary to said dwellings; so that greater opportunities for better housing and recreation may extend to all citizens and residents of this Town; and in order to encourage a more efficient use of land and of public services and to reflect changes in the technology of land development so that economies  secured  may ensure to the benefit of those who need homes; and, in aid of these purposes, to provide a procedure which can relate the type, design and layout of residential development to the particular site and the particular demand for housing existing at the time of development in a manner consistent with the preservation of the property values within existing residential areas, and to ensure that the increased flexibility of regulations over land development authorized herein is carried out under such administrative standards and procedures as shall encourage the disposition of proposals for land development without undue delay. 
 
2. Administration: 
 
 The administration of the procedures for application for and approval of Planned Residential Developments shall be vested in the Mayor and Commissioners of the Town of North East.  The Board shall, however, refer all tentative and final development plans for such developments to the Planning Commission for their review and comment. 
 
3. Conditions for Planned Residential Development: 
 
 The following are prerequisite conditions for consideration of a Planned Residential Development: 
 
a. Any tract of land so developed shall be in one ownership or in the case of multiple ownership of the tract it shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility. 
 
b. In order to qualify as a Planned Residential Development, development shall provide for a minimum of twenty-five (25) dwelling units. 
c. All of the tract must lie within the “R-3” Residential District in the Town. 
 
4. Use Regulations: 
 
 The uses permitted in a Planned Residential Development shall be limited to: 
 
a. Dwelling units in detached, semi-detached, attached or multi-family structures, or any combination thereof.  Attached dwelling units shall be townhouses and shall be arranged in clusters, not in rows, so as to provide common areas between and around groups of houses subject to provision of an adequate agreement for ownership and maintenance of the common areas between and around such townhouses as hereinafter provided. 
 
b. Accessory uses to include a related or commercial use located within the Planned Residential Development shall be vested in the Mayor and Commissioners of the Town of North East. 
 
c. Open space set aside under the provisions of this Article which may be used in whole or in part in any of the following ways, or any manner similar thereto: 
 
(1) Boating and fishing. 
 
(2) Golf course. 
 
(3) Hiking and horseback riding. 
 
(4) Parks. 
 
(5) Play fields. 
 
(6) Playgrounds. 
 
(7) Picnic areas. 
 
(8) Skating rinks. 
 
(9) Swimming pool. 
 
(10) Tennis courts 
 
(11) Woodland 
 
(12) Lakes 
 
 
 
5. Density: 
 
 The following standards shall govern the density of dwelling units on the land within a Planned Residential Development: 
 
a. In the “R-3” District, no more than six (6) dwelling units may be erected for each acre of land in the total tract under consideration. 
 
b. At least twenty five per cent (25%) of the total land in the tract shall be set aside as open space for the use and benefit of the residents of the development or the Town as hereinafter provided.  
 
c. In the case of a Planned Residential Development proposed to be developed over a period of years, a variation in each section to be developed from the density of use established for the entire Planned Residential Development may be permitted.  A greater concentration of density of land use within some section or sections of development may be allowed whether it be earlier or later in the development than others.  The approval of such greater concentration of density of land use for any section to be developed shall be offset by a smaller concentration in any completed prior stage or by an appropriate reservation  of common open space on the remaining land by a grant of easement or by covenant in favor of the Town, provided that such reservation shall, as far as practicable, defer the  precise location of such common open space until an application for final approval is filed, so that flexibility of development, which is a prime objective of this Article, can be maintained. 
 
6. Area and Bulk Regulations:  
 
 Within the limits of overall density of use established in Section 5-4 (5);  flexibility in the arrangement of housing on individual lots and in clusters of single family, duplex, townhouses, and apartments may be permitted subject to the following requirements: 
 
a. In the “R-3” District where single family homes are situated on individual lots the height, area and bulk requirements shall be as follows:

(1) The two required side yards shall total 15 feet and neither shall be less than five (5) feet. 
(2) The dwelling units of a two-family dwelling may be sold separately if separate utility systems are provided. Each dwelling unit of a two-family dwelling must comply with the minimum lot area per dwelling unit. 
(3) Rear  yards  shall  be  designed  to  be adjacent to open areas.  Where this is not possible rear yard depth shall be increased. 
 
 
b. Where dwelling units are arranged in clusters of single family, duplex, townhouses, and apartments, dwelling units shall be constructed as rental units or for sale as condominium units.  Sufficient areas of common land shall be established between and around dwelling units so that the maximum density of dwelling units within any section of cluster housing is twelve (12) units per acre. Such common areas shall be considered yard areas for these dwelling units and shall not be used in the calculation of open space as provided by Section 5-14; 5.(b) of this ordinance.  The developer shall make adequate provision for the maintenance of 
building and land within the common area set aside for such clusters.  Such provision shall be subject to the approval of the Board and shall be contained in deed restrictions providing among other things that the owners of dwellings  in such cluster developments by acceptance of a deed agree for themselves,  their  heirs, and assigns, to pay special assessments which may be levied from time to time by the Town and which shall be sufficient to maintain the buildings and common areas in  the event that  in the  opinion of the  Board such buildings and common areas are not being properly maintained.  
 
c. Where single family, duplex, townhouses, or apartments are arranged in clusters, these structures shall have a setback of not less than twenty (20) feet from any road right-of-way.  Each dwelling unit shall contain at least one thousand (1,000) square feet of habitable floor area. 
 
7. Open Space: 
 
a. Areas set aside for open space shall be suitable for the designated purpose and in any event shall be consistent with the plan policy for future land use in the Town.  Any such area shall contain no structure other than a structure related to outdoor recreational use.  Consideration shall be given to the arrangement and location of open spaces to take advantage of physical characteristics of the site and to place open spaces within easy access and view of dwelling units.  In addition, open space shall be designed to provide for both active and passive forms of recreation and shall utilize and occupy areas throughout the site.  Open space may utilize but shall not be confined to only those areas unsuitable for building purposes. 
 
b. Any land set aside as open space, of such a size as may be capable of future subdivision under the regulations of this ordinance, shall be made subject to a deed restriction or agreement in form acceptable to the Board and duly recorded in the Office of Clerk of Circuit Court in and for Cecil County eliminating the possibility of such further subdivision by transfer of development rights to the Town or by any method approved by the Board in approving the plan. Open space shall not include driveways, parking lots, or other vehicular surfaces, any area occupied by a building or areas so located or so small or so circumscribed by buildings, driveways, parking lots or drainage areas as to have no substantial value for its purpose.  
 
c. Board may, at any time and from time to time, accept the dedication of land or any interest therein for public use and maintenance, but Board need not require, as a condition of approval of a Planned Residential Development, that land proposed to be set aside for common open space be dedicated, or 
made available to public use.  In the event the open space is not dedicated or made available to pubic use, the landowner shall provide for and establish an organization for the ownership and maintenance of the common open space, such organization shall not be dissolved nor shall it dispose of the common open space, by sale or otherwise (except to an organization conceived and established to own and maintain the common open space), except by dedication of the same to the public.  The plan to provide for the ownership and maintenance of common open space shall include a method reasonably designed to give adequate notice to property owners within the Planned Residential Development in the event of the sale or other disposition of open space lands and in the event of assumption of the maintenance of open space lands by the Town as hereinafter provided. 
 
8. Application for Tentative Approval for Planned Residential Development: 
 
a. An application for tentative approval of a Planned Residential Development shall be filed by or on behalf of the owner or owners of the land. 
 
b. Plans for tentative approval shall be prepared to show the following: 
 
(1) The location, size and topography of the site and nature of the landowner's interest in the land proposed to be developed; 
 
(2) The density of land use to be allocated to parts of the site to be developed; 
 
(3) The location and size of the common open space and the form of organization proposed to own and maintain the common open space; 
 
(4) The use and the approximate height, bulk and location of buildings and other structures; 
 
(5) The feasibility of proposals for the disposition of the sanitary waste and storm water and provision of public water supply; 
 
(6) The substance of covenants, grants of easements or other restrictions proposed to be imposed upon the use of land, buildings and structures including proposed easements or grants for public utilities; 
 
(7) The provisions for parking of vehicles and the location and width of proposed streets and public ways; 
 
(8) The required modifications in the land use regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property; 
 
(9) In the case of development plans which call for development over a period of years, a schedule showing the proposed time within which applications for final approval of all sections of the Planned Residential Development are intended to be filed and this schedule must be updated annually, on the anniversary of its approval, until the development is completed and accepted. 
 
c. The application for tentative approval of a Planned Residential Development shall include a written statement by the landowner setting forth the reasons why, in his opinion, a Planned Residential Development would be in the public interest and would be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for the development of the Town. 
 
9. Public Hearings: 
 
a. Within sixty (60) days after the filing of an application for tentative approval of a Planned Residential Development pursuant to this Article, a public hearing pursuant to public notice on said application shall be held by the Board, in the manner for the enactment of an amendment to this ordinance. The Mayor, or, in his absence, the Vice-Mayor, of the Board may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses.  All testimony by witnesses at any hearing shall be given under oath and every party of record at a hearing shall have the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses. 
 
b. A verbatim record of the hearing shall be caused to be made by the Board whenever such records are requested by any party to the proceedings; but the cost of making and transcribing such a record shall be borne by the party requesting it and the expense of copies of such record shall be borne by those who wish to obtain such copies.  All exhibits accepted in evidence shall be identified and duly preserved or, if not accepted in evidence, shall be properly identified and the reason for the exclusion clearly noted in the record. 
 
c. The Board may continue the hearing from time to time, and may refer the matter back to the Planning Commission for a further report, provided, however, that in any event, the public hearing or hearings shall be concluded within sixty (60) days after the date of the first public hearing. 
 
 
 
 
10.  The Findings: 
 
a. The Board, within thirty (30) days following the conclusion of the public hearing provided for in this Article, shall, by official written communication, to the landowner, either: 
 
(1) Grant tentative approval of the development plan as submitted; 
 
(2) Grant tentative approval subject to specified conditions not included in the development plan as submitted; or 
 
(3) Deny tentative approval to the development plan. 
 
 Failure to so act within said period shall be deemed to be a grant of tentative approval of the development plan as submitted.  In the event, however, that tentative approval is granted subject to conditions, the landowner may, within thirty (30) days after receiving a copy of the official written communication of the Board, notify such Board of his refusal to accept all said conditions, in which case, the Board shall be deemed to have denied tentative approval of the development plan. In the event the landowner does not, within said period, notify the Board of his refusal to accept all said conditions, tentative approval of the development plan, with all said conditions, shall stand as granted. 
 
b. The grant or denial of tentative approval by official written communication shall include not only conclusions but also findings of fact related to the specific proposal and shall set forth the reasons for the grant, with or without conditions or for the denial, and said communication shall set forth with particularity in what respects the development plan would or would not be in the public interest including but not limited to findings of fact and conclusions on the following: 
 
(1) In what respects the development plan is or is not consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for the development of the Town; 
 
(2) The extent to which the development plan departs from zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property, including  but  not  limited to density, bulk and use, and the reasons why such departures are or are not deemed to be in the public interest; 
 
(3) The purpose, location and amount of the common open space in the Planned Residential Development, the reliability of the proposals for maintenance and conservation on the common open space as related to the proposed density and type of residential development; 
(4) The physical design of the development plan and the manner in which said design does or does not make adequate provision for public services, provide adequate control over vehicular traffic, and further the amenities of light and air,  recreation and visual enjoyment; 
 
(5) The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed Planned Residential Development to the neighborhood in which it is proposed to be established; and 
 
(6) In the case of a development plan which proposes development over a period of years, the sufficiency of the terms and conditions intended to protect the interests of the public and of the residents of the Planned Residential Development in the integrity of the development plan. 
 
c.  In the event a development plan is granted tentative approval, with or without conditions, the Board may set forth in the official written communication the time within which an application for final approval of the development plan shall be filed or, in the case of a development plan which provides for development over a period of years, the periods of time within which applications for final approval of each part thereof shall be filed.  Except upon the consent of the landowner, the time so established between grant of tentative approval and an application for final approval shall not be less than three (3) months, and, in the case of developments over a period of years, the time between applications for final approval of each part of a plan shall not be less than twelve (l2) months. 
 
11. Status of Plan After Tentative Approval: 
 
a. The official written communication provided for in this Article shall be certified by the Administrator and shall be filed in his office, and a certified copy shall be mailed to the landowner. Where tentative approval has been granted, the same shall be noted on the zoning map. 
 
b. Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify a plat of the Planned Residential Development for recording nor authorize development or the issuance of any construction authorization. A development plan which has been given tentative approval as submitted, or which has been given tentative approval with conditions which have been accepted by the landowner (and provided that the landowner has not defaulted or violated any of the conditions of the tentative approval), shall not be modified or revoked nor otherwise impaired by action of the Town pending an application or applications for final approval, without the consent of the landowner, provided an application for final approval is filed in the case of development over a period of years, provided 
applications are filed, within the periods of time specified in the official written communication granting tentative approval. 
 
c. In the event that a development plan is given tentative approval and thereafter, but prior to final approval, the landowner shall elect to abandon said development plan and shall so notify the Town in writing, or in the event the landowner shall fail to file application or applications for final approval within the required period of time or times, as the case may be, the tentative approval shall be deemed to be revoked and all that portion of the area included in  the development plan for which final approval has not been given shall be subject to those ordinances otherwise applicable thereto as they may be amended from time to time, and the same shall be noted on the zoning map and in the records of the Secretary of the Town. 
 
12. Application for Final Approval 
 
a. An application for final approval may be for all the land included in a development plan or, to the extent set forth in the tentative approval, for a section thereof.  Said application shall be made to the Town and within the time or times specified by the official written communication granting tentative approval. The application shall include any drawings, specifications, covenants, easements, performance bond and such other requirements as may be specified by this ordinance, as well as any conditions set forth in the official written communication at the time of tentative approval.  A public hearing on an application for final approval of the development plan, or part thereof, submitted for final approval, is in compliance with the development plan theretofore given tentative approval and with any specified conditions attached thereto. 
 
b. Plans submitted for final approval of all or a portion of a Planned Residential Development shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements for final subdivision plans as specified in the Town of North East Subdivision Regulations as amended. 
 
c. The design of streets, sewers, water lines, storm drainage, sidewalks, and all public improvements shall be in strict accordance with the design standards of the aforesaid ordinance. 
 
d. The Town of North East Ordinance as amended shall govern the construction and acceptance of all public improvements including the provisions or requirements of performance and maintenance bonds. 
 
e. In the event the application for final approval has been filed together with all drawings, specifications and other documents in support thereof, and as required by this ordinance and the official 
written communication of tentative approval, the Town shall, within sixty (60) days of such filing, grant such development plan final approval. 
 
f. In the event the development plan as submitted contains variations from the development plan given tentative approval, the Town may refuse to grant final approval and shall, within ninety (90) days from the filing of the application for final approval, so advise the landowner in writing of said refusal, setting forth in said notice the reasons why one or more of said variations are not in the public interest.  In the event of such refusal, the landowner may either: 
 
(1) Re-file his application for final approval without the variations objected, or  
 
(2) File a written request with the Town that it hold a public hearing on his application for final approval.  
 
(3) If the landowner wishes to take either such alternate action, he may do so at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for final approval, or within sixty (60) additional days, if the time for applying for final approval shall have already passed at the time when the landowner was advised that the development plan was not in substantial compliance. In the event the landowner shall fail to take either of these alternate actions within said time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the development plan.  Any such public hearing shall be held pursuant to public notice within sixty (60) days after request for the hearing is  made by the  landowner,  and the hearing shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in this Article for public hearings on applications for tentative approval.  Within sixty (60) days after the conclusion of the hearing, the Town shall by official written communication either grant final  approval to the  development plan  or deny final approval.  The grant or denial of final approval of the development plan shall, in cases arising under this section, be in the form and contain the findings required for an application for tentative approval set forth in this Article. 
 
g. A development plan, or any part thereof, which has been given final approval shall be so certified without delay by the Town and shall be filed of record forthwith  in  the  Office Clerk of the Court in and for Cecil County before  any development shall take place in accordance therewith.  Upon the filing of record of the development plan the zoning and subdivision ordinances otherwise applicable to the land included in such plan shall cease to apply thereto except as herein noted.  Pending completion within a reasonable time of said Planned Residential Development 
or of that part thereof, as the case may be, that has been finally approved, no modification of the provisions of said development plan, or part thereof, as finally approved, shall be made except with the consent of the landowner. 
 
h. In the event that a development plan, or section thereof, is given final approval and thereafter the landowner shall fail to commence and carry out the Planned Residential Development within twelve (12) months after final approval has been granted, no development shall take place on the property included in the development plan until after said property is resubdivided and is reclassified by enactment of an amendment to this ordinance in the manner prescribed for such amendments.  If after development in accordance with a final plan is started the landowner shall abandon such plan or the section thereof and shall so notify the Town in writing, the Town may require that the property be re-subdivided and reclassified as provided above or if any portion of a Planned Residential Development is substantially completed in accordance with final plans submitted and approved by the Town, the Town shall have the option of recording the master plan and requiring subsequent construction to be within the framework of the plan unless substantial hardship can be demonstrated. 
 
13. Enforcement and Modification of Provisions of the Plan: 
 
 To further the mutual interest of the residents of the Planned Residential Development and of the public in the preservation of the integrity of the development plan, as finally approved, and to insure that modifications, if any, in the development plan shall not impair the reasonable reliance of the said residents upon the provisions of the development plan, nor result in  changes that would  adversely affect the public interest, the enforcement and modification of the provisions of the development plan as finally improved, whether those are recorded by plat, convenant, easement, or otherwise shall be subject to the provisions of the law.

Section 5-16. “HCOD” Highway Corridor Overlay District Regulations 
 
 
1. Purpose   
a. The purpose of establishing this overlay district is to protect and/or enhance the aesthetic and visual character of the Town of North East and to provide for and promote orderly growth of the same. The Highway Corridor Overlay District regulations are intended to supplement the regulations of the underlying zoning districts and to provide for the harmony and compatibility of development along the major highway corridors that serve as gateways to the community. When other provisions of this Ordinance are more restrictive, they shall apply. All development within this District shall be subject to the procedures, standards, and guidelines specified in the following sections, in addition to those standards pertaining to the particular base zoning district in which the development occurs. In cases of conflict, the more restrictive standards and/or requirements shall apply. In particular, the purpose of the Highway Corridor Overlay District is as follows: 
 
(1) To encourage and better articulate positive visual experiences along the Town's major existing and proposed highways. 
 
(2) To provide for the continued safe and efficient use of these roadways. 
 
(3) To maintain natural beauty and scenic, cultural, and positive visual character of the corridor, particularly distinctive views, vistas, and visual continuity. 
 
(4) Minimize intersection and site access points. 
 
b. These purposes will be accomplished through evaluation of proposed developments within this overlay zoning district by the Planning Commission which shall review the location, character and appearance of new development in a positive manner. It is the purpose of such review to determine, in a cooperative fashion with the applicant, whether a proposed plan meets the guidelines and other standards of this zoning district. 
 
c. The Highway Corridor Overlay Zoning District shall include all lands within 500 feet of each side of the center line of the following rights-of-way: U.S. 40, I-95, and MD 272 north of North East Creek.  In addition, the district shall include all of such parcels that fall within the 500 foot line in order that the district shall be expanded to follow the parcel property boundaries of all parcels that are subject to a particular site plan review.  The approximate 
boundary of the overlay district shall be clearly delineated and labeled on the site plan. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01]  
2. Affected Development  
 
a. All development plan applications, including applications for construction authorization, site plan review and subdivision approval, for development located in the Highway Corridor Overlay District shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission for compliance with this Section. All changes subject to approval by the Commission shall receive such approval before proceeding.  Large scale multi-phased projects shall be reviewed and approved subject to a master site plan.  The preliminary and final site plans shall indicate the phasing concept for overall development.  Each phase shall require separate review and approval by the Planning Commission for consistency with the master site plan as well as satisfactory progress or completion of prior phases. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
b. Applications for development plan approval on properties already developed, for example an application for a construction authorization for an addition to an existing building, shall be required to comply with the provisions of this Section, to the extent possible, as determined by the Planning Commission. For the purposes of this Section, the term “to the extent possible” shall not preclude the Planning Commission from requiring existing pavement be removed to enable establishment of visual enhancement buffer yards, that entrances/exits and site traffic circulation be modified to improve channelization of traffic and reduction and/or consolidation of entrances/exits on major highways, or removal and/or replacement of existing signs and associated lighting. 
 
c. Development Activity Permitted Within The District. 
 
(1) Any alteration of existing conditions of the land, uses or structures within the Highway Corridor Overlay District requiring a construction authorization from the Town from the date of enactment of this section shall henceforth be done as provided for by this section or by other sections of this Article. 
 
(2) The overlay district regulations are supplementary to the permitted uses and requirements for the appropriate underlying zoning district as contained in Article 5. 
 
d. Development activity prohibited within the district. Uses prohibited in the underlying zoning district are also prohibited in the overlay district. 
 
3. Tree Protection  
 
 The following regulations supplement, but do not supersede the Forest Conservation Ordinance adopted by the Town of North East on February 4, 2000 and as amended.  
 
a. Development of land for different uses and intensity of uses will often times necessitate the removal of trees to accommodate roads, parking, buildings, and facilities. It is the expressed intent of this Section that every effort be made through the design, layout, and construction of development projects to incorporate and save as many trees as possible. 
 
b. No person shall cut, destroy, move, or remove any living, disease-free tree of any species having a trunk with a diameter of eight (8) inches or larger, in conjunction with any development of land governed by this Ordinance unless and until such removal or destruction has been approved under the provisions of this Ordinance. Trunk diameter is measured 4.5 feet above the ground, and is referred to as "diameter at breast height (dbh)". 
 
c. No person shall cut or clear land of trees for the sole purpose of offering land for sale.  
 
d. The clear-cutting of trees is prohibited. The term "clear-cutting" as used herein shall mean the cutting of more than 75 percent of the trees six inches in trunk diameter or larger. Clear-cutting pursuant to an approved development plan shall require the planting of replacement trees as indicated in the detailed landscape plan accompanying the development application. 
 
e. A survey of all trees shall be made and submitted in conjunction with the preliminary development site plan.  All trees proposed for removal shall be clearly noted and marked with surveyor’s flagging on site to facilitate field review by Town Staff and/or Town Consultant(s). [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
4. Retention of and/or Creation of a Minimum Visual Buffer along Highway Corridor Right-of-Ways 
 
a. Each approved application for development shall provide a minimum visual buffer between the right-of-way line of the subject roadway and all proposed structures and parking areas. The purpose of the minimum visual buffer is to soften the appearance of structures and parking lots from the road, to screen vehicular headlight glare on and off site, and to lessen spill-over light from on-site lighting. The buffer shall be continuous, except as set forth in b. below, and be no less than the requirements for Bufferyard B contained in Article 12 and Appendix A.  The Planning Commission may require additional depth or density of planting at 
its discretion pursuant to findings that such increases are in the public interest and support the purposes of this section. The depth of the bufferyard shall be measured from the existing right-of-way line or from the new right-of-way line should the application under consideration be required to or voluntarily provide a dedication of or easement for proposed roadway purposes. The minimum Bufferyard depth shall not occur at the high activity areas of a project. These areas include, but are not limited to, building entrances, drop-offs, and drive-thrus. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
 To determine the average depth of the minimum visual buffer, measurements shall be taken at intervals not greater than ten (10) feet parallel to the property or right-of-way line. Side buffer areas required by other sections of this Ordinance and deep, narrow land areas shall not be used when calculating the minimum visual buffer. Where lagoons and drainage swales occur in the minimum visual buffer because of natural land forms or drainage patterns, additional buffer depth and vegetation shall be required to augment the screening effect.  Detailed graphics, exemplary photographs, or renderings may be required by the Planning Commission to clarify and improve its understanding of the buffer issues involved. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
b. The intent of the minimum visual buffer is to leave the naturally occurring buffer vegetation intact for its softening effect. This buffer may be enhanced or created, where such vegetation is insufficient or non-existent, with trees and shrubs of a variety of species appropriate to Town character. If the minimum visual buffer already has trees of protected size and species as noted herein, their preservation is required. Where masses of native shrubs are present, their preservation with minimum disturbance is strongly encouraged. While complete screening of a project is not required, sufficient plant material shall be installed to accomplish the softening effect required in a. above. In order to maintain the screening effect, existing vegetation shall not be limbed-up from the ground more than five (5) feet to the lowest branches. However, if understory planting is planned, existing vegetation may, with the approval of the Zoning Administrator, be limbed-up to a height that will provide adequate sunlight to those plants. Minimum height and caliper of new trees shall be consistent with provisions of the tree protection requirements in Section 3 above. Minimum height of new shrubs used to create the minimum visual buffer shall be three feet. These plantings shall be shown on a master landscape plan meeting the requirements of Section 12-8. 
 
 
 
 
5. Exemptions from Buffer Requirements  
  
Exemptions, whether partial or total, from the bufferyard provisions of this section may be granted by the Planning Commission if it can be sufficiently demonstrated that such bufferyard will have a deleterious visual effect upon an existing situation or that through the preservation of existing trees or other unique natural vegetative resource, particular effort on the part of a developer in protecting the existing natural environment warrants the relaxation of bufferyard requirements of this section. The following outlines those anticipated situations where the bufferyard requirement may be relaxed or removed. 
 
a. Protection of existing visual environment. In the following cases where the characteristics of the existing visual environment would be detracted from by the provision of a required bufferyard: 
 
(1) Views and Vistas of existing buildings which exhibit a high degree of aesthetic value serving to heighten the visual experience, serve as important points of spatial identification, contain value as important historical resources. 
 
(2) Views and Vistas of existing natural landscape/topographical features of a particular locale which correspond to certain high points affording panoramic views, views to settlement clusters, views of water, valleys, and other elements of the physical landscape. 
 
(3) Views and Vistas to existing recreational/open space areas, whether natural or man-made, which serve to contribute to the overall visual environment. Uses such as golf-courses, local parks, cemeteries. 
 
(4) Views and Vistas to which give the observer an awareness of a locations inherent character related to views of farmland, pastures, water activities, such as docks or other maritime activities specific to the area. 
 
b. Protection of proposed visual environment. In the following cases, where a proposed development intended to further enhance or protect the existing visual environment would be visually affected by the required bufferyard: 
 
(1) A proposed development which by virtue of the characteristics of its structures indicates innovation of design, represents a focal point, and/or establishes a particular identifying element for the locale. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
(2) A proposed development which exhibits innovative site landscaping, or which combines in the use of the site open recreational areas such as described above. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
c. Retention of existing natural attributes of the site. In this case, significant steps must be taken by a developer to preserve significant tree stands, topographic characteristics, even in the event that such elements are in locations where they are not wholly visible. The intent is to provide incentives to retain the features of the existing natural environment rather than encourage its destruction, and then to remedy the situation with new plantings. 
 
d. Management of existing and proposed resources. In order to encourage management programs for visual natural resources, so that the continuation of such resource is assured, bufferyard requirements may be reduced or waived.  
 
6. Permitted Activity in Minimum Visual Buffer  
 
a. No existing vegetation of any type, size, or origin shall be altered or removed unless it satisfies the tree protection requirements of Section 3. 
 
b. Within the minimum visual buffer there shall be no development, clearing, grading, or construction activity, except for the following: 
 
(1) Roadway and/or driveway access to the portion of the site not in the minimum visual buffer provided that it is approximately perpendicular to right-of-way. 
 
(2) Provision for water, sanitary sewer, storm drainage, electrical, telephone, natural gas, cable, etc. service lines provided they are approximately perpendicular to the right-of-way. In the event that utilities must be installed approximately parallel to the road right-of-way, an equal amount of buffer may be required to substitute for the area of vegetation removal. Permission for easement and right-of-way disturbance and clearing for such services shall be more favorably considered when such activity is consolidated with vehicular access routes. 
 
(3) Pedestrian and bicycle paths designed to provide continuous connection along the road corridor, provided that they can be constructed without materially reducing the screening and visual softening capacity of the vegetation buffer. 
 
(4) Lighting fixtures only for approved signs or if, for safety reasons, they cannot be placed outside the buffer and then only when electric utility lines serving these fixtures and necessary easements can be established and constructed without reducing the screening and visual softening capacity of the vegetation buffer. 
 
(5) Signs shall be in accordance with the sign regulations in Article 7. A reasonable effort should be made to locate all signage outside of the buffer. 
 
(6) Clear sight distances at the permitted entrances and exits to any development as needed to provide for reasonable traffic safety, in accordance with accepted traffic engineering practices. 
 
7. Architectural Review  
 
a. Guidelines. The compatible relationship of architecture along highway corridors is of public concern. The intent of the architectural review is not to stifle innovative architectural design but to assure respect for, and reduce incompatible and adverse impacts on, the visual experience from the roadway. To accomplish this, the Planning Commission shall use the following guidelines in reviewing proposed structures, site improvements, signs, and streetscape improvements: 
 
(1) Proposed development shall avoid excessive or unsightly grading, indiscriminate earth moving or clearing of property, and removal of trees and vegetation that could cause disruption of natural water courses or disfigure natural land forms. 
 
(2) Proposed development shall be located and configured in a visually harmonious manner with the terrain and vegetation of the parcel and surrounding parcels. Structures shall impede, as little as reasonably practical, scenic views from the main road or from existing structures and the natural environment. Structures shall not dominate, by excessive or inappropriate height or mass, any general development, adjacent building, or natural landscape in an incompatible manner. 
 
(3) The architectural design of structures and their materials and colors shall be visually harmonious with the overall appearance, history, and cultural heritage of the Town, with natural land forms and existing vegetation and with other development plans approved by the Town. Specific consideration shall be given to compatibility with adjacent 
properties where such projects demonstrate the Town's character. 
 
(a) Large work area doors or open bays shall not open toward or face the highway. 
 
(b) Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning equipment, duct work, air compressors, other fixed operating machinery shall be either screened from view or located so that such items are not visible from the public rights-of-way within or adjacent to the site. Large trash receptacles, dumpsters, utility meters, above-ground tanks, satellite dishes, antennas, etc., shall be similarly treated, as practicably as possible. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
(c) Mobile homes and office-type mobile units shall be screened from view from the highway and equipped with skirting on all sides. 
 
(d) All development, including those in which the principal facade is oriented to the interior of the lot, shall be designed so that all facades visible from the roadway or from adjacent sites shall be completed in an aesthetically consistent manner with the front façade. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
(e) No temporary structures are permitted except those used in conjunction with and during construction projects. 
 
(f) Fencing along the highway right-of-way is discouraged, but, if used, such fencing shall be of quality materials (brick, stone, wood) and shall be landscaped to minimize visibility from the highway. 
 
(g) Long monotonous facade designs including, but not limited to, those characterized by unrelieved repetition of shape or form or by unbroken extension of line shall be avoided. 
 
(h) Materials with similar texture and appearance as appropriate to the Town's character. 
 
(i) Generally, no more than three colors per building should be used. Semi-transparent stains are recommended for application on natural wood finishes. 
 
(j) The location and dimensions of signs shall be indicated and shall maintain compatibility with architectural features of the building. 
 
(k) Architectural lighting shall be recessed under roof overhangs or generated from concealed source, low level light fixtures. 
 
(l) Building massing should reflect proportion and scale appropriate to the existing Town design. 
 
(m) Pedestrian lighting shall be designed and constructed to ensure light is directed toward people’s feet and kept out of direct line of sight. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
(4) The landscape plans for the proposed development shall provide visually harmonious and compatible setting for structures on the same lot and on adjoining or nearby lots and shall blend with the surrounding landscape. Natural appearing landscape forms are strongly encouraged; formal plans and the appearance of straight hedges are discouraged. Landscaping shall be required between buildings and sidewalks, parking lots and driveways. The scale of the proposed landscaping shall be in proportion to the building. 
 
(5) Site lighting shall be of low-intensity from a concealed source, shall be of a clear white light that does not distort colors, and shall not spill over into adjoining properties, buffers, roadways, or in any way interfere with the vision of on-coming motorists. 
 
(6) To the extent that they relate to aesthetic considerations, the design and construction techniques of the proposed development shall respond to energy consumption and environmental quality considerations such as heat loss, heat gain, air emission, and runoff water quality.  Green technologies, such as pervious paving, bi-directional grading for interior water channeling and absorption, and integrated use of water gardens, shall be fundamental components of the landscape design. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
(7) Streetscape Improvements and External Changes. 
 
(a) Streetscape improvements include those architectural or functional facilities or structures that occur on site but are not part of the building and that encourage and facilitate human interaction with the environment. Examples include, but are not limited to the following: decorative light fixtures, fountains, sculpture, benches and tables, planters, retaining walls, pedestrian and bicycle paths, bicycle parking structure, trash receptacles and enclosures, 
vendor areas, bollards, and fences. These improvements shall be designed to be consistent with all guidelines listed above, and shall be reviewed for aesthetic functionality and compatibility with the Town's character.  Inclusion of and general nature and character of such improvements will be located and presented on the preliminary site plan submission. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
(b) Decorative, low-level intensity, non-concealed source lighting that defines vehicular and/or pedestrian ways may be acceptable if part of a lighting master plan. It is strongly discouraged as general lighting for a development. The master plan must show the relationship of the fixtures and the light patterns to each other, to the project site, to unit development, and to the highway corridors. 
 
(c) External changes to streetscape improvements and existing structures and sites subject to review by the Planning Commission shall be consistent with all guidelines and standards in this section. External changes of a minor nature include external color and structural material changes, parking lot additions and alterations, relocation of accessory structures, and similar minor changes as determined by the Zoning Administrator.  
 
(8) Signs, permanent. 
 
(a) Reserved. [DELETED PER ORDINANCE 2011-03-01] 
 
(b) The Planning Commission shall review the appearance and features of signs proposed in the Highway Corridor Overlay District in conjunction with site plan approval and the Administrator's approval shall be given only after the Commission's approval is granted. Replacement signs will not be required to be reviewed by the Planning Commission unless the location of a ground sign has been changed from the original approval granted. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2011-03-01] 
 
(c) All signs shall meet all requirements of Article 7. 
 
(d) The amount of information on signs shall be no more than is necessary to provide reasonable identification of the name of the business to the passerby. While corporate logos that are part of a business name or business identification are authorized within Article 7, color, size, and subject matter are reviewed under subsection (1). 
 
(e) An integrated sign system design shall be required for all new Master Planned Communities (MPC), commercial and residential subdivisions, office complexes, malls and shopping centers within the Highway Corridor District. The establishment of integrated sign systems for existing developments is strongly encouraged. These systems shall be reviewed for materials, colors, shapes, sizes, compatibility with architecture, and establishment of unity of design for the development. Individual signs shall be reviewed for conformance with such sign systems, whether newly established or existing. 
 
(f) Materials, colors, and shapes of proposed signs shall be compatible with the related building(s). Size and proportions shall not be a dominant feature of the site and shall be judged by sizes and proportions of signs on adjacent and nearby properties that are compatible with the Town's character. 
 
(g) Spot-lighting of signs shall be restricted to not more than one 150-watt light per side for sign faces up to 40 square feet and nor more than two 150-watt lights per sign faces over 40 square feet. The sign base and/or proposed landscaping shall be designed to shield the light from on-coming motorists and to conceal the light fixture. 
 
(9) Signs, temporary. 
 
(a) Temporary signs within the Highway Corridor Overlay District shall comply with the design guidelines set forth in this section for colors and materials and with Article 7 and shall be reviewed for such compliance by a committee of staff members including the Zoning Administrator. 
 
(b) In the case of multiple principals (for example, owner, developer, architect, engineer, contractor, or real estate or leasing agent), all information shall be contained on a single sign not to exceed the maximum size and height allowed in Article 7. 
 
(c) Temporary signs within the corridor shall not be lighted. 
 
b. Following project completion, all design features required by the Town or shown on approved plans shall be maintained in good condition by all subsequent owners of the property. Changes proposed shall require approval by the Commission. 
 
 
8. Waivers of Corridor Requirements  
 
 The Planning Commission may waive one or more of the specific requirements of the Special Overlay District upon a showing by the applicant that these corridor regulations impose an undue hardship due to the peculiar configuration, topography, or location of the tract, or that the proposed project demonstrates the use of highly innovative architectural, site planning, or land use techniques. The Commission may approve any waiver to the minimum extent necessary to allow the project to be constructed. The applicant for any such waiver shall have the burden of showing that the proposed project, with such waiver granted, will be as good or better than a project developed in compliance with the District regulations in terms of environmental protection, aesthetic enhancement, land use compatibility, and traffic considerations. The grant or denial of a waiver by the Commission pursuant to this section may be appealed to the Board of Appeals. 
 
9. Planning Commission Review

(2) The Mayor and Commissioners may approve or disapprove the proposed floating zone district map amendment and associated MPC Plan, and shall follow the procedures set forth in Article 10 for the approval of a floating zone district. Concurrently with the location of a floating zone district, the Mayor and Commissioners may approve the MPC Plan, which, in addition to the provisions of MPC District floating zone, shall govern the subdivision and/or development of the property.  In approving the MPC District floating zone district map amendment, the Mayor and Commissioners shall make findings of fact, including, but not limited to the following matters: population change, availability of public facilities, present and future transportation patterns, compatibility with existing and proposed development for the areas, and the relationship of the proposed amendment to the Comprehensive Plan.  The Mayor and Commissioners may approve the MPC District map amendment if it finds that the proposed floating zone district amendment is: 
 
(i) consistent with the Comprehensive Plan;  
 
(ii) consistent with the stated purposes and intent of the MPC District;  
 
(iii) complies with the requirements of this Ordinance; and  
 
(iv) is compatible with adjoining  land uses.   
 
(3) After approval of a floating zone district amendment by the Mayor and Commissioners, two (2) complete copies of the approved MPC Plan shall be filed with the Town Clerk.  One (1) additional complete copy of the approved MPC Plan shall be filed with the Planning Commission for reference during its subsequent review and approval of subdivision plats and/or site plans. 
 
(4) When a MPC is to be constructed in phases, final subdivision plat(s) shall not be required for a phase until such time as applications have been filed for a Federal, State, or local permit for construction of that particular phase.  
 
(5) As part of the final MPC Plan approval, the Mayor and Commissioners shall approve a date for initiation of the proposed development.  
 
(6) In the event that a floating zone district amendment is approved by the Mayor and Commissioners without subdivision and approval of an associated MPC Plan, the subject property may not be subdivided until the owner complies with the MPC review and approval provisions of this Ordinance, and may not be developed except in conformance with a site plan or subdivision plat as required by and in conformance with this Ordinance.  
 
h. Additional Required Procedures.  
 
(1) The administrative procedures for approval of a site plan for property located within the MPC District are set forth in this Ordinance. Site plans and/or subdivision plats shall conform to the approved MPC Plan, including the MPC design standards.  
 
(2) The administrative procedures for approval of a subdivision located within the MPC District shall be those of the Subdivision Ordinance. Final subdivision plats shall conform to the approved MPC Plan.  
 
(3) Any development, site plan or subdivision approval for land in a MPC District shall be consistent with the provisions of the MPC District, and the specific MPC plan applicable to 
the property, as approved or amended by the Mayor and Commissioners. 
 
i. Amendment of MPC Plan. 
  
 The procedure for amendment of an approved MPC Plan shall be the same as for a new application, except that minor amendments of a MPC Plan may be approved by the Planning Commission at a regular meeting. 
 
 Using the guidelines set forth below, the Town Administrator shall determine whether the proposed amendment is a “minor amendment.  An amendment shall be deemed a “minor amendment”, provided that such amendment:  
 
(1) Does not conflict with the applicable purposes and land use standards of this Ordinance; 
 
(2) Does not prevent reasonable access of emergency vehicle access or deprive adjacent properties of adequate light and air flow; 
 
(3) Does not significantly change the general character of the land uses of the approved MPC Plan;   
 
(4) Does not result in any substantial change of major external access points;  
 
(5) Does not increase the total approved number of dwelling units or height of buildings; and 
 
(6) Does not decrease the minimum specified setbacks, open space area, or minimum or maximum specified parking and loading spaces. 
 
 The phrase "minor amendments" includes, but is not limited to, changes to: the location, number or types of uses within the MPC or any phase(s) thereof, subject to (3), above; internal road locations or configurations; the number, type or location of dwelling units, subject to (5), above; and the location of public amenities, services or utilities.  
 
 Any amendment of a MPC Plan that adversely impacts upon the delivery or the Town’s cost of public utilities, public services, public infrastructure, or otherwise adversely affects amenities available to the public or the public health and safety shall not be considered “minor” and shall be deferred to the Mayor and Commissioners to be considered as a new application.

Interpretation of the above parking requirements: 
1. The use requirements for each district are not affected by arrangement of uses in the chart. 
2. The parking requirements in this article do not limit special requirements which may be imposed in connection with Special Exceptions.(See Section 9-6) 
3. Floor area as used in the above shall be as defined in Article 3. 
4. Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required shall be construed to be the next highest whole number. 
5. The parking space requirements for a use not specifically listed in the above shall be the same as for a listed use of similar characteristics of parking demand generation. 
6. In the case of mixed uses, uses with different parking requirements occupying the same building or premises, or in the case of joint use of a building or premises by more than one use having the same parking requirements, the parking spaces required shall equal the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately.  
7. Whenever a building or use, constructed or established after the effective date of this Ordinance, is changed or enlarged in floor area, number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity or otherwise, to create a need for an increase in the number of parking spaces no such change or enlargement, increase in number of employees, dwelling units, seating capacity or other intensification of the use shall be permitted unless in full  
           compliance with all off street parking requirements. 
8.  Compliance   with   off  street  parking  requirements,  as  noted  in  paragraph 7 above, shall not be required in the “VC” Village Commercial District and “GC” General Commercial District if there is no change in the building footprint.   If the building footprint is enlarged, compliance with the off street parking requirements for the additional square footage shall be required. (ADOPTED PER ORDINANCE 2008-03-02) 
 
2. Joint Use and Off-Site Facilities: 
 
 All parking spaces required herein shall be located on the same lot with the building or use served, except that where an increase in the number of spaces is required by a change or enlargement of use or where such spaces are provided collectively or used jointly by two or more buildings or establishments, the required spaces may be located and maintained not to exceed 300 feet from the building served or as determined by the Planning Commission.  
 
a.  Up to 50 percent of the parking spaces required for (a) theatres, public auditoriums, bowling alleys, dance halls, night clubs or cafes, and up to l00 percent of the parking spaces required for a church auditorium may be provided and used jointly by (b) banks, offices, retail stores, repair shops, service establishments and similar uses not normally open, used, or operated during the same hours as those listed in (a); provided, however, that written agreement thereto is properly executed and filed as specified below. 
 
b. In any case where the required parking spaces are not located on the same lot with the building or use served, or where such spaces are collectively or jointly provided and used, a written agreement thereby assuring their retention for such purposes shall be properly drawn and executed by the parties concerned, approved as to form by the Town Attorney and shall be filed with the application for a building permit [construction authorization]. 
 
3. Design Standards: 
 
a. As defined in Article 3, an off-street parking space is an all-weather surfaced area not in a street or alley and having an area of not less than 9 feet x 18 feet, exclusive of driveways, permanently reserved for the temporary storage of one automobile and connected with a street or alley by an all-weather surfaced driveway which affords satisfactory ingress and egress for automobiles. (AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2014-03-01) 
 
b. Entrances or exits for all parking facilities shall comply with existing ordinances of the Town of North East. 
 
c. Screening in the form of a solid fence or shrubbery shall be required to protect neighboring residences from all parking lots hereafter constructed to contain 10 or more spaces.  The location and construction of such screening shall be approved by the Zoning Administrator. 
 
d. All parking facilities shall comply with current American Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. 
          Big Box Retail parking lots shall not contain more than eight adjacent parking spaces without an intervening landscaping area. The Planning Commission will require the applicant to consider a  design that will accept  graded stormwater  runoff via natural infiltration and subsurface channelization via perforated piping.  Landscape areas shall be sized to support the required landscape species and quantities as measured according to their size at maturity.  The Planning Commission has the authority to relax the requirement for landscape islands every eight parking spaces  if bio-retention areas of a minimum of 8.5 feet in width provided within the parking areas. [ADOPTED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
4. Fee-in-Lieu Parking Provisions 
 
a. Purpose - All new development in the “GC” and “VC” districts are required to provide adequate off-street parking as prescribed in Section 6-8. The North East Comprehensive Plan envisions a downtown and adjoining areas that remain in a compact urban form, and it is sometimes difficult in the downtown to provide both the required parking and the required urban density to maintain such a form on the same piece of property. The Fee-in-Lieu Program allows developers to pay a fee for each parking space they are unable to provide on-site. The fund into which the fee is paid is reserved for future provision of publicly accessible parking spaces in the “GC” and “VC” Districts. 
 
b. Applicability - The provisions of this section apply to all infill, development and redevelopment in the “GC” and “VC” Districts required to construct parking spaces according to provisions Section 6.8.  
 
c. Determination of Fee-in-Lieu Parking Program Fee - The fee associated with this Fee-in-Lieu Program shall be established by the Mayor and Commissioners taking into account national averages as reported in such sources as the most recent Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index (ENR CCI) as well as local land and construction costs. This fee shall be updated yearly. The fee shall be for each parking space the construction of which a developer cannot construct or provide through long-term agreement for the use of available nearby spaces.  
 
d. Collection - The Fee-in-Lieu Parking Program fee will be collected by the Town, prior to the issuance of any construction authorization or final occupancy permits for the building or portion thereof associated with the fees.  
 
e. Accounting - Fee-in-Lieu Parking Program fees and all the interest earnings on those fees will be placed in an account specific to the provision of publicly accessible parking in the “GC” and “VC” Districts. The Town will maintain a record of all properties that 
have met their required parking space obligation by paying the appropriate fee for the spaces. Payment of this fee does not absolve the developer from any future obligation to participate in future construction of publicly accessible parking spaces through additional funding mechanisms (e.g., a local improvement district, tax increment financing, etc.). Payment of this fee also does not guarantee the developer that parking spaces will be constructed for the sole use of or in the immediate proximity of that development. 
 
f. Project Implementation - Projects funded from the Fee-in-Lieu Parking Program may be implemented either by the construction of publicly accessible parking spaces through the Town’s Capital Improvement Program or by disbursing funds to a developer constructing the improvements. Funds may also be used to convert existing private parking spaces to publicly accessible parking spaces through the purchase or lease of underutilized private parking spaces. Planning for parking capital improvement projects funded by Fee-in-Lieu Parking Program fees will be initiated at the discretion of the Mayor and Commissioners. It should be recognized that to provide for a logical and cost effective construction of parking improvements, projects funded by Fee-in-Lieu Parking Program fees may be phased and may be constructed such that the parking spaces do not directly serve the parcels from which the fee was collected.

(2) All dwelling units (commercial apartments) constructed above commercial uses in the Neighborhood Centers shall be permissible in addition to the number of dwelling units otherwise authorized under this Section.  However, the total number of dwelling units in a development shall not be increased by more than 10 dwelling units or 10 percent, whichever is greater. 
 
b. Base Density Calculation. Base density shall be determined by the land area yielded through calculations of the Adjusted Tract Acreage, as determined by Table b(2). The minimum residential density for a proposed MPC shall be 3.5 dwelling units per adjusted tract acres. Except as may be provided for below the maximum residential density for a proposed MPC shall be no more than 6.0 dwelling units per adjusted tract acre.

c. Density Incentives to Further Certain Public Objectives 
 
(1) A density increase of ten (10%) percent is permitted at the discretion of the Mayor and Commissioners when the proposal provides a mixture of at least four of the five of the following types of housing: single-family detached, two-family or duplex, multi-family, townhouse, and apartments. The architecture of the proposed dwellings shall be harmonious among the various housing types, and they shall be integrated physically; that is, they should not be separated into different neighborhoods but rather mixed in together on the same streets so that at least two dwelling types are located together within the same block. 
 
(2) Implementation. For each of the public purposes described in (1) above, if the Mayor and Commissioners are satisfied that the public purpose objectives are being satisfied, density bonuses may be implemented by reducing the amount of required open space to no less than twenty (20%) percent of the gross site acreage at the discretion of the Mayor and Commissioners. The cumulative density bonuses applied to a MPC project may not exceed thirty five (35%) percent of the maximum residential base density.  
 
4. General Design Requirements 
 
a. Design standards referenced in this section shall be considered as minimum performance standards for a MPC. 
 
b. MPCs are intended to provide for a range of complementary uses and may consist of up to four use areas: Single-Family Residential    
(SRA) Areas, Central Residential (CRA) Areas, Neighborhood Centers (NA) Areas, and Conservation (CA) Areas.  At a minimum, they must contain both a SRA and a CA. These areas are intended to provide for the diversity necessary for traditional town life, while maximizing the interactions among related uses and minimizing the adverse impacts of different uses upon each other. 
 
(1) Single-Family Residential Areas (SRA) provide locations for a broad range of housing types, including single-family detached, semi-detached, and attached, and may also include accessory dwelling units. 
 
(2) Conservation Areas (CA) are permanently protected open spaces, including greens, commons, habitat protection areas and private non-common acreage used for agriculture, wholesale nurseries, tree farms, equestrian facilities, etc. 
 
(3) The Central Residential Area (CRA) is intended to contain a variety of housing options and related uses. 
 
(4) The Neighborhood Center Area (NA) is intended primarily to provide uses that meet the retail, employment and service needs of a traditional community center and its vicinity within two to three-story buildings, and may contain other compatible uses, such as civic and institutional uses of community wide importance, specifically including second-floor residential uses. Where it is not practical to support commercial uses, the Neighborhood Center should provide a focal point for neighborhood activity through the design of public spaces, the mix of uses including live-work space, emphasis on pedestrian activity and the location of the largest and most intensively used buildings. 
 
5. Development Standards 
 
a. The following development standards shall apply to proposed MPC: 
 
(1) The setback, lot size, lot dimensions, lot coverage, height, yard requirements and permitted signs in the MPC shall be established for each individual project by the Mayor and Commissioners, with the recommendations of the Planning Commission, in accordance with the MPC Design Guidelines. In establishing these requirements the Mayor and Commissioners shall consider such factors as the proposed development intensity and the existing character of adjacent neighborhoods. 
  
(2) Land Coverage. The maximum amount of land that may be built over (covered) by parking lots, roads, sidewalks, or plazas, buildings, or other structures shall be sixty (60%) percent of the gross land area of the MPC property(ies). 
 
(3) Minimum Required Open Space 
 
(a) A minimum of thirty (30%) percent of the adjusted tract acreage shall be open space including parks, recreational, habitat, forest, agriculture, stream and wetland preservation areas. Not less than fifteen (15%) percent of the minimum required open space shall be in a form usable to and accessible by the residents, such as a central green, neighborhood squares or commons, recreational playing fields, woodland walking trails, other kinds of footpaths, a community park, or any combination of the above.  In addition, no more than fifty (50% percent of the minimum required open space may be comprised of active recreation facilities, such as playing fields, golf courses, tennis courts, etc.  
 
(b) Open space land shall be permanently protected through conservation easements, and may be developed for uses consisting of the following: 
 
[1] Agricultural uses, including horticultural, wholesale nurseries, and the raising of crops, and buildings related to the same; 
 
[2] Equestrian facilities, including related stables and pastures; 
 
[3] Woodlots, arboreta, and other similar silvicultural uses 
 
[4] Woodland preserve, game preserve, wildlife sanctuary, conservation meadows, or other similar conservation uses 
 
[5] Municipal or public uses, public park or recreation area owned and operated by a public or private nonprofit agency, or governmental or public utility buildings or uses, not to include business facilities, storage of materials, trucking or repair facilities, the housing of repair crews, or private or mu-nicipal sanitary landfills; and 
  
[6] Active recreation, if it is noncommercial in nature and provided that no more than fifty (50%) percent of the minimum required open space is so used.  Parking areas and any roofed structures associated with the active recreation may not be included within the fifty (50%) percent minimum. 
 
(c) The required open space shall be located and designed to add to the visual amenities of neighborhoods and to the surrounding area by maximizing the visibility of internal open space as "terminal vistas" (the building or landscape seen at the end of a street, or along the outside edges of street curves) and by maximizing the visibility of external open space as perimeter greenbelt land (the undeveloped and permanently protected acreage around a community).  Such greenbelt open space shall be designated to provide buffers and to protect scenic views as seen from existing roadways and from public parks, and shall not be less than one-hundred (100) feet deep. 
 
(d) MPC developments shall include multiple greens, commons, or passive parks measuring a total of at least fifteen hundred (1,500) square feet for each dwelling unit, plus five hundred (500) square feet of land for active recreation per dwelling unit. 
 
(e) Civic greens or squares shall be distributed throughout the neighborhood so as to be located within fifteen hundred (1,500) feet of ninety (90%) percent of all residential units in the SRA and CRA areas.   
 
 b.                                                            Residential Unit Mix

ARTICLE 8. NONCONFORMING USES 
 
Section 8-l. Nonconforming Use of Land and Buildings 
 
Within the zoning districts established by this Ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or future amendments. 
 
It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed or destroyed, but not to encourage their survival.  Such uses are declared by the Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved.  It is further the intent of this Ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zoning district. 
 
A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this Ordinance by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited in the zoning district involved.   
 
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on.  Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved. 
 
Additional Provisions regulating nonconforming use of land and buildings in the Critical Area are set forth in Article 5. 
 
Section 8-2. Nonconforming Lots of Record (PORTIONS OF SECTION 8-2 REPEALED BY ORDINANCE 2008-03-01) 
 
Notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, except in industrial districts.  Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership.  This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the zoning district. 
 
If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this Ordinance, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot width and area as established by this Ordinance, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided  parcel  for  the  purposes of this Ordinance, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet lot width and area requirements established by this Ordinance, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this Ordinance.  
 
Section 8-3. Nonconforming Uses of Land 
 
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this Ordinance as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:  
 
1. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of and than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance; 
 
2. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance; 
 
3. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 90 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this Ordinance for the zoning district classification in which such land is located.

Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
 
1. No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity; 
 
2. Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at time of destruction as determined by the Building Inspector, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance; 
 
3. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located after it is moved.   
Section 8-5. Nonconforming Uses of Structures 
 
If a lawful use  of a  structure  or  of  structure  and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this  Ordinance, that  would  not  be allowed in the zoning district under the terms of this Ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
 
1. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Ordinance in the zoning district in which it is located, except dwellings, shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the zoning district in which it is located; 
 
2. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for use at the time of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building; 
 
3. If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Board of Appeals, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the zoning district than the existing nonconforming use.  In permitting such change, the Board of Appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this Ordinance; 
 
4. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed; 
 
5. Except in accordance with Section 8-8 in any residential district when a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for 18 months during any three year period, the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located; 
 
6. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. 
 
Section 8-6. Repairs and Maintenance 
 
On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of l2 consecutive  months  or  ordinary  repairs,  or repair  or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an 
extent not exceeding l0 percent of the current replacement value of the building,  provided  that  the  cubic content of the building, as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of this Ordinance shall not be increased. 
 
Section 8-7. Nonconforming Lots of Record with Conforming Single Family Dwellings (ADDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-09-03) 
 
Notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance, a 
conforming single-family dwelling that existed at the effective date of adoption  
or amendment of this Ordinance on a nonconforming lot of record may be 
enlarged or expanded subject to the following provisions: 
 
1. The enlargement or expansion shall meet all requirements for height, area and bulk regulations in effect at the time of construction.  

2. The enlargement or expansion may not create a nonconforming structure.  

3. The enlargement or expansion may not occupy area required to meet any off-street parking requirements of this Ordinance. 


 
Section 8-8. Uses Under Exception Provisions Not Nonconforming Uses 
 
Any use for which a special exception is permitted as provided in this Ordinance shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall without further action be deemed a conforming use in such zoning district. 
 
Section 8-9. Restoration After Damage Or Reconstruction 
 
Nothing in these regulations shall prevent the continuance of a use or the reconstruction of a structure occupied by a lawful nonconforming use destroyed by fire, explosion, or act of God as it existed at the time of such destruction provided that reconstruction is begun within two (2) years after the occurrence.

Section 12-10. Landscaping of Parking Facilities 
 
1. Intent  
 
 It is intended that the application of the landscape standards set forth below will reduce the visual and environmental impacts of large expanses of parking areas. Breaking up of paved parking areas with plantings will provide improved aesthetics and micro-climatic benefits by reducing heat and glare. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that the standards specified shall be minimum standards.  The Planning Commission, at its discretion, may require additional plantings, larger specimen plants or such combination of plantings and landscaping that will address specific concerns that may be identified during the process of concept site plan, Preliminary site plan or Landscape plan review.  The burden of proof shall rest with the applicant to demonstrate why the requirements imposed by the Planning Commission can not be met. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
2. Sites Affected  
 
a. New sites. Except for infill or redevelopment projects approved as per Section 5-15, no new parking areas shall hereafter be constructed or used unless landscaping is provided as required by the provision of this Article. 
 
b. Existing sites. Except for infill or redevelopment projects approved as per Section 5-15, no parking areas shall be expanded, moved, or removed and/or reconstructed unless the minimum landscaping required by the provision of this Article is provided for the property to the extent of its alteration or expansion, but not for the entire property. 
 
c. Change of use. Except as allowed for infill or redevelopment projects approved as per Section 5-15, no use shall be changed to another use for which additional parking above that for the previous use is required, unless the parking facility perimeter landscaping as required by this section is provided for such additional parking. The provisions of this section shall be effective regardless of whether or not new construction is necessary to meet the parking requirements for the new uses. Where new construction will not be necessary to meet the parking requirements, such additional required parking shall be deemed to be on the perimeter for as much as possible of the existing vehicular use area. Where the previous use had no required parking, perimeter landscaping shall be provided for the entire vehicular use area serving the new use. Interior landscaping shall not be required where only the use of the property is changed and no new construction or reconstruction is proposed. 
 
d. Change of zoning district. No use of an existing building, structure, or vehicular use area shall be commenced subsequent to a change in zoning district classification unless property perimeter landscaping as required herein has been provided. 
 
3. Perimeter Landscaping 
 
 When more setback and/or plantings are required in Sections 12-7 and 12-11 the standards of those sections shall apply. Otherwise, the following minimum landscape standards shall apply: 
 
a. A planting strip shall be provided at least eight (8) feet wide adjacent to the back of any sidewalks or ten (10) foot wide adjacent to the property line where no sidewalk exists.  Where the parking lot does not abut a property line or sidewalk, a five (5) foot planting area shall be provided. 
 
b. Except where otherwise specifically required by herein, a minimum ten (10) foot wide screening area shall be provided along all abutting property lines of a residential district. 
 
c. The following requirements shall apply to the design and construction of all parking lots for fifteen (15) vehicles or more: 
 
(1) Perimeter Landscaping. An eight (8) foot landscaped area shall be provided adjacent to all driveways leading to the lot and around the outer edges of all parking lots. 
 
(2) Screening Areas. A ten (10) foot screening area shall be provided abutting all residential districts except where a greater distance is required by the provisions of the zoning district in which the parking lot is located. 
 
4. Each landscape area adjacent to a street right-of-way shall contain a minimum of one tree per forty (40) feet of landscape area parallel to the right-of-way. This requirement is in addition to the street tree requirements in Section 12-9. In addition, a vegetative screen, landscaped berm, fence, wall, or other methods to reduce the visual impact of the parking area shall be provided. The vegetative screen shall have an average continuous height of three (3) feet.  
 
5. Grass or ground cover shall be planted on all portions of the landscape area not occupied by other landscape material. 
 
6. Special notes on existing natural vegetation: 
 
a. In all cases where significant natural vegetation exists, as determined by the Zoning Administrator, there will be limits of clearing/grading areas established to protect and preserve these natural area. These natural areas will not be disturbed by the installation of any structures, utilities, storm and sanitary sewers, water lines, sediment and erosion control traps, stormwater management systems, signage. Existing landscape material which is proposed to be used to fulfill landscape requirements shall be shown in the required plan. 
 
b. In the case where buffers are created by the application of these standards, no structures, utilities, storm and sanitary sewers, water lines, sediment and erosion control traps, stormwater management systems, and signage will be permitted. 
 
c. Where pedestrian and bike paths are proposed in the landscape area, such paths shall be meandering in order to preserve the existing trees. 
 
7. Trees required as a part of the parking lot street right-of-way landscaping may be placed on the right-of-way adjoining such parking area when 
approved by the Planning Commission. Such trees shall be in addition to any street trees required by the subdivision regulations. 
 
8. Landscaping in Easements. The required landscape area for parking areas may be combined with a utility or other easement only if all landscape requirements can be met. Otherwise, the landscape area shall be in addition to, and separate from, any easement. 
 
9. In any parking lot perimeter landscaping area all trees shall be set back at least four (4) feet from the edge of paving. 
 
10. Interior Landscaping for Parking Lots  
 
a. For any parking lot containing more than six thousand (6,000) square feet of area or fifteen (15) or more spaces, interior landscaping shall be provided in addition to the previously required perimeter landscaping. Interior landscaping shall be contained in peninsulas or islands. An interior parking lot landscape island or peninsula is defined as a landscaped area containing a minimum area of one hundred fifty three (153) square feet having a minimum width of eight and one half (8.5) feet and a minimum length of eighteen (18) feet.  Where needed, based on maximum adjacent spaces in adjoining parking isles, landscape islands may be joined.  The Planning Commission may require periodic spacing of landscape islands, of up to 612 square feet, to accommodate clusters of large canopy shade trees and attendant understory and shrub plantings in order to visually break up the large number of parking spaces required in Big-Box developments.  There shall be a minimum of four (4) feet to all trees from the edge of paving where vehicles overhang. For purposes of Subsection d. below and subject to the limits established in e. below, up to four (4) islands can be combined. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
b. Where a parking area is altered or expanded to increase the size to six thousand (6,000) or more square feet of area or fifteen (15) or more vehicular parking spaces, interior landscaping for the entire parking area shall be provided and not merely to the extent of its alteration or expansion. 
 
c. Landscape area. For each one hundred (100) square feet, or fraction thereof, of parking lot, ten (10) square feet of landscaped area shall, at a minimum, be provided and shall be subject to Planning Commission review and approval. The interior landscaping requirement shall be computed on the basis of the "net parking facility." For the purposes of this Section, "net parking facility" shall include parking stalls, access drives, aisles, walkways, dead spaces, and required separations from structures, but shall not include required street setbacks or access driveways 
or walkways within such setbacks. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
d. Landscape islands or peninsulas - number required: 
 
(1) For less than one hundred (100) spaces one island or peninsula is required for every seven (7) parking spaces. 
 
(2) For one hundred (100) spaces or more, one island or peninsula is required for every eight (8) adjacent spaces. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
(3) Each eight (8) parking spaces shall require an interior planting island. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
(4) All interior parking aisles shall end in a landscape island. 
 
e. Maximum contiguous areas for interior parking lot landscaping. In order to encourage the required landscape areas to be properly dispersed, no required landscape area shall be larger than the following: 
 
(1) Three hundred fifty (350) square feet in parking areas under thirty thousand (30,000) square feet. 
 
(2) There shall be no maximum size limitation on individual landscaping areas within parking lots in excess of 30,000 square feet.  However, the potential provision of large contiguous landscaped areas does not relieve the applicant from meeting all other landscaping requirements of this Ordinance or those special requirements established by the Planning Commission as a consequence of their case by case reviews. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
f. Landscape areas larger than the above are permitted as long as the additional area is in excess of the required minimum, except that landscape areas larger than the maximum permitted may be allowed as required landscaping areas in those cases where the intent is to preserve existing significant stands of natural vegetation.  
 
g. Minimum plant materials. A minimum of one (1) tree for each two hundred fifty (250) square feet or fraction thereof of required landscape area or for each five (5) spaces of required parking or for each one hundred sixty one (161) square feet of island or peninsula, whichever is greater, shall be required. The remaining area of the required landscaped area shall be landscaped with shrubs or ground cover not to exceed two (2) feet in height, or grass. 
 
h. Interior landscaping for parking areas shall be installed and continuously maintained by the owner. 
 
i. Plan submission and approval. Whenever any property is affected by these parking area landscape requirements, the property owner or developer shall prepare a landscape plan. 
 
j. Unnecessary paving or irregular paving plans are strongly discouraged and, if incorporated in a site plan, shall be subject to approval by the Zoning Administrator. 
 
k. Alternative parking area landscaping design may be considered by the Planning Commission in cases where unique topography and site constraints dictate such alternative. The innovative use of planting design and materials is encouraged and will be evaluated on the intent demonstrated to fulfill the stated objectives of this section. 
 
l. Landscape material type and quality shall be as follows: 
 
(1) Parking lots and areas that are required to be paved must be shaded by deciduous trees (either retained or planted by the developer) that have or will have when fully mature a trunk at least twelve (12) inches in diameter.  
 
(2)  Each tree of the type described in subsection a. shall be presumed to shade a circular area having a radius of fifteen (15) feet with the trunk of the tree as the center, and there must be sufficient trees so that, using this standard, twenty percent (20) of the parking lot area will be shaded. 
 
(3) Parking areas shall be laid out and detailed to prevent vehicles from striking trees. Vehicles will be presumed to have a body overhang of three (3) feet, six (6) inches.

Appendix A 
Standards for Buffer Yard Design 
 
A-1. Buffer yard specifications  
 
The following illustrations graphically indicate the specifications of each buffer yard. Buffer yard recommendations are stated in terms of the width of the buffer yard and the number of plant units required per one hundred (100) linear feet of buffer yard. The recommended buffer yard should be one (1) of the options illustrated. The "plant unit multiplier" is a factor by which the basic number of plant materials recommended for a given buffer yard is determined given a change in the width of that yard. The type and quantity of plant materials recommended by each buffer yard, and each buffer yard option, including berms, are specified in this section. 
 
Afforestation or reforestation plantings required under the Cecil County Forest Conservation Regulations may occur in buffer yards, provided that such plantings meet the minimum requirements of the Forest Conservation Regulations. 
 
The options within any buffer yard are designed to be equivalent in terms of their effectiveness in eliminating the impact of adjoining uses.  Cost equivalence between options was attempted where possible.  Generally, the plant materials which are identified as desirable are determined by the type(s) of soil present on the site.  Each illustration depicts the total buffer yard located between two uses. 
 
A-2. Plant Material  
 
The following plant material substitutions may satisfy the recommendations of this section. 
 
1. In Buffer Yards C, D and E, evergreen canopy or evergreen understory trees may be not be substituted for deciduous canopy forest trees. [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
2. In Buffer Yards B, evergreen canopy or evergreen understory trees may be substituted as follows: 
 
a. In the case of deciduous understory, without limitation.  [AMENDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-02-01] 
 
3. In all buffer yards, evergreen or conifer shrubs may be substituted for deciduous shrubs without limitation. 
 
4. In all buffer yards required of public service uses, the public service use may substitute evergreen canopy or evergreen understory plant materials 
for canopy forest trees and understory plant materials, without limitation. 
 
 
If the development on the adjoining parcel is existing, planned or deed-restricted for solar access, understory trees may be substituted for canopy trees where canopy trees would destroy solar access.  Any existing plant material which otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section should be used. 
 
Although the exact placement of recommended plants and structures is the decision of each user, the following is recommended: 
 
a. Except as specified in Buffer Yard A, evergreen (or conifer) Class III and IV plant materials should be planted in clusters rather than singly in order to maximize their chances of survival. 
 
b. Berms (Bl, B2 and B3) recommended with Buffer Yard D and E options are intended to buffer more significant nuisances from adjacent uses and, additionally, to break up and absorb noise, which is achieved by the varied heights of plant materials. 
 
c. Bufferyard Berms with a side slope of 3:1 or greater shall be avoided. (ADDED PER ORDINANCE 2010-09-02) 
 
All buffer yard areas should be seeded with lawn unless ground cover is already established.

ARTICLE 13. SENSITIVE AREAS REQUIREMENTS  
        
Section 13-1. Definitions 
  
Habitat of Threatened and Endangered Species:  An area which, due to its physical or biological features, provides important elements for the maintenance, expansion and long-term survival of threatened and endangered species listed on COMAR 08.03.08.  This area may include breeding, feeding, resting, migratory, or overwintering areas.  Physical or biological features include, but are not limited to:  structure and composition of the vegetation; faunal community; soils; water chemistry and quality; and geologic, hydrologic and microclimatic factors.  This area may need special management or protection because of its importance to conservation of the threatened or endangered species. 
 
Streams and Their Buffers: Streams are defined as all streams of water of natural origin, flowing constantly or intermittently on the surface of the earth in a relatively definite natural channel, including springs, lakes, or marshes in which a stream originates or through which it flows.  Stream buffers are defined as all lands lying within 100 feet from the banks of streams measured from the top of each normal stream bank or the centerline of streams less than 5 feet in width that have ill-defined stream banks.  The 100 foot buffer width is expanded to include contiguous steep slopes, at the rate of 4 feet for every 1% increase in slope above a slope of 15%. 
 
One Hundred Year Floodplain:  The land area along or adjacent to nontidal streams and bodies of water that is susceptible to inundation by the 100-year flood as a result of rainfall and runoff from upland areas.  A 100-year flood is a flood which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
 
Steep Slope:  Areas with a slope of 25% or more covering an area of at least 5,000 square feet.  Areas with a slope of 15% or more covering an area of at least 5,000 square feet where the erodibility coefficient is 0.32 or more. 
 
Development Projects:  Subdivision plats, site plans, and the construction of buildings, structures, roads, water and sewerage facilities and other infrastructure. 
 
Section 13-2. Permitted Uses and Activities  
 
Uses and activities permitted in sensitive areas must, in addition to the requirements below, meet all other applicable Federal, State and Local laws and regulations. 
 
All Sensitive Areas: 
 
1. Existing structures may be removed, restored, repaired, maintained, or enhanced, provided that: 
 
a. for any development other than agricultural activities,  the  area occupied by a structure may not be enlarged by more than 20% and the enlargement shall be done in conjunction with the establishment of best management practices which reduce the level of negative environmental impacts, such as runoff, which existed prior to enlargement. 
 
b. for any agricultural activity, the area occupied by a structure may be enlarged if a soil conservation and water quality plan, approved by the local soil conservation district, establishes best management practices for the enlargement. 
 
2. Agricultural activity existing, or planned as part of a conventional rotational cycle or on areas set aside under a formal program for agriculture authorized by the United States Department of Agriculture or the Maryland Department of Agriculture as of January 1, 1993, shall be allowed provided that any construction or substantial alteration of the land for agricultural purposes, including installation of best management practices, shall be done in accordance with the provisions of a soil conservation and water quality plan, approved by the local soil conservation district. 
 
Habitat of Threatened and Endangered Species: 
 
1. Natural resources and environmental protection, management, monitoring, restoration, and enhancement; provided the measures are: 
 
a. implemented to protect the habitat of threatened and endangered species. 
 
b. agricultural activities or agricultural management measures that do not disturb habitat of threatened and endangered species and are done according to a plan approved by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Natural Resources. 
 
Streams and Their Buffers: 
 
1. Natural resources and environmental protection, management, monitoring, restoration and enhancement may be implemented. 
 
2. New structures or alterations of existing structures for transportation facilities, transmission lines, and sewer, water, and gas lines may be constructed only if no practicable or feasible alternative exists for locating the structure outside of a stream and buffer area. If a structure must be located in a stream and buffer area, disturbance of the area shall be minimized. 
 
3. Nonstructural land alteration for commercial forestry shall be allowed in accordance with provision of a forest management plan, prepared by a registered forester, that is approved by the Department of Natural 
Resources and assures protection of natural resources in the stream and buffer area.  In stream buffers, a commercial forestry activity may not be undertaken within 50 feet of the banks of a stream,   except  that  activities   may  be  undertaken   to  permit  forest  conservation practices consistent with an approved forest management plan.  Disturbances of the stream and buffer area shall be minimized. 
 
4. Roads, causeways, or boat ramps that are necessary for recreational access to a stream may be constructed, provided that the area disturbed by development or nonstructural land alteration is minimized. 
 
100-Year Floodplain: 
 
1. Natural resources and environmental protection, management, monitoring, restoration, and enhancement may be implemented. 
 
2. New structures or alteration of existing structures for transportation facilities, transmission lines, and sewer, water, and gas lines may be constructed only if no practicable or feasible alternative exists for locating the structure outside of the 100-year floodplain.  If a structure must be located in a 100-year flood plain, disturbance of the area shall be minimized. 
 
3. Nonstructural land alteration for commercial forestry shall be allowed in accordance with provisions of a forest management plan, prepared by a registered forester, that is approved by the Department of Natural Resources and assures protection of natural resources in the 100-year floodplain.  Disturbance of the 100-year floodplain shall be minimized. 
 
4. Structures and nonstructural land alterations appurtenant to mineral resource extraction areas, agriculture, stormwater management facilities, dams and reservoirs, water supply and wastewater facilities, flood management activities or facilities and publicly owned or operated recreational facilities provided that:  
 
a. they are outside of the stream buffer, except that agricultural appurtenances may be in the stream buffer provided they are constructed in accordance with the provisions of a soil conservation and water quality plan approved by the local soil conservation district. 
 
b. disturbance of the 100-year floodplain is minimized. 
 
Steep Slopes: 
 
1. Natural resources and environmental protection, management, monitoring, restoration, and enhancement may be implemented. 
 
2. And sewer, water, and gas lines may be constructed only if no practicable or feasible alternative exists for locating the structure outside of the 
steep slope area.  If a structure must be located in a steep slope area, disturbance of the area shall be minimized. 
 
3. Nonstructural land alteration for commercial forestry shall be allowed in accordance with provisions of forest management plan, prepared by a registered forester, that is approved by the Department of Natural Resources and assures protection of natural resources in the steep slope area.  Disturbance of the steep slope area shall be minimized. 
 
4. New structures other than those permitted in subsection (4)(b) above may be constructed if construction disturbs a total of 5,000 square feet or less of steep slope area.  Agricultural structures may disturb more than 5,000 square feet of steep slope provided a structure is built in compliance with the provisions of a soil conservation and water quality plan approved by the local soil conservation district.

ARTICLE 14. FOREST CONSERVATION PLAN REQUIREMENTS  
 
In 1991, the State of Maryland required all municipalities with planning and zoning authority to establish their own local forest conservation program or to participate in such a program jointly with another entity with such jurisdiction. 
 
Section 5-1063 (a) (4) of Title 5 of the Natural Resources Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland authorizes a municipality to assign to the County its forest conservation program obligations, provided the County concurs.  The Town of North East exercised its rights pursuant to Title 5 and in January of 2000, the Board of Commissioners of Cecil County accepted its obligations.  The Cecil County Office of Planning and Zoning shall have the right and authority to enforce fully the forest conservation program of the Town of North East within the corporate limits of the Town.  All applications must be submitted to the Cecil County Office of Planning and Zoning and any and all applicable County fees must be paid by the applicant.   
 
The Town of North East will coordinate its development approval activities for building permits, site plan approvals, subdivision plat approvals, and any grading and sediment control permits with the requirements of Cecil County's forest conservation program.  No final building permit, site plan, subdivision plat, grading or sediment control permit shall be initiated or approved until the applicant has demonstrated compliance with the provisions of Cecil County's forest conservation program and received approval from the Cecil County Office of Planning and Zoning.

This article explains the three-stage approval process for major subdivision plats and the process required for minor subdivisions.  The three stages outlined herein as Part A, Part B, and Part C, and the procedures pertaining thereto, shall be followed in all subdivisions of five lots or more unless the Planning Commission, upon review of the tentative sketch plan, shall determine that the  Preliminary plat stage can be omitted. 
   
1.  Minor Subdivison - for a minor subdivision of four lots or less on an existing public street, a preliminary plat shall not be required.  In this latter case, the procedures and plats and data  required by the Town Administrator shall be as follows: 
 
a. The Town Administrator has the authority to approve minor subdivisions of land and/or minor adjustments in lot lines without the necessity of the Subdivision complying with preliminary plat procedures or going before the Planning Commission, provided that before any such administrative approval, the Cecil County Technical Advisory Committee shall review any such minor subdivision and make whatever comments the Committee members feel inclined to do. 


 
b. A property owner shall apply to the Planning Commission for approval of up to four (4) lots by submitting a combined preliminary/final plat, provided that the proposed subdivision does not involve a proposed new street.  The combined preliminary/final plat application shall be submitted on forms approved by the Town and the appropriate fees shall be paid.  The combined preliminary/final plat shall follow all requirements of a normal final plat as provided in Section 6-4.    


 
The combined preliminary/final plat shall also contain the following information: 
 
1) Existing topography at two or five-foot contour intervals.  Contour lines shall be indicated at least fifty (50) feet beyond the subdivision boundary.  Contours shall be based upon government bench marks when available or be estimation from United States Geological Survey  quadrangle  maps  unless  otherwise  required  by  the Planning Commission.  A reference or bench mark  


 
4-2 
 
shall be described on the plat, together with elevation.  The source of contours shall be stated on the plat. 
 
2) All existing pertinent features, either natural or man-made, that may influence the design of the subdivision, such as important trees or wooded areas, power transmission towers, existing buildings and structures and watercourses. 


 
3) Location of existing and recorded utility easements on or within two hundred (200) feet of the tract.  This should include electric and telephone poles, underground cables and towers. 


 
4) Location and extent of permanent erosion and sediment control facilities (e.g., sedimentation ponds, drainage ditches, diversion terraces, etc.), if required by the Cecil County Soil Conservation District, shall be shown, as well as location of wells, septic disposal areas, percolation information and soil types. 


 
5) Information required by the Town of North East Critical Area Program, including but not limited to the Critical Area Buffer, SD-1 Critical Area District, the Critical Area Boundary line on parcels created and Habitat Protection Areas, forests and developed woodlands on or in the vicinity of the proposed minor subdivision, limits of tidal wetlands, the mean high water line and an environmental assessment. 


 
6) The location and extent of existing and/or proposed shore erosion abatement approaches. 


 
c. The  Town Administrator may require full compliance with the major subdivision approval process where special problems prevail in a Minor Subdivision Application or where prior subdivision has occurred.  In any case, no more than four (4) parcels may be approved administratively under this minor subdivision approval process from any lot or parcel of land which was in existence on the date of original enactment of these Subdivision Regulations, April 26, 1981. 


 
d. An applicant for a minor subdivision may appeal any decision of the Town Administrator in the minor subdivision approval process to the Planning Commission.  The Town  Administrator  may  also  refer  questions or the  


 
 
4-3 
 
entire approval process to the Planning Commission in cases of question or difficulty. 
  
(Effective 12/26/93 per Ordinance No. 93-11-4) 
 
PART A.         TENTATIVE SKETCH PLAN 
  
Section 4-2.   Purpose 
 
The purpose of the "Tentative Sketch Plan" is to afford the applicant the opportunity to consult early and informally with Town officials and the Planning Commission and agencies before preparation of the preliminary plat and formal application for approval. 
  
During the "Tentative Sketch Plan" procedure, the applicant can advantageously make use of the services of the administrative personnel of the Town as well as the Planning Commission to help him analyze the problem of the development and plan more adequately for its sound coordination with the community.  This procedure also affords the Town the opportunity to give informal guidance to the applicant at a stage when potential points of difference can be more easily resolved.  It can also simplify official actions and save unnecessary expense and delay.

1. Required improvements shall be completed.  Such improvements shall be inspected by the Town Engineer and accepted by the Administrator, President and Commission and other proper authorities; or 


 
2. The owner shall enter into a written agreement with the Town in the manner and form set forth by the Town Attorney where he shall agree: 


 
a. to construct or cause to be constructed, at his own expense, all streets, curbs, sidewalks, fire hydrants, drainage facilities, street signs, monuments, water and sewerage facilities, and other improvements shown on or accompanying said final plat when required to do so by the Planning Commission in accordance with the final plats, as finally approved, and in strict accordance with the standards and specifications of the Town; 


 
b. to maintain at his own cost the said streets, curbs, sidewalks, fire hydrants, drainage facilities, street signs, monuments, water and sewerage facilities, and other improvements, until the same are accepted by the Town; 


 
c. to obtain the easements and releases required when any street, drainage facility, or other improvement wherein a subdivision abuts or traverses land of persons other than the person holding legal title to the lands of the subdivision, at his own cost, and to obtain from the owner of the lands so abutted or traversed full releases from all damages which may change in grade, construction, or otherwise, the street, drainage facility, or other improvement, and such releases shall insure to the benefit not only of the owner of the subdivision but to the Town as well. 


 
Section 5-2.   Guaranty 
  
In  order  to  assure  the  Town that the streets, curbs, sidewalks, fire hydrants, drainage facilities, street signs, monuments, water and sewerage facilities, and other improvement shown on or accompanying said final plats

This bond shall insure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained, and removed. 
  
Section 5-4.   Failure to Complete Improvement 
  
For subdivisions for which no performance bond has been posted, if the improvements are not completed within the period  specified by the Planning Commission in the resolution approving the plat, the approval shall be deemed to have expired.  In those cases where a performance bond has been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the terms of such 
5-3 
 
performance bond, the Town may thereupon declare the bond to be in default and require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default.  
 
Section 5-5.   Inspection of Improvements 
  
1.  General Procedure and Fees 
  
The Planning Commission shall provide for inspection of the Town Engineer of required improvements during the construction and insure their satisfactory completion.  The applicant shall pay to the Town the Town Engineer's inspection fee.  These fees shall be due and payable to the Town upon demand and no building permits or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid.  If the Town Engineer finds upon inspection that any of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the Town's construction standards and specifications, the applicant shall be responsible for completing the improvements.  Wherever the cost of improvements is covered by a performance bond, the applicant and the bonding company shall be severally and jointly liable for completing the improvements according to specifications. 
  
2.  Release or Reduction of Performance Bond 
  
a. Certificate of Satisfactory Completion.  The President and Commission will not accept dedication of required improvements, not release nor reduce a performance bond, until the Town Engineer has submitted a certificate stating that all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the applicant's engineer or surveyor has certified to the Town Engineer, through submission of detailed "as-built" survey plat of the subdivision, indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other information required by the Planning Commission or Town Engineer, that the layout of the line and grade of all public improvements is in accordance with construction plans for the subdivision and that a title insurance policy has been furnished to and approved by the Town Attorney indicating that the improvements shall have been completed, are ready for dedication to the Town and are free and clear of any and all liens   and   encumbrances.     Upon    such   approval  and recommendation, the President and Commission shall thereafter accept the improvements for dedication in accordance with the established procedure. 


 
 
 
5-4 
 
b. Reduction of Performance Bond.  A performance bond shall be reduced upon actual dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the public improvement dedicated bears to the total public improvements for the plat.  In no event shall a performance bond be reduced below twenty-five percent (25%) of the principal amount. 


 
Section 5-6.     Escrow Deposits for Lot Improvements 
  
1.  Acceptance of Escrow Funds 
  
Whenever, by reason of the season of the year, any lot improvements required by the subdivision regulations cannot be performed, the Administrator may, nevertheless, issue a certificate of occupancy, provided there  is no  danger to health, safety, or general welfare upon accepting a cash escrow deposit in an amount to be determined by the Town Engineer for the cost of said improvements.  The performance  
bond covering such lot improvements shall remain in full force and effect. 
 
2.  Procedures on Escrow Fund 
      
All required improvements for which escrow monies have been accepted by the Town at the time of issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall be installed by the developer within a period of nine (9) months from the date of deposit and issuance of the certificate of occupancy.  In the event that the improvements have not been properly installed, at the end of the time period the Administrator shall give two (2) weeks' written notice to the developer requiring him to install them, and in the event that same are not installed properly in the discretion of the Administrator, the Administrator may request the President and Commission to authorize the Town to proceed to contract out the work for the installation of the necessary improvements in a sum not to exceed the amount of the escrow deposit.  At the time of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for which escrow monies are being deposited with the Administrator, the applicant shall obtain and file with the Administrator prior to obtaining the certificate of occupancy a notarized statement from the purchaser or purchasers of the premises authorizing the Administrator to install the improvements at the end of the nine-month period in the event that the same have not been duly installed by the developer. 
  
 
 
 
5-5 
 
Section 5-7.     Deferral or Waiver of Required Improvements 
  
1.  The Planning Commission may defer or waive at the time of final approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all such improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the interests of the public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities. 
 
2.  Whenever it is deemed necessary by the Planning Commission to defer the construction of any improvement required herein because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of connecting facilities, or for other reasons, the applicant shall pay his share of the costs of the future improvements to the Town prior to signing of the final subdivision plat, or the applicant may post a bond insuring completion of said improvements upon demand of the local government. 
  
Section 5-8.    Issuance of Building Permits and Certificates of Occupancy 
  
1.  Where  a  performance   bond  has   been  required for  a subdivision, no certificate of occupancy for any building in the subdivision shall be issued prior to the completion of the improvements and dedication of same to the Town, as required in the Planning Commission's final approval of the subdivision plat. 
  
2.  The extent of street improvement shall be adequate for vehicular access by the prospective occupant and by police and fire equipment, prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit.  The developer shall at the time of the dedication  submit  monies  in  escrow  to  the  Town in a sum determined by the Town Engineer for the necessary final improvement of the street. 
  
3.  No building permit shall be issued for the final ten percent (10%) of lots in a subdivision, or if ten percent (l0%) be less than two (2), for the final two (2) lots of a subdivision, until all public improvements required by the Planning Commission for the plat have been fully completed and dedicated to the Town. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5-6 
 
Section 5-9. Consumer Protection Legislation and Conflicts of Interest 
                      Statutes 
 
1. No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be granted or issued if a developer or his authorized agent shall have violated any federal, state, or local law pertaining to consumer protection of real estate land sales, promotion, or practices, or any applicable conflicts-of-interest legislation with respect to the lot or parcel of land which is the subject of the permit or certificate, until so ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. 


 
2. With respect to said lot or parcel of land, in the event a building permit or certificate of occupancy has been granted or issued, it shall be subject to revocation by the Town until so ordered otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that in no event shall the rights of intervening innocent third parties in possession of a certificate of occupancy be prejudiced in any  such revocation.
