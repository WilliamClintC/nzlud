The Commission is empowered to deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements of this By-law; for failure to submit necessary information and plans requested by the Commission; for failure to meet the design specifications, performance standards, and other requirements in regulations of the Commission; for failure to avoid or prevent unacceptable significant or cumulative effects upon the resource area values protected by this By-law; and where no conditions are adequate to protect those values. 
C. 	Lands within 100 feet of wetlands resource areas are presumed important to the protection of these resources because activities undertaken in close proximity to wetlands and other resource, either immediately, as a consequence of construction, or overtime, as a consequence of daily operation or existence of the activities. These adverse impacts from construction and use can include, without limitation, erosion, siltation, loss of groundwater recharge, poor water quality, and harm to wildlife habitat.  The Commission therefore may require that the applicant maintain a strip of continuous, undisturbed vegetative cover in part or all of the 100-foot area and set other conditions on this area, unless the applicant provides evidence deemed sufficient by the Commission that the area or part of it may be disturbed without harm to the values protected by the law. 
May 21, 2018 	p. 91 Chapter 32 -4 
D. A permit shall expire three years from the date of issuance.	  Any permit shall be renewed for additional one year periods if a request for renewal is received in writing by the Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the permit, and providing the Commission finds that (1) good cause has been shown for such extension and (2) such extension will not have significant adverse effects, immediate or cumulative, upon any of the wetland values protected by this By-law.  Notwithstanding the above, a permit may contain requirements which shall be enforceable for a stated number of years, indefinitely, or until permanent protection is in place, and shall apply to all owners of the land. 
E. 	The Commission shall, after receiving a written request for a Certificate of Compliance, inspect the resource area and buffer zone where any activity governed by a permit issued under this By-law was carried out.  If such activity has been completed in accordance with said permit, the Commission shall within twenty-one (21) days after such a request issue a Certificate of Compliance evidencing such. 
F. Violations of this By-law, submission of false or erroneous information, or new information that substantially alters the likely impact of the project on wetlands resources or values may cause the Commission to revoke or modify a permit or determination issued under this By-law after notice to the holder of the permit or determination, notice to the public, abutters, and town boards, pursuant to Section 5 and Section 6, and a public hearing. 
G. The Commission in an appropriate case may combine the permit or determination issued under this By-law with the Order of Conditions or Determination of Applicability issued under the Wetlands Protection Act, Massachusetts General Law, Ch. 131, § 40, and Regulations, 310 CMR 10.00. 
H. No work proposed in any permit application shall be undertaken until the permit issued by the Commission with respect to such work has been recorded in the registry of deeds or, if the land affected is registered land, in the registry section of the land court for the district wherein the land lies; and until the holder of the permit certifies in writing to the Commission that the permit has been recorded.  Such certification shall include the book and page or instrument number and date. 
Section 8: Regulations 
A. After	 the public notice and public hearing, the Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this By-law.  Failure by the Commission to promulgate such rules and regulations or a legal declaration of their invalidity by a court of law shall not act to suspend or invalidate the effect of this By­law. 
B. 	At a minimum these regulations shall define key terms in this By-law not inconsistent with the By-law and procedures governing the amount and filing of fees. 
Section 9: Definitions. The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and implementation of this By-law. 
A. The term “bank” shall include the land area which normally abuts confines of a water 
May 21, 2018 	p. 92 Chapter 32 -5 
body; the lower boundary being the mean annual low flow level, and the upper boundary being the first observable break in the slope or the mean annual flood level, whichever is higher. 
B. 	The term “vernal pool” shall include, in addition to that already defined under the Wetlands Protection Act, Massachusetts General Law, Ch. 131, § 40 and Regulations there under, 310 CMR 10.00, any confined basin or depression not occurring in existing lawns, gardens, landscaped areas, or driveways which, at least in most years, holds water for a minimum of two continuous months during the spring and/or summer, contains at least 200 cubic feet of water at some time during most years, is free of adult predatory fish populations, and provides essential breeding and rearing habitat functions for amphibian, reptile, or other vernal pool community species, regardless whether the site has been certified by the Massachusetts Division of Wildlife and Fisheries.  The presumption of essential habitat value may be overcome by the presentation of credible evidence, which in the judgment of the Commission demonstrates that the basin or depression does not provide the habitat functions as specified in the By-law regulations. The buffer zone for vernal pools shall extend 1,000 feet from the mean annual high-water line defining the depression, or one-half of the distance between the vernal pool and any existing house foundation, which ever is smaller.  In either case the buffer zone for vernal pools shall not extend over existing lawns, gardens, landscaped or developed areas. 
C. 	The term “existing” in the determination of buffer zones shall mean existing as of the date this By-law becomes effective. 
D. The term “isolated land subject to flooding” shall include an area, depression, or basin that holds at minimum one-eighth acre-foot of water and at least six inches of standing water once a year.  Not included are swimming pools, artificially lined ponds or pools, or constructed wastewater lagoons.  The buffer zone for isolated land subject to flooding shall be 25 feet. 
E. 	The term “pond” shall include any open body of fresh water with a surface area observed or recorded within the last ten years of at least 5,000 square feet. Ponds shall contain standing water except for periods of extended drought. Not included are swimming pools, artificially lined ponds or pools, or constructed wastewater lagoons. The buffer zone for ponds under 10,000 square feet shall extend 100 feet from the mean annual high-water or one-half of the distance from existing house foundation, whichever is smaller, but in no case shall the buffer zone include existing lawns, gardens, landscaped or developed areas. 
F. The	 term “rare species” shall include, without limitation, all vertebrate and invertebrate animal and plant species listed as endangered, threatened, or of special concern by the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife regardless of whether the site in which they occur has been previously identified by the Division. 
G. The term “person” shall include any individual, group of individuals, association, partnership, corporation, company, business organization, trust, estate, the Commonwealth or political subdivision thereof to the extent subject to town By-laws, administrative agency, public or quasi-public corporation or body, this municipality, 
May 21, 2018 	p. 93 Chapter 32 -6 
and any other legal entity, its legal representatives, agents, or assigns. 
H. The term 	“alter” shall include, without limitation, the following activities when undertaken to, upon, within or affecting resource areas protect by this By-law: 
1. 	
Removal, excavation, or dredging of soil, sand, gravel, or aggregate materials of any kind;

Any activities, changes, or work which may cause or tend to contribute to pollution of any body of water or ground water; 

11. 
Incremental activities which have or may have a cumulative adverse impact on the resource areas protected by this By-law. 


I. 	Except as otherwise provided in this By-law or in regulations of the Commission the definitions of terms in this By-law shall be as set determination, which may in an appropriate case be combined with a Certificate of Compliance issued under the Wetlands Protection Act.  A Certificate of Compliance may specify conditions in the permit, which will continue to apply for a fixed number of years or permanently and shall apply to all owners of the land. 
Section 10: Security As part of a permit issued under this By-law, in addition to any security required by any other municipal or state board, agency, or official, the Commission may require that the performance and observance of the conditions imposed thereunder (including conditions requiring mitigation work) be secured wholly or in part by a proper bond or deposit of money or negotiable securities or other undertaking of financial responsibility sufficient in the opinion of the Commission, to be released in whole or in part upon issuance of a Certificate of Compliance for work performed pursuant to the permit. 
May 21, 2018 	p. 94 Chapter 32 -7 
Section 11: Enforcement 
A. No person shall remove, fill, dredge, build upon, degrade, or otherwise alter resource areas and buffer zones protected by this By-law, or cause, suffer, or allow such activity, or leave in place unauthorized fill, or otherwise fail to restore illegally altered land to its original condition, or fail to comply with a permit or an enforcement order issued pursuant to this By-law. 
B. 	Where the Commission deems it necessary to carry out its duties under this By-law by entering privately owned land it shall do so with the authority of the property owner and shall be subject to the limitations imposed by the applicable federal and state laws. With the authority of the property owner or his/her designee the Commission may make or cause to be made such examinations, surveys, or sampling as the Commission deems necessary. 
C. 	The Commission shall have authority to enforce this By-law, its regulations, and permits issued thereunder by violation notices, administrative orders, and civil and criminal court actions.  Any person who violates provisions of this By-law may be ordered to restore the property to its original condition and take other action deemed necessary to remedy such violations, or may be fined, or both. 
D. Municipal boards and officers, including any police officer or other officer having police powers, shall have authority to assist the Commission in enforcement. 
E. 	Any person who violates any provision of this By-law, or regulations, permits, or administrative orders issued thereunder, shall be served with a Notice of Violation enumerating the alleged violations.  If after ten business days the Commission has not received what it deems to be either (a) sufficient evidence demonstrating that no violations have occurred, or (b) a filing that will remove the violations along with evidence that sufficient progress is being made to correct the violations, then the violator shall be punished by a fine of $100 per offense.  Beginning ten business days after the date of the Notice of Violation each day or portion thereof during which a violation continues, or unauthorized fill or other alteration remains in place, shall constitute a separate offense, and each provision of the By-law, regulations, permits, or administrative orders violated shall constitute a separate offense. 
F. As an alternative to criminal prosecution in a specific case, the Commission may issue citations under the non-criminal disposition procedure set forth in Massachusetts General Law, Ch. 40, § 21D. 
Section 12: Burden of Proof The applicant for a permit shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of credible evidence that the work proposed in the permit application will not have significant or cumulative negative effect upon the resource area values protected by this By-law.  Failure to provide evidence that in the judgment of the Commission is adequate to support this burden shall be sufficient cause for the Commission to deny a permit or grant a permit with conditions. 
Section 13:  Appeals A decision of the Commission shall be reviewable in the Superior Court in accordance with 
May 21, 2018 	p. 95 Chapter 32 -8

relevant part thereof, was adopted. Such prior, lawfully existing nonconforming uses and
structures may continue, provided that no modification of the use or structure is accomplished,
unless authorized hereunder.
5.1.2 Nonconforming Uses. The Board of Appeals may award a Special Permit to change a
nonconforming use in accordance with this section only if it determines that such change or
extension shall not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming use to the
neighborhood. The following types of changes to nonconforming uses may be considered by the
Board of Appeals:
1.Change or substantial extension of the use;
2.Change from one nonconforming use to another, less detrimental, nonconforming use.
5.1.3 Nonconforming Structures. The Board of Appeals may award a Special Permit to

areas, where the alteration will comply with all current setback, yard, building coverage
and building height requirements, or where the alteration increases the volume of the
nonconforming structure but does not increase the gross floor area of the nonconforming
nature of the structure.
If the Building Commissioner determines that no subsection referenced above applies or that
such proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change will increase the gross floor area
of the existing structure by more than 25%, the Board of Appeals may, by Special Permit, allow
such reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change where it determines that the proposed
modification will not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming
structure to the neighborhood. The extension of an exterior wall at or along the same
nonconforming distance within a required yard, shall require the issuance of a Special Permit
from the Board of Appeals.
5.1.6 Abandonment or Non-Use. A nonconforming use or structure which has been
abandoned, or not used for a period of two years, shall lose its protected status and be subject to

the gross floor area of the original nonconforming structure or (b) cause the structure to
be located other than on the original footprint, a Special Permit shall be required. In the
case of voluntary demolition. The Special Permit shall be obtained from the Board of
Appeals prior to such demolition.

months while the residence is being rebuilt. Any such manufactured home shall be subject to
the provisions of the state sanitary code.
7.5 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS AND FACILITIES
7.5.1 Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to establish general guidelines for the siting of
wireless telecommunication towers, antenna(s), satellite dishes greater than three (3) feet in
diameter, and appurtenant structures. The intent of this By-law is to 1) require the location of
towers on land in zoning districts other than residential or open space districts, and in areas
where the adverse impact on the community is minimal, 2) minimize the number and overall
height of towers in Maynard, 3) require the co-location of different telecommunication
companies’ antenna(s) on towers as much as possible, 4) encourage the siting of towers and
appurtenances to minimize their visibility to the public, including if possible location of
antenna(s) in or on existing buildings, 5) enhance the ability of the providers of
telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively
and efficiently, 6) prohibit satellite dishes greater than three (3) feet in diameter in residential
zones, and 7) to make available all wireless telecommunication towers and facilities to local
municipal agency use upon their request.
7.5.2 General Requirements. No wireless telecommunications facility, which shall include
towers of any type greater than twelve (12) feet in height, satellite dishes over three (3) feet in
diameter, antenna(s), panels, and appurtenant structures, shall be erected or installed except in
compliance with the provisions of this Section. The foregoing provision shall also apply to
antennas to be added to an existing tower, which specific antennas were not previously
approved during a Special Permit process. In all cases, a Special Permit is required from the
Planning Board in accordance with the requirements set forth herein. Granting of a Special
Permit is required prior to the approval of a Site Plan by the Planning Board.
1. Only free-standing towers not requiring guy wires for support are allowed.
2. Tower height shall be limited to the minimum height necessary, as determined from
objective technical evidence presented by the applicant. In all cases, tower height shall be
limited to less than the Federal Aviation Administration height limit beyond which lighting
would be required for the particular siting area proposed, or 125 feet, whichever is less,
except that a 190’ limitation, rather than a 125’ limitation shall apply for those buildings or
structures already in existence within the Town of Maynard on January 1, 2000. Any
PROTECTIVE ZONING BY-LAWS
Town of Maynard, Massachusetts
Zoning as Amended through May 20, 2019
Page | 35
Additional height added to an existing structure above 125’ will be considered a new
structure.
3. Wireless telecommunications facilities shall be located zoning districts other than
residential or open space zoning districts, and shall be suitably screened from abutters and
residential neighborhoods. Towers may be allowed on a lot as an accessory use to a main
building, however no more than one tower may be sited on any parcel of land.
4. There shall be a presumption by the SPGA that the applicant’s service can be provided by
location of antenna(s) in or on existing buildings or structures. This presumption may be rebuttable
by hard evidence to the contrary that such location is not feasible.
5. When utilizing existing buildings or structures for antenna(s) location, antenna(s) shall,
wherever possible, be enclosed within an existing structure such as a church steeple or
clock tower. Antenna(s) may only be placed on the exterior of existing buildings or
structures upon the determination by the SPGA that placement within existing buildings or
structures is not feasible, and that the placement of such antenna(s) does not materially
detract from the historic value or traditional view of buildings or structures in the vicinity.
The height limit imposed by Section 7.5.2.2 above shall also apply to antenna(s) placed on
existing buildings and structures, and shall be measured from the lowest ground elevation
adjacent to the existing building or structure.
6. There shall be a presumption by the SPGA that co-location of multiple service providers
now seeking, or anticipated to be seeking a tower location within the next 3 years within 2
miles of the proposed site, is possible and will be included in any Special Permit
application. This presumption may be re-buttable by hard evidence to the contrary that
such co-location is not feasible. Once a Special Permit has been granted, in the interest of
not burdening the public process, no application for an additional tower on any portion of
the site in question will be accepted until a period of three years has elapsed from the
granting of the Special Permit.
7. All wireless telecommunications facilities shall comply with all applicable standards
and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), the American National Standards Institute, the Massachusetts
Aeronautics Commission, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. The
Special Permit Granting Authority (SPGA) may require annual certification demonstrating
continuing compliance with regulations and requirements of any or all of the above
regulatory agencies as a condition of the Special Permit.
7.5.3 Design Requirements
1. All towers shall be designed to have sufficient structural capacity to support antenna
arrays for a minimum of 3 separate wireless telecommunications companies.
PROTECTIVE ZONING BY-LAWS
Town of Maynard, Massachusetts
Zoning as Amended through May 20, 2019
Page | 36
2. Any tower shall be set back from any lot line by a minimum distance equal to the
height of the tower above the lowest surrounding grade, but in no case less than the
minimum required setbacks for the district in which it is situated. Appurtenant structures
shall also conform to the minimum required set backs for the district in which the
facility is located.
3. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.5.3.2, facilities shall be sited such that, at
a minimum, a 50 foot undisturbed buffer zone is provided between the nearest edge of
the fencing surrounding the facility and any abutting property line.
4. Lighting at all wireless telecommunication facilities shall be limited to low intensity
lighting intended for security purposes and installed at or near ground level. The
source for such lighting shall not be directly visible from any residential property in the
area of the site.
5. Fencing shall be provided to control unauthorized access to the tower. Such fencing
shall not be of the barbed wire or razor wire type, but shall be a minimum of 8 feet in
height with an added section of anti climber returning to the exterior. Said fencing
shall be appropriately screened and colored to blend in with the surrounding
landscape.
6. Towers shall be colored so as to blend in with the surrounding landscape, including
different colors to cause the structures to blend with the landscape below the tree-line
horizon, and the sky above the tree-line horizon. The SPGA may impose reasonable
conditions to ensure the facility will have the minimal impact on the surrounding
neighborhood, visually and from noise generated by it. Conditions may include
grading, screening by plantings and otherwise, and painting, as well as increased
setbacks if noise from the facility is a concern, which in the sole opinion of the SPGA,
is not adequately addressed by the applicant.
7. Access to the tower site shall be provided by a driveway designed to cause only
minimal disturbance to the natural terrain, and provide emergency access at all times, the
adequacy of which shall be determined by emergency services personnel and the SPGA.
Wherever beneficial in the opinion of the SPGA, said access driveway shall be laid out
so as to have sufficient turns to prevent passers-by from having direct line-of-sight
visibility to the facility.
8. There shall be no signs, except for no trespassing signs discreetly placed, and a
required sign giving a phone number where the owner or legal operator of the facility can
be reached on a 24-hour basis. All signs shall conform with the sign requirements of
this By-law, and shall be the minimum size necessary in the opinion of the SPGA to
accomplish the purpose of the sign.
9. The height of satellite dishes (greater than three (3) feet in diameter as regulated under
PROTECTIVE ZONING BY-LAWS
Town of Maynard, Massachusetts
Zoning as Amended through May 20, 2019
Page | 37
this By-law) located on property abutting property(s) upon which residential structures
are sited, shall not exceed the height of the tree-line on the lot, and shall not be visible
from any street.
10. There shall be one parking space only for each tower site to be used solely in
connection with maintenance of the facility, and not to be used for the permanent
storage of vehicles or other equipment.
11. There shall be only one building allowed to be constructed at the base of the tower,
and it shall be for the purpose of housing the necessary support equipment for the tower
transmission and receiving antenna(s). Said building shall be no higher than 12 feet
above the surrounding grade to its highest point, shall have a peaked roof (minimum 6
Vertical:12 Horizontal pitch) and architectural features consistent with the zoning
district and with surrounding existing buildings, shall have a maximum footprint of
400 square feet, and shall be screened from abutting properties as much as is feasible in
the opinion of the SPGA and/or the Planning Board. Multiple story buildings are
permitted only if additional stories are below grade.
12. All network interconnections and other support equipment required to be sheltered
shall be contained within the single support building allowed at the base of the tower.
Other equipment shall be shown on the site plan, and may be subject to conditions or
being placed within the support building. This determination shall be made by the
SPGA based upon individual site conditions and the ability of the exterior equipment to
be screened from abutting properties. The intent is to minimize visible clutter at the
base of the tower to the maximum extent possible.
7.5.4 Amateur Facilities. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to prohibit the
construction or use of an amateur radio tower or facility by a federally licensed amateur radio
operator provided that (1) the tower is not used or licensed for any commercial purpose; and (2)
the tower must be removed if its use is discontinued for a period exceeding six (6) months.
7.5.5 Independent Review. If the SPGA determines that independent review of the Special
Permit is required, it may require the applicant to pay a review fee consisting of reasonable

upon their request.
7.5.8 On-Site Demonstration. The SPGA may require the applicant to perform an on-site
demonstration of the visibility of the proposed tower by means of a crane with a mock antenna
array raised to the maximum height of the proposed tower. A colored 4’ minimum diameter
weather balloon held in place at the proposed site and maximum height of the tower may be
substituted for the crane if approved by the SPGA. This demonstration shall take place after
the application for Special Permit has been made, but prior to the close of the public hearing on
said Special Permit. The applicant shall take care to advertise the date of the demonstration in a
newspaper widely circulated in the neighborhood of the proposed site. Failure, in the opinion of
the SPGA, to adequately advertise this demonstration may be cause for the SPGA to require
another, properly advertised demonstration.
7.5.9 Approval Criteria. In lieu of the criteria set forth in Section 10.4, the SPGA shall
grant the Special Permit only upon finding that the wireless telecommunications facility
proposed:
1. Has been adequately described and justified to the SPGA by the applicant’s
compliance with the requirements of this Section.
2. Will not be unreasonably detrimental or injurious, in the opinion of the SPGA to the
neighborhood in which it is to be located;

operating in the area to the maximum extent possible, and shall incorporate a tower
capable of accommodating a minimum of 3 separate antenna arrays (although
appurtenant buildings may be constructed for only those users identified in the
application for Special Permit); this requirement may be waived by the SPGA only
upon a finding that for the particular site in question, said requirement is contrary to the
public interest.
6. Due to technical requirements, topography or other unique constraints, the facility
cannot be located at any other available site that would be less visible to the general
public.
7. Has been demonstrated by technical data to be necessary due to the inability of
existing facilities in the same or similar service area to accommodate the further
antenna arrays required at the time of the application.
7.5.10 Cessation of Use. Facilities shall be removed upon cessation of use, at the sole expense
of the owner(s) of the facility. Use of the facility shall be determined to have ceased when it has
not been in use for a period of 12 continuous months, or for a total of 18 of the last 30 months.
Records shall be submitted to the SPGA annually indicating the usage of the facility over the
previous 12 months, and its current operational status. Such information shall be a condition of
the Special Permit.
7.5.11 Performance Guarantees. It shall be the joint and several responsibility of the Special
Permit applicant and any subsequent owners of the facility to completely remove the tower,
antenna(s), satellite dish(es), panels, and all appurtenant structures upon cessation of use of the
facility, and to restore the site to its pre-construction condition. An initial cash bond shall be
posted in a passbook account in a reasonable amount determined and approved by the SPGA
to assure timely and complete removal of all above ground structures associated with the
facility when the use of the facility is discontinued. The tower and appurtenances shall be
removed within 90 days of written request from the SPGA to the current facility owner,
beyond which time the SPGA may utilize the posted bond to effect the removal of all above
ground structures associated with the facility, and the restoration of the site to its original
grades with a permanently stable landscaped surface.
1. The applicant shall submit a bid for the removal of the facility from three (3) qualified
contractors at the time of initial Special Permit Application. The SPGA may use these
bids at its discretion to set the removal bond amount.
2. It shall be the responsibility of the current owner of the facility to maintain the entire
facility and its access road and screening in a condition equivalent to that when
construction was initially completed to the satisfaction of the SPGA. Therefore, a
maintenance agreement between the applicant, or a designated operator, and the SPGA,

Town of Maynard, Massachusetts
Zoning as Amended through May 20, 2019
Page | 41
shall be executed which defines the terms of and responsibility for the maintenance as
required by the SPGA. Said agreement shall constitute a condition of the Special
Permit. An additional bond shall be posted, in the form of a separate passbook account
in an amount to be set by the SPGA, to be utilized for maintenance of the facility and its
access road and screening in the event the maintenance agreement to be executed
between the SPGA and the applicant is not complied with to the on-going satisfaction of
the SPGA.
7.5.12 Term. A Special Permit granted under this By-law shall expire within 2 years of the date
of issuance of the permit. Prior to the expiration of the Special Permit, the applicant shall make
application to the SPGA for renewal of the Special Permit for an additional 2 year period. Said
renewal shall not require the technical submissions of the original application, provided that
conditions of the site and facility have not changed materially from the original application. A
certification by a Structural Engineer licensed in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as to the
condition and structural integrity of the tower and its antennas shall accompany every
application for renewal.
7.5.13 Site Plan Approval. Site Plan Approval by the Planning Board is required for the
siting and construction of all wireless telecommunication facilities. If modification of a
previously issued special permit is sought, the Planning Board may require approval of a new
site plan.
Site Plan review by the Planning Board may be conducted concurrently with the proceedings
and public hearings of the Special Permit application. Site Plan applications shall be made in
conformance with Section 10.5, and in conformance with the Site Plan Review Regulations
adopted by the Planning Board.
7.6 KENNELS
7.6.1 Special Permit. The Board of Appeals may grant a Special Permit allowing a private
kennel. In granting the special permit, the Board of Appeals shall consider the adequacy of
shelter and exercise space for the kennel, as well as security (both of the dogs from escape, as
well as preventing access by children) and the control of noise, smells, dust, and other
emissions. Accessory kennel buildings may not be located on any lot between the street lot line

7.10 INCLUSIONARY HOUSING 222, 224
7.10.1 Purpose and Intent
The purpose of this Inclusionary Housing bylaw is to expand and diversify the Town of
Maynard’s housing stock; to encourage development of new housing that is affordable to low- and
moderate-income households in Maynard; and to produce affordable housing units that are
adaptable and accessible to seniors and those with physical disabilities.
At minimum, affordable housing produced through this regulation should be in compliance with
the requirements set forth in G.L. c. 40B sect. 20-24, except as provided herein, and other
affordable housing programs developed by state, county and local governments. It is intended that
the affordable housing units that result from this bylaw be considered as Local Initiative Units, in
compliance with the requirements for the same as specified by the Department of Housing and
Community Development (DHCD). Definitions pertaining to this section can be found in the
Definitions portion of this Bylaw (Section 7.9.11).
7.10.2 Applicability
1. §7.9 applies to any subdivision or development, whether new construction, conversion,
adaptive reuse or expansion of an existing structure, involving the creation of at least six (6)
dwelling units. It applies to all residential dwelling types as defined by the Maynard Zoning
Bylaw with the exception of assisted living residences/facilities, independent living
residences, and continuing care retirement communities as defined in Section 7.9.11 of the
Zoning By-laws.
A subdivision or division of land shall mean any subdivision as defined in the Subdivision
Control Law, G.L. c.41, §81K-81GG, or any division of land under G.L. c.41, §81P, into
lots for residential use.
Developments may not be segmented or phased to avoid compliance with this Section. Any
segmentation on a single parcel shall be subject to this Section as a covered development
and completed within a five-year period. An extension shall require Planning Board
approval.
2. §7.9 does not apply to the rehabilitation of any building or structure, all of or substantially
all of which is destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty or a natural disaster;
provided, however, no rehabilitation nor repair shall increase the density, bulk or size of
any such building or structure which previously existed prior to the damage or destruction
thereof except in conformance with this Section.
3. No special permit for a development requiring a special permit and no building permit for a
use permitted as of right shall be issued for a development subject to §7.9 unless the
applicant provides the percentage of the total dwelling units in the development as
PROTECTIVE ZONING BY-LAWS
Town of Maynard, Massachusetts
Zoning as Amended through May 20, 2019
Page | 45
affordable housing as described herein.
7.10.3 Special Permit
Development pursuant to this Section shall be allowed as of right if the required affordable housing
is provided on-site. Alternatively, if the applicant provides the affordable housing off-site or makes
a payment-in-lieu of developing units, the project will require a special permit to be issued by the
Planning Board. A special permit will also be required for development under §7.9.4.3 Density
Bonus.
7.10.4 Mandatory Provision of Affordable Units
1. Affordable housing requirement. As a condition of development, the applicant shall
contribute to the local stock of affordable housing in accordance with the following
requirements:
a. In any development subject to this Section, at least ten (10) percent of the dwelling
units shall be affordable to households with incomes at 80% of Area Median
Income (AMI) or below. The percentage of affordable housing units required will
increase with the total size of a given residential project, inclusive of bonus units,
as described in the following table, “Affordable Units Required by Project Size”:
Affordable Units Required by Project Size
Project Size
(Units)
Percent Affordable Units
(Ownership Project)
Percent Affordable
Units (Rental Project)
6-12 10% 10%
13-17 12% 12%
18-20 15% 25%
21 and over 20% 25%
b. In the event that the applicant provides units for households earning between 30%
and 60% of AMI, the Planning Board may count them as 1.2 affordable units each
and reduce by special permit the total number of affordable units required by this
Section. However, the total number required shall not be reduced to fewer than
10% of the project size.
c. Nothing in this Section shall preclude the applicant from providing additional
affordable units, or greater affordability, or both, than the minimum requirements.
In no instance shall any permit or special permit approval create less than one
affordable housing unit.
2. Fractions. For any fractional housing units the applicant shall have the choice to round up
to the next whole number or convert to a cash payment equal to the product of the fraction
PROTECTIVE ZONING BY-LAWS
Town of Maynard, Massachusetts
Zoning as Amended through May 20, 2019
Page | 46
multiplied by the cash contribution for a whole affordable housing unit as specified in
7.9.5.2.b below.
3. Density Bonus.
a. The Planning Board may allow an increase in the total number of market-rate units
by a number equal to the required affordable unit(s), not to exceed 10 bonus units.
The minimum lot area per dwelling unit normally required in the applicable zoning
district may be reduced by that amount necessary to permit the additional market
rate and bonus units. For example, in a development that must provide two (2)
affordable units, an additional two (2) market-rate units may be allowed through
the reduction in minimum lot area per dwelling unit. All other Standard
Dimensional Requirements in §4.1.1.1 shall be met. The density bonus may only
be granted for developments that provide affordable units on-site pursuant to
Subsection 7.9.5, below.
b. New residential development allowed by right that is not subject to this bylaw can
provide affordable units should the applicant volunteer, and therefore be eligible
for the same benefits specified above.
c. Projects where the applicant chooses to convert a fractional unit(s) to a cash
payment per Subsection 7.9.4.2 are eligible for density bonus.
d. No density bonus shall be granted when the requirements of this Section are met
with a payment-in-lieu-of units pursuant to Subsection 7.9.5.2.b, below.
e. The development must be of a use allowed in the district. For example, multifamily
housing shall not be constructed under this provision on lots zoned for single
family housing.
4. Affordable Units shall be provided as occupiable in accordance with the timing of
compliance schedule set forth in Section 7.9.6.4.
7.10.5 Methods of Providing Affordable Housing Units
1. On-site units. If the affordable housing requirements of this section are met exclusively
through on-site construction or provision, development shall be permitted as of right.
2. The Planning Board may grant a special permit for one or more of the following methods.
a. Off-site units. Construction or provision of comparable affordable units on another
site in Maynard. All requirements of this Section that apply to on-site provision of
affordable units shall apply to provision of off-site affordable units.
i. The applicant shall provide a demonstration of the following: necessary
financing to complete the off-site units, control of the site, that the site
meets Site Plan Review standards, that the plan includes an architect’s
PROTECTIVE ZONING BY-LAWS
Town of Maynard, Massachusetts
Zoning as Amended through May 20, 2019
Page | 47
conceptual site plan with unit designs and architectural elevations, and
agreement that the off-site units will comply with this Section.
ii. Preservation of existing dwelling units for affordable housing, rather than
construction of off-site units, may be accomplished by purchasing deed
restrictions and providing funds for capital improvements to create housing
with equal or greater value than new-construction units.
iii. The location of the off-site units to be provided shall be approved by the
Planning Board as an integral element of the review and approval process.
b. Payment in lieu of units. As an alternative to construction of affordable units within
the locus of the proposed development or at another locus, an equivalent payment
in lieu of units (PILU) may be made to the Maynard Affordable Housing Trust
Fund.
i. The payment shall be an amount equal to the required number of affordable
housing units multiplied by the median price of a Maynard market-rate
home comparable in type, size, and number of bedrooms reported for a
minimum of three (3) home sales over a period of twelve (12) months prior
to the date of application submission, if available. Median home cost
utilized in the formula must be approved by the Maynard Affordable
Housing Trust, or designee. The applicant shall calculate the proposed sum
based on an appraisal of the comparable home sales and submit
documentation of the relevant data source(s) as part of the application.
ii. If there is not a comparable housing unit, the payment shall be equal to the
most current Total Development Cost as articulated in DHCD’s Qualified
Allocation Plan for Low Income Housing Tax Credit, for the areas
described as Within Metro Boston/Suburban Area, as adjusted for the type
of project and number of units.
iii. PILU shall not be accepted as part of rental development, either multifamily
or mixed-use.
iv. PILU shall be made according to the timing of compliance schedule set
forth in Subsection 7.9.6.4 herein.
v. Cash contributions made to the Maynard Affordable Housing Trust Fund in
accordance with this Section shall be used only for purposes of providing
for the creation and preservation of affordable housing for low- and
moderate-income household in accordance with the municipal Declaration
of Trust and action, strategic, or other plan, as well as the Municipal
Affordable Housing Trust Fund Law G.L. c. 44 § 55C, as it may be
amended.

3. In no event shall the total number or value of off-site units or cash payments provided be
less than the equivalent number or value of affordable housing units that could be built onsite
pursuant to Subsection 7.9.4.1, above.
7.10.6 Provisions Applicable to Affordable Housing Units, On- and Off-Site, and PILU
1. Unit mix.
a. The bedroom mix in the affordable units shall be proportionate to the market-rate
units.
b. In any residential project where more than ten (10) affordable units will be built, a
minimum of ten (10) percent of the affordable units shall have three (3) bedrooms.
Fractional affordable units of 0.5 or more shall be rounded up; fractions of less
than 0.5 shall be rounded down. This requirement is subject to the provisions of
Section 7.9.4.2 of this bylaw.
2. Siting of affordable units. On-site affordable units constructed or otherwise provided under
this Section shall be proportionately distributed throughout the project in terms of both
location and unit size/type. For example, a development consisting of a mix of singlefamily
homes, townhouses, and a small apartment building shall include affordable units
of each housing type. Affordable units shall also be as accessible to common amenities as
the market-rate units in the same development.
a. The special permit application shall include a plan showing the proposed location
of the affordable housing units.
b. When a special permit is not required, the location of the affordable housing units
shall be identified on plans submitted to the Town for any other required permit.
3. Minimum design and construction standards. Materials of affordable units shall be equal to
that of market-rate units within the development. Units shall comply with the Local
Initiative Program’s (LIP) minimum design and construction standards as they may be
amended.
a. The exterior of affordable units shall be comparable to the market-rate units in
terms of design, appearance, quality of construction, and quality of materials.
b. Interior features of affordable units shall be comparable to the standard package for
market-rate units, though designer and high-end finishes, fixtures, and appliances
are not required.
c. Mechanical systems and energy efficiency shall conform to the same specifications
as apply to the market-rate units.

d. Affordable units shall have the same floor area as the median market-rate units of
the same number of bedrooms.
4. Timing of construction of affordable units and payment made. On and off-site affordable
units or payment in lieu of units shall be provided in proportion to market-rate units, but in
no event shall the construction of affordable housing units or PILU be delayed beyond the
schedule indicated below by the table, “Timing of Construction of Affordable Units.”
Proportionality shall be determined by the number of certificates of occupancy issued for
affordable and market-rate units, or lot releases, as applicable. In accordance with the table
below, affordable units shall not be the last units to be built in any development that is
subject to §7.9.
Timing of Construction of Affordable Units
Percent Market-Rate
Units Constructed
Required Affordable Units Constructed or Payment
Up to 30% None
31% -50% The greater of 1 unit or 10% of required units or payment

Over 90% 100% of required units or payment
5. Marketing plan for affordable units. Applicants creating new affordable units under this
Section are required to select qualified homebuyers or renters via lottery under an
Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan prepared and submitted by the applicant and
approved by the Planning Board and DHCD. The marketing plan shall comply with federal
and state fair housing laws and guidelines in effect on the date of filing of the special
permit or other permit application with the Town of Maynard. No building permit for a
development subject to §7.9 shall be issued unless the Planning Division of Maynard has
determined that the applicant’s affirmative marketing plan complies with this requirement.
The affirmative marketing costs for the affordable housing units shall be the responsibility
of the applicant.
7.10.7 Maximum Incomes and Selling Prices: Initial Sale
1. To ensure that only income-eligible households purchase affordable housing units,
prospective homebuyers shall be required to submit to the lottery monitoring agent the
information needed to demonstrate that they meet the applicable requirements found in the
DHCD LIP guidelines, as may be revised from time to time.
2. The maximum housing cost for affordable units created under this Section is established by
DHCD LIP guidelines or by the Maynard Affordable Housing Trust, whichever is greater.

7.10.8 Preservation of Affordability
1. As a condition of development, all affordable housing units provided under §7.9 shall be
subject to an affordable housing restriction in a form consistent with LIP or any other
applicable guidelines issued by DHCD, acceptable to the Planning Board, and that ensures
affordable units can be counted toward Maynard’s Subsidized Housing Inventory. The

9.3 NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS OVERLAY DISTRICT (NBOD)
193
9.3.1 Purpose. The Neighborhood Business Overlay District (NBOD) is established:
1. To encourage and authorize the mixed-use development of large land areas by means of
authorizing and combining a variety of building types and uses with conditions and
safeguards; and
2. To prevent detrimental effects and impacts upon neighboring land uses and upon the
Town of Maynard.
9.3.2 Applicability. The NBOD is an overlay district superimposed over, rather than replacing,
the applicable underlying zoning district(s). Upon receipt of a special permit from the
Planning Board, the NBOD authorizes certain uses and structures not otherwise permitted in
the underlying district(s). Where the NBOD authorizes uses or structures not otherwise
allowed in the underlying district(s), the provisions of the NBOD shall control.
9.3.3 Requirement for Approval of a Concept Plan at Town Meeting. No construction or
activity for a structure or use not otherwise permitted in the underlying zoning district(s) shall
be permitted on any land within the NBOD without first obtaining approval, by a majority
vote of Maynard Town Meeting, of a Concept Plan that identifies the proposed development
and uses and structures proposed therein. At the property owner’s discretion, one or more
Concept Plans may be submitted at different times and a Concept Plan may include
development of all, or any smaller portion, of the relevant parcel or lot. Each Concept Plan
submitted for approval at Town Meeting shall include the following information:
1. The area of land proposed to be developed under the NBOD regulations, which may be
less than the total area of the applicable lot.
2. The topography of the land to be developed.
3. The location of wetlands and water bodies, if any.
4. The location of existing roads and ways serving the land to be developed.
5. The general location, size and shape of existing structures to be removed, and the general
location, size and shape of existing structures to remain.
6. The general location and size of all required buffer areas provided in compliance with
Section 9.3.12.3.
7. The general location, general use and approximate size of all proposed new buildings
including the proposed general use within said new buildings; the final size of each
PROTECTIVE ZONING BY-LAWS
Town of Maynard, Massachusetts
Zoning as Amended through May 20, 2019
Page | 65
proposed new building to be determined via the Town’s site plan review process and shall
not exceed the dimensional requirements in Table G, below.
8. Examples of amenities and design features to be included as part of the proposed
development, including but not limited to, the proposed location, number, size, type,
appearance and lighting for, on and off premises signs relating to and serving the proposed
development.
9. Illustrations of the general architecture of the proposed structures.
10. A preliminary traffic impact analysis.
11. A written proposal from the applicant or its agents (“Applicant”) that addresses, but is not
limited to, the following:
a. Proposed contribution to the Town of Maynard, including but not limited to proposed
improvements to public facilities, public infrastructure, gifts of land, including
easement rights, grant of financial resources to offset anticipated development impacts
and other proposals to mitigate development impacts ;
b. Payment for consultant review of plans and documents accompanying the Concept
Plan pursuant to G.L. c.44, s.53G; and
c. Assurances for continuing obligations should the applicant assign all or some of its
rights in the proposed development.
Such proposal shall be incorporated into the terms of a binding development agreement,
which may include any other lawful provisions negotiated between the Applicant and the
Town of Maynard acting by and through the Board of Selectmen and the Planning Board, said
provisions to be specifically attributable to projected impacts from the proposed development
upon the surrounding neighborhood, the Town of Maynard and the region. The execution of
said development agreement is a condition precedent to final site plan approval by the
Planning Board (see Section 10.5 of the Zoning Bylaw).
9.3.4 Application for Permits. Following approval of a Concept Plan at Town Meeting as
provided in Section 9.3.3., the Applicant shall be entitled to apply for any other permits and
approvals required for all or any portion of the development shown on the Concept Plan,
including, without limitation, site plan review.

maximum of four (4) stories. No structure greater than forty (40) feet shall be constructed
closer than three (300) hundred feet to any residential zoning district or closer than one
thousand (1,000) feet to any State numbered roadway.
9.3.11 Housing Cap. The maximum number of dwelling units in the NBOD shall not exceed one
hundred eighty (180) regardless of the permitting mechanism used to construct said dwelling
units. For up to and including 175 dwelling units no fewer than seventeen (17) of the
dwelling units constructed within the NBOD shall be made available for sale or rent, for the
longest period permitted by law, to individuals or families earning less than eighty percent
(80%) of the median income of Maynard, as that figure is determined from time to time by the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts (“affordable unit”) All additional dwelling units greater
than 175 shall be affordable units. Notwithstanding, this cap shall not include those dwelling
units permitted pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section 9.3 et seq. as senior housing,
nursing/convalescent homes, assisted living residences and any dwellings associated with a
continuing care retirement or independent living community.
9.3.12 Site Plan Approval. The provisions of Section 10.5, Site Plan Approval, shall apply to all
uses, buildings and structures permitted by right or by special permit in the NBOD. All
structures and uses permitted pursuant to the NBOD shall be subject to Site Plan Approval
from the Planning Board. The Planning Board may not issue such approval unless the
proposed Site Plan substantially conforms to the Concept Plan approved by Town Meeting.
The Planning Board may permit minor modifications to the proposed development in
connection with its site plan review, provided that the Planning Board finds, in its reasonable
discretion and in writing, that any such modifications do not materially conflict with the
general intent of the Concept Plan as approved. In addition to the requirements contained in
Section 10.5 of the Zoning By-law, applications for Site Plan Approval shall ensure
compliance with the following requirements:
1. Lighting.
a. All lighting installations shall be designed to achieve no greater than the minimum

established by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA);
b. To prevent glare on off-site locations, all outdoor lighting fixtures shall be full cutoff
(Full-cutoff means that no light is emitted above the horizontal plane that
intersects the lowest part of the fixture). Where necessary to prevent light or glare,
accessories such as hoods and shields shall be used on lighting fixtures. The source
of light shall be so arranged and shielded as to prevent direct glare from the light
source into any public street or onto adjacent property;
c. Security lighting shall be shielded and directed at a downward angle.

(100) feet shall be provided at the perimeter of every lot or parcel in the
NBOD where it abuts the property line of any residentially zoned or occupied
properties, except for fences twelve (12) feet in height or less and driveways necessary
for access and egress to and from the new building(s); provided, however, that existing
structures and existing access roadways and paved areas are exempt from this
requirement. Notwithstanding the preceding, existing structures and paved areas shall
not be made more non-conforming except for American with Disabilities Act (ADA)
compliance. A buffer area of forty-five feet (45) shall be provided where the property
line of any land within the NBOD is contiguous to the property line of another lot
within an existing residential district. The buffer shall be landscaped and screened by
way of fences, walls, and/or plantings (including existing vegetation and trees) to
reasonably and substantially shield abutting land from parking and loading areas and
buildings. Any such fences or walls may, in the reasonable determination of the
Planning Board, provide openings to allow safe pedestrian access and egress between
the development site and the adjacent neighborhood.
4. Parking. Required parking shall be four (4) spaces per one thousand (1,000) square
feet of gross floor area for retail and supermarket uses. For outdoor sales and display
areas of a Garden Center uses, required parking shall be one space per three thousand
(3,000) square feet of outside merchandise display area. For all other allowed uses,
the parking requirement for such use shall be in accordance with the schedule of
parking uses set forth in Section 6.1 of the Zoning By-law.
9.3.13 Signage. On and off premises signs relating to development and uses within an NBOD shall
be as approved by Town Meeting pursuant to Section 9.3.3.8, above. Thereafter, revisions to
the placement, number and lighting of wall signs only may be approved by the Planning
Board pursuant to Section 9.3.7 or 9.3.12, as applicable, where, and only where, the Concept
Plan approved by Town Meeting does not contain sufficient details or where the details of the
Concept Plan are proposed for insubstantial revision. For the purposes of this Section,
“insubstantial revision” shall mean revisions to the sign component of the Concept Plan as it
relates to the placement, number and lighting of wall signs only within the NBOD. In no
event, shall the Planning Board approve any revision to signs placed at the NBOD
entranceway(s)—so called “pylon” or “freestanding” signs.
9.3.14 Definitions for NBOD Uses. Definitions not contained within this Section shall utilize the
definitions found within Section 11.0 of the Zoning By-law.

front facade.
9.4.2 Applicability. The DOD is an overlay district superimposed on the included portions of the
underlying zoning districts. All use allowances, definitions, regulations and standards of the
underlying zoning district shall apply within the DOD except where specifically modified or
supplemented by this section. Where the DOD varies dimensional or other requirements otherwise
set forth in this Zoning By-Law, the terms and conditions of the DOD shall control.
9.4.2.1 Special Permit Granting Authority (SPGA). For the purposes of this Section, unless
otherwise noted, the Planning Board shall be the Special Permit Granting Authority 225.
9.4.3 Permitted and Prohibited Uses. In addition to the uses permitted in the underlying
district (see Table A), the following uses are permitted:

9.4.5 Mixed Use and Multifamily Reduced Area Requirement; Development Agreement. In
order to provide maximum flexibility to prospective developers while ensuring sufficient
safeguards for the Town, a Special Permit may be issued by the SPGA to reduce the minimum lot
requirement for multi-family and mixed use to a minimum of eight-hundred (800) sq. ft. per
residential unit if and only if an executed Development Agreement between the Developer and
The Town of Maynard acting by and through the Board of Selectmen and the Planning Board.
The development agreement shall include all of the following:
1. Agreement from the developer to include in the development a number of “affordable”
units equal to or greater than 15% of the total number of units in the development, rounded
up to the nearest whole unit or an agreement from the developer to make a donation to the
“Maynard Affordable Housing Trust” (or any equivalent town fund or account which is
dedicated to the development of “affordable” housing stock) equal in value to the whole
number of affordable units, multiplied by the “affordable unit equivalent” (in dollars). This
“affordable unit equivalent” shall be determined by the Affordable Housing Trust, or in the
absence of such a Trust, by the Board of Selectmen. This does not preclude the applicability
of the Town’s Inclusionary Zoning By-law. If the development is subject to the Inclusionary
Zoning By-law, the most restrictive of the requirements shall apply. 229
2. Agreement from the Developer to make a donation to the Maynard Community
Preservation Fund, or other equivalent town fund or account dedicated to the acquisition and
PROTECTIVE ZONING BY-LAWS

9.4.6 Special Permit Criteria. The SPGA shall apply the following review criteria in addition to
the criteria identified in Section 10.4 of this By-law:
1. The proposal constitutes a high quality development with regards to construction
materials, architectural design, and site design, which will enhance the downtown and the
immediate neighborhood and provide significant benefit to the residents of the Town of

one of the following means:
a. Provide a significant improvement to the usage and/or number of public parking
spaces in the downtown area;
b. Provide a significant improvement to the effectiveness of the parking space
allocation of the downtown area;
c. Provide a significant improvement to the pedestrian experience in downtown
Maynard;
d. Provide a significant improvement to the water quality of current storm water
runoff reaching the Assabet River;
e. Increase views and access to the Assabet River;

9.4.7 Special Permits for Minimum Building Height. While increased density is one of the goals
of the DOD, situations may arise in which development of multi-story structures may not be
practical. In such cases, an applicant may request relief from the minimum building height as
identified within this section through a Special Permit. In evaluating the Special Permit request,
The SPGA shall use the following review criteria in addition to the criteria identified in Section
10.4 of this By-law:
1. Ability of the reduced height development to fit within the surrounding streetscape.
2. That the single story building proposed is the only reasonable, practicable alternative
for development of the site in question. Alternatives need not be economically equivalent.
3. That there are circumstances particular to the site in question that do not apply to the
neighborhood in general.
4. That adherence to the By-law requirement for a multi-storied building will impose
unreasonable hardship on the development of the site and its owners.
5. The proposed development purpose is an allowed use in the underlying district and/or
the overlay district, and could not be accomplished with a multi-story structure.
9.4.9 Parking Standards within the DOD. Parking requirements in the DOD are designed to
allow existing first floor uses to meet their parking requirements based on non-contracted use of
existing public parking in the downtown and to acknowledge that shared parking solutions work
well in downtowns where users typically will visit multiple destinations within walking distance
of each other.
1. First Floor Rehabilitation Credit. The rehabilitation of the 1st floor of any preexisting
(prior to the adoption of the DOD on May 22nd, 2007) structure whose previous and
proposed new use are non-residential is exempt from minimum parking space
requirements. The expansion of the 1st floor of said structure by less than five hundred
(500) square feet (s.f.) of gross floor area (g.f.a.) is also exempt from minimum parking
requirements. For expansions greater than or equal to five hundred (500) s.f. of g.f.a.,

PURPOSE (Section 81-M of Chapter 41, Massachusetts General Law) 
“The subdivision control law has been enacted for the purpose of protecting the safety, conven­ience and welfare of the inhabitants of the cities and towns in which it is, or may hereafter be, put in effect by regulating the laying out and construction of ways in subdivisions providing access to the several lots therein, but which have not become public ways, and ensuring sanitary conditions in subdivisions and in proper cases parks and open areas.  The powers of a planning board and of a board of appeal under the subdivision control law shall be exercised with due regard for the provision of adequate access to all of the lots in a subdivision by ways that will be safe and con­venient for travel; for lessening congestion in such ways and in the adjacent public ways; for re­ducing danger to life and limb in the operation of motor vehicles; for securing safety in the case of fire, flood, panic and other emergencies; for ensuring compliance with the applicable zoning ordinances or by-laws; for securing adequate provisions for water, sewerage, drainage, under­ground utility services, fire, police, and other similar municipal equipment, and street lighting and other requirements where necessary in a subdivision; and for coordinating the ways in neighbor­ing subdivisions. Such powers may also be exercised with due regard for the policy of the Com­monwealth to encourage the use of solar energy, and protect the access to direct sunlight of solar energy systems.  It is the intent of the subdivision control law that any subdivision plan filed with the planning board shall receive the approval of such board if said plan conforms to the recom­mendation of the board of health and to the reasonable rules and regulations of the planning board pertaining to subdivision of land, provide, however, that such board may, when appropriate, waive, as provided for in Section Eighty-One R ((81-R) of Chapter 41 Massachusetts General Laws), such portions of the rules and regulations as is deemed advisable.” 
SECTION I. AUTHORITY 
Under the authority vested in the Planning Board in the Town of Maynard by Section 81-Q of Chapter 41 of the Massachusetts General Laws, as amended, the Maynard Planning Board hereby adopts these rules and regulations governing the subdivision of land in the Town of Maynard ef­fective on and after August 23, 1988, as amended.

2. 	Review Fees (M.G.L. Ch.44 S.53G) 
A. 	When reviewing an application for subdivision approval, the Board        requires that the applicants pay a “review fee” to provide for the        assistance of outside engineering, planning, and other consultants.  This        “review fee” consists of the reasonable costs incurred by the Board        for the employment of outside consultants engaged by the Board to         assist in the review of an application and is in addition to the application        or administrative filing fee. 
B. 	In hiring outside consultants, the Board may engage engineers, planners,       lawyers, landscape architects, hydrologists, botanists or other appropriate       professionals who can assist the Board in analyzing a project to ensure       compliance with all relevant laws, ordinances/bylaws, and regulations.       The minimum qualifications shall consist either of a degree in, or related       to field at issue or three or more years of practice in the field at issue or a       related field, and if the field is licensed or registered by the Commonwealth, the respondent holds such license or registration. 
C. 	Funds received by the Board pursuant to this section shall be deposited with                   the municipal treasurer who shall establish a special account for this purpose. 
      Expenditures from this special account may be made at the direction of the                   Board without further appropriation.  Expenditures from this special account                   shall be made only in connection with the review of a specific project or                   projects for which a review fee has been or will be collected from the   applicant. Failure of an applicant to pay a review fee shall be grounds for                   denial of the application or permit.  
D. 	Review fees may only be spent for services rendered in connection with the                     specific project from which they were collected.  Accrued interest may also be spent for this purpose.  At the completion of the Board’s review of a project,                   any excess amount in the account, including interest, attributable to a specific                   project, shall be repaid to the applicant or the applicant’s successor in interest.                   A final report of said account might upon request be made available to the applicant or 
the successor interest. For the purpose of this regulation, any person entity claiming to be an applicant’s successor in interest shall provide the with documentation estab­lishing such succession in interest. 
E. 	Any applicant may take an administrative appeal from the selection of the                    outside consultant to the Maynard Board of Selectmen.  The grounds for such                   an appeal shall be limited to claims that the consultant selected has a conflict                   of interest or does not possess the minimum, required qualifications.  The                   required time limit for action upon an application by the Board shall be                   extended by the duration of the administrative appeal.  In the event that no                   decision is made by the Maynard Board of Selectmen within one month       following the filing of the appeal, the selection made by the Board shall stand.

SECTION III. PROCEDURE FOR THE SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL OF PLANS 
A. Preliminary Plan 
1. General 
The applicant, before submitting a Definitive Plan for approval as hereinafter prescribed, may, at the applicant’s own election, submit to the Board for approval a Preliminary Plan, showing the proposed subdivision in a general way. The submission of a Preliminary Plan, while not herein required for a residential subdivision is strongly recommended except in the simplest cases.  Such submission affords the applicant the opportunity to have the Board review the proposed subdivi­sion before the expenditure of time and money for more detailed engineering. A Preliminary Plan is required for a non-residential subdivision. 
It is intended that the Preliminary Plan will enable the applicant to more expeditiously ascertain the specifications and requirements of the various town agencies with relation to the subdivision. 
2. 
Application 

The applicant shall submit the Preliminary Plan to the Planning Board, together with a properly executed application form (Form B - see Appendix), application fee, and verification that copies of the Preliminary Plan have been submitted to the Department of Public Works, Board of Health, and Conservation Commission.  The applicant shall file by hand delivery or registered mail, a notice with the Town Clerk stating the date of submission for an approval, accompanied by a copy of the completed application Form B.  The applicant shall provide the Planning Board with a copy of the notice of filing at the first public meeting at which the Board considers the Prelimi­nary Plan. 

3. 
Contents 


Four copies of the Preliminary Plan, drawn by a surveyor or engineer, no larger than twenty-four inches by thirty-six inches (24” x 36”), preferably at a scale of one (1) inch equals forty (40) feet, shall be clearly designated “Preliminary Plan”.  Such plan shall show: 
(a) 
The subdivision name, boundaries, north arrow, date, scale, legend and title; 

(b) 
Name and address of the record owner, applicant, and designer, engineer or surveyor; 

(c) 
The names of all abutters from the latest available Assessors’ records.  (See Form E - Certified List of Abutters in the Appendix.) 

(d) 
The existing and proposed lines of street, ways, easement, and any public areas within the subdivision. 

(e) 
The location, names and present widths of streets bounding, approaching or near the subdivision; 

(f) 
The topography of the land in a general manner utilizing contours at intervals of five 

(5)
 feet or less. 


Page 11 

TOWN OF MAYNARD 
RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING 
TO THE SUBDIVISION OF LAND 
Adopted August 14th, 2007 

(g) 
The proposed system of water, proposed system of drainage, including existing natu­ral waterways that would receive subdivision stormwater flow, and the proposed sys­tem of sewerage in a general manner both within and adjacent to the subdivision; 

(h) 
The approximate boundary lines of proposed lots, with approximate areas and dimen­sions and approximate locations of proposed buildings in a general manner;  

(i) 	
Estimates of the grades of proposed streets and ways, or profiles of same; 

(j) 	
Major site features such as existing stonewalls, fences, buildings, large trees or wooded areas, rock ridges and outcroppings, wetlands, water bodies, water courses within 200 feet of the property boundaries, and all other resource areas as defined in the Maynard Wetlands Administration Bylaw.  Water courses should be clearly la­beled as intermittent or perennial, and should be supported by the applicant’s presen­tation in a public meeting of a recent USGS map showing the watercourse (or not, as the case may be). 

(k) 
A locus map at a scale of 1” = 1000’. 


The Preliminary Plan must be accompanied by a statement of existing zoning and any easement, covenants, or restrictions applying to the area proposed to be subdivided. 
4. 	
Approval 

The Planning Board must give such Preliminary Plan its approval with or without recommended changes, or disapproval with reasons therefore, within forty-five (45) days of submission, or as required by MGL Chapter 41, Section 81S, as amended.  Approval of a Preliminary Plan does not constitute or guarantee approval of subdivision or a Definitive Plan, but is intended to facilitate the procedure in securing final approval of the Definitive Plan. 

5. 	
Adjacent Land of Subdivider 

In the case of a Preliminary Plan of a subdivision covering less than all of the land owned by the applicant and/or record owner in the area of the subdivision, or where the owner or applicant also controls undivided adjacent land, a sketch plan shall be submitted showing, in a general manner, the overall proposed development of all of the land owned or controlled by the applicant and/or record owner in the area of the subdivision, and indicating the area for which approval is being sought. Said sketch plan shall show a possible or prospective street layout and development scheme for such adjacent land. 

6. 	
Incomplete Submissions 


The Planning Board, at its first public meeting addressing the Preliminary Plan may make a judgment that the information shown on the plan and/or in the supporting submittal documenta­tion is incorrect or incomplete, and that the submittal is incomplete and unacceptable, and so in­form the applicant and the Town Clerk. Notice of an incomplete submission will cause the pas­sage of time for action of the Planning Board to effectively be suspended until such time as a completed and/or corrected submission is made.

(i) 	
Approval of the Definitive Plan shall be contingent upon the completion of the re­quired work on the ground within two (2) years of the endorsement of the Definitive Plan. Failure to complete the required work within the two-year time period shall constitute a reason for rescission of the subdivision approval by the Board.  Prior to the expiration of such time period, the applicant may request that the Board allow ad­ditional time for completion of the subdivision improvements, which extension is at the sole discretion of the Board. The Board, when asked to approve such an exten­sion, may also elect to review the security arrangements for the work, and may re­quest additional security if it is adjudged necessary.

B. 	Utilities 
1. 	
Sanitary sewers, with manholes and other appurtenances, and water mains, with hydrants, valves and other fittings, shall be sized and constructed within the subdivision as necessary to provide to all lots therein adequate sewage disposal and adequate water supply for domestic use and fire protection. 

2. 	
Proper connections shall be made with the existing public sewer and water systems.  Where adjacent property is not subdivided, provision shall be made for proper projections of the systems by continu­ing appropriate sewers and water mains to the exterior boundaries of the subdivision, at such size and grade as will allow for the projections. 

3. 	
Service connections for sewer and water from the mains in the street to the exterior lines thereof shall be installed for each lot shown on the plan, whether or not there is a building thereon. 

4. 	
In no case shall pipe trenches be backfilled until the installation has been approved by the Department of Public Works, or as required by the Planning Board’s designated inspector. 

5. 	
The sewer and water systems shall be laid out to the satisfaction of the Planning Board and of the De­partment of Public Works, both, who will require provision of such facilities and arrangements thereof as in their opinion are necessary to carry out the intent of subparagraphs (1) through (4), above. The installation of the water and sewer systems, including the methods of construction and the quality of materials used, shall conform to standard specifications of the Department of Public Works. 

6. 	
Where existing public sewers and/or water mains are not reasonably accessible or are of inadequate size, in the opinion of the Department of Public Works and/or the Board,  the installation of the re­quired sewer and/or water facilities respectively, specified above, shall be waived, but in such cases the Planning Board shall not approve the plan unless the following conditions are met: 


(a) In the absence of a public sewer connection to any lots, either the subdivider agrees to pro­vide for the collection and disposal of sanitary sewage from such lots by a project or individ­ual sewage disposal works satisfactory to the Board of Health, or the Planning Board en­dorses on the plan the condition that such lots shall not be built upon without prior written consent of said Board of Health.

RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING 
TO THE SUBDIVISION OF LAND 
Adopted August 14th, 2007 

(b) 
In the absence of a public water system connection to any lots, either the subdivider shall agree to provide for domestic water supply to such lots by project or individual water systems satisfactory to the Board of Health, or the Planning Board shall endorse on the plan the condi­tion that such lots shall not be built upon without prior written consent of the Board of Health. 

(c) 
In the absence of a public hydrant system to serve any lot, the subdivider shall agree to pro­vide for water supply for fire protection purposes for such lots by such facilities, if any, as is deemed necessary by the Chief of the Fire Department and the Board, together (taking into consideration the prospective character and density of the development).  Such measures may include fire cisterns, fire ponds, or sprinklers in individual homes. 


7. 	
Where the subdivider elects to install a project system for sewage disposal, and/or water supply, such systems(s) shall also be subject to the requirements and approval of the Department of Public Works and the Board insofar as, in the opinion of said agencies, the systems may subsequently be connected with the public system(s). 

8. 	
Sewer design and construction shall be in accordance with standard Town of Maynard Department of Public Works specifications, drawing details presented in the appendix of these regulations, and de­sign and construction standards as follows: 


(a) 	
Minimum depth of cover over sewer lines shall be four feet (4.0’). 

(b) 
Minimum sewer main size shall be eight inches (8”), and all sewer pipes shall be SDR 35 PVC or an approved equal. Sewer services shall be a minimum of six inches (6”) diameter SDR 35, except within 10 feet of the foundation, where the service line shall be four inch (4”) diameter cast iron through/under the foundation. 

(c) 
Drop manholes are allowed only where necessary to eliminate an excessively deep sewer line (12 foot depth or more), or where high groundwater would make installation difficult, or where needed to control sewer flow velocities, and is therefore justified in the opinion of the Superintendent of Public Works and the Planning Board. 

(d) 
All drop manholes shall be inside drops. 

(e) 
Sewer manholes, of a design shown in the standard details in these Rules and Regulations, shall be provided at intervals not to exceed two hundred fifty feet (250’), at changes in verti­cal and horizontal alignment, and at all junctions of sewer mains. 

(f) 	
Inverts in sewer manholes shall be built-up of standard red sewer brick and mortar, and shall be configured as ¾ of a pipe diameter.    

(g) 
Upon completion of the sewer system, video and audio tapes of the sewer line shall be pro­vided to the Department of Public Works for their review, along with detailed as-built plans showing rim and invert elevations and pipe slopes, sizes and materials.

RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING 
TO THE SUBDIVISION OF LAND 
Adopted August 14th, 2007 

9. 	Disposal of surface water, which in the opinion of the Planning Board is adequate to prevent flooding, property damage and hazard to public safety shall be provided.  Drainage design and construction standards are as follows: 
(a) 
Catch basins shall be installed on both sides of the roadway on continuous grades at intervals of not more than 350 feet, at low points and sags in the roadway, and near the corners of the roadway at intersecting streets. 

(b) 	
Catch basins and grates shall be designed and located so that surface water does not cross the roadway, including at any intersection of streets. 

(c) 	
Stormwater flow into catch basins via subsurface drainage pipes is not permitted.  

(d) 
All catch basins shall have a four-foot (4’) deep sump with a solid, precast bottom. 

(e) 
Storm drains shall be reinforced concrete pipe, shall be at least twelve inches (12”) in diame­ter, and shall have a minimum cover over the pipe of three feet (3’).  

(f) 	
Storm drains shall be designed such that they allow a minimum velocity of three feet per sec­ond (3 fps) when flowing full, and a maximum velocity of fifteen feet per second  (15 fps) when flowing full. The design flow depth shall be less than or equal to 80% of the pipe di­ameter. 

(g) 
Drain manholes shall be provided at intervals not to exceed two hundred twenty-five feet (225’), at changes in vertical and horizontal alignment, and at all junctions.   

(h) 
There shall be a 0.20-foot minimum hydraulic drop through any drain manhole, or the crown of the outlet pipe shall be lower or at the same elevation of the inlet pipes, whichever allows for a greater hydraulic difference.  

(i) 	
Catch basins, manholes, pipe, joint specifications, construction methods and materials shall all conform to the Town of Maynard Department of Public Works, and the ASCE Manuals and Reports on Engineering Practice No. 37. 

(j) 	
Where natural drainage courses are obstructed, cross drains culverts or other structures shall be installed to restore natural drainage patterns. Cross-drains and culverts shall be reinforced concrete pipe, shall have a minimum of three feet of cover over the pipe and where possible shall be designed to provide temporary flood water storage. 

(k) 
The cross drain or culvert in (j.), above, shall be designed with reinforced concrete headwalls where they enter and emerge from roadway embankments, and shall not be designed using Flared End Sections. 

(l) 	
The design storm for the cross-drains, culverts or similar structures discussed in (j.), above, shall be a 100-year frequency storm.   All other proposed storm drain systems (pipes and manholes) shall utilize a 25-year frequency design storm.

RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING 
TO THE SUBDIVISION OF LAND 
Adopted August 14th, 2007 

(m) 
Design of the detention/retention basins and other Best Management Practices (BPM’s) shall be in conformance to the Department of Environmental Protection’s (DEP’s) Stormwater Management Policy and Stormwater Management Standards when applicable. If the DEP Stormwater Standards are not technically applicable, detention/retention basin design should still follow the design principles in the Volume 2: Stormwater Technical Handbook by the DEP dated March 1997. 

(n) 
Any hydrologic analysis performed for the project should utilize the U.S. Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Technical Releases, TR-20 and/or TR-55, to design the drain­age system(s) such that the following standards are complied with: 

(1) 
Peak rates of runoff from the site for Post-Development conditions shall not exceed that for Pre-Development conditions for the 2 and 10-year frequency design storms.  

(2) 
Analyses shall also be run for the 25 and 100 year frequency storms, and the peak rate of runoff shall be mitigated for these storms as well, unless it can be clearly shown to the satisfaction of the Planning Board that increased post-development peak discharge rates will not result in adverse downstream flooding impacts. 

(3) 	
The volume of stormwater runoff for Post-Development conditions as determined for the 2 and 10-year frequency design storms shall not exceed that of Pre-Development conditions. The Planning Board may, in cases where the drainage dis­charge is towards the Assabet River, require retention of up to the entire increased volume from Post-Development conditions for up to the 100-year frequency storm.  

(4) 
Peak rates of discharge shall be measured at the design point at the lowest point of discharge along the down-gradient property boundary(s) of the subdivision.  The to­pography of the site may require that discharge rates be balance between Pre- and Post-Development conditions at more than one design point.  In cases where dis­charges are in different directions, or to substantially different topographic features or to different watersheds, the peak discharge shall be balanced individually for each design point, rather than in aggregate for the entire project.  In this case, and assum­ing that the project balances in aggregate for the required design storms, no individ­ual design point shall have an increase in the peak rate of discharge more than 20% above the Pre-Development rate, and this increase is allowable only if the applicant can clearly demonstrate to the Planning Board’s satisfaction, that the projected in­crease will have no adverse impact to downstream properties, and will not increase flooding impacts offsite. 

(o) 
All stormwater control structures shall be accessible by public road for maintenance. 

(p) 
Where water velocity beyond drain pipe or culvert outlets may cause scour or erosion, aprons, riprap, and other appropriate protection acceptable in the opinion of the Planning Board shall required.

RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING 
TO THE SUBDIVISION OF LAND 
Adopted August 14th, 2007 

(q) Where roadway sections are cut into natural ground, subsurface drainage is required to drain the roadway base course at location dictated by good design procedure and protection accept­able in the opinion of the Planning Board. (Reference Figure 4). 
10. 
Fire boxes as well as required connecting lines shall be constructed to serve the subdivision in con­formity with specifications of the Fire Department of the town of Maynard, a copy of which is avail­able from the Fire Chief.  All box locations must be shown on the Definitive Plan, and must be ap­proved by the Fire Chief. 

11. 
Location and number of fire hydrants, fire boxes and similar fire protection provisions are designated herein for the convenience and guidance of the applicant, however, final decisions on all similar pro­visions are to be made by the Fire Chief.  


C. 	Monuments 
Monuments shall be installed at all street intersections, at all points of curvature of streets, and at other points where in the opinion of the Board, permanent monuments are necessary.  Such monuments shall be reinforced concrete, 5”x5”x 3’ in depth, and shall be set two inches (2”) above the finished grade.  No permanent monuments shall be installed until all construction, which would destroy or disturb the monu­ments is completed. 
D. 	Grass Plots and Slopes 
1. 	
All areas between the exterior street lines of the roadways and the back of sidewalks, or curb lines if no sidewalks, shall be graded with six inches (6”) of topsoil, rolled, seeded and compacted to the sat­isfaction of the Board. 

2. 	
Embankments adjoining the right-of-way shall be evenly graded at a slope of not greater than two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical up or in cut sections, and not greater than three (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical down or in fill sections.  Where cuts are made in ledge, other slopes may be determined with the approval of the Planning Board and the Department of Public Works.  Where terrain necessitates greater slopes, then retaining walls, terracing, fencing, rip-rap, cellular confinement, or other innova­tive slope stabilization methods may be used either alone or in combination to provide safety and freedom from maintenance with the approval of the Planning Board and the Department of Public Works 

3. 	
Guardrails shall be furnished in accordance with Department of Public Works Standards, whenever the slope is greater than three- (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical downhill, and shall be installed along the edge of the right-of-way. Whenever embankments are built in such a way as to require approval by the Planning Board, the developer must furnish to the town evidence of duly recorded access easements free of encumbrances for the slopes, terraces, retaining walls and other measures as dis­cussed in subparagraph 2., above. 


E. 	Protection of Natural Features 
Page 35 

TOWN OF MAYNARD 
RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING 
TO THE SUBDIVISION OF LAND 
Adopted August 14th, 2007 

Due regard shall be shown for all natural features such as large trees (greater than 16” diameter at breast height, DBH), water courses, scenic points, notable viewsheds, historic sites, and other similar commu­nity assets, which if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the subdivision. Resources protected under the Maynard Wetlands Administration Bylaws shall also be of concern to the Planning Board inso­far as they are valuable natural features. The Planning Board may require the applicant to preserve and protect such features deemed by the Planning Board to be of exceptional value to the subdivision and the community at large. 
F. Street Signs 
Street signs, which are of the type commonly used on public ways in the Town, and bearing the name of the street(s) as indicated on the plan, shall be erected at all intersections of streets in the subdivision, and shall require the approval of the Department of Public Works as to type and mounting. 
G. Street Shade Trees 
Street trees shall be planted on each side of every street in the subdivision wherever, in the opinion of the Board, existing woodlands or suitable individual trees are not retained.  Trees shall be located outside the exterior street lines and at such distance therefrom as the Board shall specify. 
Street trees shall be hardwoods of at least a 2” caliper size at four feet off the ground, and shall be such species as is approved by the Board.  Two trees per building lot shall be the normal requirement unless the Board specifies otherwise.

SECTION VI. ADMINISTRATION 
A. 	Waivers 
Strict compliance with the requirements of these Rules and Regulations may be waived when, in the judgment of the Board, such action is in the best interest of the Town and not inconsistent with MGL Chapter 41, Subdivision Control Law. 
The Planning Board, in deciding to grant such a waiver, should be able to make the following general findings: 
A. 	The granting of the waiver is in the best interest of the Town of Maynard. 
B. 	The granting of the waiver does not substantially derogate from the intent of these Rules and Regula­tions. 
C. 	The waiver, if a minor technical waiver, is necessitated by good design practice and strict compliance would run contrary to good design practice. 
D. 	In the case of a substantial waiver of significant monetary value to the applicant, the waiver is being granted in return for concessions or amenities by the applicant that are being provided to the Town for the good of the Town, not just for residents of the proposed subdivision, and which are of similar import or value to the Town as the waiver is to the applicant. 
E. 	The granting of a waiver of the length of a cul-de-sac: 
a) 	does not allow more lots than would otherwise be allowed on a cul-de-sac of the maximum allowable length, 
b) 	is the minimum length that could be allowed, and still result in a design that is superior to the same number of lots on a shorter cul-de-sac, 
c) 	does not, according to consultation with the Fire Chief, result in a reduction or compromise of the Fire Department’s ability to provide emergency services to the residents of the development in any way. 
It must be noted that a waiver of the maximum length of a cul-de-sac should not be considered a foregone conclusion by the applicant.  This waiver should be granted sparingly, and only in those cases where it is clearly in the Town’s best interest to do so.

CONDITIONS REQUIRING SITE PLAN APPROVAL 
Site Plan applicability may be found in Section 10.5.1 of the ZBL. 
If inappropriate or unnecessary to particular applications, the Applicant may request, in writing, a waiver of strict compliance to these regulations when submitting an application for Site Plan Review. The Planning Board or the Town Planner shall determine whether to grant or deny said request. 
SITE PLAN REVIEW PROCEDURE 
The procedures and application form for Site Plan Review are contained as Appendices “B” and “C” respectively within this document. Section 10.5.6 of the ZBL states that once an application for Site Plan Approval is filed Planning Board must take action upon the Site Plan within 90 days.

The following guidelines have been organized into two related sections: 
• 	
Overall Guidelines -These are general considerations that shall apply to any project. 

• 	
Specific Guidelines -These concern the elements of a building and its site that might be affected by a proposed project such as storefronts, lighting, roofs, materials, signage and the like. 


B. Overall Guidelines 
Building improvements should respect a building's original style or type where the building is of historic merit, or where the original building design is of high quality and distinctive character. 
The Industrial Revolution and the building styles that were used during this period are of great significance in Maynard, and several structures typical of this period remain. Restoration of these facades to reflect their original character to the greatest extent possible is a fundamental goal. 
Building renovations should be harmonious with the original structure in form, style and materials whenever possible. Building improvements should not be designed to mimic historical features that are inappropriate to the original character of the building. 
Previous building renovations, which have taken place over the course of time, are sometimes evidence of the history of a building and its environment. If these alterations have acquired their own significance, they should be recognized and respected. 
1. 	
If original building elements have been removed or substantially altered over time, contemporary treatments are not discouraged. However, they should retain traditional principles and be of a character appropriate to the area. 

2. 	
New buildings may have a contemporary character that is respectful of and composed with traditional and attractive design elements (materials, colors, facade organization and proportions). Buildings designed in accurate historical architectural styles are recommended. 

3. 	
New building design should reflect a long-term contribution to the area’s architecture, and should be planned in such a manner as to not preclude a variety of tenants from occupying the structure over the course of time. Building styles not easily adapted to future reuse are strongly discouraged.

4. 	
Distinguishing original qualities and character defining features of a building or structure and its environment should be preserved; elements that make a building special should be identified and preserved if at all possible. 

5. 	
Facade designs that relate to the historic town character of Maynard are encouraged. In general, businesses should rely on signage, not on signature or symbolic building elements, to advertise themselves and to attract patrons. 

6. 	
Standardized or generic designs are to be avoided. Within an overall framework of consistent and coherent general principles, variety in the commercial environment is encouraged. 


C. Peer Review for Design Standards 
The Planning Board may at its own discretion, opt to utilize a design professional to conduct a peer review of projects. The determination to utilize outside professional peer review will normally, but not always, be made at the Pre-Application meeting. The Applicant is solely responsible for all professional costs incurred for peer review. 
D. Specific Guidelines 
In each of the following subsections, the “Standard” represents the conditions that must be met by all development that are subject to design review, while the “Recommended Approach” represents one way of satisfying the standard. Through the site plan approval process, the Planning Board may permit alternative site planning and building design approaches provided that it finds that such alternative approaches address the required standard as well as, or better than, the “Recommended Approach.” 
1. 	Facades, Exterior Walls, and Details 
Standard: 
• 	
Buildings should have “human scale” architectural features and patterns; their height, orientation, and massing should be respectful of and in proportion to pedestrians that pass along the downtown streetscape. The elements should be integral parts of the building fabric, and not superficially applied trim or graphics, or paint. Facades visible from a public way should be articulated or use other techniques to reduce the massive scale and the uniform appearances of large buildings. Facades along Main and Nason Streets should pay particular attention to exterior detailing that encourages pedestrian interest and activity. 

• 	
New building and facade designs should be similar to the immediate neighbors and historic site organization, with primary orientation towards the streets and doors and windows adjacent to sidewalks. Facades and visible roofs should strive to be visually interesting and attractive along areas that will be seen by the public. 

• 	
A unified architectural style should be determined for each project and used consistently for all elements of a building wall and roof. However, in the case of a use which is housed in multiple buildings, the underlying integrity of each building should be preserved, to the extent that historic qualities remain.  Proportions of building elements should respect the architectural styles with which they are composed, in addition to details and materials. Building doors and windows should be designed to be consistent in proportion, size and configuration with the architectural styles that are determined to be appropriate for the building. 


Recommended approach: 
• 	Building facades should include a repeating pattern that should include color change, texture change, and materials change. At least one of these elements should repeat horizontally. All elements should repeat at intervals of no more than thirty (30) feet, either horizontally or vertically. Patterns can include architectural or structural bays through a change in plane no less than 12 inches in width, such as an offset, reveal, or projecting rib.

Maynard Planning Board 
Rules and Regulations 

• 	
The massing of large buildings should reflect the functions of the building and respond to the scale of traditional buildings by including major façade elements, which help to break the building into smaller pieces with distinctive appearances. Individual buildings and their storefronts should appear distinct, even when a single use spans multiple storefronts. 

• 	
Facades which are visible from a public way and greater than 100 feet in length, measured horizontally, should: 

a. 	
Incorporate wall plane projections or recesses having a depth of at least 3% of the length of the facade so that no uninterrupted facade should exceed 100 horizontal feet; or 

b. 	
Incorporate other types of articulation, facades, displays, materials, or texture which meets the above standard. 

• 	
Ground floor facades that face public streets should have arcades, display windows, entry areas, awnings, or other such features along no less than 60 percent of their horizontal length. The street level facade of commercial storefronts should be transparent between the height of three feet and eight feet above the walkway grade (see Storefronts). 

• 	
Blank walls without any visual content or interest should be avoided along pedestrian sidewalks and parking areas, and on front facades in general. 

a. 	
Historic roof forms should be retained or restored. Additions should have roof forms that are compatible with the forms of the building to which they are attached. New structures should employ simple roof forms compatible with the flat or gable roof styles typical of the Maynard commercial areas. 

b. 	
Downspouts and gutters should be of a color that is compatible with the building walls. If the building is historic, the style and color of downspouts and gutters should be appropriate to the original character of the facade. 


2. 	Windows, Doors, and Entryways 
Standard: 
• 	
Windows should respect spacing and size patterns appropriate to the architectural style that is chosen for either renovation or new construction. In general, numerous smaller window openings are preferred for upper stories of buildings. Lower story windows should be appropriate for the uses behind them, but transparency and indication of activity are important. In general if not a storefront, it is preferable to have vertically-oriented windows. 

• 	
Primary entrances are a principal element of orientation and connectivity to the street and should be designed appropriately; they should concentrate visible activity and interest toward the street. 

• 	
Large retail buildings should feature multiple entrances. Multiple building entrances break up large walls, reduce walking distances from cars, facilitate pedestrian access from public sidewalks, and provide convenience where certain entrances offer access to individual stores, or identified departments of a store. Entryway design elements and variations should give orientation and definition to the building. 


Recommended Approach: 
• 	Whenever possible, the original window patterns of a building should be restored or retained; avoid blocking, reducing, or changing any original and appropriate pattern of windows when renovating older buildings. Repairing existing historic windows with in-kind materials is preferable to replacement. When existing historic windows are irreparable, replacement windows should strive to replicate existing historic window details.

Rules and Regulations (including Fee Schedule and Applications) 
Approved May 24, 2016 (Revised August 14th, 2018) 

Maynard Planning Board 
Rules and Regulations 

• 	
An individual, "punched" window expression rather than continuous horizontal or vertical "strip" windows is encouraged whenever possible and appropriate to the building style. Windows with multiple small panes, which emulate historic windows should be avoided, unless they are historically accurate and appropriate to the primary style of the building. Such glazing was seldom used during many historical periods, and is often used inappropriately to convey a "colonial" appearance. 

• 	
Larger scale windows should be used at the ground level. 

• 	
Transparent glazing should be used, and reflective or dark tinted glass avoided. Opaque panels, such as painted metal or spandrel glass, should not be used to replace vision glazing in windows. 

• 	
Shutters should be employed only if they are consistent with the architectural style of the façade. Shutters should not be employed with casement-style windows, bay windows, broad picture, paired/grouped or display windows. 

• 	
Doors: 


o 	Primary entrances should be largely transparent, as is traditionally the case with storefront design. This will promote a sense of welcome and safe access. 

o 	Street numbers should be located near the front address and be of adequate size and distinctive color to be visible to the passing motorist. The street number should not be located so that it is obscured when the front door is open. 

o 	Any special loading and service entrances should be screened from streets, other public ways, and adjacent properties. If it is not possible to screen such areas entirely, they should be visually minimized to the greatest extent possible. 

o 	Unused entrances should be transformed into other architectural elements appropriate to the architectural style of the building, such as a store window. 

o 	Entrances shall meet the requirements of the Massachusetts Architectural Access regulations. 

o 	The addition of rear entrances, display windows or other improvements is encouraged in order to increase interest and access to uses. 

o 	Historic door material and hardware should be restored or repaired where possible. Repair should match existing size, design, profile and configuration. 

o 	Screen and storm doors should be wood, when appropriate to the building, and kept as simple as possible. Horizontal and vertical rails of screen doors should align and coincide with those of the doors behind. 

o 	Aluminum doors and aluminum screen doors are not recommended. 

o 	Divided lighte doors or side lights should be employed only if appropriate for the style of the building facade. 

o 	Drop ceilings should not be visible from the public street or sidewalk. 


• 	Entryways: 
o 	The sides of a principal building that abut a public street or large parking lot should have at least one customer entrance or a pedestrian arcade that brings pedestrians around the building to the entrance. 

o 	Each principal building and each store within a building should have at least one clearly defined, highly visible customer entrance, featuring no less than three of the following: Canopies or porticos, overhangs, recesses/projections, arcades, raised corniced parapets over the door, peaked roof forms, arches, outdoor patios, display windows, architectural details which are integrated into the building structure (such as tile work and moldings), or integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas and/or places for sitting.

3. 	Materials and Colors 
Standard: 
• 	
In general, high quality materials should be used that convey substance and integrity. The use of materials that are traditional and historically typical to Maynard is encouraged. This includes an emphasis on brick and clapboard for renovations or reconstructions. Exterior materials should be consistent with the historic style, which is used to compose the facade. 

• 	
The goal of these guidelines is to encourage the use of traditional quality materials for both appearance and durability. The use of authentic materials, rather than imitations, is strongly encouraged. This guideline is intended to discourage materials that are typical of low cost and low quality construction, or appear to be masking or patching an underlying facade material. 

Recommended approach: 

• 	
Predominant exterior building materials should be high quality materials and include, but not be limited to, brick, wood, granite, native stone and tinted, textured or concrete masonry units. 

• 	
Facade colors should be low reflectance, using appropriate historic palates or neutral or earth tone colors. 

• 	
Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors, including primary colors. 

• 	
The consistent use of a dominant building material for the facade is encouraged, rather than multiple materials, such as brick and clapboard combinations. 

• 	
Where possible, materials used to patch or repair existing facades should match original, desirable materials as closely as possible. 

• 	
Designs should use traditional or historic materials, rather than imitation materials, such as composite siding, plastic roof tiles, or veneer brick. 

• 	
If metal is used, it should be appropriate to the building, and convey a sense of quality to assure an attractive appearance over time. 

• 	
Materials used near sidewalks and adjacent to the entrance should be durable and compatible with other building materials. 

• 	
Plywood or other wood panel sheathing materials should be avoided unless they are incorporated as a panel within a frame and are durable for exterior use. 

• 	
Minor decorative elements, such as facade ornaments, decorative fasteners, or small accents can be of any rigid, durable material that will be in harmony with the façade and the architectural style of the structure. 


4. 	Rear and Sides 
Standard: 
• 	
Architectural and landscaping features should mitigate the impacts of rear and sides of buildings which otherwise present a view of blank walls, loading areas, storage areas, HVAC units, garbage receptacles, and other such features. Where the rear and sides of buildings front on public streets and/or other public spaces (e.g. parks or parking lots), they should incorporate additional entries and attractive architectural treatments that mimic the quality of the front façade. 

Recommended approach: 

• 	
Where space allows, greater landscape buffers, screening, and fencing than is otherwise required in the zoning should be used, but in no way impede views of the Assabet River. Where the facade faces adjacent residential uses and space allows, enhanced screening shall be provided consistent with the Landscape Regulations.

5. 	Central Pedestrian-Scale Features 
Standard: 
• 	
Buildings should offer pedestrian-scale features and amenities. Entrances and parking lots should be configured to be functional with walkways conveniently tied to logical destinations. Bus stops and drop-off/pick-up points should be considered as integral parts of the design. Pedestrian ways should be branded by special design features such as towers, arcades, porticos, pedestrian light fixtures, bollards, planter walls, alternative paving materials, and other architectural elements that define circulation ways and outdoor spaces, represent context-appropriate public infrastructure. 

Recommended approach: 

• 	
Each project subject to these standards should contribute to community and public spaces by providing at least two of the following: outdoor benches or seating, window shopping walkway, outdoor playground, kiosks, water feature, or other such deliberately shaped area and/or a focal feature or amenity that enhances such community and public spaces. Any such areas should have direct access to the public sidewalk network and such features should not be constructed of materials that are inferior to the principal materials of the building and landscape. 


6. 	Signage, Awnings, Canopies and Marquees 
Standard: 
• 	
Signage shall be consistent with Section 6.2 of the ZBL. 

• 	
Consistent with Section 6.2.11 of the ZBL, the Planning Board is also empowered to grant relief through the issuance of a Special Permit. 

• 	
Awnings, canopies and marquees with a traditional design and appearance are encouraged as facade elements when they serve to protect pedestrians from the sun and rain, provide a secondary location for signage, add color and interest to building storefronts and facades, and add emphasis to display windows and doorways. Awnings should reflect the overall facade organization and storefront locations of a building. Traditional and simple shapes are encouraged, rather than unusual or contemporary profiles. 

Recommended Approach: 

• 	
Awnings on a multiple storefront building should be consistent in character, but need not be identical. 

• 	
Awnings should be located within the building elements framing individual storefront openings. 

• 	
Awnings of a round or bullnose shape should be avoided unless used for a single door or window opening that is not part of a framed storefront. 

• 	
The rigid framework for awnings, canopies or marquees should be no lower than 8 feet above the sidewalk under it per Massachusetts Building Code. Suspended fabric panels of awnings should be no lower than 7 feet above the sidewalk 

• 	
Backlit awnings should not be used. 

• 	
Awnings shall be made of soft fabrics such as canvas. 


7. 	Storefront 
Standard: 
• 	Storefronts refer to those portions of the facade, which directly relate to the street and the 
Maynard Planning Board 
Rules and Regulations (including Fee Schedule and Applications) 
Approved May 24, 2016 (Revised August 14th, 2018) 

Maynard Planning Board 
Rules and Regulations 

interior activities. In some cases, the storefront may include the side or back of the building. Most facades consist of an architectural framework designed intentionally for one or more storefronts to occur. The storefront design should complement the framework and not expand beyond it. 
• 	Storefronts should be consistent in style with the building architecture where possible, provide clarity and interest to the facade, provide for a high level of transparency, and be harmonious with other adjacent storefronts. It is also important that the distinction between the storefront and the rest of the building facade should be maintained. Displays in street front windows that add color, texture, information or visual activity to the pedestrian experience are encouraged. 
Recommended Approach: 
• 	
Storefront display windows that display products or services, signs with the name of the organization, local business logos, hours, public service messages or displays, or views to an activity in which people are involved frequently during hours of operation are encouraged. 

• 	
Dark tinted or opaque reflective glass/films should be avoided. 

• 	
Where a storefront does not serve a retail use and transparency is not practical, window treatments should be employed to create an attractive appearance that promotes aesthetic harmony with the surrounding area and maintains storefront character. 

• 	
A horizontal band or frieze that serves as a signage band should be incorporated at the top of storefronts. 

• 	
Base panel and sill courses are traditional for many architectural styles. Where it is appropriate for the existing or proposed architectural style, a base panel and sill course should be provided. The base panels and sill course should continue across the entire width of the storefront bay and terminate at doors or the vertical elements framing the Bay. The base panel and sill course should be a maximum of 24" measured above the sidewalk. 

• 	
Incorporating a glazed transom (with the building address) above the door is encouraged when storefront heights are sufficient to allow for it. 

• 	
Storefront window transoms should be consistent with door transoms. 

• 	
It is preferable to maintain substantial storefront glazing and provide attractive window treatments to avoid blank facades along the sidewalk. 


8. 	Building Systems 
Standard: 
• 	
The components of building mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems should be concealed from view wherever possible. The visual impact of those building systems and equipment which cannot be concealed should be minimized on building facades. Exposed elements of building systems which cannot be hidden, recessed or screened should be blended sympathetically with the building facade. 

Recommended Approach: 

• 	
Rooftop mechanical equipment should be completely screened by the building parapet wall so as not to be visible from any street public way. 

• 	
Air conditioning units should not be placed into windows or any other openings visible from the street. Units located in non-window openings are appropriate if they are screened with a grille within the storefront or facade or building wall.

A. Safe Harbor Valuation of Open Space 
The purpose of this section is to establish a Safe Harbor Amount for ZBL Section 9.4.5 Donation for Acquisition and Preservation of Open Space or Recreation Land. 
• 	
Section 9.4.5 of the Town of Maynard Protective Zoning By-laws allows for developers to reduce the minimum lot requirements for residential units in the Downtown Overlay District if they are issued a Special Permit and if there is a Development Agreement that includes, among other things, a donation for the “acquisition and preservation of open space or recreation land”. 

• 	
Because there is a need for a consistent and fair determination of the value of such donation, the Community Preservation Committee recommends that a “safe harbor” value of such donation be established as noted below1. Further, the CPC recommends that a developer providing the value of this safe harbor amount be considered compliant with the provisions of Section 9.4.5 regarding a donation for the acquisition and preservation of open space or recreation land. 

• 	
The value of the Section 9.4.5 donation for acquisition and preservation of open space or recreation land is to be determined by multiplying a Base Acquisition Cost Per Household by the number of Applicable Units. 


o 	The FY19 Base Acquisition Cost Per Household is $9,4002. 

o 	The number of Applicable Units is equal to the difference between the Project’s total number of residential units and the number of units otherwise allowed without Section 


9.4.5. 
• 	The Acquisition Cost per Household will be increased by an inflation factor of 2.0 percent annually, unless the Planning Board specifies a different inflation factor. Any such adjustments by the Planning Board to the inflation factor shall be in effect at the start of the next fiscal year. 
Example: A project proposes to increase the allowed number of units from 5 to 7 under Section 
9.4.5. The number of Applicable Units is therefore 2. The safe harbor donation amount is therefore ($9,400)x(2) =$18,800. 
1Text approved by Community Preservation Committee on May 16, 2018 – it was subsequently modified by Planning Board on July 10, 2018. 
2 
This amount was determined using Maynard’s current average number acres of open space and recreation land per household (0.15) multiplied by the current assessed value per acre of the golf course land ($62,800). The golf course land is the most recent open space and recreation land acquired by the town. The valuation of the golf course land used in the calculation excludes the value of the clubhouse and parking lot. The current acreage of open space and recreation land used in the calculation excludes the wildlife refuge lands.

Regulations as Amended by the Planning Board Meeting July 28, 2015 

Maynard Planning Board 
Landscape Regulations 

1. 	
Purpose The purpose of this document is 1) to outline the Planning Board’s required Landscape Design Drawing Requirements to accompany applications for Site Plan Approval, Special Permit or Design Review, and 2) to provide Landscape Design Standards to guide the landscape design of all new project proposals. 

2. 	
Applicability All applications for Site Plan approval, Special Permit, or Design Review shall include Landscape Design Documents (Existing Conditions Documents, Landscape Plan, Landscape Maintenance Plan, as described herein.) 

3. 	
Guiding Principles The Town’s impetus for applying landscape standards to projects is found throughout the Maynard Community Development Principles adopted by the Board of Selectman in 2011. Because of the myriad of ways landscaping can positively affect the community they are a vehicle to implement the vision of the Community Development Principles. Directing attention to landscape design ensures that the entire community benefits from development through an enhanced visual experience, higher property values, the protection of the natural environment, and an improved quality of life. Landscape design can improve air quality, buffer noise, promote energy and wildlife conservation, facilitate traffic flow, promote water conservation and mitigate the impact of otherwise incompatible uses. 


3.1. Following these guiding principles, project proposals shall generally seek to: 
o 	Reinforce and extend existing patterns of outdoor spaces and vegetation. 

o 	Support functional purposes, such as spatial definition, visual screening, creation of privacy, and management of microclimate or drainage; 

o 	Increase public safety, both pedestrian and vehicular, through carefully planned design elements. 

o 	Enhance the appearance of the proposed development and its context; 

o 	Protect desirable trees, topography, historic features, natural systems and habitat; 

o 	Enhance the pedestrian environment; 

o 	Increase the tree canopy. 


4. 	Drawing Requirements 
4.1. General Requirements 
4.1.1. 	Use of a Massachusetts registered landscape architect is strongly recommended for the design of any project that is significant in size or scope. 
4.1.2. 	Where the applicable project requires construction of five (5) or more parking spaces, or two (2) or more dwellings, the Landscape Plan shall be prepared, signed and sealed by a Massachusetts registered landscape architect.

5. 	Landscape Design Standards 
5.1. Purpose: These standards are included to provide baseline guidance for landscape design for proposed projects in Maynard. While each project will be reviewed based on its unique context and parameters, the Planning Board expects Design Standards to be integrated into project design to the greatest extent possible. Compliance with these standards, in the judgment of the Board, is criteria for project approval. 
5.2. Low Impact Development (LID) Projects should embrace the principles of Low Impact Development, an approach to site development that manages stormwater as close to its source as possible and seeks to support site ecology, native plants and resource conservation. LID projects employ the following 
Maynard Planning Board Landscape Regulations Approved July 28, 2015 
Maynard Planning Board 
Landscape Regulations 

strategies: 
o 	Preserving, enhancing or recreating naturally existing site features, natural systems and drainage patterns. 

o 	Managing stormwater as close to its source as possible, 

o 	Minimizing impervious surfaces. 

o 	Encouraging infiltration of stormwater into the ground where appropriate. 

o 	Utilization of native plant material and soils that is naturally suited to the site and region. 

o 	Emphasis on small scale, economical and decentralized features. throughout the landscape rather than reliance on large, expensive and complicated infrastructure. 


Examples of specific strategies that contribute to LID development include bio­retention facilities, rain gardens, vegetated roof tops, roof leader disconnection, rain barrels, native plant buffers, and permeable pavements, among others. 
5.3. Existing Vegetation, Topography, and Soils 
5.3.1. 	All efforts shall be made to protect and preserve valuable existing plant material, especially mature trees. 
5.3.2. 	Projects shall protect and enhance existing topographical patterns and avoid unnecessary disturbance to existing drainage systems. 
5.3.3. 	Projects shall appropriately manage any on-site soil resources throughout the completion of the project so as to minimize the need for importing topsoil. 
5.3.4. 	Projects shall include a plan to eradicate any invasive species from the site during the course of construction, and include provisions for long term management of invasive species. 
5.3.5. 	Clearing of vegetation and alteration of topography shall be restored with comparable native vegetation planted in disturbed areas as needed to enhance or restore wildlife habitat, slope stabilization and natural buffers. 
5.3.6. 	Existing trees to remain shall be protected from damage from construction equipment through the use of adequate tree protection fencing and tree armor. Roots shall be protected from compaction by limiting construction traffic to outside of root zone, defined as the area beneath the tree’s drip line. 
5.3.7. 	Areas of the site that experience excessive soil compaction, dangerous to the health of tree roots, shall be de-compacted to a depth of 12”, and to a level that will allow for proper root growth and infiltration of water, where appropriate. 
5.4. Streetscapes 
5.4.1. 	“Streetscapes” are defined as the public / private space between buildings and the street edge. 
5.4.2. 	Streetscapes shall utilize vegetation to create separation between buildings and the street edge. Plantings shall be contiguous, with the 
Maynard Planning Board Landscape Regulations Approved July 28, 2015 
Maynard Planning Board 
Landscape Regulations 

exception of driveways, and consider existing neighborhood patterns of 
vegetation and tree canopy in adjacent areas. 
5.4.3. 	All plantings and landscape elements shall allow for adequate sight lines for pedestrians and not encroach on a clear path of travel. 
5.4.4. 	The use of shade trees is strongly encouraged to shade and cool paved areas and buildings, and to provide contiguous canopy cover for pedestrians. 
5.5. Parking Areas 
Vegetation within parking areas shall provide visual and climatic relief from broad expanses of pavement. All parking areas shall be properly screened and landscaped to protect adjacent property from undesirable effects of parking lots such as lighting, sound, dust, and views of cars, and to preserve the appearance and character of the surrounding neighborhoods. Standards for the landscaping of parking areas are contained within Section 6.1.15 of the Zoning By-laws.  In addition the following requirements shall apply: . 
5.5.1. 	Trees and soil plots shall be so located so as to provide visual relief and sunlight and wind interruption within the parking area, and designed to assure safe patterns of internal circulation for both vehicles and pedestrians. 
5.5.2. 	When appropriate, planted parking islands and other vegetated spaces should be utilized to manage surface runoff and promote infiltration of stormwater. 
5.5.3. 	Projects with five (5) or more parking spaces are required to be designed by a Massachusetts licensed landscape architect. 
5.6. Planted Buffers and Visual Screening 
5.6.1. 	Planted buffers, in combination with fencing or berms shall be used to reduce the impacts of development (ambient light, noise and air pollution, etc.). The use of adequate visual screening is required. Incompatibility is affected by zoning district and or/adjacent uses but will ultimately be determined by the Board’s discretion on a site specific basis.  Typical incompatibilities would include, but are not limited to, residential/commercial, multifamily/single family etc.  Uses proposed will also be considered by the Board when reviewing buffers. 
5.6.2. 	Planted buffers shall consist of a combination of native plantings of trees, shrubs and groundcovers, primarily evergreen, and accented with deciduous plants, staggered in rows of substantially sight-impervious foliage. Deciduous trees shall be spaced a maximum of 20’ apart. Shrubs shall generally be spaced upon their ability to efficiently screen views within a maximum two (2) year timeframe. All buffers must be a minimum of six (6) feet tall at time of installation. A 10 foot minimum width is recommended for all buffers. 
5.6.3. 	Where a vegetated buffer is not practical or feasible, the Planning Board may allow or require the use of an opaque fence, wall or berm in addition to, or in lieu of planted areas. 

5.6.4. 	Dumpsters, transformers, loading, storage, refuse storage and disposal 
Maynard Planning Board Landscape Regulations Approved July 28, 2015 
Maynard Planning Board Landscape Regulations 
areas shall be screened from view of adjacent properties and public ways. 
5.7. Lawn Areas 
It is recognized that lawn areas planted with turf grass require significant care, often necessitating the use of fertilizers, pesticides and large quantities of water to maintain. Lawn maintenance is often performed with equipment, requiring fossil fuel consumption, and producing noise and dust pollution. It is recommended proposed designs: 
o 	minimize lawn areas to only spaces where people will gather or play. 

o 	consider alternative ground covers that require less maintenance and water. 

o 	Utilize “Low-Mow” native grass species, and seed mixes with higher quantities of Fescue grasses, are desirable alternatives to typical Kentucky Bluegrass seed. 

o 	Artificial turf is prohibited. 


5.8. Irrigation 
Irrigation systems, while helpful to maintain plant health during the establishment of vegetation, are large consumers of water, requiring proper installation and seasonal maintenance. When irrigation systems are required, the design should utilize drip irrigation emitters with intelligent water management features such as rain and moisture sensors. 
5.8.1. 	Projects utilizing irrigation systems are required to comply with the “Town of Maynard Water Rules and Regulations” as published by the Department of Public Works 
5.8.2. 	Projects must submit documentation of the water efficient components of the proposed system, including cut sheets and calculations. 
5.8.3. 	All irrigation systems should be properly commissioned to avoid improper settings and overwatering. Documentation of commissioning is to be submitted to the Building Inspector upon project completion. 
5.8.4. 	Plant species should be chosen to avoid the need for irrigation after the establishment period, typically two growing seasons. 
5.8.5. 	When possible, projects shall utilize water from rooftop collection or runoff from hardscape areas to offset the need to irrigate with Municipal or well water. 
5.9. Site Lighting 
5.9.1. 	Site lighting shall be designed to: 
o 	Reduce light pollution, trespass, intensity, and glare in order to preserve and enhance the natural, scenic, and aesthetic qualities of the Town. 

o 	Conserve energy and decrease lighting cost without decreasing night time safety, security, and productivity. 

o 	Preserve the night sky as a natural resource to enhance nighttime enjoyment of property within the Town. 

o 	Enhance the safety and security of pedestrians, residents and private

Landscape Regulations 

property. 
5.9.2. 	Utilize “Dark Sky” compliant lighting standards when appropriate. 
http://www.darkskysociety.org/handouts/LightingPlanGuidelines.pdf 
5.9.3. 	Lighting fixtures shall be chosen to be architecturally consistent with the project context. Cut sheets of all proposed lighting shall be provided to the Planning Board for review. 
5.9.4. 	No outdoor light fixtures using sodium vapor or metal halide lamps shall be allowed, unless specifically authorized by the Planning Board. 
5.9.5. 	Luminaires attached to a building for area lighting shall be mounted no higher than twelve (12) feet above grade; 
5.9.6. 	Pole mounted exterior lighting fixture types shall be mounted no higher than fifteen (15) feet above grade. 
5.9.7. 	Refer to the Department of Public Works standards for street lighting design. 
5.10. Soil Standards 
5.10.1. 	All top soil placed on site shall be clean of roots, plants, sod, stones, clay lumps, and other extraneous materials that may be harmful to plant growth. 
5.10.2. 	Projects shall preserve and reuse existing surface soil, to the greatest extent possible. Topsoil stockpile location is required to be identified on the Landscape Plan. 
5.10.3. 	Imported topsoil shall come from naturally well-drained construction or mining sites where topsoil occurs at a minimum of four (4) inches deep. Do not obtain soil from agricultural land, bogs, or marshes. Soil shall not be excessively acid or alkaline nor contain toxic substances that may be harmful to plant growth. 
5.10.4. 	Recommended Soil Specification: ASTM D5268, 5.5 to 7 pH range, minimum 4 percent organic material content; free of stones 1 in. or larger in any dimension or other extraneous materials harmful to plant growth. 
5.11. Plant Material Standards 
5.11.1. 	Plants utilized shall consist of healthy, vigorous stock, grown in a recognized nursery in accordance with good horticultural practice and free of disease, insects, eggs, larvae and defects such as knots, sun-scale, injuries, abrasions or disfigurement. The Designated Town inspector can refuse the placement of any plant that does not satisfy these conditions, up to one week after installation. 
5.11.2. 	All plant material shall be guaranteed for a minimum of one full year, or two growing seasons, from date of installation. Within this time period, any dead plant material that is not thriving in a healthy manner, must be promptly replaced at the earliest appropriate season, and at the owner’s expense.

SECTION I: What Is Historic Preservation? 
Introduction 
Maynard, like many other classic New England mill towns, is rich with history. With the tremendous growth and success of the textile mill built by Amory Maynard in 1847, the town’s population boomed, and Maynard blossomed into a thriving industrial community. Many citizens today can still trace their family lines back to first-generation immigrant mill workers. Hints of the past remain in Maynard’s historic buildings, including the renovated mill complex at Mill & Main, the reused Old Fowler School at Art Space, the Gruber Brothers Furniture building, and Fine Arts Movie Theater. 
Since receiving its first town warrant in 1871, Maynard has grown into a vibrant community that combines an active downtown area with the values of a small-town suburb. As Maynard continues to grow, it is crucial that its historic sites are preserved and protected. A community’s historic sites are fundamentally important to its character and identity. Many townspeople who have lived in Maynard their entire lives also feel connected to their genealogical history through the town’s historic sites. 
Each year, the fifth grade at Fowler School embarks on a walking tour of historic Maynard. By exploring Maynard’s historic buildings, these children learn about the past and the town in which they live. The identification, preservation, and protection of the town’s historic sites can forward education efforts and foster an appreciation of the town’s history and resources for Maynard citizens young and old. 
Historic preservation can also be economically beneficial, as the renovation of historic properties has been shown to promote and increase business activity in commercial areas. Maynard’s economy depends heavily on small businesses who can benefit from historic preservation. Historic preservation could also provide the town with new sources of income, such as housing and businesses. When provisions are made so that private developers can “repurpose” historic buildings in a way that is both economical and efficient, preservation becomes a win-win for both the town and the developer. 
Historic preservation is defined as the “protection, conservation, and restoration of historic sites.” This handbook will explain the processes of historic preservation and make suggestions for the town to further its dedication to historic preservation efforts. A list of resources, including grants, is also included to aid in the preservation process. 
Historic Preservation in the United States 
Local governments play an important role in the process of historic preservation. Historic preservation can provide communities with direct fiscal and social benefits, but also furthers local identity by embracing the past. However, historic preservation in a city or town is just a small part of a greater picture, as it is largely overseen by divisions of the federal government. 
Much of the historic preservation in America is overseen by the Department of the Interior. The Department establishes nationwide standards for preservation, rehabilitation, 
3 

restoration, and reconstruction, and protects hundreds of historic properties through the National Park Service. Since its foundation in 1916, the Park Service has designated, preserved, and maintained important natural and historic sites throughout the United States. Many of its programs, including federal tax incentives and the National Register of Historic Places, are important preservation tools for American communities. Please see pages 6-10 for more information on federal preservation programs. 
Likewise, each state also plays a role in managing its own historic preservation. In Massachusetts, historic preservation is regulated by the Massachusetts Historical Commission, chaired by the Secretary of the Commonwealth. The Massachusetts Historical Commission directs programs such as the Certified Local Government Program and the State Register of Historic Places which benefit communities with historic assets. It also provides financial assistance in the form of tax credits and grants. Please see pages 11-14 for more information on state preservation programs. 
However, the first level of historic preservation in the United States is local preservation. Divisions of the local government typically lead preservation efforts. In Maynard, the Town Charter established the Maynard Historical Commission, which coordinates with the federal, state, and local governments to direct preservation efforts in town. Private organizations, such as the Maynard Historical Society and Friends of the Maynard Library, also aid preservation efforts by providing financial assistance, sharing resources, and educating the broader community. More information on local preservation efforts can be found on pages 15-19. 
Although historic preservation operates on many different levels, each level can benefit a town like Maynard. Successfully ensuring the preservation of any town’s historic sites involves requires identifying, understanding, and utilizing many resources of each level: federal, state, and local as well as private funding opportunities. 
What is Considered “Historic?” 
There is a fine line between what is considered “historic” and what is simply considered “old.” Not all old buildings are deemed worthy of historic preservation. According to the National Register of Historic Places, “historic” buildings should hold some significance, including but not limited to: 
Association with important people or events. 
The homes of Amory and Lorenzo Maynard, which still stand today, are considered “historic” because of their ties to the Maynard family. The Maynard family was not only the namesake of the town, but also held prominent roles within the community and town government. Amory Maynard was even the town’s first postmaster! 
Architectural or artistic significance. 
One historic building in Maynard which meets this criteria is the Coolidge School. The Coolidge School was partially built by the master architect Charles Bateman, famous for his work throughout the greater Boston area. The Coolidge School also exemplifies the architectural style known as Classical Revival. The Classical Revival movement was inspired by Greco-Roman art and architecture, and became widely popular in the 19th century. 
4 

Providing new information about the past. 
Archaeological sites are generally “historic” because they may yield new information about the past. Similarly, a newly-discovered site could be considered historic because of potential information it might hold. Glenwood Cemetery in Maynard, which is the town’s only nationally-recognized historic property, is one example of a site that might possess archaeological resources. 
Of exceptional importance to community, state, or country 
The most notable example of this criteria in Maynard is the former mill at Clock Tower Place, recently rechristened Mill & Main. The mill is historic not only because of its ties to families in the community, but because of its reflection of a greater trend throughout the United States. The mill exemplifies the transformative process of industrialization underwent by America during the 19th century. The community of Maynard was just one of thousands of communities throughout New England that adopted this new technology and thrived because of it. Maynard’s booming immigrant population as a result of the mill also reflected a nationwide trend. Therefore, the mill is “historic” because it was part of an important moment in American history. 
Although this handbook focuses on the preservation and protection of historic buildings, not all historic sites must be buildings to meet these criteria. Natural formations, areas of land, and graveyards/cemeteries could all be considered “historic” under the right conditions. Likewise, not all old buildings are considered historic. A home built in the 1920s is not historic simply because of the time in which it was built. It may, however, be historic because of its particular architectural features, or a former resident of note.

SECTION II: NATIONAL PRESERVATION 
In the United States, the federal government is the highest branch on the tree of historic preservation. Divisions of the federal government, such as the National Park Service, oversee much of the historic preservation in this country. Washington performs preservation tasks such as: passing federal laws, publishing guidelines, and awarding special recognition to properties of note, among other duties. Additionally, some private nonprofit organizations operate on a national level, like the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Below, you will find a sampling of national preservation resources, provided both by the federal government and by nonprofits. 
The Secretary of the Interior’s Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, 
Restoring, and Reconstructing Old Buildings 

In the United States, preservation is overseen, at the federal level, by the Department of the Interior, which handles many of the domestic affairs in this country. As such, it is the responsibility of the Secretary of the Interior to establish federal policy on historic preservation. To help preservationists determine the best course of action for an historic building, the Secretary of the Interior has published a set of guidelines for preserving, rehabilitating, restoring, and reconstructing old buildings. They are paraphrased below. 
According to the Secretary of the Interior, preservationists have four options, or “treatment approaches,” when determining the future of an historic building: 
Preservation favors the conservation of the building’s historic character through the use of original materials, maintenance and repair. 
Rehabilitation assumes that a building is more deteriorated prior to treatment, and therefore allows more leeway for the replacement of old materials. However, like preservation, rehabilitation stresses the importance of conserving the original features, materials, and style of the building – i.e. its “historic character.” 
Restoration retains and replaces materials to return the appearance of the building to its most significant period of history. Unlike preservation or rehabilitation, it permits the removal of materials not belonging to this time period. 
Finally, reconstruction allows preservationists to recreate a destroyed or no longer existing site using all-new materials. 
To determine which of these four options best suits the property at hand, the Secretary of the Interior asks preservationists to consider four main considerations in addition to the building’s historical significance: 
Relative importance in history. For example, National Historic Landmarks often undergo preservation or restoration, while buildings belonging to an historic district more frequently experience rehabilitation. 
Physical condition. Sometimes, though we would like to preserve a building, preservation is simply not an option due to the building’s present physical condition. Preservation is a viable option when most of the building’s original materials and features 
6 

remain intact, but when extensive repairs are necessary, rehabilitation may be a more feasible choice. 
Proposed use. Most historic buildings can be adapted to a new use (see “Adaptive Reuse,” pages 26-27) without compromising their historic character, but some specialized buildings – such as grain silos, forts, or windmills – are less easily adapted. Therefore, both the original and proposed uses of a building are important considerations. 
Mandated code requirements. Regardless of what treatment is pursued, code requirements must be taken into consideration as the project proceeds. However, sometimes, code-required actions can jeopardize the historic character of a building. Code-mandated changes to the building – such as system upgrades or accessibility requirements – should affect the building’s historic appearance as little as possible. 
By following these guidelines, preservationists can identify the most appropriate actions to be taken to protect a specific historic building. 
The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation 
The Secretary of the Interior has published ten Standards for Rehabilitation, which must be observed to qualify for many sources of federal and state funding. The current Standards – as they appear on the National Park Service website1 – are shown below: 
“1. A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
2. 
The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 

3. 
Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 

4. 
Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 

5. 
Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. 

6. 
Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.

7. 
Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 

8. 
Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 

9. 
New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 

10. 
New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.” 


These standards help to ensure the proper treatment of historic properties around the United States, especially those receiving federal and/or state funding. 
National Park Service Programs 
As stated previously, the Department of the Interior administers many federal programs to help towns – like Maynard – in the process of historic preservation. These programs are run through the National Park Service and range from protective legislation to federal tax credits and grants. 
National Historic Preservation Act 
In 1966, Congress passed the National Historic Preservation Act to set the federal policy on historic preservation. The National Historic Preservation Act required that the federal government establish various preservation programs and designate historic preservation officers. Through this Act, the federal government committed to working with state and tribal governments to better protect and maintain historic sites. 
This Act was important because it forced federal agencies to take into account their effects on our country’s historic properties. This Act established many programs which are still in use today – such as the National Register of Historic Places and the Certified Local Governments Program. It also created the Historic Preservation Fund, which provides the means for the United States’ federal historic tax credits and grants. 
National Register of Historic Places 
Established by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the National Register of Historic Places is an official list of all the historic properties in the United States meeting a certain set of criteria. Historic sites are listed on the Register through official nominations, which are sent through the state and reviewed by the National Park Service. Nominations may be made by individuals or groups, but require careful research and evidence demonstrating that the property meets the National Register’s official criteria. These criteria take both the age and 
8 

significance of the site into consideration, as well as its associations with important historical events, people, artistic or architectural styles, etc. 
Listing on the National Register of Historic Places is primarily an honorary designation. This means it will not affect the ownership of the building, nor will it ensure the building’s maintenance or preservation. A threatened property is not automatically “saved” when it is placed on the National Register of Historic Places. However, listing on the Register can still provide tremendous benefits for the future preservation of a historic property. For example, National Register listing draws attention to the importance of a site, helping to convince others of its value. Listing on the National Register earns the site a place in a public database, offering important publicity and exposure. It also makes the site eligible for federal tax credits, federal preservation easements and grants, and possible state benefits as well. 
Federal Tax Credits 
The National Park Service and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have partnered to offer tax credits toward the rehabilitation of historic properties, in order to encourage private investment in the historic sector. Two tax credits are available: historic and non-historic. The former provides a 20% income tax credit for “the rehabilitation of historic, income-producing buildings”; however, residential properties are ineligible. The latter provides a 10% tax credit toward non-historic properties that were in use before 1936. In order to qualify, the property’s internal structural framework and internal and external walls must remain 50-75% intact. For more information on federal historic tax credits, please contact the National Park Service (see page 38). 
Historic preservation easements also offer some federal tax benefits. A historic preservation easement is a legal agreement that permanently protects a historic property, typically in the form of a deed. Easements such as these restrict the changes which can be made to a historic property. These restrictions usually travel with the deed of the property, so that they will still apply even if ownership of the property changes. A building owner who donates an historic preservation easement may be eligible for a federal income tax deduction. The National Park Service recommends that interested owners consult with a tax attorney or accountant for more information on these deductions. 
National Trust for Historic Preservation Programs 
On October 26, 1949, President Truman signed legislation creating the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Now a privately-funded nonprofit, the National Trust continues to manage twenty-eight historic properties in the United States. Today, the organization also administers several programs to aid in preservation efforts around the country. 
The National Treasures Campaign 
The National Trust for Historic Preservation launched their National Treasures campaign in order to raise awareness and garner support for endangered historic sites. The National Treasures portfolio contains nationally-significant sites that are threatened by 
9 

demolition, closure, or other forms of neglect. Through this program, the National Trust provides aid to endangered historic sites in the form of advocacy, marketing, planning, legal assistance, and more. These sites, honored as “National Treasures,” are listed on the National Trust website, where readers are invited to donate toward the Trust’s efforts. 
National Trust Preservation Grants 
The National Trust also delegates funds to aiding preservation projects on the local level, in the form of Preservation Grants. Preservation projects that are innovative, help build sustainable communities, and promote diversity may be eligible for a National Trust grant. Grants typically amount to $2,500-$5,000 and are only awarded for use in planning or educational outreach; they may not be used for rehabilitation or construction projects. For more information, please refer to the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s website (see page 39). 
10 

SECTION III: STATE PRESERVATION 

Statewide preservation efforts are also important to the overall success of historic preservation. As in the federal government, specific divisions of the Massachusetts state government deal with historic preservation issues in the Commonwealth. The state government can award tax credits, nominate properties to the National Register, provide funding for preservation projects, and more. Likewise, many private organizations in Massachusetts can provide grants and other forms of assistance. A diverse collection of historic preservation resources available in the state of Massachusetts appears below. 
Massachusetts Historical Commission Programs 
In 1963, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts enacted legislation creating the Massachusetts Historical Commission (MHC). This commission, comprising seventeen professionals in various preservation-related fields, was established to help “identify, evaluate, and protect important historical and archaeological assets of the Commonwealth.” The Commission is chaired by the Secretary of State, and also serves as the office of the State Historic Preservation Officer, State Archaeologist, and State Review Board for historic preservation programs. 
Certified Local Governments 
The National Park Service has partnered with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) to instrument the Certified Local Governments program. Through this certification, communities receive benefits from the Federal Historic Preservation Program, such as access to a multitude of grants, assistance from SHPO staff, and state and National Park Service training. To be eligible as a Certified Local Government, governments must “establish a qualified historic preservation commission, enforce appropriate State or local legislation for the designation and protection of historic properties….maintain a system for the survey and inventory of local historic resources, [and] facilitate public participation in the local preservation, including participation in the National Register listing process.” They must also meet the standards set forth by the state of Massachusetts. Currently, there are 22 Certified Local Governments in the state of Massachusetts. As of 2015, the town of Maynard is not certified. For more information on the Certified Local Governments Program, please contact Mr. Christopher C. Skelly of the Massachusetts Historical Commission (see page 40 for further details). 
State Register of Historic Places 
The Massachusetts Historical Commission established the State Register of Historic Places in 1982 as a comprehensive list of all the historic properties in the Commonwealth. All sites that have received local, state, or national designations as places of historic or archaeological importance are automatically added to this list. Listing on this register is largely honorary, but may make certain properties eligible for funding from the Massachusetts Historical Commission (see “Preservation Projects Fund” on page 12). Since the Register’s creation, over 60,000 properties have been added to the Register. A current copy of the Register can be purchased through the Massachusetts State Bookstore. 
11 

Massachusetts Cultural Resource Information System (MACRIS) 
The Massachusetts Cultural Resource Information System (MACRIS) is a public online database compiled by the Massachusetts Historical Commission. Data is compiled from various sources, including but not limited to the Inventory of Historic Assets of the Commonwealth, National Register nominations, and State Register listings. MACRIS – updated weekly -serves as a valuable resource for historic preservationists in the research and study of historic properties. Almost 400 Maynard buildings are listed in the MACRIS database, with 125 more in progress. 
Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit 
The Massachusetts Historical Commission allocates $50 million per year to financially assisting certified historic rehabilitation projects. This money is awarded in the form of tax credits, which can alleviate up to 20% the cost of rehabilitation. To qualify, the properties must be owned by a private, for-profit business or organization, and must be listed in, or certified by the MHC as eligible for listing in, the National Register of Historic Places. The rehabilitation project must also meet the standards established at the federal level by the Secretary of the Interior (see pages 7-8). 
Preservation Projects Fund 
The Massachusetts Preservation Projects Fund provides 50% reimbursable matching grants toward preservation projects throughout Massachusetts. To be eligible, properties must be listed in the State Register of Historic Places (see page 11), and the applicant must be a municipality or non-profit organization. As a condition of receiving Preservation Projects funding, the applicant must agree to place a preservation deed restriction onto the property (see page 18), ensuring the building’s protection into the future. Please contact the grants staff at the Massachusetts Historical Commission for more information (see page 40). 
Preservation Planning Fund 
Established in 1984, the Massachusetts Preservation Planning Fund provides 50% reimbursable matching grants toward the preservation of sites listed on the State Register of Historic Places. Only municipalities and nonprofit organizations are eligible to apply. The state considers properties for an award based on many criteria, including historical significance, threats to the property, financial need, and public support. Once awarded, funds may only be used toward certain pre-development, development, and acquisition projects; please see the Massachusetts Historical Commission website for more details (see page 40). Grants for pre­development projects range from $5,000-$30,000, while awards for development and acquisition projects may amount to as much as $100,000. 
12 

Cultural Facilities Fund 
The Massachusetts Cultural Facilities Fund (CFF) provides grants for the “acquisition, design, repair, renovation, expansion, and construction of nonprofit and municipal cultural facilities.” Grants from the CFF can be applied to historic properties when the building is owned by a nonprofit cultural facility and made accessible to the public, and when at least 50% of the building is devoted to cultural purposes. These grants fall into three categories: Feasibility and Technical Assistance, Systems Replacement Plan, and Capital Grants. Eligible projects must exhibit community and financial need, must benefit tourism in the area, and must demonstrate local support. Grants range from $7,000 to $675,000 based on category; Systems Replacement and Feasibility and Technical Assistance Grants must be privately matched, 1:1. 601 grants have been awarded since 2007. For more information on these grants, please visit the Massachusetts Cultural Facilities Fund webpage (see page 41). 
MHC Planning and Survey Grant Program 
In addition to funding preservation projects, each year, the Massachusetts Historical Commission also awards 50/50 matching grants toward the completion of: cultural resource inventories, National Register nominations, community-wide preservation plans, and other types of studies/reports pertaining to historic preservation. Though these grants may not be used toward the rehabilitation of a specific property, they, too, help to further preservation efforts in local communities throughout Massachusetts. Please refer to the MHC website for more details (see page 40). 
Preservation Massachusetts Programs 
Preservation Massachusetts is a nonprofit organization dedicated to furthering historic preservation efforts throughout the Commonwealth. Since 1985, the organization has worked to: educate the public, through events such as its bi-annual statewide conference; advocate for endangered properties; lobby for preservation legislation on the state level (for example, the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit was a direct result of Preservation Mass. efforts); and partner with communities statewide through the Massachusetts Preservation Coalition. 
Most Endangered Historic Resources 
Preservation Massachusetts’ Most Endangered Historic Resources program is a public-relations based advocacy initiative dedicated to promoting awareness of the Commonwealth’s endangered historic sites. While the program does not provide funding or professional services on behalf of these resources, the publicity that Preservation Mass. garners for these sites can be a great help in obtaining this assistance. Resources are submitted for nomination on even-numbered years and selected based on criteria such as: historical significance, threat of loss, community support, geographic location (in relation to other state resources), and type of site. Once a resource is listed, it receives attention through social media, press releases, the 
13 

Preservation Massachusetts website, and the organization’s “Believe in Preservation” Fall Event. For more information, contact program manager Courtney Whelan (see page 43). 
Predevelopment Loan Fund 
Preservation Massachusetts’ Predevelopment Loan Fund provides financial assistance toward third-party costs associated with the launch of a preservation project, such as consultant fees and feasibility studies. Each year, the organization awards 3-5 loans ranging from $25,000 to $75,000. Necessary qualifications for the award include listing (or eligibility for listing) of the site on the National Register of Historic Places, and the project’s compliance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation (see pages 7-8). 
Preservation Circuit Riders 
Since 2008, Preservation Massachusetts has collaborated with the National Trust for Historic Preservation to provide part-time preservation professionals to communities statewide. These professionals act as a resource for developing preservation projects and strategies, and can help preservationists in a small community build networks within the greater world of historic preservation. Currently, Preservation Massachusetts employs two Preservation Circuit Riders; one serves Eastern Massachusetts, while the other serves Western Massachusetts. To contact a Preservation Circuit Rider, please see page 43. 
Maynard’s own Coolidge Reuse Taskforce Committee enjoyed a visit from one of the Preservation Circuit Riders – Stacia Caplanson – in 2015 during its deliberations over the future of the Coolidge School Building. Ms. Caplanson helped the Taskforce Committee make recommendations for the Coolidge School by advising and connecting its members with preservation professionals throughout the state of Massachusetts. 
Community Preservation Coalition 
The Community Preservation Coalition was formed in 2000 under the Community Preservation Act (CPA), an important piece of Massachusetts legislation that facilitates historic preservation throughout the Commonwealth by funding community projects (see page 16 for more information). A number of aforementioned organizations help comprise the Coalition, including the National Trust for Historic Preservation and Preservation Massachusetts. 
Since the Act’s passage, 160 communities throughout Massachusetts have adopted CPA, raising a total of almost $1.4 billion in community preservation funding. Statewide, the Coalition has spent over $395 million since the CPA’s inception, catalyzing more than 4,000 historic preservation projects. The Community Preservation Coalition helps towns implement and enforce CPA through local preservation projects. To contact the Coalition, please see pages 41­
42. 
14 

SECTION IV: LOCAL PRESERVATION 

Perhaps the most essential branch of historic preservation is the local level. The local level is where the most direct action occurs, immediately benefitting the community. It is not only crucial for town governments to take measures to foster historic preservation, but also for the public to be educated and enthusiastic about local preservation efforts. No preservation campaign can exist without grassroots support. Although most of the information in this handbook focuses on action taken by local governments, the importance of local publicity and community involvement cannot be emphasized enough. 
Local Historical Commissions 
Local historical commissions are a valuable resource for historic preservation at a community level. Historical commissions – unlike historical societies, which are private organizations – are low-level divisions of the town government dealing with questions of historic preservation. 
Since the state law was enacted in the 1960s, almost every city and town in Massachusetts has established a local historical commission. This law (found in Chapter 40, section 8d of Massachusetts General Law) provides conditions by which a local government may appoint and maintain its own Historical Commission. According to the Massachusetts Historical Commission’s Preservation Planning Manual, the law identifies five key responsibilities of local historical commissions: 
1. 	
“Research places of historic or archaeological value; 

2. 	
Cooperate with the State Archaeologist in conducting surveys and reporting sites; 

3. 	
Coordinate with other preservation organizations; 

4. 	
Keep accurate records of the LHC’s actions and file an annual report; 

5. 	
Maintain a membership of not less than three nor more than seven members, duly appointed by the appropriate municipal official.” 


Note that the law does not give the Historical Commission the ability to take regulatory or legislative action in the local government. Unless a local bylaw or ordinance is established, giving the Historical Commission regulatory authority, the Historical Commission may only hold an advisory role within the town government. 
The Maynard Town Charter established its own Historical Commission, which meets monthly to discuss issues of historic importance within the town. On the Maynard town website, the Historical Commission defines its goals as “to preserve, protect, and develop the historic and archaeological assets of the community.” In recent years, the Commission has been working to inventory the town’s historic properties, in addition to: restoring the fence of Glenwood Cemetery (a State and National Register property), as well as the official Town Scale in Town Hall; administering the Historic Markers and Plaques programs; and creating several Walking Tours – available online and at the Maynard Public Library – which each pass through different historic sections of Maynard. 
The Historical Commission may be contacted by e-mailing histcom@townofmaynard.net. Meetings of the Commission are open to the public. For more information, please see page 45. 
15 

Local Ordinances and Bylaws 
Local ordinances and bylaws are types of legislation enacted by the town government or municipality, not by the Local Historical Commission. The Massachusetts Historical Commission cites such legislation as “the most effective method of protecting historic resources.” These laws safeguard historic resources from threats like demolition, destruction, and decay, and require passage at city council or town meeting. 
Community Preservation Act 
The Community Preservation Act (CPA) was approved by the Massachusetts state legislature in September 2000. This law provides local and state funding for the acquisition and preservation of historic buildings and landscapes. Funds are sourced from local property taxes and the statewide CPA Trust Fund. As of October 2010, the state of Massachusetts had already appropriated over $20 million for local historic preservation projects through the CPA. 
Maynard adopted the Community Preservation Act in November 2006 after the vote passed at the annual spring town meeting. In Maynard, the Community Preservation Committee (CPC) meets twice a month to review local project proposals and appropriate funding toward these projects. CPA proposals are then presented at a public hearing before being voted on at town meeting in May. To contact the committee, please see page 45. 
The Community Preservation Act is not specific to historic preservation. In fact, CPA funding may be used for four types of projects: 
1. 
Community housing projects 

2. 
Historic preservation projects 

3. 
Open space projects 

4. 
Recreation projects 


Because the use of CPA funds is always voted on at town meeting, publicizing and gathering support for historic preservation projects in the town is vitally important. Historic preservation must be a priority for the citizens of Maynard, in order for local preservation projects to feel the benefits of CPA funding. 
Historic Districts 
Two types of historic districts exist in Massachusetts: National Register Districts and local historic districts. National Register Districts, established by the Massachusetts Historical Commission through the National Park Service, are primarily honorary. Meanwhile, local historic districts are established by local bylaw or ordinance, and are primarily regulatory. The following section will focus on local historic districts. 
Over 220 local historic districts exist in the state of Massachusetts. Maynard currently has none. In a local historic district, all properties are subject to the same set of regulations. Typically, these regulations require that all changes to the exterior of a building are subject to 
16 

review by the local Historic District Commission (established when the district is established). A building permit will not be issued until the construction has been approved by the commission. 
Before a local historic district can even be considered, a nomination is necessary from either the Board of Selectmen or a local historic organization, such as a Historical Society or Board of Realtors. After receiving the nomination, a study committee is typically established to explore the possibility of a local historic district. Before proposing a historic district, the committee should prepare a study report establishing the boundaries of the district and detailing the significance of the area. Then, the ordinance should move to a public hearing, where citizens of the area can hear both sides of the issue and voice their opinions. From the public hearing, a final report is prepared by the study committee for consideration at town meeting. 
Local historic districts may only be passed by a majority vote of town meeting or city council. Therefore, it is important to garner public support for the cause. Once the vote passes at town meeting, the ordinance must be submitted to the Massachusetts Attorney General for approval within thirty days. Then -and only then -should a Local Historic District Commission be appointed for review of all proposed construction within the district. 
Architectural Preservation Districts 
Architectural Preservation Districts – sometimes known as Neighborhood Conservation Districts or Architectural Conservation Districts -can be effective alternatives to Local Historic Districts in places where alterations have already occurred, but where overall protection of the area’s character remains necessary. They regulate only additions, major alterations, demolition, and new construction within the specified area, to make sure that the outward character of the district is preserved. Therefore, their standards are less binding than those of a Local Historic District. 
A District Commission (a type of review committee) enforces the terms of an Architectural Preservation District. The Commission should comprise of a combination of building professionals, architects, property owners, and district residents. 
The terms of Architectural Preservation Districts often combine binding and non-binding regulations. Under an Architectural Preservation District, major construction, alterations, and demolition exceeding a certain percentage are subject to binding regulatory review – meaning that approval from the review committee is absolutely necessary for the activity to proceed. On the other hand, most minor changes to exterior features – such as windows and doors – are either exempt from review or subject to non-binding regulatory review. In the case of non-binding regulatory review, the committee may rule on the activities, but approval is not necessary for construction to proceed. 
Currently, Maynard has no Architectural Preservation Districts. Architectural Preservation Districts are treated as bylaws, passed with a majority rule of Town Meeting or City Council. Typically, the bylaw is introduced by the town Historical Commission or by a neighborhood preservation organization. The Massachusetts Historical Commission recommends that involved parties first prepare a Study Report including: the reasons for proposing an Architectural Preservation District, descriptions of the historic resources in the area, evidence of public opinion, an outline of the terms of the bylaw, and a map of the proposed 
17 

district. Such studies can be costly, but thankfully, there are sources of funding specific to predevelopment projects (like studies), such as the MHC’s Preservation Planning Fund and Preservation Massachusetts’ Predevelopment Loan Fund (see pages 12-14). 
Preservation Deed Restrictions 
Preservation deed restrictions, as their name might suggest, are preservation restrictions written into the deed of a property. This means that even when the property changes ownership, the same requirements will apply. Sometimes, these restrictions are also known as historic preservation easements; however, although an easement protects an historic property in much the same way as a preservation deed restriction, it does not necessarily need to be written into the deed of the property to take effect. 
According to Massachusetts General Law, the Massachusetts Historical Commission must approve all preservation restrictions. In addition, any restrictions held by “a charitable corporation or trust” must also be approved by the local government. Deed restrictions are donated and enforced by the local government or a third-party organization, with the agreement of the property owner. Many are stipulated as a condition of receiving a local, state, or federal grant. 
Some preservation deed restrictions expire within a few years, while others last indefinitely. The content of the restrictions can vary, but generally they restrict alteration of specific historical features in the interior or exterior of the building, with the intent to preserve the historic character and/or increase the value of the property. 
One advantage of a preservation deed restriction is its versatility. No two historic properties are exactly alike; preservation deed restrictions can easily be customized to the specific needs of a property. They are also especially effective in preserving the character of a property that is passing from public to private ownership. 
Countless towns throughout Massachusetts – including Maynard -utilize preservation deed restrictions. In June of 2015, Maynard’s own Coolidge Reuse Taskforce Committee recommended that preservation restrictions such as these be imposed on the Coolidge School building. Though the future of the building remains to be seen, the Taskforce recognizes the importance and effectiveness of these restrictions in preserving historical properties. 
Demolition Delay Bylaws 
Demolition Delay Bylaws are a popular option among local governments looking to preserve their historic properties. Such a law delays the demolition of an historic building while alternative options can be explored. At present, Maynard has not passed a Demolition Delay Bylaw. 
Most Demolition Delay Bylaws take effect after the owner of a historic building applies for a demolition permit. The local Historical Commission then reviews the application to determine the historic significance of a building. If the building is not found to be historic, the demolition may proceed unhindered. However, if the building is found to be historic, the Commission holds a public hearing, at which the property owner may present his reasons for 
18 

demolishing the structure and the public may discuss. Finally, following the hearing, the Historical Commission votes whether or not to impose a demolition delay. 
While most provide for a substantial (six to eighteen month) delay, Demolition Delay Bylaws cannot prevent demolition in its entirety. Demolition remains a possibility unless an alternative is identified and a compromise is reached with the property owner. Thus, Demolition Delay Bylaws have the most success in communities where the people are interested and involved in the future of their historic properties. Community support can help pressure developers or property owners to consider an alternative to demolition. 
Affirmative Maintenance Bylaws 
Affirmative Maintenance Bylaws help protect threatened historic buildings from loss due to lack of maintenance. These bylaws may take several forms, but the most common form is known as a demolition by neglect bylaw. Demolition by neglect bylaws protect buildings that are deteriorating due to a lack of routine or major maintenance from being demolished. Such bylaws allow local regulatory authorities to identify threatened resources and order the building owners to take action. 
Typically, the local Historical Commission administers the terms of the Affirmative Maintenance Bylaw, working closely with the town’s code enforcement officers and building department to draft the legislation. Under the bylaw, the Historical Commission identifies endangered historic properties according to a clearly-defined set of standards (such the deterioration of major features or elements specified in the fire safety code), then contact the building owners. Building owners are required to make at least the minimum repairs necessary to comply with Bylaw regulations. In the event that the building owner fails to make the mandated repairs, the town may either levy a fine or, after financing the repairs, place a lien on the property. This lien temporarily transfers ownership of the property to the town, until the owner defrays the cost of the repairs. Since many building owners claim that their neglect was due to economic hardships, most bylaws also make provisions for such circumstances. 
Maynard has not yet passed an Affirmative Maintenance Bylaw. The passage of an Affirmative Maintenance Bylaw can only occur with a majority vote of the Town Meeting or City Council. 
Though this list of bylaws may seem long, it is in no way comprehensive. What appears above is merely a sampling of effective preservation legislation. For information regarding further types of legislation, please see the Massachusetts Historical Commission’s Preservation Through Bylaws and Ordinances manual, available through the MHC.

SECTION V: SAMPLE BUILDING ASSESSMENT 

In order to enact many of the above bylaws, the Massachusetts Historical Commission recommends that the local Historical Commission or other nominating organization first conducts a study or assessment. Sometimes the subjects of these studies are entire districts, while other times, they concern only specific properties. Studies are often conducted through third-party preservation organizations or private consultants, which may charge fees for their work. 
A sample outline for a building assessment appears below. It is modeled after Tappé Associates’ 2008 study of the Coolidge School Building in Maynard. The purpose of the building assessment was to determine the type, scale, and cost of necessary repairs to the Coolidge School. The full report is available for download on the Town Website, under the heading “Coolidge Reuse Taskforce Committee.” 
I. Project Overview 
Here, Tappé Associates detailed the purpose and contents of the study. In the case of the Coolidge School, the building owners – the Maynard School Department – requested an assessment of the building’s interior and exterior facilities, including its various systems. Readers can see that the study will include findings on all of these components, from their present conditions to repair cost estimates, as well as the consultants’ recommendations. As a term of the facility review, Tappé Associates also presented its findings to the Maynard School Committee and provided several copies of the Coolidge School Building Feasibility Study for distribution. 
II. General Building History 
Perhaps the most important part of studying an historic building is researching the reasons why it is historic. In this section, consultants provided a brief history of the construction, architecture, and uses of the Coolidge School. The building history also included evidence of prior major repairs to the School. Interestingly, Tappé Associates noted that there was “little documentation on the Coolidge School within the Town of Maynard.” 
III. Interior Building Conditions 
Here, the meat of the report begins. Tappé Associates collected and presented information on the walls, ceilings, floors, windows, doors, hardware, stairs, and toilets of the Coolidge School. Each part of the interior was sorted by material (i.e. drywall, plaster, and brick walls) and inspected for signs of damage. Then, Tappé Associates gave recommendations on what reparations could/should be made. As you can see, a building assessment must be complete, in order to provide the best possible picture on the status of the building. 
20 

IV. Exterior Envelope Conditions 
The same process was repeated for the exterior features of the building: roof, overhang, chimney, exterior walls, exterior windows, entryway, exterior doors, entry stairs, and storm drainage. In the case of the roof, Tappé Associates brought in an outside professional in roof maintenance for further consultation. Again, observations about the building conditions and recommendations for future maintenance and repair are provided. 
V. Systems Overview 
Building systems include heating, cooling, electricity, hot water, fire alarms, fire suppression, and technology. Again, Tappé Associates brought in outside professionals in the field to consult on the conditions of the systems in the Coolidge School Building. In this section, the consultants identified a major problem of the building: its lack of central air conditioning. This was one of the problems that contributed to the School Department’s vacancy of the building in 2014. 
VI. Building Accessibility for persons with Disabilities (MAAB) 
MAAB stands for the Massachusetts Architectural Access Board, a division of the Massachusetts state government mandating by law that all persons with disabilities should have “full, free and safe use of all buildings and facilities.” Here, Tappé Associates noted problems in the Coolidge School’s compliance with MAAB regulations, including its lack of an elevator and noncompliant handrails, bathroom stalls, and ramps. The consultants also noted the need for Braille signage within the building. 
VII. CMR Jurisdiction 
CMR simply stands for the Code of Massachusetts Regulations – or, in other words, Massachusetts State Law. Tappé Associates excerpted the portions of state law that applied to the proposed renovations on the building, according to the cost of renovations. 
VIII. Requirements Summary 
Finally, Tappé Associates detailed the cost estimates of the proposed renovations, prioritized by their urgency. The renovations were given rankings numbered 1-4: 1 meaning Currently Critical, 2 meaning Potentially Critical, 3 meaning Necessary, but Not Yet Critical, and 4 meaning Recommended. Recommendations were also placed in categories, such as Functionality, Integrity, Code Compliance, and Appearance, and sorted based on the primary system to which they applied (most were Architectural). At the end of the report, the recommendations were broken down in more detail, from specific repairs to their cost. In total, the recommended renovations on the Coolidge School amounted to more than $2 million. 
21 

The type of comprehensive information in the Tappé Report can be incredibly useful in painting a full picture of a property during the historic preservation process. For example, detailed research is required by the National Park Service when a building is nominated for the National Register of Historic Places. Additionally, when establishing Local Historic Districts and Architectural Preservation Districts, the state or local Historical Commissions may require a similar study before enacting the district. 
Likewise, property owners – such as the Maynard School Committee – frequently use these studies to determine whether or not their continued use of the building is effective and/or feasible, whether economically, physically, or otherwise. In the case of the Tappé Report, the Maynard School Committee determined that its continued use of the Coolidge School Building for its administrative facilities was not feasible. It vacated the building in 2014, leading the town government to create the Coolidge School Taskforce Committee, whose job was to make recommendations for the future maintenance and repair of the building. 
22 

SECTION VI: PUBLIC RELATIONS IN HISTORIC PRESERVATION 

PR and advertisement are a critical element of any historic preservation campaign or project. Whether led by the town government or a private organization, preservation projects need public support to thrive. Therefore, it is crucial to involve the public in the historic preservation process. Local publicity is key to achieving this goal; after all, if the public is unaware of their town’s historic properties and/or organizations, it can do nothing to help or support them. One way to target this need is through implementing local-level public relations strategies, to help publicize groups such as the local Historic Commission and their preservation projects. 
Public Relations 101 
The core of most PR strategies boils down to two key concepts: audience and message. 
Audience refers to the target of your efforts. In the case of a specific historic preservation objective, sample audiences could range from the Board of Selectmen, to the residents of a proposed Historic District, to a private developer hoping to demolish an historic structure. However, it is important to conduct more general publicity, too, among the residents of a town. After all, town residents can be the most critical audience for preservationists. Not only do town residents vote to enact preservation legislation, but oftentimes, they do not realize that preservation is an issue in their town. You can imagine how difficult it is to vote when you do not know what you are voting for! 
The rules of effective rhetoric require that you always bear in mind your audience when speaking, writing, or otherwise targeting it through a PR strategy. Whatever your media may be, always remember who it is you want to see your campaign. Imagine your target audience being represented by a single individual: who are they? How old are they? What are their interests, beliefs, concerns? If you are hoping to target a wide range of individuals – such as an entire town full of people – this can be difficult. Consulting town censuses or conducting a survey can help you narrow down the identity of your target audience. SurveyMonkey (www.surveymonkey.com) is a free online survey-taking service that you may find useful in your efforts. 
Message refers, quite simply, to the message you want to send to your audience. What are the core beliefs of your preservation group or project? What do you hope to say and/or achieve with your public relations campaign? Whether your ultimate goal is to convince voters to enact a Demolition Delay Bylaw, or merely to generate awareness of the local Historical Commission, it is important to clearly and concisely define your message. The Wisconsin Historical Society recommends boiling it down to a list of three to five key talking points. However, most importantly, make your message one you believe in. Your message should be something you can be proud of, and something you can generate honest enthusiasm for. If your audience does not see that you care about historic preservation, they won’t see why they should care, either. 
23 

Sample Public Relations Strategies 
Press Releases 
A press release is a public relations announcement issued to the media, in order to publicize new and noteworthy developments in your organization and/or preservation project. Press releases cover the “Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How?” of specific events – for example, the passage of a new preservation Bylaw in your town – and are submitted directly to the media (newspapers, radio, etc.) for review. Press releases should be one-to-two pages in length and follow standard formatting: typed, double-spaced, and bearing the proper heading. When published, press releases can be effective in reaching a large audience, fast. However, press releases are subject to the editor’s discretion, meaning that they can sometimes be overlooked in favor of more “exciting” news. 
Print Publications 
Though in today’s internet age, brochures and flyers may seem a bit “old-school,” they are still effective in providing a concise explanation of your organization’s message. However, you do not need to be limited to brochures and/or flyers, either. More creative strategies – for example, a coloring book for children, a word search, a “Historic Preservation Dos and Don’ts” list, etc. – can and should be pursued. One effective strategy used by the Maynard Historical Commission in the past was the Historic Walking Tours of Maynard. Available for print on the town website and as brochures at the Maynard Public Library, these walking tours not only raised awareness of the Historical Commission, but also of the town’s fascinating history. 
Newsletters and E-mail Campaigns 
Many historical organizations, including the Maynard Historical Society, publish a weekly, monthly, or annual newsletter. Though it will undoubtedly reach a smaller audience than a larger media source might, self-publishing a newsletter is a great way to guarantee that your news will be seen. However, publishing a print newsletter can quickly become expensive. If you are internet-savvy, an e-mail newsletter or campaign is one effective alternative to publishing a print newsletter. One online service, MailChimp, will allow you to send 12,000 e­mails to up to 2,000 subscribers for free. Using this service, you can embed a virtual sign-up sheet on your organization’s website, or use platforms such as Facebook to collect subscribers. 
Social Media Campaigns 
Social media campaigns are a relatively new strategy in public relations; however, they can be extremely effective in targeting the younger demographic. While some cannot vote themselves, young people are often vocal and passionate about the issues they care about, and will help generate even more publicity for your campaign. Social media campaigns use different online platforms to advertise. For example, your organization or project could launch a Facebook page, Twitter account, Instagram, or online discussion forum. Using these accounts, 
24 

you could use photo or caption contests, video contests, viral sweepstakes (where users leave a comment or make a post in order to enter a contest), and/or hashtags (online search keywords denoted by the pound key symbol, #) to advertise. 
Another great benefit of social media is how quickly it spreads information. If you are looking to reach a large, broad audience of people, then the web is a prime target for your PR efforts. 
Events 
By far, events are the costliest and most demanding of these public relations strategies. They require an extraordinary amount of planning in order to be effective. However, when pulled off right, events can generate an incredible amount of publicity. They allow you to interact directly with your audience, so they are receiving your message straight from the source. Fundraising events can also be effective, as they not only allow you to generate capital that can be used for your preservation projects, but also allow the public to feel as if they are directly contributing to the success of these projects. 
The Maynard Historical Society has hosted many events in the past, including lectures at the town Library and talks at their annual meetings (all open to the public). In Maynard, we are also fortunate enough to host an annual town fair, Maynardfest. Renting a table at Maynardfest is relatively inexpensive, and allows organizations to reach a wide audience of people from in and around Maynard.

SECTION VII: PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT AND HISTORIC PRESERVATION 
The private sector is an important component of any country’s economy. Comprising of various ventures owned by individuals (rather than the federal, state, or local governments), a thriving private sector is a symbol of a country’s wealth and status. In the United States, it is a gleaming exemplar of the capitalism we fought so hard to protect during the Cold War. 
Private developers make their living off of building new properties and investing in old ones, creating new businesses and new jobs, and growing the country’s economy. Though new construction is a prominent aspect of this job, the rehabilitation of historic properties is an area of interest for many developers, too. 
However, some private developers are intimidated by historic properties, dreading the accompanying restrictions and limitations, the heavy hand of the town government. Some may also believe that the price of historic rehabilitation far outweighs the profit, but this is simply not true. 
Private developers have no reason to fear historic properties. As Michael Ainslie – former president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation – once said, “Preservation is not just saving landmarks. It is [an] economic development strategy.” Often, historic properties are effective, sustainable, successful alternatives to new construction. They provide private-sector developers with a new opportunity, not an old burden. 
An Introduction to Private Development 
As preservationists, we easily see the intrinsic value in our historic properties. When we look at an historic building, we see the contributions our history has made to our country, our lives, and our culture. Unfortunately, private developers cannot always afford to view historic properties in this light. In order to understand why private developers sometimes view a property’s historic status as a negative – and in order to counteract that opinion – we must first begin to think like them. 
Private-sector developers are in the business of buying, owning, and selling properties. Therefore, they are inherently familiar with the rights that accompany the buying, owning, and selling of properties. In the United States, there are four types of property rights: private ownership, public open access, public closed access, and state ownership. These forms of ownership simply concern who has the right to regulate the property, be it the state, a single individual, a collection of individuals, or some combination thereof. 
True private ownership of a property would allow the property owner to buy, develop, alter, and sell the property as he or she pleases. Though private developers typically have private ownership of their properties, they still fall subject to many federal, state, and local regulations. Property owners reserve the rights to lease, sell, mortgage, and otherwise manage their property, but the state still reserves its rights to tax the property, seize it for public use, or repossess it (in the case of death), among other actions. 
Many private developers believe that, because historic properties are sometimes more heavily protected by the government, investing in an historic property will force them to 
26 

renounce more of their property rights. Sometimes, this may be true; for example, a developer who purchases a property with a preservation deed restriction renounces his right to alter the property in certain ways. However, in most cases, an historic property does not present with more limitations – and the ways in which these properties are limited are balanced by or even outweighed by their economic benefits. 
As Neil Mayer, professor of agricultural economics and rural sociology at the University of Idaho, writes, “the property rights of private owners are shared with the public.” Sometimes, these public interests conflict with the developer’s private business interests. The key to working with historic properties as a private developer is learning to balance public and private interests. A developer who is willing to sacrifice some of his property rights for the public good opens himself up to tremendous profits in historic redevelopment. 
Sustainable Development and Adaptive Reuse 
Private developers are faced with many options in their work. Demolition, new construction, and the redevelopment of older structures number among those myriad options. Arguably, all of these options could be viable under the perfect conditions, but the perfect conditions rarely exist. In real life conditions, development must be sustainable to succeed. 
Sustainability conserves resources and earns profits not just now, but in the long run. Often, demolition and new construction are less sustainable than the redevelopment of older structures. Therefore, sustainable development and historic preservation go hand-in-hand; one cannot exist without the other. 
According to scholar Angi Fuller Wildt at the University of South Carolina, “the most environmentally sustainable buildings are those that are already built.” New construction and demolition are not only less “green” than the restoration of an old building, but also frequently more expensive. 
Economic sustainability is just as much a part of sustainable development principles as environmental sustainability. For example, when a building’s original materials are maintained, money is invested in local sources, rather than overseas. The maintenance of the building’s original character, through the preservation of its materials, provides another form of sustainability: cultural sustainability. The character of an area – its traditions, its customs, its way of life – is represented in the preserved history. Together, environmental, economic, and cultural sustainability lay the foundation for sustainable development. 
Even if it is the most economically, environmentally, and culturally beneficial option, conserving an historic building through sustainable development is not without its own challenges. For example, an historic building’s original use may not align with its most sustainable future use, which can present challenges with zoning, or the town’s allowed uses for the building. An old mill might be zoned for industrial use only, but a developer may see potential for a residential use in the future. This is actually where adaptive reuse becomes most effective. Adaptive reuse allows the developer to refurbish an old structure for a purpose different from its original use. 
27 

Adaptive Reuse Zoning 
Private developers can take many actions to make their job easier on the town. Likewise, the town must also take action to make historic redevelopment easier on the developer. 
In some towns, zoning designations can hinder opportunities for the reuse of vacant or underutilized historic buildings – especially when the town is looking to attract a private developer. Adaptive reuse zoning lets the town government expand the allowed uses for the building by amending the existing zoning bylaw. For example, an empty mill building zoned for industrial use could be rezoned for commercial, residential, or mixed uses. The bylaw should also contain site plan review or design guidelines to encourage developers to preserve the defining historical characteristic of the building. 
The town Planning Board typically drafts Adaptive Reuse Zoning Bylaws. Before amending zoning bylaws, the Massachusetts Historic Commission recommends that the property is studied to determine its best uses. Then, the most effective method of rezoning can be determined based on these uses. 
At present, Maynard does not have an Adaptive Reuse Zoning Bylaw. In order to pass an Adaptive Reuse Zoning amendment, the town Planning Board must hold a public hearing and issue a report to town meeting or city council. Only with a 2/3 majority vote in town meeting or city council can the amendment be passed. Therefore, it is crucial for the local legislative body to garner community support for town preservation efforts prior to such a vote. 
Economic Benefits of Historic Properties 
The reuse of historic properties can be economically prosperous in both the public and private sectors. Some of these benefits result merely from the practicality of historic redevelopment. Other times, the public sector is willing to reward the developer with extra benefits as compensation for the property rights he or she has sacrificed for the greater good. Either way, there are many opportunities for private developers to profit from their historic investments. 
Federal and State Designations 
In most cases, special designations awarded by the federal and state governments – such as the National and State Registers of Historic Places – are only honorary, meaning that they have no legal bearing over what happens to the building. For private developers, this is good news: in the case of such a designation, the historic status of the building does not interfere with the development process. 
Additionally, these designations can provide economic benefits to private property owners. Studies have proven that historical designations – particularly in historic districts – increase residential property values over time, by as much as 35%. One reason for this is that historic designations can sometimes protect properties from fluctuations in the housing market. This stability can attract more and more investors, also causing an increase in property values. 
28 

On the other hand, newer construction in historic districts was shown to consistently depreciate in value, making adaptive reuse a more viable method for development in these areas. 
Tax Credits and Easements 
Tax credits are incentives provided by the government that can significantly reduce the amount of taxes a property owner must pay. At the federal level, both tax credits and easements (otherwise known as preservation deed restrictions) give private property owners the opportunity to return on their investments. A 20% tax credit is available for income-producing historic properties, and a 10% tax credit is available for properties built prior to 1936. Property owners who donate an easement or preservation deed restriction to their property, requiring all subsequent property owners to protect certain historic features of the building, may also be eligible for a federal income tax deduction. More information on federal tax credits can be found on page 9. 
Tourism 
In 2014, the travel and tourism industries accounted for 3.1% of the U.S. economy. That same year, the tourism industry generated over 105 million jobs. 
As you can see, the business of tourism can be a lucrative investment for a private developer. Heritage tourism – traveling to experience the history and culture of both past and present – is one part of that business, one directly reliant on historic preservation. Even in small towns, historic sites can be major draws for heritage tourists. If those sites are not aptly preserved, they lose much of their charm and allure – and the economy loses a substantial profit. 
Tourism can be not only profitable to the town, but profitable to a private developer as well. For example, a refurbished farmhouse could make a successful private museum on the history of agriculture. Or, an old jailhouse could be transformed into a novel restaurant – as is the case of the A&B burger joint in Salem, MA. 
Small Business and Downtown Revitalization 
Businesses unrelated to tourism may also find a suitable home in an historic building. According to urban activist Jane Jacobs, newer businesses – such as local boutiques and small start-ups – are more frequently attracted to the charm of older buildings than sleeker, more modern designs. 
Privately-owned businesses can profit from historic preservation even when their properties are not the ones in question. In many small towns, including Maynard, small businesses form the heart of the town’s economy and culture. The appearance of these businesses’ storefronts is one of the most important components of their advertising and marketing strategies. Some communities are finding that their downtown areas are suffering as their storefronts begin to deteriorate. 
The rehabilitation of historic storefronts can draw more customers to these small downtown businesses. However, it is important to preserve the historic character of the 
29 

storefront in the revitalization process. Though a shiny, modern exterior may hold superficial appeal, many customers will also be attracted to the charm of an historic storefront. 
Many towns are passing bylaws – such as those enacting historic districts (see pages 16­17) – to protect the historic character of their storefronts. Though private developers should undoubtedly be familiar with the nature of these bylaws, they should not be intimidated by them. Ultimately, when the community is happy with the developer, the happiest customers will present. 
Here in Maynard, we are proud to invest ourselves in the future of our businesses downtown – and we recognize the substantial effect that the revitalization of storefronts can have on those businesses. In Maynard, no organization better represents that interest than the Revitalize Maynard Collaborative. One of the most notable achievements of the organization is its commitment to rejuvenating storefronts downtown. For example, the organization sponsored a “Downtown Spruce Up” prior to Maynardfest, where businesses “spruced up” their storefronts in celebration of the festivities. 
Partnering with the Local Government 
As previously stated, private developers must often share their property rights with the public. Most of the time, the public does not deal with the developer directly. Instead, the government – representing the public interest – collaborates and compromises with the developer. The more successful the collaboration between private and public interests, the more successful the venture will be to the developer and the town. This is especially true in cases of historic preservation, as the public frequently harbors deep attachment and pride toward its history. While it is crucial for private developers to honor that history, the town should honor the developer’s goals for the property, too. When a developer succeeds in transforming an historic property into an income-producing business, the town as well as the developer can reap the economic and cultural benefits. 
Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) 
A public-private partnership is the technical term for a collaboration between a private developer and the government, in which private management is introduced into a public service. Public-private partnerships can comprise anything from a National Park Service contract with a private construction firm to the shared ownership of a building between the developer and the town government. These partnerships are entered into via long-term contracts between the developer and the town. The building does not necessarily need to be historic for a PPP to exist, but for our purposes, we will be focusing specifically on the implications of a PPP for an historic property, known as Heritage PPPs. 
PPPs of any kind can be beneficial to both the public and private parties. Obviously, the private developer serves a public interest simply by entering into the PPP. However, a developer can also provide fresh insight and creative innovation to bring that public interest to its fullest potential. In some cases, private investors also can provide the public with much-needed capital; in other cases, the public might fund the developer’s vision. PPPs can also be beneficial to developers because they allow the investor to share the risk of the venture with another entity. 
30 

Also significant is the influence that local governments have over public opinion. Public parties can help private developers gain local support for their projects. 
In most heritage PPPs, the private developer partners with the local government. The role of the local government, or “public partner,” is to regulate and protect the building, while the private partner handles the economic side of the partnership and typically maintains long­term ownership and management of the property. Oftentimes, a third partner – a non-profit organization (NGO) – also enters the PPP, but assumes only a passive role in the process. Sometimes, the non-profit may share ownership with the private partner; other times, they may simply hold the local government accountable for its role in the site’s preservation and help to influence public opinion regarding the PPP. The NGO may also be able to provide historic expertise in a way that neither the public nor private parties can. 
In most cases, the building in question is one that is troublesome for the local government to maintain; the private developer helps to relieve some of the town’s stress, but in the meantime, the preservation of the building is still ensured. Because of the gap between the cost of rehabilitating an historic building and the resulting value of the building, the private developer frequently looks for the public partner to provide some type of funding. Since this funding can be daunting to provide, several public institutions may enter into the PPP in this role, though usually only the local government is considered the “public partner” of the developer. Usually, the local government provides economic incentive in the form of tax credits or grants. Provisions for adaptive reuse (see pages 27-28) are another common component of a PPP. 
By entering a long-term contract with the developer, the public can be assured that the building will be preserved for at least one year or longer. Provisions are also made for the public partner, in order to ensure the protection of the building’s historic character. For example, the PPP may stipulate maintenance requirements, approvals for major changes, the prohibition of demolition, and/or the reversion of ownership to the public at the end of the lease. Preservation deed restrictions (see page 18) may also be added onto the lease to ensure that these restrictions continue to apply to subsequent owners of the property. 
The tremendous benefits of public-private partnerships should be shared with local citizens. As long as both parties remain transparent and accountable with the public, PPPs can be a great way for a developer to make his profit while still ensuring the protection of an historic property. Alternatively, PPPs can lose public support when there is a lack of transparency and accountability on either side of the agreement.

SECTION VIII: HISTORIC PRESERVATION FOR HOMEOWNERS 
Houses can be historic just as other buildings can. While not all historic houses still serve a residential function, many still do, presenting a unique set of concerns for homeowners looking to preserve the historic character of their homes. Many of the resources available to public and private owners of historic properties – such as preservation consultant services (see page 14) – are also useful to historic homeowners. Historic homeowners may also be subject to the conditions of preservation bylaws, like historic districts, just as private developers are. Nevertheless, some resources and concerns are unique especially to historic homeowners. In this section, you will find information unique to historic homes; however, historic homeowners are still recommended to consult the rest of this guide for other relevant information and/or resources. 
Insurance 
If you have owned an historic home for some time now, you are probably already familiar with the effects of your property’s history on insurance rates. However, if you have just bought or are considering buying an historic home, you may be surprised to learn that typical insurance coverage might not cut it when it comes to your historic home. 
The reason for this is, quite simply, age. Many historic homes have unique characteristics that must be preserved using period materials, which can be more difficult and/or more expensive than repairing a typical home. Historic properties are typically sorted into two categories: those built before 1945 and those built before 1900. While owners of homes built before 1945 might consider a typical homeowner policy with some additional coverage, owners of homes built before 1900 should definitely consider an historic home policy -from a firm that specializes in historic homes -that includes restoration coverage. While this type of coverage can cost more, in the long run, the benefits far outweigh the costs for historic homes with unique architectural features. 
Likewise, if you purchase a “fixer-upper” historic home, typical insurance coverage may do at first; however, as you restore and upgrade the home, its value will increase, meaning that this policy may no longer apply. Therefore, experts recommend that homeowners do an annual check of their insurance needs to make sure they are getting the coverage that works best for them. 
The best way to determine how much insurance coverage your historic home needs is to obtain an insurance cost appraisal from an appraiser or a restoration contractor with extensive knowledge of historic properties. After receiving an appraisal, contact your insurance company and increase your building’s coverage limit to the appraised value. 
Insurance policies for historic homes should include replacement-in-kind coverage, which will ensure the preservation of hard-to-replace details – such as hand-crafted wood features, decorative moldings, or stained glass windows – in the event of damage or destruction. This can be added onto a standard insurance policy, but is typically included in policies specifically for historic homeowners. When guaranteed replacement cost coverage is unavailable, ask about extended replacement cost coverage; though it is a step down from guaranteed replacement 
32 

coverage, it will add an extra layer of protection to your historic home. If your historic home also includes expensive antiques or artwork, you will also want to insure those items, as most standard insurance policies only cover the market value of the home. 
Standard insurance policies also tend to include something called a “co-insurance clause,” which is a warning sign for historic homeowners. A co-insurance clause requires the policy holder to maintain a minimum insurance limit of around 80-90% of the property’s value. If you are underinsured, this clause enables the insurance company to decrease your claim payment by the same percentage as you are underinsured. This can result in the loss of important historic characteristics that may be particularly expensive to restore. 
Insuring an historic home can be pricey, costing up to 20% more than standard insurance rates. Luckily, there are a few precautions historic homeowners can take to lower these premiums. Installing modern safety tools, such as smoke detectors, sprinkler systems, and burglar alarms, can help lower your insurance rate without compromising the historic character of your home. Any restorations, repairs or upgrades performed on your home should also comply with federal, state, and local building codes. As previously stated, modern repairs and upgrades can change your insurance policy by increasing the value of your home; however, upgrading old plumbing and electrical systems can, in some cases, help convince firms to insure your historic home. 
Maintenance 
Historic homes, like other historic properties, sometimes have a reputation for being expensive, due to the substantial amount of upkeep that is sometimes needed to preserve the historic character of the property. However, regularly inspecting your historic home and performing the necessary maintenance can actually prevent the property from costing you more in the future, as many costly problems are caused by a lack of proper routine maintenance. A brief overview of the recommended inspection and maintenance procedures for historic homeowners, adapted from Preserve Rhode Island, is provided below. 
Once a year: 
. 	Inspect the external wood features of your home (sills, cornices, doors, porch flooring, etc.) for damage, making sure to fill any cracks with a caulk or epoxy specifically designed for exterior use. In addition to filling them, unsealed joints should also be primed and painted with a good quality exterior paint. If decayed wood is found, it is important to locate and stop the source of moisture as soon as possible to prevent further damage, which can quickly become costly and inconvenient. 
. 	Inspect all wooden railings and fences for deterioration, rust, moisture damage, etc. Repair, prime, and paint/stain them as necessary. Any metal fixtures (other than those made from aluminum) can be cleaned using a wire brush and primed/painted using paints made specifically for that metal. Aluminum should be cleaned with a mild detergent, primed with zinc chromate, and painted with paint designed for aluminum only. Alternatively, bare aluminum can be protected using varnish or wax. 
. 	Inspect all structural systems, including exposed exterior and interior surfaces of walls and all exposed roof framing members. Check for signs of movement and/or deterioration in all walls, both interior and exterior. Inspect roof supports for rotted, 
33 

cracked, or splitting timbers. In the event that significant damage is discovered, consult a structural engineer who is familiar with the nature of historic buildings. Engineers who are not familiar with historic buildings might recommend overly-aggressive solutions to structural problems. 
. 	Have a professional exterminator check for termites and other wood-damaging insects once a year. Treat appropriately if necessary. 
Twice a year: 
. 	Foundations and steps should not only be inspected in the fall and spring, but also after any major storms. Proper drainage is the best form of prevention for any foundational problems. However, one should still check twice yearly for cracks or leaks (water in the cellar is often a dead giveaway). If a crack or leak is discovered, consult a mason familiar with historic masonry and be sure to match the original mortar in color, texture, and composition, in order to preserve its historic character. Also, do not use any chemicals or other harsh methods, such as sandblasting, to clean your historic masonry. 
. 	Chimneys and fireplaces must be inspected for signs of crumbling, loose or missing stones. If damage is discovered, consult a mason familiar with historic masonry and be sure to match the original mortar in color, texture, and composition. 
. 	Proper roof maintenance entails regular cleaning of the gutters and/or downspouts, and the replacement of deteriorating flashing. Additionally, not only should the roof be inspected in the fall and spring, but it should also be checked after any winds higher than 40 mph. Roof sheathing should be checked for proper ventilation, and roof shingles should be checked for any worn or missing components. Also, check the nails and clips to make sure that all components of the roof are properly secured and no water can leak through. Leaks and loose attachments should be repaired immediately, while plywood, rolled asphalt roofing, or tar paper can provide a temporary solution for more serious damage. 
. 	Appropriate surface cleaning techniques should be used on all window frames, including but not limited to rust removal, limited paint removal, and reapplication of protective coatings. Making windows weather-tight may also be effective to reduce damage and increase thermal efficiency; this can be done either be re-caulking or installing weatherstripping. Treating the window frames with a 1:1 mixture of linseed oil and mineral spirits prior to repair can help extend the life of the wood. For windows, it is also especially important to limit any replacements made to the original window frames. Repair is a more viable option for historic preservation; however, selective replacements may be made to the frames when necessary. 
. 	The preservation of the exterior wood features of your home is especially important because it is a huge part of what gives it its historic character. Proper drainage is the best way to prevent wood damage. Also, avoid power-washing, as it can allow water to seep in unnoticed. If repainting of the exterior wood is ever necessary, avoid stripping paint layers, as these layers help protect the wood from water and UV damage. All new work to the exterior wood features of the building should be done “in-kind,” using the same materials, techniques, dimensions, and configuration as in the original design. 
Three or more times per year: 
34 

. 	Check gutters and downspouts frequently, including after any storms or high winds. Leaks should be repaired, clogs should be cleaned, and loose gutters/downspouts should be properly reattached. To protect the foundation of your home from water damage, consider installing a downspout leader or tray, and/or wood gutters (which have superior tensile strength). Also, install any downspout replacements with the seams facing away from the wall to avoid leaks from damaging the sidewall features of the building. 
. 	Paint should be inspected on a regular basis for bare spots, blistering, peeling, and mildew. Stopping leaks as quickly as possible helps to prevent mildew, but if you still discover mildewed areas of your home, these areas can be cleansed with a mixture of 1 part bleach to 10 parts water. Any paint or primer used on your home should be compatible with the materials and any preservatives used on the material. 
“Going Green” in an Historic Home 
News of climate change has rocked the nation for decades now, leading many homeowners to become more energy efficient, or “go green.” Luckily, many historic homes were originally built with energy-saving features such as thick walls, light-reflecting finishes, vents, and shade-providing awnings and/or porches. Maximizing the energy-saving potential of these preexisting features is a cost-effective way to “go green” in an historic home. 
For example, in the Northeast, “saltbox-style” homes were designed with sloped roofs, to direct cold winds up and over the house, keeping it warmer in wintertime. Chimneys were placed in the center of the house to allow heat to radiate outward, and houses and outbuildings were typically grouped in L or U-shapes to create a sheltered area in which to work. Thick masonry walls also help keep the house warm during the day and cool at night by absorbing the sun’s rays during the day. These classically-historic features can reduce the need for heating systems in the winter and cooling systems in the summer, providing great potential for energy efficiency even in the modern era. 
Besides their original energy-saving designs, historic homes can also be made more energy efficient through simple changes and/or upgrades. The National Trust for Historic Preservation recommends starting with a professional energy audit – or performing your own – to identify a baseline for your home’s energy efficiency. After that, you are ready to begin “going green!” 
Reducing air infiltration is one of the easiest, most effective ways to improve your energy efficiency. Cracks in attic floors and doors, among other openings, allow conditioned air to leak outside, increasing the cost of cooling. Certain problems – such as wet or moldy insulation, a history of ice dams in the winter, and/or knob and tube wiring – may require a professional contractor to fix. However, attic air leaks can often be sealed oneself using a combination of fiberglass insulation, foil insulation or drywall, and caulk. Drafts can also be reduced significantly by taking simple measures such as closing curtains or shades at night, using rolled towels or “draft snakes” at the bottoms of doors, and closing fireplace dampers when not in use. 
Heating and cooling systems can sap energy when used inefficiently. Before replacing your HVAC system – a costly upgrade which, in an historic home, could also increase your insurance premiums -address any problems with your air infiltration. You can also take simple, 
35 

“do-it-yourself” measures to reduce your heating and cooling bills. For example, the hot water system – which accounts for about 13% of the energy bill in most homes – can be used more efficiently by insulating the pipes and turning the thermostat down to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. You might also consider installing a tankless hot water system or solar-powered hot water system, without significantly impacting altering the historic character of your home. Geothermal heat pumps can also be more energy efficient; however, if your historic property is also part of an historic landscape, your property may need to be evaluated for archaeological resources before geothermal pumps can be installed. 
Finally, retrofitting windows – rather than replacing them with newer, more energy-efficient windows – is a cheaper, more viable option to increase the energy efficiency of historic homes, as it allows the owner to preserve the original historic windows (if they are intact). According to the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s Green Lab, the rate of return for retrofitted windows amounted to 3-4%: nearly double that of installing modern, energy-efficient windows. Retrofitting strategies include weather stripping and sealing and installing exterior storm windows or interior cellular shades. What option you choose should depend on the climate in which you live and the other needs of your home; in other words, make sure you are prepared for the next harsh New England winter! 
National Trust for Historic Preservation Programs 
In addition to funding and aiding in public and private historic preservation efforts, the National Trust for Historic Preservation also offers several products and services designed specifically for owners of historic homes. A sampling of these services appears below. 
National Trust Insurance Services’ Historic Property Coverage 
In the event that your historic home requires specialized coverage, National Trust Insurance Services (NTIS) is a division of the National Trust for Historic Preservation specializing in insuring historic properties. Working with its partner – Maury, Donnelly, & Parr 
– NTIS ensures that “the hidden costs of historic reconstruction” are covered under its insurance policy. These “hidden costs” include: skilled craftspeople, hard-to-match materials, extra time for rebuilding, and additional professional services (to help with recertification and recovery of tax benefits, among others). NTIS covers the increased cost of construction for historic buildings, historic certification expenses, the loss of local, state, and/or federal tax benefits, increased building assessments, and green building upgrades, to increase energy efficiency when possible. It also provides historic homeowners with extra time to restore your property in compliance with landmark and other building laws. In addition to this Historic Property Coverage, NTIS also offers Builder’s Risk insurance for properties being renovated or reconstructed. For more information on Historic Property Coverage, contact National Trust Insurance (see pages 39-40). 
Valspar Historic Color Palettes 
The National Trust for Historic Preservation has partnered with the paint company Valspar to make a special product available to owners of historic homes. Together, the two 
36 

parties designed an historic paint selection of over 250 colors. Available exclusively at Lowe’s, the collection features four palettes, named for historic American architectural styles and sourced from historic buildings around the country: Georgian, Neoclassical, Southwestern, and Victorian. These paints allow historic homeowners to repair their homes with an affordable, easy-to-obtain product. Valspar also supplies paint to the National Trust’s own historic sites. 
Unico System Green Series 
The National Trust for Historic Preservation also partnered with the energy company Unico to design and manufacture an effective small-duct central heating and cooling system. Such a system is particularly effective for historic homes, where larger-duct systems cannot be fitted without compromising the historic and architectural character of the home. The Unico System has been installed in the National Trust’s historic properties across the country, from the Mark Twain House to President Lincoln’s Cottage. 
Historic New England Programs 
Historic New England – then known as the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities – is a private organization founded by William Sumner Appleton in 1910. Since then, Historic New England has acquired thirty-six historic museums and a collection of over 110,000 relics. In addition to managing these sites and educating the public, Historic New England also provides various preservation services to historic homeowners. The organization is dedicated to preserving each historic site with as little impact as possible on the original historic fabric of the building. 
Historic Homeowner Membership 
The majority of Historic New England’s benefits are provided through its Historic Homeowner Membership program. Though it is not free, it allows members to take advantage of preservation services such as: e-mail or telephone consultations, virtual technical assistance, e-newsletters, and special members-only workshops. It also has the added benefit of free admission to all thirty-six of Historic New England’s museums! Membership costs $50.00 per individual or $60.00 per household. Please contact of Historic New England (see page 46) for more information. 
Preservation Easement Program 
Historic homeowners can partner with Historic New England to donate a preservation easement (aka preservation deed restriction – see page 18) to their home, preventing future alterations or neglect from damaging the building’s historic character. Before a property is approved for a preservation easement, Historic New England will conduct substantial research, such as compiling historic and/or architectural background information and evaluating the significant features of the site. After approving your property for an easement and conducting the necessary legal proceedings, Historic New England continues to monitor the property; all repairs and alterations must be approved by the organization before they can proceed. When a preservation easement is donated to a National Register or historic district building, the donor 
37 

may be eligible for a federal tax deduction. Contact Historic New England (see page 46) for more information. 
SECTION IX: ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

SECTION X: PRESERVATION SUCCESS STORIES 
Though historic preservation sometimes seems exclusive to National Parks and museums, we can witness preservation in our own backyard. From National Register sites to Community Preservation projects, Maynard is home to many exemplars of historic preservation. A sampling of Maynard’s past preservation projects appears below, to help inspire and provide guidelines for future preservation. 
Glenwood Cemetery 
Glenwood Cemetery has existed in Maynard, MA since the town’s formation in the early 1870s. It contains more than 6,000 gravesites, including those of 54 Civil War veterans. Many famous locals, including town founder Amory Maynard, were buried there, and its monuments are excellent representations of the artistic and architectural styles of the time. Perhaps most importantly, the cemetery represents the diverse cast of immigrants who populated Maynard at the time, including names of English, Scottish, Irish, Russian, Polish, Finnish, Swedish, and Greek descent. Interestingly enough, research also suggests a moderate to high potential of locating Native American and other archaeological artifacts and resources in the area. 
As a result, Glenwood Cemetery received recognition from the National Park Service as a National Register property on May 4, 2004. To this day, the Cemetery remains the only historic site in Maynard to receive a National Register designation. 
In 2013, the Maynard Historical Commission embarked on a CPA-funded project to repair the fence surrounding Glenwood Cemetery. The fence, gradually damaged by many New England winters, was deemed too ramshackle to restore, so replacing the fence became the focus of the project instead. The annual Town Meeting allocated Community Preservation Act and Perpetual Care funds toward the project, which has been executed as a group effort of the Historical Commission, Maynard Department of Public Works, and MassCor Industries. 
The Maynard Mill 
The Maynard Mill -originally owned and operated by town founder Amory Maynard and his partner William Knight -has remained the heart of Maynard’s cultural and commercial life, despite numerous changes in ownership and use. The Mill, which opened in 1847, and its prospects of work attracted a sprawling and diverse population of immigrants to the town. Ten years later, the Mill closed in a nationwide recession. The only original Mill building still standing today has been moved across the street and adaptively reused as an apartment house. 
During the Civil War, the Mill reopened under the leadership of the American Woolen Company, cranking out woolen textiles for use by the Union army. Its success -and the influx of immigrant work -were so overwhelming that the Mill managed to stay in business until the Great Depression, when the national financial crisis forced it to sell all of its housing. 
47 

The Mill reopened again during World Wars I and II to produce blankets and jackets for American soldiers. However, when peace resumed, business once again dwindled due to the outsourcing of factory jobs overseas and the increased use of synthetic fibers. Luckily, in 1857, two young engineers from MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory secured space in the mill complex for their startup, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). DEC, like so many of the Mill’s prior endeavors, evolved into a tremendous success, growing to become the second largest employer in the State of Massachusetts (second only to the Commonwealth itself!). In 1974, DEC was acquired by Compac, which maintained offices in the Mill complex until 1998. 
After the absence of DEC, the Mill complex was first reused for commercial use as Clock Tower Place in the early 2000s, ushering in a new era of business triumphs and trials for the town of Maynard. In March of 2015, Clock Tower Place was acquired by Saracen Properties, a private developer with big plans for the future of the Mill. 
“Built in 1847. Reborn in 2016.” “1.1 million square feet of pure potential.” These are just a few of the slogans for Saracen Properties’ planned revitalization of the Maynard Mill and former Clock Tower Place, each of which captures both the historic essence and the bright future of the property. The company has rechristened the complex “Mill and Main” and is currently redesigning it for mixed uses. Its amenities will include ground-floor retail, a riverside boardwalk, and a brand-new brew pub operated by Battle Road Brewing, which opened in August 2015. Saracen’s creative transformation and expansion of the Mill’s preexisting resources makes Mill and Main a prime example of adaptive reuse. 
ArtSpace and Acme Theater 
On January 2, 1924, the town of Maynard voted to erect an eight-room schoolhouse on Summer Street. Emerson Junior High School – built by the T.P. Hurley Construction Company of Marlborough, Mass – officially opened for use two years later, on January 19, 1926. The addition of the George Washington Auditorium would join this school with the former High School, leading the complex to be renamed the Emerson-Fowler School. The name was later shortened to the Fowler Junior High, and eventually the Fowler Middle School. 
When construction on a new Fowler Middle School began, the question of what to do with the old one loomed over every head in town. In 1996, the town voted to appoint a Fowler School Building Reuse Committee. As all these changes were happening, a local group of artists 
– informally called the Assabet River Artists Association (ARAA) – assembled, creating an impetus for the transformation of the school into art studios. 
Perfectly enough, the Reuse Committee concluded in 1999 that the most suitable use for the building was lease to a nonprofit cultural or arts group. The building was officially transferred to ArtSpace, Inc. in January of 2001. Studios remain in high demand, as 43 studios are shared between 75 artists and only one or two spaces become available each year. 
Meanwhile, Acme Theater Productions – a community theatre troupe -shares ArtSpace’s residency in the old Fowler. Though the group formed in 1992, Acme Theater did not officially become a non-profit corporation until 2001, conveniently as the reused school began to seek occupants. A few minor injuries later, the Fowler’s old wood shop was converted by hand into a 70-seat theater. 
48 

Together, ArtSpace and Acme Theater form the cultural center of Maynard. Not only is the complex at the old Fowler School a perfect example of adaptive reuse; it is also a living, breathing, thriving work of art in and of itself. 
Coolidge School 
The Coolidge School was one of several elementary schools built in the early 1900s to account for the growing population of mill workers and their children. The lower level of the Coolidge School was built in 1905, while the second level was added in 1910. However, the school is considered historic -rather than simply “old” -due to its ties to Maynardian James Mullin, who contracted the original first story, and the master architect Charles Bateman, widely known for his commissions throughout the Boston area. Due to this rich history, the building was declared eligible for the National Register of Historic Properties in 1999, though this designation was not pursued. Additionally, the School is home to an enormous hill famous for its wintertime revelry, and a renovated public playground for entertainment during warmer months. 
In 2013, the Maynard School Administration -who previously held office in the building -announced its intentions to vacate the Coolidge School. The other tenants, including the Maynard Food Pantry and Hudson-Maynard Adult Learning Center -soon followed suit, rendering the future of the building uncertain. To tackle the enormous problem of preserving the Coolidge School’s history, the Maynard Historical Commission and Board of Selectmen worked together to form the Coolidge School Reuse Taskforce Committee to make recommendations for the empty building’s possible fate and eventual uses. 
The Committee orchestrated a Public Forum to garner public opinion on the future of the Coolidge School. While some wondered if the high costs of rehabilitation -caused largely by a lack of routine maintenance throughout the years -would be unappealing to private developers, many believed the costs of losing the building would be much greater than the costs of preservation. 56% of attendees believed that preserving the school was “of the utmost importance” and 50% felt it was important that the school remained in public use -yet 79% did not care whether the building was publicly or privately owned. 
Eventually, the Committee submitted its recommendations to the Board of Selectmen. It determined that the school would best be adaptively reused, rather than demolished, and that the town should invest in repairs to prevent future deterioration while the ownership of the building was debated. Among the recommended preservation strategies were a Request For Proposals (RFP) from private developers, the imposition of a Preservation Deed Restriction, and the subdivision of the lots to keep the School’s playground in public use. As of now, the building remains in limbo -but the Coolidge School can ultimately be considered a preservation success, due to the overwhelming public support in favor of maintaining its historic character. 
Maynard Public Library 
Many Maynard residents likely remember the conversion of the old Roosevelt School at 77 Nason Street into the current home of the Maynard Public Library. The final result of this rehabilitation project was unveiled on July 17, 2006.

A lot happened prior to the library’s grand reopening. Before anything else, the Roosevelt School had to be built. In 1916, a vote of 147 to 2 decided that the town would build a 14-room elementary school for $55,000. The school opened for classes in the fall of 1918, although its start date was delayed due to the ongoing influenza epidemic. 
Rehabilitating the damaged school was no small – or cheap – feat. According to the library’s website, the estimated costs totaled an impressive $5.7 million. Amassing this sum required a combination of state, local, and private funding. $2.1 million came from a library construction grant from the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners, while the remaining $3.6 was borrowed, thanks to a debt-exclusion matter passed at the May 2003 town meeting. Meanwhile, the cost to taxpayers was defrayed through a capital campaign conducted by the Friends of the Maynard Public Library, which managed to raise over $500,000 in pledges and donations. 
The tremendous achievement of the Roosevelt School’s rehabilitation stands as a paragon of historic preservation in Maynard. Only time will tell if the present challenges of the Coolidge School, Mill and Main, and our other reused properties will meet similarly successful fates.
