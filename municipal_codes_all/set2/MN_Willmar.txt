PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Willmar of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1978 Code, as supplemented through September 30, 1980, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1978 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees.There are numberous cross references within each index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date periodically. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Sucessfully keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Section 2.06. - Vacancies. 
    Subdivision 1. Determination of vacancy. The office of a Council member shall become vacant upon their death. A vacancy also automatically occurs when an incumbent submits a written resignation to the City Council. The vacancy will be created on the date specified in the written resignation, or if one is not specified, on the date of submittal to the City Council. If the date of submittal is unknown, then the vacancy will occur on the date the City Council receives the written resignation. A vacancy in an office of Council member also exists in the following situations: 
(A)  Failure of an elected person to qualify on or before the first Monday after the first Tuesday of January immediately following a general election; 
(B)  Termination of residency in the city; 
(C)  Termination of a ward council member's residency in the ward from which elected except when a ward boundary change places a ward council member's residence in a different ward, the council member will continue in office until the next general municipal election, at which time the office must be filled for the remainder of that term; 
(D)  Continuous absence from the city for more than 90 days; 
(E)  Conviction of a felony either before or after qualification for office; 
(F)  Loss of qualifications for the elective office; or 
(G)  Failure without good cause to perform the duties of office for a period of 90 consecutive days. 
    Subdivision 2. The Council must on its own motion declare by resolution that a vacancy exists when a vacancy occurs for a reason other than death or resignation. If the Council fails to act or is unaware of a vacancy, a resident who is an eligible voter in the city may submit a written verified request with supporting facts to the City Clerk, asking the Council to declare a vacancy. A written verified request submitted within 90 days after another request for the same Council position will not be considered under this section. The Council must act on the written verified request within 21 days after submission to the city clerk, unless a vote approved by 75% of the Council members present authorizes an additional 21 days. If the Council fails to act within the required time, the Mayor has seven days to act on the written verified request. If the Council and Mayor fail to act within the required time, a vacancy automatically occurs. 
    Subdivision 3. Within 45 days after the effective date of any vacancy on the Council, the Council must either (1) appoint an eligible person to fill the vacancy on an interim basis as more fully provided in this Section; or (2) schedule a special election to be held within 90 days to fill the vacancy for the unexpired portion of the term. 
    Subdivision 4. If the Council fills the vacancy through an interim appointment under Subdivision 3, a special election to elect a permanent replacement to serve for the unexpired portion of the term must be held at the next regular municipal election when each of the following conditions exist on the effective date of the vacancy: 
(A)  More than two years remain in the unexpired term; and 
(B)  The first day to file affidavits of candidacy for the next regular municipal election has not yet occurred. 
    If a special election is not required under this Subdivision, a Council member appointed on an interim basis under Subdivision 3 will serve until expiration of the position's term. 
    Subdivision 5. The term of a Council member elected at a special election begins as soon as the election results have been certified and the person has qualified for office. 
    Subdivision 6. For a special election held at a time other than a regular municipal election: 
(A)  Candidates must file for office no later than four weeks before the election; 
(B)  No primary will be held; 
(C)  The candidate receiving the highest number of votes is elected; and 
(D)  The election must be held on a Tuesday. 
(Ord. of 10-2-18) 
Section 2.07. - Judge of qualifications. 
    The Council shall be the judge of the election and qualifications of its members. In the event of an adverse determination, the Council shall proceed as provided in Section 2.05, and a Council member or electee to the Council shall have the right of appeal and the right of reimbursement for attorneys fees therein provided. 
(Ord. of 10-2-18) 
Section 2.08. - Appointive offices of the Council. 
    Subdivision 1. [City Administrator.] The City Council shall appoint an officer of the City who shall be called the City Administrator and shall approve the appointments of other Department Head positions that from time to time may be deemed appropriate.

    Subdivision 2. [City Attorney.] The City Council shall appoint a licensed attorney(s) who shall be an officer of the City and shall be called the City Attorney(s). Alternately, the City Council may contract for legal services with a licensed individual or law firm.

    Subdivision 3. Votes required for appointments. All appointments shall require the affirmative votes of at least five (5) members of the Council. 
(Ord. of 10-2-18) 
Section 2.09. - Independent audit and financial reporting. 
    The Council shall provide for an independent annual audit of all City accounts and may provide for such more frequent audits as it deems necessary. The accounts of Rice Memorial Hospital and the Willmar Municipal Utilities shall be audited at least annually. Such audits shall be made by a certified public accountant or firm of such accountants who have no direct interest in the fiscal affairs of the City government or any of its officers. The annual audit of the City, the Willmar Municipal Utilities and Rice Memorial Hospital shall be certified by the accountant preparing the annual audit. Except as provided herein with respect to audits of Rice Memorial Hospital and the Willmar Municipal Utilities, the Council may, without requiring competitive bids, designate such accountant or firm for a period not exceeding three (3) years, provided that the designation for any particular fiscal year shall be made no later than thirty (30) days after the beginning of such fiscal year. If the State makes such an audit, the Council may accept it as satisfying the requirements of this Section. The Rice Memorial Hospital Board and the Willmar Municipal Utilities Commission may select their respective certified public accountant and shall each pay their own audit fees incurred for the audits required by this Section. Copies of each annual audit of Rice Memorial Hospital and the Willmar Municipal Utilities shall be submitted to the Mayor, the City Council and the City Finance Director. 
    In addition to the annual audits herein provided for, the Willmar Municipal Utilities and the Rice Memorial Hospital Board shall prepare monthly statements, prepared on an accrual basis, and submit said statements to the City Council, the Mayor and the City Finance Director on or before the twenty-fifth (25th) day of the month following the month for which the statement was prepared.

It may subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, take testimony and require the production of evidence. Any person who is found, by a court of competent jurisdiction, to have failed or refused, without lawful excuse, to comply with an order of the Council in the exercise of this investigative power shall be guilty of a misdemeanor as defined in the Minnesota Criminal Code.

Upon introduction of any ordinance, the City Clerk shall distribute a copy to each Council member, to the Mayor and to the City Attorney, shall file a reasonable number of copies in the Office of the City Clerk and such other public places as the Council may designate, and shall publish the ordinance, together with a notice in the official City newspaper setting out the time and place for a public hearing thereon and for its consideration by the Council. The public hearing shall follow the publication by at least seven (7) days, may be held separately or in connection with a regular or special meeting and may be continued from time to time; all persons interested shall have an opportunity to be heard. After the hearing the Council may adopt the ordinance with or without amendment or reject it, but, if it is amended as to any matter of substance, the Council may not adopt it until the ordinance or its amended sections have been subjected to all the procedures hereinbefore required in the case of a newly introduced ordinance. As soon as practicable after adoption of any ordinance, the City Clerk shall have it published as adopted, together with a notice of its adoption. In each instance where publication is required by this paragraph, the Council may, upon an affirmative vote of at least six (6) of its members, elect to publish a summary of an ordinance that, because of its length, would be unduly expensive to publish in its entirety. In any instance where a summary of an ordinance is published, the Council, at its own expense, shall furnish to the public the complete text of the ordinance. The summary of the ordinance that is published shall state that the full text of the ordinance is available, at no cost to the public, at the City Clerk's Office.

An emergency ordinance may be adopted with or without amendment or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least six (6) members of the Council shall be required for adoption, provided, the Mayor may vote affirmatively to provide one of the six votes. After its adoption, the ordinance shall be published and printed as prescribed for other adopted ordinances. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as the Council may specify therein. Every emergency ordinance, except one adopted pursuant to Section 5.07 of Article V shall automatically stand repealed as of the sixty-first (61st) day following the date on which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent reenactment of the ordinance in the manner specified in this subdivision if the emergency still exists. An emergency ordinance may also be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this subdivision for adoption of emergency ordinances. 
    Subdivision 4. Codes of technical regulations. The Council may adopt any standard code of technical regulations by reference thereto in an adopting ordinance. The procedure and requirements governing such an adopting ordinance shall be as prescribed for ordinances generally except that:

(B)  A copy of each adopted code of technical regulations as well as of the adopting ordinance shall be authenticated and recorded by the City Clerk pursuant to Subdivision 5 of this section; and 
(C)  The publication of the ordinance shall not be construed as requiring publication of the code of technical regulations, but the publication shall state and identify clearly the code adopted by the ordinance and shall state the location of the place or places where the code is available for inspection by the public. 
Copies of any adopted code of technical regulations shall be made available by the City Clerk for distribution or for purchase at a reasonable price.

The general codification shall be adopted by the Council by ordinance and in the publication of the adopting ordinance the Code need not be published but the publication shall clearly state the place or places it is available for inspection by the public. The general codification, together with this Charter and any amendments thereto, pertinent provisions of the constitution and other laws of the State of Minnesota, and such codes of technical regulations and other rules and regulations as the Council may specify shall be promptly published in bound or loose-leaf form. This compilation shall be known and cited officially as the Municipal Code of Willmar. Copies of the Code shall be furnished to City officers, placed in libraries and public offices and in the courts for free public reference and made available for purchase by the public at a reasonable price fixed by the Council. 
(C)  Printing of ordinances and resolutions. The Council shall cause each ordinance and resolution having the force and effect of law and each amendment to this Charter to be printed promptly following its adoption and the printed ordinances, resolutions and Charter amendments shall be distributed or sold to the public at reasonable prices to be fixed by the Council. Following publication of the Code and at times thereafter, the ordinances, resolutions and Charter amendments shall be printed in substantially the same style as the Code currently in effect and shall be suitable in form for integration therein. The Council shall make such further arrangements as it deems desirable with respect to reproduction and distribution of any current changes in or additions to the provisions of the constitution and other laws of the State of Minnesota, or the codes of technical regulations and other rules and regulations included in the Code. 
    Subdivision 6. Special ordinances. Ordinances of limited application such as zoning and annexation ordinances or of current interest only or which by their terms will expire within a definite period of time and emergency ordinances shall be classified for purposes of identification and codification as special ordinances and shall not be codified.

The City Clerk shall provide copies thereof to the public at a reasonable price fixed by the Council.

(H)  The failure of the grantee to obey the provisions of the law, this Charter, or the ordinances of the City, or the violation of any of the terms and conditions set forth in or embraced within the franchise or the ordinance granting the same shall be a sufficient cause for the forfeiture, cancellation and revocation of the franchise by resolution of the Council. 
(Ord. of 10-2-18) 
Section 8.06. - Regulation of rates and charges. 
    All franchise holders shall give courteous, efficient, and adequate service at reasonable rates.

ARTICLE VI. - HOSTING EVENT WHERE ALCOHOL PRESENT AND POSSESSED BY PERSONS UNDER 21[7] 

Footnotes:

Editor's note- Ordinance No. 1281, §§ 1-5, 7, adopted November 3, 2008, did not specifically amend the Code. Therefore, such ordinance has been added as §§ 3-296-3-301 at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 3-296. - Purpose and findings. 
    The Willmar City Council intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons criminally responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The Willmar City Council finds that: 
(a)  Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of twenty-one (21) are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health and public safety requiring prevention or abatement. 
(b)  Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions. 
(c)  Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user. 
(d)  Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times when the parent(s) is/are present and, condone the activity, and in some circumstances provide the alcohol. 
(e)  Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime, it is difficult to prove, and an ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage consumption. 
(f)  A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs. 
(Ord. No. 1281, § 1, 11-3-08)

(b)  Designation as potentially dangerous animal . The animal control authority shall designate any animal as a potentially dangerous animal upon receiving evidence that the animal meets any of the criteria in subsection (a). When an animal is declared potentially dangerous, the animal control authority shall cause the owner(s) of the potentially dangerous animal to be notified in writing that such animal is potentially dangerous. An animal that has been determined to be potentially dangerous must be microchipped in accordance with section 4-61, licensed in accordance with section 4-42, and may, at the discretion of the animal control authority, be required to comply with one (1) or more of the following conditions:

If the committee upholds the determination as potentially dangerous, the order may affirm or modify the conditions recommended by the animal control authority. If as a result of testimony or other evidence at the hearing there are grounds for declaring the animal to be dangerous pursuant to section 4-58, the committee chairperson may change the designation and issue the appropriate orders. 
(2)  If an owner fails to comply with any conditions specified in the order and fails to request a hearing under subsection (c)(1), the animal shall be seized. The animal may be reclaimed by the owner as set forth in section 4-59.

If the owner is found not to have violated the conditions, the owner may reclaim the animal under the provisions of section 4-59.

The animal control authority may review the status of an animal which has been determined to be potentially dangerous if a period of two (2) years has passed without any further incidents under section (a) above and may use discretion in determining whether any conditions which have been ordered are still required. After the initial two-year period, an owner may request a review annually. The owner must provide evidence that the animal's behavior has changed due to the animal's age, sterilization, environment, completion of obedience training that includes modification of aggressive behavior, or other factors.

(1)  The animal control authority shall seize the dangerous animal and notify its owner pursuant to section 4-62 that the animal has been determined to be dangerous and that the animal is to be destroyed if the owner does not comply with the conditions and requirements of section 4-59 and applicable state laws. This notice shall state that the owner shall have fourteen (14) days to reclaim the animal and appeal the determination by submitting to the city administrator a written request for a hearing before the city council.

(1)  A proper enclosure exists for the dangerous animal. 
(2)  If a dangerous animal is outside of a proper enclosure, the animal must be restrained by a substantial chain or leash and under the physical restraint of a responsible person.

(3)  A dangerous animal must be sterilized at the owner's expense.

There are two types of discretionary deferrals: 
(1)  Senior citizen, disability, active military service, and other hardship deferrals. The council may defer special assessments for certain senior citizens, people with disabilities, and members of the military, as allowed by Minn. Stat. §§ 435.193 to 435.195 and subject to the following rules. 
a.  The council may, in its discretion, defer the payment of special assessments against any homestead property if: 
1.  It is owned by a person 65 or older; or 
2.  It is owned by a person who is retired by virtue of a permanent and total disability; or 
3.  It is owned by a member of the Minnesota National Guard or other military reserves who has been ordered into active military service; or 
4.  There is a hardship on the basis of exceptional and unusual circumstances not covered by other standards and guidelines, where the determination is made in a nondiscriminatory manner and does not give the applicant an unreasonable preference or advantage over other applicants. 
Provided that, in each such case, the council has determined that it would be a hardship for the owner to make the payments. Under subsection 4 above, the council may limit the deferment to one (1) year or to a limited period of years, and may require regular verification by the applicant of the continuation of the exceptional and unusual circumstances that justify the deferment. 
b.  If an applicant for deferral falls into one of the foregoing categories, hardship shall be determined based upon the applicant meeting one or more of the following conditions: 
1.  Gross household income is at or under United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) very low income limits, adjusted for the year and household size. 
2.  Unusually high medical expenses relative to income. 
3.  Other conditions found by the council to justify deferment. 
c.  Except as otherwise expressly determined by the council in the resolution approving deferment, a hardship deferment ends and all accumulated amounts (including applicable interest, if any) become due: 
1.  Upon the death of the owner if the spouse is not otherwise eligible for deferment; 
2.  Upon the sale, transfer or subdivision of any part of the property; 
3.  Upon loss of homestead status; or 
4.  Upon the council's determination that immediate or partial payment would impose no hardship. 
(2)  Unimproved property. The council may, in its discretion, defer special assessments against unimproved property as allowed by Minn. Stat. § 429.061, subd. 2. Payment of the first installment of any assessment levied upon unimproved property may, in the council's discretion, be deferred until a designated future year or until the platting of the property or the construction of improvements thereon, upon such terms and conditions and based upon such standards and criteria as may be provided by resolution of the council. When such an assessment becomes payable, it must be divided into a number of installments such that the last installment thereof will be payable not more than thirty (30) years after the levy of the assessment. 
(b)  Procedure. A person seeking deferment must be the owner of the property, and shall make application to the city clerk on forms prescribed by the city. An application shall be made not later than October 1 in the year the assessment was adopted. The city administrator or his/her designee shall review applications for deferral of special assessments to determine eligibility under this section and shall make a written report to the council not later than October 15 in the year the assessment was adopted. The report shall contain a recommendation on whether the deferment should be granted, and a recommended interest rate on any deferred assessment. A copy of the report shall be mailed to or given to the applicant by the city clerk. The council shall make the final determination on whether to grant a deferment not later than October 21. If a deferment is granted, the city clerk shall make the proper certification to the county recorder which shall set forth the amount of the assessment and the amount of interest, if any, pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 435.194.

DIVISION 3. - AUTOMATED PAWN SYSTEM[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1226, §§ 1-15, 17, adopted September 19, 2005, amended division 3 to read as herein set out. Former division 3, §§ 8-201-8-208, pertained to pawnbrokers, and derived from Ord. No. 846, § 1-10, 2-6-85. 

Sec. 8-201. - Purpose. 
    The city council finds that use of services provided by pawnbrokers provides an opportunity for the commission of crimes and their concealment because pawn businesses have the ability to receive and transfer property stolen by others easily and quickly. The city council also finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers. The city council further finds that the pawn industry has outgrown the city's current ability to effectively or efficiently identify criminal activity related to pawn shops. The purpose of this chapter is to prevent pawn businesses from being used as facilities for the commission of crimes and to assure that such businesses comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city. 
    To help the police department better regulate current and future pawn businesses, decrease and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of the pawn industry and increase identification of criminal activities in the pawn industry through the timely collection and sharing of pawn transaction information, this chapter also implements and establishes the required use of the automated pawn system (APS). 
(Ord. No. 1226, § 1, 9-19-05)

    Pawnbroker. Any natural person, partnership or corporation, either as principal or agent or employee thereof, who loans money on deposit or pledge of personal property, or other valuable thing, or who deals in the purchasing of personal property, or other valuable thing on condition of selling the same back again at a stipulated price, or who loans money secured by chattel mortgage on personal property, taking possession of the property or any part thereof so mortgaged. To the extent that a pawnbroker's business includes buying personal property previously used, rented or leased, or selling it on consignment, the provisions of this chapter shall be applicable. 
    Reportable transaction. Every transaction conducted by a pawnbroker in which merchandise is received through a pawn, purchase, consignment or trade, or in which a pawn is renewed, extended or redeemed, or for which a unique transaction number or identifier is generated by their point-of-sale software, or an item is confiscated by law enforcement, is reportable except: 
(1)  The bulk purchase or consignment of new or used merchandise from a merchant, manufacturer or wholesaler having an established permanent place of business, and the retail sale of said merchandise, provided the pawnbroker must maintain a record of such purchase or consignment which describes each item, and must mark each item in a manner which relates it to that transaction record.

Fees imposed pursuant to this section become delinquent after thirty (30) days from the date of the city's notice of imposition of the fee to the fire alarm user, and a late payment penalty of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be assessed and interest on the entire balance owing under this section shall accrue at a rate of three (3) percent per annum. If efforts to obtain voluntary payment fail, all payment of fees and penalties may be enforced by civil action. In addition, unpaid fees, late payment penalties and interest incurred under this section constitute a lien against the property which was the subject of the false alarms and may be collected by certifying the amounts against the property in the same manner as the collection of delinquent utility fees provided in section 16-127 of this Code. 
(b)  Exemptions. A fire alarm user whose fire alarm system is validly registered pursuant to the requirements of section 8-284 of this article shall be exempt from the fees imposed in subsection (a) of this section upon submitting to the fire chief written verification that the fire alarm system that communicated the false alarm was serviced and/or repaired after the date of the false alarm, or at the discretion of the fire chief for other good cause shown if the circumstances of the false alarm do not indicate that any problems with the proper functioning of the fire alarm system that communicated the false alarm exist. For purposes of this paragraph, written verification of service and/or repair of a fire alarm system shall be deemed sufficient if it is on the letterhead of an alarm repair company or similar service provider and is submitted to the fire chief within five (5) business days of the date of the false alarm. 
(Ord. No. 1339, § 1, 3-4-13)

(Ord. No. 1339, § 1, 3-4-13) 
Sec. 8-288. - Liability of city. 
    The regulation of fire alarms does not constitute acceptance by the city of liability to maintain equipment, to answer alarms, or to respond to alarms in any particular manner. The city has no responsibility for any consequential damage resulting from the city's failure to respond to an alarm.

ARTICLE V. - SEXUAL OFFENDERS AND SEXUAL PREDATORS 

Sec. 10-76. - Findings and intent. 
(a)  Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. The costs of this sexual offender victimization to society at large are severe. 
(b)  Offenders who have committed certain statutorily designated sexual offenses and other identified offenses are required by Minnesota statutes to register their addresses, secondary addresses, work locations and vehicles with the Minnesota Department of Corrections. 
(c)  Offenders who have committed the designated sexual and predatory offenses and are confined in Minnesota correctional facilities or treatment facilities are subject to review by an End of Confinement Review Committee (ECRC) established by the Minnesota Commissioner of Corrections, which assesses, reviews and assigns a risk level to the offender before the offender is released from confinement, all pursuant to M.S.A. § 244.052. The offender is entitled to notice of the ECRC meeting and has the right to be present and be heard at the meeting. 
(d)  The ECRC assigns offenders a risk level from I to III, with those assigned a risk level III having been assessed to have the highest risk of reoffending and thus posing the greatest risk to other residents of the city. 
(e)  Research indicates the measurement of individual characteristics are the best predictors of likelihood of reoffending and the end of confinement review process follows the procedures for such individualized review identified in M.S.A. § 244.052, resulting in the assigned risk level. 
(f)  It is the intent of this article to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein those sexual offenders and sexual predators assessed to have the greatest likelihood of reoffending are prohibited from residing. 
(g)  It is the further intent of this article to serve the city's compelling interest in mitigating the concentration of certain predatory offenders, as recommended by M.S.A. § 244.052, subdivision 4a, by prohibiting certain predatory offenders from establishing temporary or permanent residences within close proximity to one another.

Upon the reasonable belief that a violation of this article has occurred, the city's planning and development services director or the director's designee shall serve on the violator an order to correct the violation.

If compliance is not achieved within the time specified in the order to correct, or if the violation subject to the order occurs at a property that was found to have violated this article at any time in the preceding three (3) months, the official is authorized to issue an administrative citation stating the date, time, and nature of the offense, the name of the official issuing the citation, the amount of the scheduled civil fine, and the manner for paying the fine or appealing the citation by requesting an administrative conference. The citation shall be presented in person or by mail to the person responsible for the violation. 
(b)  Civil fines. A person responsible violating this article may be subject to a civil fine in an amount not to exceed the amount of the maximum fine allowed if each ordinance violation had been prosecuted as a misdemeanor.

Based upon those facts, the planning and development services staff will determine if any settlement options may, consistent with the public health, welfare and safety, be offered to the person responsible for the violation as an alternative to the payment of the entire amount of the fine. This conference shall take place within twenty (20) calendar days of the department's receiving the request. If a settlement cannot be reached at the administrative conference, the person responsible for the violation may, at the conclusion of the conference, either pay the fine or appeal the same to the community development committee pursuant to section 12-36.

Failure to attend the administrative conference as scheduled shall be deemed an admission of the charges set forth in the administrative citation.

(1)  A late payment fee of ten (10) percent of the civil fine amount shall be imposed if the person responsible for the violation fails to pay the civil fine within twenty (20) calendar days after issuance of the administrative citation or fails to timely request an administrative conference pursuant to this article. 
(2)  If a civil fine is not paid within the time specified and no request for an administrative conference is timely received, the nonpayment of the civil fine shall constitute a personal obligation of the violator that may be collected by any appropriate legal means.

Such summary and statement shall become a part of public record. 
(b)  The community development committee, upon receipt of an appeal, shall set a time and place for a hearing and shall advise the applicant in writing by mail, postage prepaid to address of applicant, of such time and place, at least seven (7) days prior to the date of the hearing.

The final plat (consistent with the requirements in section 14-108) shall be submitted to the zoning administrator at least fourteen (14) days prior to the planning commission meeting at which the same shall be considered. The zoning administrator shall review the final plat application materials for completeness, and if it is determined additional information is necessary to complete the application, shall return the application to the applicant with a description of the additional information needed. Once the application is determined to be complete, the zoning administrator shall prepare a report clearly stating whether or not the final plat is consistent with and satisfies all conditions of approval of the preliminary plat, and whether or not it conforms to the requirements of state and federal law, city ordinances, and the City of Willmar Comprehensive Plan. The zoning administrator shall present said report, together with recommendations, to the next meeting of the commission following its filing as set forth above. 
b.  The subdivider shall present with the plat to the planning commission an abstract of title, title opinion, or certificate of title, with an opinion of a duly licensed attorney at law certifying that the persons signing the plat are the only owners of interest, either as fee title owners, owners of less than fee, or as mortgagees or lien holders, of the land therein platted. The said attorney's opinion shall also contain a certification that the plat meets the requirements imposed by the laws of the State of Minnesota and the ordinances of the City of Willmar, provided, however, that with respect to the requirements of such laws and ordinances dealing with data and provisions of an engineering nature, it shall be sufficient if such opinion sets forth that the requirements of the laws and ordinances respecting questions of engineering, survey and similar technical data are considered to be within the province of the city engineer and are not passed upon in the opinion. 
c.  The planning commission shall consider the final plat at the meeting at which it is submitted, and may consider it at such future special or regular meetings as it shall determine necessary. 
d.  The planning commission shall approve or deny the plat. If conditions required on the preliminary plat have not been met, all further action on the plat shall be suspended until the subdivider shall respond thereto, provided that if further action is not taken by the subdivider within a period of three (3) months from the date of such decision, the plat shall be deemed to be denied. 
e.  A final decision to approve the final plat by the planning commission shall be made by motion; however a decision to deny the plat shall be made by written resolution setting forth the basis for the denial. Final action shall be communicated to the subdivider by the zoning administrator, and commission's decision shall be forwarded to the city council, together with the plat and data as applicable. 
f.  If the planning commission approves the final plat, the chairman and the secretary shall sign the same when the recordable copies are presented for signatures. 
(2)  Submittal to the city council. 
a.  Upon the decision of approval or denial by the planning commission, or in the event the planning commission shall fail to act within the time required above, the final plat shall come before the city council for review. 
b.  The council may hold such public hearings on the final plat as it shall determine, and upon such, notice shall be provided. 
c.  If the council is not satisfied with the final plat as presented, it may deny the same, set forth such conditions and requirements as it shall require to be fulfilled before the same is approved, or refer the same to the planning commission for such further action as it shall determine. Upon such referral, the planning commission shall act thereon at the next meeting and report back to the council no later than thirty (30) days after the said action of the city council, unless an earlier report is required for the city to satisfy the applicable time limit for final action on the final plat application, in which case the date by which such report is required shall be communicated to the commission in the referral. 
d.  If the council shall determine to approve the plat, it may do so by motion and the decision shall provide for the acceptance of all streets, alleys, easements or other public ways, parks, and other open spaces dedicated for public purposes. If the council denies the plat, it shall do so by written resolution setting forth the basis for the denial. 
e.  If the council shall determine to approve the plat notwithstanding disapproval of the same by the planning commission, it shall make such decision in conformity with the requirements of the city charter for overruling the planning commission and such action shall be endorsed on the plat over the signature of the city clerk. 
f.  The action of the city council finally determining the matter shall be communicated by the zoning administrator to the subdivider, and if the plat be denied, a copy of the resolution denying the plat stating the reasons given by the council for such denial shall be provided. 
g.  If the city council approves the final plat, the mayor and the city clerk shall sign the same once the recordable copies are presented for signatures. 
h.  A paper copy of the final plat shall be supplied by the subdivider to the county for review prior to printing recordable copies of the plat. 
i.  If the final plat is approved by the city council, or by act of law, the applicant shall record it with the county recorder within one hundred eighty (180) days from final plat approval by the city council, unless a time extension has been granted by the city council following written application thereof by the subdivider made to the city at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of expiration. The subdivider shall provide the city with a copy of the plat showing evidence of recording. Failure to record the final plat within the one hundred eighty (180) day period shall render final plat approval by the city council null and void, unless the city council has granted an extension of time in which the final plat shall be recorded as provided in this paragraph. In the event that a final plat is not timely recorded, a new plat application and process shall thereafter be required. No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions shall be made in any final plat after approval is given by the city council and signing of the final plat by the mayor and applicable city representatives.

DIVISION 3. - REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 14-112. - Design standards. 
(a)  Blocks . 
(1)  Block length. In general, intersecting streets, determining block lengths, shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross-traffic adequately and to meet existing streets. 
a.  Where no existing plats control, the blocks in residential subdivision shall normally not exceed seven hundred (700) feet in length, except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from this maximum. In blocks longer than five hundred (500) feet, pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block may be required. The width and location of such pedestrian ways shall be subject to the approval of the city engineer and the planning commission. 
b.  Blocks for business or industrial use should normally not exceed eight hundred (800) feet in length. 
(2)  Block width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two (2) tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for their respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking and deliveries. 
(b)  Streets and alleys. 
(1)  The arrangement of thoroughfares and collector streets shall conform as nearly as possible to the Willmar Comprehensive Plan. Except for cul-de-sacs, streets normally shall connect with streets already dedicated in adjoining or adjacent subdivisions, or provide for future connections to adjoining unsubdivided tracts or shall be a reasonable projection of streets in the nearest subdivided tracts. The arrangement of thoroughfares and collector streets shall be considered in their relation to the reasonable circulation of traffic, to topographic conditions, to runoff of stormwater, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed use of the area to be served. 
(2)  Minor streets should be planned to discourage their use by non-local traffic. Dead end streets are prohibited, but cul-de-sacs will be permitted where topography or other conditions justify their use. Cul-de-sacs shall normally not be longer than five hundred (500) feet, including a terminal turn-around which shall be provided at the closed end, with an outside curb radius of at least forty (40) feet and a right-of-way radius of not less than fifty (50) feet. 
(3)  Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of a proposed future street system for the unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider, and it shall be at the same scale as set forth herein. 
(4)  When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or parcels, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical location and opening of future streets and appropriate subdividing, with provision for adequate utility connections for such subdividing. 
(5)  Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, except where topography or other conditions justify variations. The minimum angle of intersection of streets shall be eighty (80) degrees. Street intersection jogs shall be a minimum of one hundred fifty (150) feet apart, and shall not be permitted without the express approval of the city engineer. 
(6)  Wherever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to the right-of-way of a limited access highway or thoroughfare, provision may be made for a marginal access street (frontage) approximately parallel and adjacent to the boundary of such right-of-way, or for a street at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land between such street and right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for approach connections to future grade separations or lot depths. 
(7)  Alleys should be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except that this provision may be waived where other definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading, and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. Except where justified as special conditions, such as the continuation of an existing alley in the same block, alleys will not be approved in residential districts. Alleys, where provided, shall not be less than twenty (20) feet wide. Dead end alleys shall not be permitted. 
(8)  Dedication of half streets will not be approved, except where it is essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision and in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations, where it is found that it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever there is a half street adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. 
(9)  For all public ways hereafter dedicated and accepted, the minimum right-of-way widths for streets, and thoroughfares shall be as shown in the Comprehensive Plan for Willmar and where not shown therein, the minimum right-of-way width for streets, thoroughfares, alleys, or pedestrian ways included in any subdivision shall not be less than the minimum dimensions for each classification as follows: 
Right-of-Way Width Curb-to-Curb Street Width Primary thoroughfare 100 feet 64 feet Secondary thoroughfare 80 feet 48 feet Collector street 70 feet 40 feet Minor street 70 feet 40 feet Minor street, one side parking 60 feet 32 feet Frontage street 50 feet -- Alley 15 feet -- Pedestrian way 10 feet --  
Where existing or anticipated traffic on primary and secondary thoroughfares warrants greater width of rights-of-way, these shall be required at the discretion of the city engineer. 
(10)  Street grades. The grades in all streets, thoroughfares, collector streets, minor streets, and alleys in any subdivision shall not be greater than the maximum grades for each classification as follows: 
Primary thoroughfare 5 percent Secondary thoroughfare 5 percent Collector street 6 percent Minor street 8 percent Alley 8 percent  
There shall be a minimum grade on all streets and thoroughfares of not less than four-tenths ( 4 / 10 ) of one (1) percent. There shall be a minimum crown on all streets and thoroughfares of not less than one and one-half (11/2) percent. 
(11)  Street alignment. The horizontal and vertical alignment standards on all continuous streets shall be as follows: 
a.  Horizontal . Radii of center line: 
Major thoroughfare 500 feet-minimum Secondary thoroughfare 500 feet-minimum Collector street 250 feet-minimum Minor street 150 feet-minimum  
There shall be a tangent between all reverse curves of a length in relation to the radii of all curves so as to provide for a smooth flow of traffic. 
b.  Vertical. All changes in street grades shall be connected by vertical parabolic curves of such length as follows: 
Primary thoroughfare or secondary thoroughfare 30 times the algebraic difference in the percent of grade of the two adjacent slopes. Collector street or minor street 20 times the algebraic difference in the percent of grade of the two adjacent slopes.  
(12)  All proposed streets shall be offered for dedication as public streets. However, private streets may be permitted in PUDs. 
(c)  Lots. 
(1)  The minimum lot area, width and depth shall not be less than that established by the Zoning Ordinance of Willmar. 
(2)  Corner lots for residential use shall have additional width to permit appropriate building setback from both streets as defined in the Zoning Ordinance of Willmar. 
(3)  Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles to street lines or radial to curved street lines. 
(4)  Double frontage lots shall not be permitted except where lots back on a thoroughfare or other arterial street, or where topographic or other conditions render subdividing impractical in which case vehicular and pedestrian access between the lots and arterial streets shall be prohibited. Such double frontage lots shall have an additional depth of at least twenty (20) feet in order to allow space for screen planting along the back lot line. 
(5)  Every lot must have at least the minimum required frontage as per zoning ordinance on a public dedicated street other than an alley. 
(d)  Easements. 
(1)  An easement for utilities, at least six (6) feet wide shall be provided along each side of any lot line as may be deemed necessary to form a continuous right-of-way, at least twelve (12) feet in width. If necessary for the extension of water main or sewer lines or similar utilities, easements of greater width may be required along lot lines or across lots. 
(2)  Utility easements shall connect with easements established in adjoining properties. These easements, when approved, shall not thereafter be by resolution pursuant to the provisions of the city charter respecting the vacation of streets and public grounds. 
(3)  Additional easements for pole guys should be provided at the outside turns. Where possible lot lines shall be arranged to bisect the exterior angle so that pole guys will fall alongside lot lines. 
(4)  Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage way, channel, or stream, a storm sewer easement, drainage right-of-way or park dedication, whichever the planning commission may deem the most adequate, conforming substantially with the lines of such water course shall be provided, together with such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the stormwater drainage of the area. The width of such easements shall be determined by the planning commission. 
(5)  A five-foot tree planting easement shall be required contiguous to all public streets and avenues. 
(Ord. No. 1426, § 2, 9-4-18) 
Sec. 14-113. - Park dedication. 
(a)  General. The city finds the preservation and development of parks and open space areas essential to the health and general welfare of the community. Parks are a major asset to residents and persons employed in Willmar, and the following provision allows for further growth, orderly development, and enhancement of the park system, pursuant to the City of Willmar Comprehensive Plan and the Willmar Parks and Recreation Master Plan. Prior to subdivision approval, the subdivider shall dedicate land for parks, playgrounds, conservation, or public open spaces and/or shall make a cash contribution to the city's park dedication fund as set forth in this section. All land intended for public use as indicated in the Willmar Comprehensive Plan that lies partially or completely within a proposed subdivision shall be dedicated to the appropriate governmental unit in addition to the requirements of this section, except where the planning commission deems an alternate site within the plat to be similarly suitable. 
(b)  Application. All new subdivisions within the jurisdiction of this chapter shall be required to comply with park dedication requirements as herein described. In the case of a replat where a park dedication and/or cash contribution has been made on previously subdivided lots, and said lots are more than seventy (70) percent of the area being replatted, no dedication or cash contribution shall be required. 
(c)  Alterations. The city may alter park dedication requirements in the following scenarios: 
(1)  A subdivision in the central business district where the development or redevelopment is of greater vitality and benefit to the city in comparison to park, playground, conservation, and open space improvements. 
(2)  A subdivision that allows for the development of affordable housing that is of greater benefit to the city in comparison to park, playground, conservation, and open space improvements. 
(3)  A subdivision that significantly increases tax revenue or employment opportunity that is of greater benefit to the city in comparison to park, playground, conservation, and open space improvements. 
(4)  A subdivision that is largely city-assisted development, achieving public objectives. 
(d)  Land dedication required. In all applicable subdivisions, a percentage of net developable land of all property to be subdivided, where a land dedication and/or cash contribution has not been made, shall be dedicated as follows: 
(1)  Residential subdivision (minimum)-Seven (7) percent 
(2)  Commercial subdivision (minimum)-Four (4) percent 
(3)  Industrial subdivision (minimum)-Four (4) percent 
(4)  Other subdivision (minimum)-Seven (7) percent 
Land dedication and/or cash contributions for mixed-use planned unit developments shall be calculated in accordance with the percentage of land devoted to each use. Net developable land shall be calculated by gross acreage of all land in the proposed subdivision excluding wetlands and areas required for stormwater ponding, public streets, rights-of-way, and trails. All calculations shall be made at the time of final plat approval. 
(e)  Credit. The following credits towards park dedication shall be considered when applicable: 
(1)  Where a subdivision includes private open space intended for park and recreation use for all people within the subdivision and such land is to be privately owned and maintained, a credit towards the required land dedication and/or cash contribution may be approved by the city of up to twenty-five (25) percent. 
(2)  Where prior park land dedication and/or cash contribution has been given for land within a proposed subdivision, credit equivalent to the full amount dedicated and/or contributed shall be given. 
(3)  In no case shall park land dedication credits result in a refund. 
(f)  Land suitability. All land dedicated for parks, playgrounds, conservation, or public open spaces shall be suitable for its intended use and shall be at a convenient location for the intended users. In the evaluation of adequacy of proposed park, playground, conservation, or open space areas, the city shall consider factors including size, shape, topography, geology, hydrology, tree cover, access, and location. 
(g)  Payment requirements. The city may elect to accept a cash payment in lieu of a land dedication or any combination thereof equivalent to the land dedication requirements. In such case, the subdivider shall be required to make such payment to the city's dedicated park dedication fund based on the estimated market value, as determined by the county assessor, of unplatted land in the area for which park fees have not been paid and that is to be served with city sanitary sewer and water service, in an amount equivalent to the land dedication requirements. Cash payments contributed to this fund shall be used for the acquisition and improvement of land for parks, playgrounds, conservation, or other open space areas as provided by Minnesota State Statute. No funds shall be used for ongoing operation or maintenance of existing parks or recreational facilities or sites. All cash contributions shall be calculated and paid at final plat approval. 
    The city may approve a delay in the payment of cash contributions for any plat with park fees of more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) if an agreement is executed guaranteeing such payment as follows: 
(1)  Plats with park fees of two thousand five hundred one dollars ($2,501.00) to seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500.00) shall pay at least one-third (?) of the fee at final plat approval, one-half (1/2) of the balance not later than six (6) months from the date of final plat approval, and the balance not later than twelve (12) months from the date of final plat approval. No interest shall be charged during the twelve (12) months. 
(2)  Plats with park fees of over seven thousand five hundred one dollars ($7,501.00) shall pay at least one-third (?) of the fee at final plat approval, one-half (1/2) of the balance not later than twelve (12) months from the date of final plat approval, and the balance not later than twenty-four (24) months from the date of final plat approval. No interest shall be charged during the twenty-four (24) months. 
(h)  Improvements and infrastructure. Land dedicated for public use shall be designated as an outlot on the plat. The subdivider shall be responsible for grading the land to the contours approved on the preliminary plat and the land shall be left in condition suitable for the city. Improvements shall be made to all land dedicated for parks and open space in the same degree and manor as is required for developable property in section 14-114 of this chapter. All existing trees shall be preserved on land to be dedicated.

This provision shall not apply in whole or in part to residential uses combined with business or industrial uses. 
(c)  Measurement of discharge when noncity water source is used. If any lot, parcel of land, building or premises discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the sanitary sewer system of the city, either directly or indirectly, is supplied in whole or in part with water not obtained from the city, the owner or occupant of such property shall cause to be installed necessary metering equipment, as approved by the director of public works, to measure the quantity of water pumped or used, and the sewer rental charge shall be based on the quantity of water so measured. Whenever the owner, lessee or occupant fails to install such metering equipment, or where it is not practicable to measure the water consumed on any premises by a meter, the director of public works shall cause to be determined, in such manner and by such methods as may be practicable considering conditions and attendant circumstances in each case, the estimated volume of water from private sources which discharge into the sanitary sewer system of the city. Such estimate shall be used in lieu of the meter volume of water from private sources to determine the sewage rental charges therefor. 
(Code 1978, §§ 710.02-710.04; Ord. No. 995, § 5, 4-3-91; Ord. No. 1284, § 20, 2-2-09)

(a)  The amounts due to the city for sewer rental charges, computed in accordance with the provisions and statements of this division, will be billed quarterly or monthly, at the option of the city, at the same time and on the same bill with the city water and electric charge statement, to the owner or occupant of any premises served by the sanitary sewage system. If a property supplies all of its own water, a bill shall be rendered for sewer rental only. If sewer rental charges are billed quarterly for the preceding quarter year, they shall be due on April 1, July 1, October 1 and January 1 of each year, or as otherwise determined by the council and the municipal utilities commission. If sewer rental charges are billed monthly they shall be due, without penalty, the same as charges for water and electric energy. In the event of quarterly billing, all charges shall become delinquent thirty (30) days after they are due. 
(b)  If it is impossible for the city meter reader to gain access to the property served by the sewage system on the regular course of reading meters, the city reserves the right to institute a system of billing through estimates for prior use of the sewage system by the user or occupant, or through the use of estimate cards to be filed with and transmitted to the city by the user or occupant of the system. The city reserves the right to read meters quarterly, but to bill on a monthly basis on estimated use, in which case the last billing statement of the quarter in question, or for the year, shall be the true indication of the total water used by the occupant, and the total sewage charge therefor, during the period. 
(c)  Minimum charges to be paid as set forth in the schedule on file in the city clerk-treasurer's office shall be paid on the basis of total water used during the quarter year in question, although actual charges for sewer rental, exclusive of the minimum charges specified in the schedule on file in the city clerk-treasurer's office, may be billed on a monthly basis as set forth in this section. 
(Code 1978, § 710.10) 
Sec. 16-163. - Same-Charges to be lien on property served. 
    Nothing in this division shall be held or construed as in any way stopping or interfering with the city's right to levy, as taxes or assessments against any premises affected, any delinquent or past due sewer rental charges. Each and every sewer rental charge levied by and pursuant to this division is hereby made a lien upon the lot or premises served, and all such charges which are, on October 15 of each year, past due and delinquent, shall be certified to the county auditor as taxes or assessments on the real estate.

(1)  Protect life and property from dangers and damages associated with flooding. 
(2)  Protect public and private property from damage resulting from runoff or erosion. 
(3)  Control the annual runoff rates from post development site conditions to match the annual runoff rates from predevelopment site conditions. 
(4)  Promote site design that minimizes the generation of stormwater and maximizes pervious areas for stormwater treatment. 
(5)  Promote regional stormwater management by watershed. 
(6)  Provide a single, consistent set of performance standards that apply to all developments. 
(7)  Protect water quality from nutrients, pathogens, toxics, debris and thermal stress.

    The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section: 
    Accidental discharge means a discharge prohibited by this chapter which occurs by chance and without planning or thought prior to occurrence. 
    Applicant means any person or group that applies for a stormwater management plan, building permit, subdivision approval, site plan review or other permit to allow land-disturbing activities or who conducts activities pursuant to such permit. Applicant also means that person's agents, employees, and others acting under this person's or group's direction. The term "applicant" also refers to the permit holder or holders and the permit holder's agents, employees, and others acting under this person's or group's direction. 
    Best management practice (BMP) means a technique or series of techniques (that will be operational after the construction phase of a project and that is designed to become a permanent part of the site) which are proven to be effective in controlling runoff, erosion and sedimentation, and includes schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, general good housekeeping practices, pollution prevention and educational practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants directly or indirectly to stormwater, receiving waters, or stormwater conveyance systems. BMPs also include treatment practices, operating procedures, and practices to control site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or water disposal, or drainage from raw materials storage. Examples of BMPs can be found in; Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency 2000; Minnesota Urban Small Sites BMP Manual, Metropolitan Council 2001; State of Minnesota Stormwater Manual, MPCA 2005. 
    Buffer means a regulated area of land at or near a streambank, wetland, or waterbody that has intrinsic water quality value due to the ecological and biological processes it performs or is otherwise sensitive to changes which may result in significant degradation to water quality and where natural vegetation must be maintained. 
    Clean Water Act means the Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), as amended from time to time. 
    Common plan of development or sale means a contiguous area where multiple separate and distinct land-disturbing activities may be taking place at different times, or on different schedules, but under one proposed plan. This item is broadly defined to include design, permit application, advertisement or physical demarcation indicating that land-disturbing activities may occur. 
    Construction activity means activities subject to NPDES construction permits, generally consisting of construction projects resulting in land disturbance of one (1) acre or more, and including, but not limited to, such activities as clearing and grubbing, grading, excavating, and demolition. 
    Dedication means the deliberate appropriation of property by its owner for general public use. 
    Department means the City of Willmar Public Works Department or any other part, division, bureau, sub-unit, or branch of the city authorized by the city council to carry out or enforce any provision of a city ordinance. 
    Detention means the temporary storage of stormwater runoff in a stormwater BMP with the goals of controlling peak discharge rates and providing gravity settling of pollutants. 
    Developer means any person, group, firm, corporation, sole proprietorship, partnership, state agency, or political subdivision thereof engaged in a land disturbance activity. 
    Development means any land disturbance activity that changes the site's runoff characteristics in conjunction with residential, commercial, industrial or institutional construction or alteration. 
    Dewatering means the removal of water for construction activity. It can be a discharge of appropriated surface or groundwater to dry and/or solidify a construction site. It may require Minnesota Department of Natural Resources permits to be appropriated and if contaminated may require other Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) permits to be discharged. 
    Discharge means the release, conveyance, channeling, runoff, or drainage, of stormwater including snowmelt, from a construction site. 
    Drainageway means a natural or artificial watercourse with a definite bed and banks that conducts continuously or periodically flowing water. 
    Easement means a legal right granted by an owner to a grantee allowing the use of private land for conveyance or treatment of stormwater runoff and access to stormwater practices. 
    EPA means the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
    Erosion means any process that wears away the surface of the land by the action of water, wind, ice, or gravity. Erosion can be accelerated by the activities of people and nature. 
    Erosion control means methods employed to prevent erosion. Examples include soil stabilization practices, horizontal slope grading, temporary cover, final stabilization, and construction phasing. 
    Exposed soil areas means all areas of the construction site where the vegetation (trees, shrubs, brush, grasses, etc.) or impervious surface has been removed, thus rendering the soil more prone to erosion. This includes topsoil stockpile areas, borrow areas and disposal areas within the construction site. It does not include temporary stockpiles or surcharge areas of clean sand, gravel, concrete or bituminous, which have less stringent protection. Once soil is exposed, it is considered "exposed soil," until it meets the definition of "final stabilization." 
    Final stabilization means that all soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed, and that a uniform (evenly distributed, e.g., without large bare areas) perennial vegetative cover with a density of seventy (70) percent of the cover for unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent structures has been established, or equivalent permanent stabilization measures have been employed. Simply sowing grass seed is not considered final stabilization. For individual lots in residential construction, final stabilization means either: (a) the homebuilder completing final stabilization as specified above; or (b) the homebuilder establishing temporary stabilization including perimeter controls for an individual lot prior to occupation of the home by the homeowner and informing the homeowner of the need for, and benefits of, final stabilization. Where agricultural land is involved, such as when pipelines are built on crop or range land, final stabilization constitutes returning the land to its preconstruction agricultural use. Areas disturbed that were not previously used for agricultural activities, such as buffer strips immediately adjacent to surface waters and drainage systems, and areas which are not being returned to their preconstruction agricultural use must meet the final stabilization criteria in (a) or (b) above. 
    Hazardous materials means any material, including any substance, waste, or combination thereof, which because of its quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical, or infectious characteristics may cause, or significantly contribute to, a substantial present or potential hazard to human health, safety, property, or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed of, or otherwise managed. 
    Illegal connection means either of the following: 
(1)  Any pipe, open channel, drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or subsurface, that allows an illicit discharge to enter the storm drain system including, but not limited to, any conveyances that allow any non-stormwater discharge including sewage, process wastewater, or wash water to enter the storm drain system or any connections to the storm drain system, regardless of whether such pipe, open channel, drain or conveyance has been previously allowed, permitted, or approved by an authorized agency; or 
(2)  Any pipe, open channel, drain or conveyance connected from a commercial or industrial land use to the storm drain system that has not been documented in plans, maps, or equivalent records and approved by the department. 
    Illicit discharge means any direct or indirect non-stormwater discharge to the storm drain system, except as exempted in section 17-32 of this article. 
    Impaired waters mean those streams, rivers, and lakes that currently do not meet their designated use classification and associated water quality standards under the Clean Water Act. 
    Impervious cover means those surfaces that cannot effectively infiltrate rainfall (e.g., building rooftops, pavement, sidewalks, driveways, etc.). 
    Impervious surface means a constructed hard surface that either prevents or retards the entry of water into the soil and causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities and at an increased rate of flow than existed prior to development. Examples include rooftops, sidewalks, patios, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, and concrete, asphalt, or gravel roads. 
    Infiltration means the process of percolating stormwater into the subsoil. 
    Industrial activity means any activity subject to NPDES permits as defined in 40 CFR § 122.26(b)(14). 
    Land disturbance activity means any land change that may result in soil erosion from water or wind and the movement of sediments into or upon waters or lands within the city's jurisdiction, including construction, clearing and grubbing, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land, and similar activities. Land disturbance activity does not include: 
(1)  Minor land disturbance activities such as home gardens and home landscaping, or home repairs and maintenance work, unless such activity exceeds one (1) acre in exposed soil. 
(2)  Construction, installation, and maintenance of fences, signs, posts, poles, and electric, telephone, cable television, utility lines or individual service connections to these utilities. 
(3)  Tilling, planting, or harvesting of agricultural, horticultural, or silvicultural (forestry) crops. 
(4)  Emergency work to protect life, limb, or property and emergency repairs. If, apart from the emergency, the land disturbance activity requires a permit under this chapter, the property owner shall submit a SWPPP and obtain a permit, and shape and stabilize the disturbed land area, as soon as possible following the emergency work. 
    Land locked basin means a low area such as a lake, pond, or wetland entirely surrounded by land with no regularly active outlet channel. 
    Maintenance agreement means a legally recorded document that acts as a property deed restriction, and that provides for long-term maintenance of stormwater BMPs or practices. 
    Maximum extent practicable means a standard for water quality that applies to all MS4 operators regulated under the NPDES program. 
    MPCA means the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.

    Wet detention facility means depressions constructed by excavation and embankment procedures to store excess runoff temporarily on a site. After a runoff event, overflow from the pond is released at a controlled rate by an outlet device designed to release flows at various peak rates and elevations until the design elevation of the pool is reached. Wet detention facilities maintain a permanent pool of water between storm events. Wet detention facilities are located to collect stormwater inflows from adjacent drainage areas and are usually designed to control peak discharges from relatively large design storms. 
    Wetland means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Constructed wetlands designed for wastewater treatment are not waters of the state.

The purpose of this article is to minimize negative impacts of stormwater runoff pollution on the city's water resources by regulating development activities and by assuring long-term effectiveness of existing and future stormwater management facilities on public and private property. This article sets forth rules and regulations to manage the stormwater runoff and establishes procedures for the development and approval of a stormwater management plan. This article is adopted pursuant to the authorization contained in Minn. Stat. chs. 103B and 462, and Minnesota Rules ch. 7090. 
(b)  Applicability. This article shall apply to all land disturbance activities conducted on any developed and undeveloped lands in the city unless explicitly exempted by section 17-9(b) of this article. 
(Ord. No. 1406, § 2, 11-6-17) 
Sec. 17-9. - Stormwater management plans and permits. 
(a)  Stormwater management plan required. Every applicant for a permit that will authorize the disturbance of one (1) acre or more of land, or a common plan of development or sale that will result in the disturbance of one (1) acre or more of land, or the disturbance of land within a shoreland area as defined by the city's shoreland management ordinance to which section 17-18 applies, must submit a stormwater management plan to the city. No land shall be disturbed nor shall any permit to allow land-disturbing activities be issued until approval of this plan. 
(b)  Exceptions . A stormwater management plan (SWPPP) is not required for the following: 
(1)  Any development or expansion/redevelopment project which results in disturbance of less than one (1) acre of land, unless the development is located in a shoreland area, in which case a plan sufficient to demonstrate compliance with section 17-18 shall be submitted. 
(2)  Emergency work to preserve life, limb, or property, provided that if, apart from the emergency, the land disturbance activity requires a SWPPP under this article, the property owner shall submit a SWPPP and obtain a NPDES construction stormwater permit, and shape and stabilize the disturbed land area, as soon as possible following the emergency work. 
(c)  NPDES construction stormwater permit. All SWPPPs and stormwater mitigation and management technologies must comply with the most recent NPDES permit requirements as administered by MPCA under the NPDES stormwater construction permit, and the Minnesota Stormwater Manual, except where more specific requirements are contained herein. 
(d)  TMDL allocation plans. All stormwater management plans must be in compliance with TMDL allocation plans, and other special plans as shall be adopted and amended from time to time. 
(e)  Compliance with city plans and permits. All stormwater management plans must be prepared in accordance with the city's stormwater pollution prevention program and the city's current NPDES MS4 permit. 
(Ord. No. 1406, § 2, 11-6-17) 
Sec. 17-10. - Stormwater management plan submittal requirements. 
(a)  Application. A stormwater management plan application shall be made on a form provided by the city and shall be submitted with an application for a permit that will disturb one (1) acre or more, or a common plan of development or sale that will result in the disturbance of one (1) acre or more, and shall include the following:

(Ord. No. 1406, § 2, 11-6-17) 
Sec. 17-11. - Stormwater management plan review procedures. 
(a)  Application, review and approval process . Unless exempted under section 17-09(b), no permit or approval that authorizes disturbing one (1) acre or more of land shall be issued until the city has approved a required stormwater management plan (SWPPP). Approval of a stormwater management plan does not exempt the applicant from the requirements and permitting authority of other agencies having jurisdiction over the work performed nor from other permitting processes required by the city. 
(b)  City review. The department shall review the SWPPP application for completeness and compliance with standards. If needed, staff shall return the application to the applicant to make changes or supply additional information. Land-disturbing activities may begin only upon approval of the application and issuance of the permit. 
(c)  Reviewed plans. If the plans meet the performance standards and requirements of this article, the city shall endorse in writing or stamp on the plans "Reviewed." However, construction activities may begin only upon approval of the site plan review application. Such reviewed plans shall not be changed or deviated from by the applicant without authorization from the city. One (1) set of reviewed plans shall be returned to the applicant, and that set shall be kept on the project site at all times during which the authorized work is in progress. 
(d)  SWPPP approval. If the city determines that the SWPPP meets the requirements of this article, the city shall issue a permit valid for a specified period of time that authorizes the land disturbance activity contingent on the implementation and completion of the SWPPP. 
(e)  SWPPP denial. If the city determines that the SWPPP does not meet the requirements of this article, the city shall not issue a permit for the land disturbance activity. The SWPPP must be resubmitted for approval before the land disturbance activity begins. All permit applications shall be suspended until the developer has an approved SWPPP. 
(f)  Amendments. The applicant must amend the SWPPP as necessary to include additional requirements such as additional or modified BMPs designed to correct problems identified or address situations whenever: 
(1)  A change in design, construction, operation, maintenance, weather, or seasonal conditions occurs that has a significant effect on the discharge of pollutants to surface waters or underground waters. 
(2)  Inspections indicate the plan is not effective in eliminating or significantly minimizing the discharge of pollutants to surface waters or underground waters or that the discharges are causing violations of applicable water quality standards. 
(3)  The plan is not achieving the general objectives of controlling pollutants or is not consistent with the terms and conditions of the NPDES construction stormwater permit. 
(g)  Permit transfer . A permit runs with the property it covers, until the permitted activities are completed, and is transferable to new owners in its entirety or by parcel, with each parcel being subject to the permit and any conditions that apply to that parcel. In the event land under such a permit is transferred or conveyed in fee, such transfer or conveyance must be reported in writing to the city and the new owner within seven (7) days of the transfer. This section refers to city-issued permits and does not release the permittee or owner from transfer requirements of a NPDES permit. 
(Ord. No. 1406, § 2, 11-6-17) 
Sec. 17-12. - Waivers. 
    The city council, upon recommendation of the city engineer, may waive requirements of this article upon making a finding that compliance with the requirements will involve an unnecessary hardship and the waiver of such requirements will not adversely affect the standards and requirements set forth in this article. The city may require, as a condition of the waiver, such dedication (e.g., land, easement, etc.), construction, or fee in lieu of construction as a contribution to off-site facilities, as may be necessary to adequately meet the standards and requirements of this article. 
(Ord. No. 1406, § 2, 11-6-17) 
Sec. 17-13. - Stormwater management plan inspections and enforcement. 
(a)  Inspections. The city will conduct inspections on a regular basis to ensure that the plan is properly installed and maintained. In all cases the inspectors will attempt to work with the builder or developer to maintain proper erosion and sediment control at all sites. In cases where cooperation is withheld, the city shall issue construction stop work orders, until erosion and sediment control measures meet the requirements of this chapter. An inspection must follow before work can commence. Inspections are required as follows: 
(1)  Before any land-disturbing activity begins. 
(2)  For residential construction, at the time of footing, framing and final inspections. 
(3)  At the completion of the project. 
(4)  Prior to the release of any financial securities, if applicable. 
(5)  Random inspections during the course of the project to ensure compliance with the SWPPP, including after a storm event greater than one-half (1/2) inch over twenty-four (24) hours. 
(b)  Notification of failure of the SWPPP. The city shall notify the permit holder of the failure of the SWPPP's measures. 
(1)  Initial contact. The initial contact will be to the party or parties listed on the application and/or the plan as contacts. Except during an emergency action, forty-eight (48) hours after notification by the city or seventy-two (72) hours after the failure of erosion control measures, whichever is less, the city at its discretion, may begin corrective work. Such notification should be in writing, but if it is verbal, a written notification should follow as quickly as practical. If after making a good faith effort to notify the responsible party or parties, the city has been unable to establish contact, the city may proceed with corrective work. There are conditions when time is of the essence in controlling erosion. During such a condition the city may take immediate action, and then notify the applicant as soon as possible. 
(2)  Erosion off-site. If erosion breaches the perimeter of the site, the applicant shall immediately develop a cleanup and restoration plan, obtain the right-of entry from the adjoining property owner, and implement the cleanup and restoration plan within forty-eight (48) hours of obtaining the adjoining property owner's permission. In no case, unless written approval is received from the city, may more than seven (7) calendar days go by without corrective action being taken. If in the discretion of the city, the permit holder does not repair the damage caused by the erosion, the city may do the remedial work required. When restoration to wetlands and other resources are required, the applicant shall be required to work with the appropriate agency to ensure that the work is done properly. 
(3)  Erosion into streets, wetlands or water bodies. If eroded soils (including tracked soils from construction activities) enters streets, wetlands, or other water bodies, cleanup and repair shall be immediate. The applicant shall provide all traffic control and flagging required to protect the traveling public during the cleanup operations. 
(c)  Failure to do corrective work. When an applicant fails to conform to any provision of this policy within the time stipulated, the city may take the following actions. 
(1)  Issue a stop work order, withhold the scheduling of inspections and/or the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(2)  Revoke any permit issued by the city to the applicant for the site in question or any other of the applicant's sites within the city's jurisdiction. 
(3)  Correct the deficiency or hire a contractor to correct the deficiency. The issuance of a permit constitutes a right of entry for the city or its contractor to enter upon the construction site for the purpose of correcting deficiencies in erosion control. 
(4)  Require reimbursement to the city for all costs incurred in correcting stormwater pollution control deficiencies. If payment is not made within thirty (30) days after the city incurs costs, the city will halt all work on the project site and assess any reimbursement costs to the property. As a condition of the permit, the owner shall waive notice of any assessment hearing to be conducted by the city, concur that the benefit to the property exceeds the amount of the proposed assessment, and waive all rights by virtue of Minnesota Statute 429.081 to challenge the amount or validity of assessment. 
(d)  Right of entry and inspection. 
(1)  Powers . The applicant shall allow the city and its authorized representatives, upon presentation of credentials, to: 
a.  Enter upon the permitted site for the purpose of obtaining information, examination of records, conducting investigations or surveys. 
b.  Bring such equipment upon the permitted development as is necessary to conduct such surveys and investigations. 
c.  Examine and copy any books, papers, records, or memoranda pertaining to activities or records required to be kept under the terms and conditions of this permitted site. 
d.  Inspect the stormwater pollution control measures. 
e.  Sample and monitor any items or activities pertaining to stormwater pollution control measures. 
(Ord. No. 1406, § 2, 11-6-17) 
Sec. 17-14. - Development agreement. 
    A development agreement regarding stormwater management may be required for any project that requires a stormwater management plan. The agreement shall guarantee the performance of the work described and delineated on the approved plan. In addition, the agreement will describe the city's inspection policy. Should the applicant fail to meet any of the terms of the development agreement, the city may proceed with any of the actions listed in section 17-13. 
(Ord. No. 1406, § 2, 11-6-17) 
Sec. 17-15. - Construction activities. 
    Construction activities must at a minimum comply with the NPDES construction stormwater permit and the SWPPP in addition to the following best management practices: 
(1)  Site dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be treated by temporary sedimentation basins, grit chambers, sand filters, upflow chambers, hydrocyclones, soil concentrators or other appropriate controls as deemed necessary. Water may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion, sedimentation, or flooding on the site, on downstream properties, in the receiving channels, or in any wetland. 
(2)  Waste and material disposal. All waste and unused building materials (including garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, petroleum based products, paints, toxic materials, or other hazardous materials) shall be properly disposed of off-site and shall not be allowed to be carried by runoff into a receiving channel, storm sewer system, or wetland. 
(3)  Tracking management. Each site shall have roads, access drives and parking areas of sufficient width, length and surfacing to minimize sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any material deposited by vehicles or other construction equipment onto a public or private road shall be removed (not by flushing) before the end of each working day. 
(4)  Water quality protection. The construction contractor, including the general contractor and all subcontractors, shall be required to control oil and fuel spills and chemical discharges to prevent such spills or discharges from entering any watercourse, sump, sewer system, water body, or wetland. 
(5)  Site erosion and sedimentation control. Construction operations must include erosion and sedimentation control measures meeting accepted design criteria, standards and specifications contained in the Minnesota Stormwater Manual or other standards determined acceptable by the city. 
(6)  Concrete washout area. All liquids and solid waste generated by concrete washout operations must be contained in a leak-proof containment facility or impermeable liner. A compacted clay liner that does not allow washout liquids to enter ground water is considered an impermeable liner. A sign must be installed adjacent to each washout facility to inform concrete equipment operators to utilize the proper facilities. 
(7)  Storm drain protection. All storm drain inlets shall be protected during construction with control measures as contained in the SWPPP. These devices shall remain in place until final stabilization of the site. A regular inspection and maintenance plan shall be developed in implemented to assure these devices are operational at all times. Storm drain protection must conform to the protection alternatives pre-approved by city staff and available at city hall and on the city's website. 
(8)  Soil stockpiling. All exposed soil areas must be stabilized as soon as possible to limit soil erosion but in no case later than fourteen (14) days after the construction activity in that portion of the site has temporarily or permanently ceased. Temporary clean aggregate stockpiles, demolition concrete stockpiles, sand stockpiles and the constructed base components of roads are exempt from this requirement. 
(Ord. No. 1406, § 2, 11-6-17) 
Sec. 17-16. - Post-construction performance standards for stormwater management. 
(a)  Water quality criteria. 
(1)  Best management practices shall be implemented that reduce the total suspended solids load by eighty (80) percent, and the phosphorus load by sixty (60) percent from the runoff generated by the two-year, twenty-four-hour event for the developed site as a whole, as compared to no runoff management controls. These standards may be met through the runoff volume reduction criteria below (subsection (c) of this section). If the criteria are met through ponding, the following guidelines for the design of wet detention facilities shall be followed: 
a.  A permanent pool ("dead storage") volume below the principal spillway (normal outlet) which shall be greater than or equal to the runoff from a two and one-half (21/2) inch storm over the entire contributing drainage area assuming full development. 
b.  A permanent pool average depth (basin volume/basin area) which shall be greater than or equal to three (3) feet, with a maximum depth of less than or equal to ten (10) feet. 
c.  Basin side slopes above the normal water level should be no steeper than 3:1, and preferably flatter. A basin shelf with a minimum width of ten (10) feet and one (1) foot deep below the normal water level is recommended to enhance wildlife habitat, reduce potential safety hazards, and improve access for long-term maintenance. 
d.  The pond should be wedge shaped with the inlet at the narrowest end and the outlet at the widest end. A length to width ration of 3:1 or greater shall be used whenever possible. Distance between outfalls and outlets should be maximized. 
e.  Skimmers or other similar devices are required on pond outlets. Designs shall provide for skimmers that extend a minimum of four (4) inches below the water surface and minimize the velocities of water passing under the skimmer to less than one-half (1/2) foot per second for the one (1) year twenty-four-hour event. 
f.  Side slopes shall be seeded with native vegetation appropriate to the site conditions. Upland buffers on side slopes are required. Buffers shall include a mixture of deciduous and coniferous shrubs and include access for pond maintenance. Trees are encouraged as part of the upland buffer. Buffers shall be designed to provide maintenance access to the facility. 
g.  The applicant shall provide the city with a two-year warranty on all vegetation to ensure plant establishment and survival. 
h.  Pond designs that incorporate filtered bottom withdrawal, vegetated swale discharges, or constructed wetland treatment cells to limit temperature increases are encouraged. 
i.  Pond designs that incorporate tree shading to limit future temperature increases are encouraged. 
(2)  Infiltration/filtration methods, described under runoff volume control are the preferred approach to satisfying the water quality treatment requirements in all areas of the city where practical and subject to the limitations of section 17-6(c)(3). 
(3)  For all projects, street catch basins must have a three-foot sump. 
(4)  Where TSS and/or TP reduction requirements cannot be met on the site of the original construction, the applicant will be required to locate alternative sites where TSS and/or TP treatment standards can be achieved. Mitigation project locations are chosen in the following order of preference: 
a.  Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water that receives runoff from the original construction activity. 
b.  Locations within the same department of natural resource (DNR) catchment area as the original construction activity. 
c.  Locations in the next adjacent DNR catchment area upstream. 
d.  Locations anywhere within the City of Willmar. 
Mitigation projects shall involve the establishment of new structural stormwater BMPs or the retrofit of existing structural stormwater BMPs, or the use of a properly designed regional structural stormwater BMP. Previously required routine maintenance of structural stormwater BMPs cannot be considered mitigation. Mitigation projects must be finished within twenty-four (24) months after the original construction activity begins. A maintenance agreement specifying the responsible party for long- term maintenance shall be identified. Payments will not be accepted in lieu of the construction project meeting the TSS and TP treatment standards. 
(b)  Runoff rate control criteria. 
(1)  Future discharge rates from new development and redevelopment will not exceed existing discharge rates for the two-year (fifty (50) percent), ten-year (ten (10) percent), and 100-year (one (1) percent) twenty-four-hour critical storm events and the 100-year (one (1) percent) ten-day snowmelt, in accordance with the most recent Atlas14 data, as supplemented and amended from time to time. In any area where downstream flooding is a concern the city may require additional rate control. Design calculations for the two-year (fifty (50) percent), ten-year (ten percent), and 100-year (one (1) percent) twenty-four-hour critical storm events and the 100-year (one (1) percent) ten-day snowmelt must be submitted to the city for review and approval. For a regional detention or stormwater management system, the city engineer shall recommend a proposed system charge to be administered by the city council based upon an approved watershed master plan and an analysis of required drainage systems, projected costs and flood protection benefits provided to those properties directly or indirectly impacted by the regional detention or stormwater management system. 
(2)  The stormwater system must be designed to provide discharge capacity or level of service for the following system components. The city may allow variance to these standards if regional ponding systems are located downstream. 
Local storm sewer-Ten-year (ten (10) percent) event. 
Trunk storm sewer-100-year (one (1) percent) event. 
Storm ponds, pipe and drainageways connecting ponds, and open channels-100-year event. 
(3)  For stormwater collection systems not designed to meet rate control standards (e.g., catch basins), a clogging factor of fifty (50) percent will be used to size intake structures. 
(4)  No orifice having a diameter less than eight (8) inches is allowed in the design of rate control structures within the city. If a structure having an opening less than eight (8) inches is required to meet rate control requirements, the required rate control for a site will be increased to allow a rate consistent with an opening of this size. 
(5)  An emergency spillway or outlet from ponding areas shall be installed at a minimum of one (1) foot below the lowest building opening and shall be designed to have a capacity to overflow water at an elevation below the lowest building opening at a rate not less than three (3) times the 100-year (one (1) percent) peak discharge rate from the basin or the anticipated 100-year (one (1) percent) peak inflow rate to the basin, whichever is higher. A narrative shall be submitted describing the secondary flow paths for events larger than the 100-year (one (1) percent) event. 
(c)  Runoff volume control criteria. 
(1)  Volume control measures are required on projects to meet the water quality criteria of the city and to meet the requirements of the city's NPDES MS4 permit obligations. Except where conditions listed below are not met, stormwater runoff abstraction via infiltration, evapotranspiration, capture, and/or reuse of stormwater runoff is required to treat the water quality volume of one (1) inch (or one (1) inch minus the volume of stormwater treated by another system on the site) of runoff from the new impervious surfaces created by a development project. For new development projects, stormwater discharge volume shall result in no net increase from pre-project conditions. For redevelopment projects, stormwater discharge volume shall result in a net reduction from pre-project conditions. Runoff must be infiltrated within forty-eight (48) hours or less. To simplify the review process, no runoff will be assumed from pervious surfaces from a one inch rainfall event. 
(2)  Infiltration will not be required nor allowed in areas where: 
a.  There are known groundwater contaminants; 
b.  The soils are not suitable for infiltration (hydrologic soil group D); 
c.  The area is within a drinking water supply management areas are present, as defined by Minn. R. 4720.51000, subp. 13; 
d.  Soil infiltration rates are more than 8.3 inches per hour, unless soils are amended to flow the infiltration rate below 8.3 inches per hour; or 
e.  There is less than three (3) feet of separation between the bottom of the infiltration system and the groundwater. 
Percolation tests shall be required to verify the infiltration rates of on-site soils following the construction of infiltration BMP's. 
(3)  Pretreatment of stormwater is required prior to discharge to an infiltration system. This pretreatment shall collect sediment and be easily accessed for inspection and maintenance. The infiltration/filtration system selected must meet the following criteria: 
a.  Remove settleable solids, floating materials, and oils and grease to the maximum extent practicable before runoff enters the system. 
b.  Filtration must be designed to remove eighty (80) percent of total suspended solids. 
c.  Consider the impact of construction and infiltration practices on existing hydrologic features (e.g., existing wetlands) and maintain pre-existing conditions. 
d.  Consider potential hotspots, groundwater warning, design measures, maintenance considerations or other retention, detention, and treatment devises as specified in the stormwater manual. 
e.  The infiltration practice shall not be used within fifty (50) feet of a municipal, community or private well, unless specifically allowed by an approved wellhead protection plan. 
f.  The infiltration practice shall not be used for runoff from fueling and vehicle maintenance areas and industrial areas with exposed materials posing contamination risk. 
g.  Ensure the area is not compacted while the site is under construction. 
h.  The infiltration/filtration area shall be staked and marked so heavy construction vehicles do not compact the soil. 
i.  To prevent clogging the system shall have a pretreatment device such as a vegetated filter strip, small sedimentation basin, or water quality inlet (e.g., grit chamber) to settle particulates before stormwater discharges into the system. 
j.  Ensure appropriate on-site testing consistent with the Stormwater Manual is conducted to verify soil type and to ensure a minimum of three (3) feet of separation from the seasonally saturated soils (or bedrock) and the bottom of the proposed system is maintained. 
k.  Ensure filtration systems with less than three (3) feet of separation form seasonally saturated soils or from bedrock are constructed with an impermeable liner. 
l.  The infiltration practice shall not be used in Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG) D soils without soil corrections. 
m.  Provide an eight-foot wide maintenance access. 
(4)  The city may authorize reduced volume control for the following situations: 
a.  If the project meets one (1) of the limitations outlined above. 
b.  If the applicant implements to the maximum extent possible other volume reduction practices, besides infiltration, on the site but may not meet the requirements for post-construction stormwater management. 
(d)  General performance standards. 
(1)  For development proposals having more than one (1) acre of new impervious area, all stormwater treatment must be designed to address the actual amount of impervious surface or the following impervious surface coverage amounts for the entire development site, whichever is higher. 
a.  Residential lots (one (1) or two (2) dwelling units)-Forty (40) percent. 
b.  Commercial and industrial lots-Eighty-five (85) percent. 
(2)  Unless superseded by the city's requirements, stormwater management practices shall be designed according to the most current technology as reflected in the stormwater manual. 
(3)  The natural surface water drainage system shall be used as far as is feasible for storage and flow of runoff. All stormwater diversion discharged to natural waterways must meet the performance standards in this section 17-16. 
(4)  All structural or engineered stormwater treatment facilities shall be located in an outlot or in a drainage and utility easement dedicated to the city. Facilities may be located within the right-of-way at the city's discretion. Access of sufficient size shall be provided to each treatment facility to perform maintenance activities identified in the maintenance plan. 
(5)  Subdivision design shall be consistent with limitations presented by steep slopes. Subdivisions shall be designed so that no construction or grading will be conducted on slopes steeper than twelve (12) percent in grade unless it can be demonstrated through satisfactory design that the area can be built upon without problems with soil erosion or danger from slides. 
(6)  All applicants shall submit as-built plans for all structural or engineered facilities at project completion. The plans must show the final design specifications for all facilities. Plans must certify that the facilities meet the performance standards and be signed by a registered professional engineer. 
(7)  Stormwater management plans must show construction staging and specifically address measures to preserve the infiltration capacity of proposed infiltration facilities to ensure that the performance of such facilities are not impaired at the conclusion of construction. Plans shall also demonstrate methods of staging construction to minimize soil compaction of landscaped areas during construction. Soil testing and decompaction may be required if site construction activities negatively impact soil permeability. 
(8)  A planted vegetated buffer width of fifty (50) feet shall be established and maintained around all wetlands, stormwater ponds and infiltration/filtration facilities. Buffers shall be measured perpendicular from the high water level of a constructed facility or the delineated wetland edge, and shall be provided and maintained at all times. Monuments/signs shall be located to delineate the buffer. The monuments/signs should be placed at an interval of approximately one hundred (100) feet and at locations where the buffer line deviates by more than thirty (30) degrees. The signs should conform to local standards and be at least four (4) feet high, made of non-degradable material, and minimally contain the words: Buffer-Do Not Mow or Fill. Contact City of Willmar for Further Information. 
(9)  No fences, structures or other impediments shall be constructed across the natural or constructed waterway that will reduce or restrict the flow of water. Fences, structures or other impediments or other structures built within drainage easements are placed at the owner's risk.

(2)  Take such appropriate preventative action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including, but not limited to, immediately halting operations or terminating the discharge; and 
(3)  Immediately comply with all requirements of this article and other applicable laws and regulations. 
    In the event of a person's failure to immediately comply with the emergency cease and desist order, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the storm drain system or waters of the state, or endangerment to persons or to the environment, including immediately terminating the facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The city may allow the person to recommence the discharge activities when he or she has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the person under this article. A person that is found by the city to be responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the MPCA within thirty (30) days of receipt of the emergency cease and desist order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, the city taking any other action against the violator. 
    In the event that a violation or suspected violation occurs which constitutes an immediate danger to public health and safety, the city is authorized to, in lieu of an emergency cease and desist order or notice of violation, enter upon the subject property without giving prior notice, to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and preserve public health and safety. 
(e)  Suspension of storm drainage system access. 
(1)  The city may, without prior notice, suspend storm drainage system access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the storm drainage system or waters of the state. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the storm sewer system or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(2)  Any person discharging to the storm drainage system in violation of this article may have their storm drainage system access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. Such suspension may also be imposed if it is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger. 
(f)  In the event that the abatement or restoration work is performed by the city, the city may charge the violator for its costs and expenses associated with the work. If the bill received for abatement or restoration is not paid within thirty (30) days, the city may draw the amount of the bill from any financial guarantees or security that the city may be holding or may certify the amount to the county for collection with the property taxes. 
(g)  Violation of any provision of this article may be enforced by civil action including an action for injunctive relief and by any administrative penalties approved by the city. In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this article is a threat to public health, safety and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense or a civil action to abate, enjoin or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken. 
(h)  Any person, firm or corporation failing to comply with or violating any of the provisions of this article, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and each day during which any violation of any of the provisions of this article is committed, continued or permitted, shall constitute a separate offense. 
(i)  In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this article is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense; and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken. 
(Ord. No. 1334, § 1, 10-1-12; Ord. No. 1406, § 5, 11-6-17) 
Sec. 17-39. - Appeal. 
(a)  Administrative decisions and enforcement actions by city staff may be appealed by the applicant to the city administrator as follows: 
(1)  The appeal must be filed in writing with the city clerk within ten (10) business days of the date of the decision or enforcement action. 
(2)  The written appeal shall specify in detail the action appealed from, the errors allegedly made by the enforcement officer giving rise to the appeal, a written summary of all oral and written testimony the applicant intends to introduce at the hearing, including the names and addresses of all witnesses the applicant intends to call, copies of all documents the applicant intends to introduce at the hearing, and the relief requested. 
(3)  The enforcement officer shall specify in writing the reasons for the enforcement action, a written summary of all oral and written testimony the enforcement officer intends to introduce at the hearing, including the names and addresses of all witnesses the enforcement officer intends to call, and copies of all documents the enforcement officer intends to introduce at the hearing. 
(4)  The city clerk shall notify the applicant and the enforcement officer by ordinary mail, of the date, time and place for the hearing. The hearing shall be scheduled for a date not less than four (4) or more than twenty (20) days after the filing of the appeal. 
(5)  The city administrator shall hear and render a decision on the appeal after the hearing. The decision shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the decision. The city clerk shall notify the applicant and the enforcement officer by mail of the decision. 
(b)  The applicant may appeal a decision of the city administrator to the city council, by written notice of appeal filed with the city clerk. Such appeal shall be filed within ten (10) business days of the date of the administrator's decision. The decision of the city administrator shall remain in effect pending appeal to the city council, unless otherwise directed by the city council. The city council, in its sole discretion, may agree to hear the appeal and make a final decision or may decline to hear the appeal, in which case the decision of the city administrator shall be final.

be removed as soon as practicable, commensurate
with the preservation of property values inherent
in the sign. The following criteria shall govern
the determination of a nonconforming use period:
)
(1) (a) Whether or not a permit was obtained for
the sign, or approval was granted by
virtue of including the sign on a
development plan/site plan receiving a
positive review by the Zoning
Administrator or Planning commission. It
shall be the responsibility of the sign
owner to demonstrate to the Zoning
Administrator that a nonconforming sign
has a permit or was likewise approved at
the time of its erection.
(b) The nonconforming use period for such
permitted/approved signs shall not exceed
ten (10) years from the date of
verification of the nonconforming status
of the sign by the Zoning Administrator.

the nonconforming use period shall not
exceed five (5) years from the date of
verification of the nonconforming status
of the sign by the Zoning Administrator.
(d) This criterium shall not apply to signs
allowed by a variance, as a variance is
permanent in nature unless conditioned
otherwise.

pUblic road right-of-way.
(b) To minimize potential liability to the
city created by a sign erected in, or
projecting into, a public road right-ofway,
the nonconforming use period for
such signs shall not exceed two (2) years
from the date of verification of the
nonconforming status of the sign by the
Zoning Administrator.

(c) Signs erected in, or projecting into, a
pUblic right-cif-way for which a permit
was obtained or approval granted, shall
have a nonconforming use period not to
exceed ten (10) years as specified above.

another or other signs, exceeds the number of
signs permitted under this Ordinance, the owner
of the signs shall determine which sign or
signs shall remain as the permitted sign or
signs and the nonconforming use period of the
other sign or signs shall be six (6) months.

the criteria herein set forth, make a determination
of the nonconforming use period
for each nonconforming sign.

Administrator shall serve a notice upon the
owner of such sign setting out his determination
of the nonconforming use period of the
sign and a copy of section 5.J. of this Ordinance.

this section provides for the continuation of nonconforming

E. CHANGE FROM NONCONFORMING USE. A nonconforming use may be
changed to a conforming (permitted) use, but once it has become
conforming it cannot revert to a nonconforming use. A
nonconforming use may be changed to a more restrictive nonconforming
use, provided no structural changes are made to the
structures involved. A nonconforming use shall not be changed
to a less restrictive nonconforming use.
F. ABANDONMENT. When any nonconforming structure/use is abandoned
for a period of six (6) months or more, such structure
shall not be used, or use established, in any manner which
would constitute nonconformity with the provisions of this
Ordinance. Such structures/uses shall be considered abandoned,
and the city may proceed to cause the structure to be
removed or the use barred from re-establishment.
G. DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION. If any nonconforming structure, or
structure used as part of a nonconforming use, is damaged to
the extent of fifty (50) percent or more of its estimated
market value, it shall not be restored unless the structure or
use can be brought into conformity with this Ordinance. Any

J. RELOCATION OF STRUCTURES/USES. No nonconforming structure or
use shall be moved to another lot or to any other part of the
parcel of land upon which it was constructed or conducted at
the time of this Ordinance adoption, unless such movement
shall bring the nonconforming structure/use into compliance
with the provisions of this Ordinance.
K. VARIANCES PROHIBITED. No variance may be granted for any
enlargement or addition to any nonconforming structure/use

it is in the best interests of the public health, safety, and
welfare to provide for the wise sUbdivision, use, and
development of shorelands of public waters. The Legislature
of Minnesota has delegated responsibility to local governments
of the state to regulate the sUbdivision, use, and development
of the shorelands of pUblic waters and thus preserve and

D. consistency of Land Use Districts to state standards. The
city of Willmar Comprehensive Land Use Plan promotes a
development philosophy which is consistent with that found
within the state Shoreland Management Standards. Zoning
district designations created by the City, and made the focal
point of the Zoning and Shoreland ordinances/Maps, reflect
this philosophy and provide the necessary framework to control
land uses within the various shoreland areas. Although the
City's existing zoning districts were adopted for use in this
Shoreland Ordinance, the uses allowed within each district
have been restricted to achieve compliance with the intent of
the Comprehensive Plan and state standards.

B. Additional Lot Area and Width Provisions. Residential
subdivisions with dwelling unit densities exceeding those in
the tables in Section IV.A. can be allowed only if designed
and approved as residential planned unit developments under
Section VII. of this Ordinance. Only land above the ordinary
high water level of public waters can be used to meet lot area
standards, and lot width standards shall be met at both the
ordinary high water level and at the building line. The lot
area dimensions for sewered lakes in Section IV.A.2. can be
used only if publicly owned sewer system service is available
to the property.
1. Lots intended as controlled accesses to pUblic waters or
as recreation areas for use by owners of nonriparian lots
within subdivisions are permissible and shall meet or
exceed the following standards:
a. They shall meet the width and size requirements for
residential lots, and be suitable for the intended
uses of controlled access lots.
b. If docking, mooring, or over-water storage of more
than six (6) watercraft is to be allowed at a
controlled access lot, then the width of the lot
(keeping the same lot depth) shall be increased by
18

c. They shall be jointly owned by all purchasers of
lots in the subdivision or by all purchasers of
nonriparian lots in the subdivision who are
provided riparian access rights on the access lot.
d. Covenants or other equally effective legal
instruments shall be developed that specify which
lot owners have authority to use the access lot and
what activities are allowed. The activities may
include watercraft launching, loading, storage,
beaching, mooring, or docking. They shall also
include other outdoor recreational activities that
do not significantly conflict with general public
use of the pUblic water or the enjoyment of normal
property rights by adjacent property owners.
Examples of the nonsignificant conflict activities
include swimming, sunbathing, or picnicking. The
covenants shall limit the total number of vehicles
allowed to be parked and the total number of
watercraft allowed to be continuously moored,
docked, or stored over water, and shall require
centralization of all common facilities and
activities in the most suitable locations on the
lot to minimize topographic and vegetation
alterations. They shall also require all parking
areas, storage buildings, and other facilities to
be screened by vegetation or topography as much as
practical from view from the pUblic water, assuming
summer, leaf-on conditions.
C. Placement. Design. and Height of structures. When more than
one setback applies to a site, structures and facilities shall
be located to meet all setbacks. Where structures exist on
the adjoining lots on both sides of a proposed building site,
structure setbacks may be altered without a variance to
conform to the adjoining setbacks from the ordinary high water
level, provided the proposed building site is not located in
a shore impact zone or in a bluff impact zone. structures

Bluff Impact Zones. Structures and accessory facilities,
except stairways and landings, shall not be placed within
bluff impact zones.
4. Uses without Water-Oriented Needs. Uses without wateroriented
needs shall be located on lots or parcels
without pUblic waters frontage, or, if located on lots or
parcels with pUblic waters frontage, shall either be set
back double the normal ordinary high water level setback
or be substantially screened from view from the water by
vegetation or topography, assuming summer, leaf-on
conditions.
5. Design criteria for Structures. The following design
criteria shall apply to structures within all shoreland
areas:
20
a. High Water Elevations. structures shall be placed
in accordance with any floodplain regUlations
applicable to the site. Where these controls do
not exist, the elevation to which the lowest floor,
including basement, is placed or flood-proofed
shall be determined as follows:
-For lakes, by placing the lowest floor at a
level at least three feet above the highest
known water level, or three feet above the
ordinary high water level, whichever is
higher.
-Water-oriented accessory structures may have
the lowest floor placed lower than the
elevation determined in this item if the
structure is constructed of flood-resistant
materials to the elevation, electrical and
mechanical equipment is placed above the
elevation and, if long duration flooding is
anticipated, the structure is built to
withstand ice action and wind-driven waves and
debris.
b. Water-oriented Accessory structures. Each lot may
have one water-oriented accessory structure not
meeting the normal structure setback in section
IV. C. 1. of this Ordinance if this water-oriented
accessory structure complies with the following
provisions:
-The structure or facility shall not exceed
ten feet in height, exclusive of safety rails,
and cannot occupy an area greater than 250
square feet. Detached decks shall not exceed
eight feet above grade at any point.
-The setback of the structure or facility from
the ordinary high water level shall be at
least ten feet.
-The structure or facility shall be treated to
reduce visibility as viewed from public waters
and adjacent shorelands by vegetation,
topography, increased setbacks or color,
assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
-The roof may be used as a deck with safety
rails, but shall not be enclosed or used as a
storage area.
21
-The structure or facility shall not be
designed or used for human habitation and
shall not contain water supply or sewage
treatment facilities.
-As an alternative for general development
water-bodies, water-oriented accessory
structures used solely for watercraft storage,
and including storage of related boating and
water-oriented sporting equipment, may occupy
an area up to 400 square feet provided the
maximum width of the structure is 20 feet as
measured parallel to the configuration of the
shoreline.
c. Stairways, Lifts, and Landings. Stai"Nays and
lifts· are the preferred alternative to maJor
topographic alterations for achieving access up and
down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas.
Stairways and lifts shall meet the following design
requirements:
-Stairways and lifts shall not exceed four
feet in width on residential lots. Wider
stairways may be used for commercial
properties, public open-space recreational
properties, and planned unit develor~ents.
-Landings for stairways and lifts on
residential lots shall not exceed 32 square
feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square
feet may be used for commercial properties,
pUblic open-space recreational properties, and
planned unit developments.
-canopies or roofs are not allowed on
stairways, lifts, or landings.
-Stairways, lifts, and landings may De either
constructed above the ground on posts or
pilings, or placed into the ground, provided
they are designed and built in a manner that
ensures control of soil erosion.
-stairways, lifts, and landings shall be
located in the most visually inconspicuous
portions of lots, as viewed from the surface
of the pUblic water assuming summer, leaf-on
conditions, whenever practical.
22

-Facilities such as ramps, lifts, or mobility
paths for physically handicapped persons are
also allowed for achieving access to shore
areas, provided that the dimensional and
performance standard for these facilities are
complied with in addition to the requirements
of Minnesota Regulations, Chapter 1340.
d. Significant Historic sites. No structure may be
placed on a significant historic site in a manner
that affects the value of the site unless adequate
information about the site has been removed and
documented in a pUblic repository.
e. Steep Slopes. The Zoning Administrator shall
evaluate possible soil erosion impacts and
development visibility from public waters before
issuing a permit for construction of sewage
treatment systems, roads, driveways, structures, or
other improvements on steep slopes. When
determined necessary, conditions shall be attached
to issued permits to prevent erosion and to
preserve existing vegetation screening of
structures, vehicles, and other facilities as
viewed from the surface of pUblic waters, assuming
summer, leaf-on conditions.
Height of Structures. All structures in residential
districts, except churches and nonresidential
agricultural structures, shall not exceed 25 feet in
height.
D. Shoreland Alterations. Alterations of vegetation and
topography will be regulated to prevent erosion into pUblic
waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve
historic values, prevent bank slumping, and protect fish and
wildlife habitat.
1. Vegetation Alterations. The following provisions apply
to the alteration of vegetation in shoreland areas:
a. Vegetation alteration necessary for the
construction of structures and sewage treatment
systems and the construction of roads and parking
areas regulated by Section IV.E. of this Ordinance
are exempt from the vegetation alteration standards
that follow.
b. Removal or alteration of vegetation, except for
agricUltural uses as regUlated in section IV.G., is
allowed sUbject to the following standards:
23
-Intensive vegetation clearing within the
shore and bluff impact zones and on steep
slopes is not allowed. Intensive vegetation
clearing for forest land conversion to another
use outside of these areas is allowable as a
conditional use if an erosion control and
sedimentation plan is developed and approved
by the soil and water conservation district in
which the property is located.
-In shore and bluff impact zones and on steep
slopes, limited clearing of trees and shrubs
and cutting, pruning, and trimming of trees is
allowed to provide a view to the water from
the principal dwelling site and to accommodate
the placement of stairways and landings,
picnic areas, access paths, livestock watering
areas, beach and watercraft access areas, and
permitted water-oriented accessory structures
or facili:ies, provided that the screening of
structures, vehicles, or other facilities as
viewed from the water, assuming summer,leaf-on
conditions, is not substantially reduced.
c. The above provisions are not applicable to the
removal of trees, limbs, or branches that are dead,
diseased, or pose safety hazards.
2. Topographic Alterations/Grading and Filling. The
following provisions apply to topographic
alterations/grading and filling in shoreland areas:
a. Grading and filling and excavations necessary for
the construction of structures, sewage treatment
systems, and driveways under validly issued
construction permits for these facilities do not
require the issuance of a separate grading and
filling permit. However, the grading and filling
standards in this section shall be incorporated
into the issuance of permits for construction of
structures, sewage, treatment systems, and
driveways.
b. PUblic roads and parking ,areas are regulated by
Section IV.E. of this Ordinance.
c. Notwithstanding items a. and b. above, a grading
and filling permit will be required for:
-The movement of more than ten cubic yards of
material on steep slopes or within shore or
bluff impact zones.
24
-The movement of more than 50 cubic yards of
material outside of steep slopes and shore and
bluff impact zones.
d. The following considerations and conditions shall
be adhered to during the issuance of construction
permits, grading and filling permits, conditional
use permits, variances, and subdivision approvals:
-Grading or filling in any type 2,3,4,5,6,7,
or 8 wetland shall be evaluated to determine
how extensively the proposed activity would
affect the following functional qualities of
the wetland.
Sediment and pollutant trapping and
retention.
Storage of surface runoff to prevent or
reduce flood damage.
Fish and wildlife habitat.
Recreational use.
Shoreline or bank stabilization.
Noteworthiness, including special
qualities such as historic significance,
critical habitat for endangered plants
and animals, or others.
-This evaluation shall also include a
determination of whether the wetland
alteration being proposed requires permits,
reviews, or approvals by other local, state,
or federal agencies such as a watershed
district, the Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources, or the United States Army Corps of
Engineers. The applicant will be so advised.
-Alterations shall be designed and conducted
in a manner that ensures only the smallest
amount of bare ground is exposed for the
shortest time possible.
-Mulches or similar materials shall be used,
where necessary, for temporary bare soil
coverage, and a permanent vegetation cover
shall be established as soon as possible.
-Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap
25
sediments before they reach any surface water
feature shall be used.
-Altered areas shall be stabilized to
acceptable erosion control standards
consistent with the field office technical
guides of the local soil and water
conservation districts and the United states
soil Conservation service.
-Fill

or excavated material shall not be
in a manner that creates an unstable
-Plans to place fill or excavated material on
steep slopes shall be reviewed by qualified
profe"sionills for continued slope stability
and shall not create finished slopes of 30
percent or greater.
-Fill or excavated material shall not be
placed in bluff impact zones.
-Any alterations below the ordinary high water
level of pUblic waters shall first be
authorized by the Commissioner under Minnesota
statutes, section 103.G.245..
-Alterations of topography shall only be
allowed if they are accessory to'permitted or
conditional uses and do not adversely affect
adjacent or nearby properties.
-Placement of natural rock riprap, inclUding
associated grading of the shoreline and
placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if
the finished slope does not exceed three feet
horizontal to one foot vertical, the landward
extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the
ordinary high water level, and the height of
the riprap above the ordinary high water level
does not exceed three feet.
e. Connections to public water. Excavations where the
intended purpose is connection to a public water,
such as boat slips, canals, lagoons, and harbors,
shall be controlled by local shoreland controls.
Permission for excavations may be given only after
the Commissioner has approved the proposed
connection to public waters.
26
E. Design and Placement of Roads. Driveways. and Parking Areas.
The following provisions apply to the design and placement of
roads, driveways, and parking areas in shoreland areas:
1. Design. Public and private roads and parking areas shall
be designed to take advantage of natural vegetation and
topography to achieve maximum screening from view from
pUblic waters. Documentation that all roads and parking
areas are designed and constructed to minimize and
control erosion to pUblic waters consistent with the
field office technical guides of the local soil and water
conservation district, or other applicable technical
materials, shall be provided by a qualified individual.
2. Placement. Roads, driveways, and parking areas shall
meet structure setbacks and shall not be placed within
bluff and shore impact zones, when other reasonable and
feasible placement alternatives exist. If no
alternatives exist, they may be placed within these
areas, and shall be designed to minimize adverse impacts.
Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach
roads, and access-related parking areas may be placed
within shore impact zones provided the vegetative
screening and erosion control conditions of this sUbpart
are met. For private facilities, the grading and filling
provisions of sections IV.D. of this Ordinance shall be
met.
F. Stormwater Management.
provisions apply to the
shoreland areas:
1. General Standards.
The following general and specific
management of storrnwater runoff in
a. When possible, existing natural drainageways,
wetlands, and vegetated soil surfaces shall be used
to convey, store, filter, and retain stormwater
runoff before discharge to pUblic waters.
b. Development shall be planned and conducted in a
manner that will minimize the extent of disturbed
areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential; and
reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas
shall be stabilized and protected as soon as
possible and facilities or methods used to retain
sediment on the site.
c. When development density, topographic features, and
soil and vegetation conditions are not sufficient
to adequately handle stormwater runoff using
natural features and vegetation, various types of
constructed facilities such as diversions, settling
27
basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways, and
ponds may be used. Preference shall be given to
designs using surface drainage, vegetation, and
infiltration rather than buried pipes and manmade
materials and facilities.
2. Specific Standards.
a. Impervious surface coverage of lots shall not
exceed 25 percent of the lot area.
b. When constructed facilities are used for stormwater
management, documentation shall be provided by a
qualified individual that they are designed and
installed consistent with the field office
technical guide of the local soil anr water
conservation districts.
c. Newly constructed stormwater outfalls to pUblic
waters shall provide for filtering or settling of
suspended solids and skimming of surface debris
before discharge.
G. Special Provisions for Commercial. Industrial, PUblic/SemiPublic
and Agricultural Uses. The following provisions apply
to the establishment and maintenance of commercial,
industrial, pUblic/semi-public, and agricultural uses in
shoreland areas:
1. Standards for commercial, Industrial, Public and SemiPublic
Uses. Surface water-oriented commercial uses and
industrial, pUblic, or semi-public uses with similar
needs to have access to and use of pUblic waters may be
located on parcels or lots with frontage on public
waters. Those uses with water-oriented needs shall meet
the following standards:
a. In addition to meeting impervious coverage limits,
setbacks, and other zoning standards in this
Ordinance, the uses shall be designed to incorporate
topographic and vegetative screening of
parking areas and structures.
b. Uses that require short-term watercraft mooring for
patrons shall centralize these facilities and
design them to avoid obstructions of navigation and
to be the minimum size necessary to meet the need.
c. Uses that depend on patrons arriving by watercraft
may use signs and lighting to convey needed
information to the pUblic, SUbject to the sign
28
regulations included as part of the Willmar Zoning
ordinance.
Uses without water-oriented need shall be located on lots
or parcelS without pUblic waters frontage, or, if located
on lots or parcels with public waters frontage, shall
either be set back double the normal ordinary high water
level setback or be sUbstantially screened from view from
the water by vegetation or topography, assuming summer,
leaf-on conditions.
2. Standards for Agricultural Uses. General cultivation
farming, grazing, nurseries, horticulture, truck farming,
sod farming, and wild crop harvesting are permitted uses
if steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones are
maintained in permanent vegetation or operated under an
approved conservation plan (Resource Management Systems)
consistent with the field office technical guide of the
local soil and water conservation district or the United
States Soil Conservation Service, as provided by a
qualified individual or agency. The shore impact zone
for parcels with permitted agricultural land uses is
equal to a line parallel to and 50 feet from the ordinary
high water level.
1. Water Supply. Any public or private supply of water for
domestic purposes shall meet or exceed standards for
water quality of the Minnesota Department of Health and
the Minnesota Pollution control Agency.

SECTION V: NONCONFORMITIES
A. General. All legally established nonconformities as of the
date of this Ordinance may continue, but they will be managed
according to applicable state statutes and Willmar Zoning
Ordinance provisions for the sUbjects of alterations and
additions, repair after damage, discontinuance of use, and
intensification of use; except that the following standards
will also apply in shoreland areas:
1. Nonconforming Lots of Record.
a. Lots of record in the office of the county recorder
on the date of enactment of this Ordinance that do
not meet the requirements of section IV.A. may be
allowed as building sites without variances from
lot size requirements provided the use is permitted
in the zoning district, the lot has been in
separate ownership from abutting lands at all times
since it became substandard, was created compliant
with official controls in effect at the time, and
sewage treatment and setback requirements of this
Ordinance are met.
b. A variance from setback requirements shall be
obtained before any use, sewage treatment system,
or building permit is issued for a lot. In
evaluating the variance, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall consider sewage treatment and water
supply capabilities or constraints of the lot and
shall deny the variance if adequate facilities
cannot be provided.
c. If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under
the same ownership, any individual lot does not
meet the requirements of section IV. A. of this
ordinance, the lot shall not be considered as a
separate parcel of land for the purposes of sale or
development. The lot shall be combined with the
one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or
more parcels of land, each meeting the requirements
of section IV.A. of this Ordinance as much as
possible.
2. Additions to/Expansions of Nonconforming Structures.
a. A nonconforming structure may be added to or
expanded sUbject to the provisions of the Willmar
Zoning Ordinance for enlargement of, or additions
to, nonconforming structures.
31
b. Deck additions may be allowed without a variance to
a structure not meeting the required setback from
the ordinary high water level if all the following
criteria and standards are met:
-The structure existed on the date the
structure setbacks were established.
-A thorough evaluation of the property and
structure reveals no reasonable location for a
deck meeting or exceeding the existing
ordinary high water level setback of the
structure.
-The deck encroachment toward the ordinary
high water level does not exceed 15 percent of
the existing setback of the structure from the
- ordinary-high water level or does not encroach
closer than 30 feet, whichever is more
restrictive.

is not roofed or screened.
3. Nonconforming Sewage Treatment systems.
a. A sewage treatment system not meeting the
requirements of section IV. H. of this Ordinance
shall be upgraded, at a minimum, at any time a
permit or variance of any type is required for any
improvement on, or use of, the property. For the
purposes of this provision, a sewage treatment
system shall not be considered nonconforming if the
only deficiency is the sewage treatment system's
improper setback from the ordinary high water
level.
b. The city council of the city of Willmar has by
formal resolution notified the Commissioner of its
programs to identify nonconforming sewage treatment
systems by a combination of review of existing
records and systematic on-site inspections.
Reconstruction, replacement, or other upgrading of
nonconforming systems shall be required when
appropriate or practicable, and shall be
accomplished within a reasonable period of time
which shall not exceed two years.
c. Sewage systems installed

)
may be considered as conforming unless they are
determined to be failing, except that systems using
cesspools, leaching pits, seepage pits, or other
deep disposal met~ods, or systems with less soil
treatment area separation above groundwater than
required by the Minnesota Pollution Control
Agency's Chapter 7080 for design of on-site sewage
treatment systems, shall be considered
nonconforming.

SECTION VII: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Types of PUD's Allowed. Planned unit developments (PUD's) are
allowed for new projects on undeveloped land, redevelopment of
previously built sites, or conversions of existing buildings
and land. The land use districts in which they are an
allowable use are identified in the land use district
description in section 111.0. of this Ordinance and on the
official zoning map.
B. Conditional/Permitted Use status. Any planned unit
development shall be processed as a conditional use, except
that an expansion to an existing commercial PUD involving six
or less new dwelling units or sites since the date this
Ordinance was adopted is permissible as a permitted use
provided the total project density does not exceed the
9, l).o",abJ,e deI}~H.j,e~ _ciO\lc.!:1.:L.a_~ed_ ill . tl:J..~.p'rClj ect... density

Willmar Planning Commission that is necessary to explain
the design and function of the PUD.
D. site "suitable Area" Evaluation. Proposed new, or expansions
to existing, planned unit developments shall be evaluated
using the following procedures and standards to determine the
suitable area for the dwelling unit/dwelling site density
evaluation in section VII.E.
1. The project parcel shall be divided into tiers by
locating one or more lines approximately parallel to a
line that identifies the ordinary high water level at the
following intervals, proceeding landward:
Shoreland Tier Dimensions
General development lakesfirst

2. The suitable area within each tier is calculated by
excluding from the tier area all wetlands, bluffs, or
land below the ordinary high water level of public
waters. This suitable area and the proposed project are
then SUbjected to either the residential or commercial
planned unit development density evaluation steps to
arrive at an allowable number of dwelling units or sites.
E. Residential and Commercial PUD Density Evaluation. The
procedures for determining the "base" density of a PUD and
density increase mUltipliers are as follows. Allowable
densities may be transferred from any tier further from the
waterbody, but shall not be transferred to any other tier
closer.
1. Residential PUD "Base" Density Evaluation.
a. The suitable area within each tier is divided by
the single residential lot size standard for lakes.
Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or
sites for the residential planned unit developments
are then compared with the tier, density, and
suitability analyses herein and the design criteria
in Section VII.F.
37
2. Commercial PUD "Base" Density Evaluation.
a. Determine the average inside living area size of
dwelling units or sites withi~ each tier, including
both existing and proposed units and sites.
computation of inside living area sizes need not
include decks, patios, stoops, steps, garages, or
porches and basements, .unless they are habitable
space.

*For average unit floor areas less than shown, use the floor
area ratios listed for 200 square feet. For areas greater
than shown, use the ratios listed for 1,500 feet. For
recreational camping areas, use the ratios listed at 400
square feet.
c. Multiply the suitable area within each tier by the
floor area ratio to yield total floor area for each
tier allowed to be used for dwelling units or
sites.
38
d. Divide the total floor area by tier computed in
Item c. above by the average inside living area
size determined in Item a. above. This yields a
base number of dwelling units and sites for each
tier.
e. proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or
sites for the commercial planned unit development
are then compared with the tier, density, and
suitability analyses herein and the design criteria
in section VII.F.
F. Density Increase Multipliers.
1. Increases to the dwelling unit or dwelling site base
densities previously determined are allowable if the
dimensional standards in Section IV. are met or exceeded
and the design criteria in section VII.F. are satisfied.
The allowable density increases in Item 2. below will
only be allowed if structure setbacks from the ordinary
high water level are increased to at least 50 percent
greater than the minimum setback, or the impact on the
waterbody is reduced an equivalent amount through
vegetative management, topography, or additional means
acceptable to the local unit of government and the
setback is at least 25 percent greater than the minimum
setback.

facilities for use by owners of dwelling units or
sites, by guests staying in commercial dwelling
units or sites, and by the general pUblic.
e. Open space may include sUbsurface sewage treatment
systems if the use of the space is restricted to
avoid adverse impacts on the systems.
f. Open space shall not include commercial facilities
or uses, but may contain water-oriented accessory
structures or facilities.
g. The appearance of open space areas, including
topography, vegetation, and allowable uses, shall

erosion impacts on surface water features. Erosion
control plans approved by a soil and water
41
conservation district may be required if project
size and site physical characteristics warrant.
b. Be designed and constructed to effectively manage
reasonably expected quantities and qualities of
stormwater runoff. Impervious surface coverage
within any tier shall not exceed 25 percent of the
tier area, except that for commercial PUD's 35
percent impervious surface coverage may be allowed
in the first tier of general development lakes with
an approved stormwater management plan and
consistency with section IV.D.
4. centralization and Design of Facilities.
and design of facilities and structures
according to the following standards:
centralization
shall be done
a. Planned unit developments shall be connected to
publicly owned water supply and sewer systems, if
available. On-site water supply and sewage
treatment systems shall be centralized and designed
and installed to meet or exceed applicable
standards or rules of the Minnesota Department of
Health and sections IV.C. and IV.H. of this
Ordinance. On-site sewage treatment systems shall
be located on the most suitable areas of the
development, and sufficient lawn area free of
limiting factors shall be provided for a
replacement soil treatment system for each sewage
system.
b. Dwelling units or sites shall be clustered into one
of more groups and located on suitable areas of the

the surface water features, and maximum height.
Setbacks from the ordinary high water level shall
be increased in accordance with Section VII.E. of
this Ordinance for developments with density
increases.
c. Shore recreation facilities, including but not
limited to swimming areas, docks, and watercraft
mooring areas and launching ramps, shall be
centralized and located in areas suitable for them.
Evaluation of suitability shall include
consideration of land slope, water depth,
vegetation, soils, depth to groundwater and
bedrock, or other relevant factors. The number of
spaces provided for continuous beaching, mooring,
42
or docking of watercraft shall not exceed one for
each allowable dwelling unit or site in the first
tier (notwithstanding existing mooring sites in an
existing commerci<llly used harbor). Launching ramp
facilities, including a small dock for loading and
unloading equipment, may be provided for use by
occupants of dwelling units or sites located in
other tiers.
d. structures, parking areas, and other facilities
sh<lll be treated to reduce visibility as viewed
from pUblic waters and adjacent shorelands by
vegetation, topogr<lphy, increased setb<lcks, color,
or other means acceptable to the local unit of
government, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions.
Vegetative and topographic screening shall be
preserved, if existing, or may be required to be
provided.
e. Accessory structures and facilities, except wateroriented
accessory structures, shall meet the
required principal structure setback and shall be
centralized.
f. Water-oriented accessory structures and facilities
may be allowed if they meet or exceed design
standards contained ~n section IV.C. of this
Ordinance and are centralized.
H. Conversions. The City may allow existing land uses and
facilities to be converted to a residential planned unit
development provided all of the following standards are
met.
1. Proposed conversions shall be initially evaluated
using the same procedures for residential planned
unit developments involving all new construction.
Inconsistencies between existing features of the
development and these standards shall be
identified.
2. Deficiencies involving water supp~y and sewage
treatment, structure color, imperv~ous coverage,
open space, and shore recreation facilities shall
be corrected as part of the conversion or as
specified in the conditional use permit.
3. Shore and bluff impact zone deficiencies shall be
evaluated and reasonable improvements made as part
of the conversion. These improvements shall
inclUde, where applicable, the following:
43
a. Removal of extraneous buildings, docks, or
other facilities, that no longer need to be
located in shore or bluff impact zones.
b. Remedial measures to correct erosion sites and
improve veljetative cover and. screening of
buildings and other facilities as viewed from
the water.
c. If existing dwelling units are located in
shore or bluff impact zones, conditions are
attached to approvals of conversions that
preclude exterior expansions in any dimension
or substantial alterations. The conditions
shall also provide for future relocation of
dwelling units, where feasible, to other
locations, meeting all setback and elevation
requirements when they are rebuilt or
replaced.
4. Existing dwelling unit or dwelling site densities
that exceed the standards in Section VII.E. may be
allowed to continue but shall not be allowed to be
increased, either at the time of conversion or in
the future. Efforts shall be made during the
conversion to limit impacts of high densities by
requiring seasonal use, improving vegetative
screening, centralizing shore recreation facilities,
installing new sewage treatment systems, or
other means.

AN ORDINANCE AMENDING ORDINANCE NO. 1060
KNOWN AS THE WILLMAR ZONING ORDINANCE BY
AMENDING SECTION 3. Q. RELATING TO
ADULT ORIENTED BUSINESSES
The City Council of City of Willmar does ordain as follows:
SECTION 3. Ordinance No. 1060 is hereby amended by deleting the existing text and adding
new text to SECTION 3 Q so as to read as follows:
Q. Adult Oriented Businesses
1. PURPOSE. In order to protect the City's community image, property values, public
health, safety, welfare, and business environment, the City has found it necessary, in light
ofthe harmful and unwanted secondary effects that certain businesses generate, to restrict
where such businesses may locate within the City and to regulate those businesses. Only
those businesses with secondary effects on neighboring properties and on the City are
intended to be regulated. This section is not intended to restrict art.
It is the purpose of this Ordinance to regulate Adult Oriented Businesses to promote the
health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City and to establish
reasonable and uniform regulations to:
a. Prevent additional criminal activity within the City;
b. Prevent deterioration of neighborhoods and its consequent adverse effect on real
estate values of properties within the neighborhood;
c. To locate Adult Oriented Business away from residential areas, schools, churches,
parks and playgrounds;
d. Prevent concentration of Adult Oriented Businesses within certain areas of the
City.
2. FINDINGS OF THE CITY COUNCIL.
The City Council of the City of Willmar makes the following findings regarding the need
to license adult oriented businesses. The findings are based upon the experiences of other
cities where such businesses have located, as studied by City staff.
a. Adult oriented businesses can exert a dehumanizing influence on persons
attending places of worship, children attending state licensed family daycare
homes, state licensed group family day care homes, and state licensed child care
centers; students attending school; and people using public parks and libraries.
1
b. Adult oriented businesses can be used as fronts for prostitution and other criminal
activity. The experience of other cities indicates that the proper management and
operation of such businesses can, however, minimize this risk, provided the
owners and operators of such facilities are regulated by licensing or other
procedures.
c. Adult oriented businesses can significantly contribute to the deterioration of
residential neighborhoods and can impair the character and quality of the
residential housing in the area in which such businesses are located, thereby
exacerbating the shortage of affordable and habitable housing for City residents;
d. The concentration of sexually-oriented businesses in one area can have a
substantial1y detrimental effect on the area in which such businesses are
concentrated and on the overall quality of life in the community. A cycle of
decay can result from the influx and concentration of adult oriented businesses.
The presence of such businesses is often perceived by others as an indication that
the community or area is deteriorating and the result can be devastating to other
businesses that may be required to move out of the vicinity and which could
influence residents to relocate from the area. It has been noted that the presence
of such businesses can have the overall effect of causing declining real estate
values, which result can be exacerbated by the concentration of such business,
which can erode the City's tax base and contribute to overall community blight.
e. Adult oriented businesses can increase the risk of exposure to communicable
diseases including but not limited to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS) for which currently there is no cure. The experiences of other cities
indicate that such businesses can facilitate a spread of communicable diseases by
virtue of the design of the premises, thereby endangering not only the patrons of
such establishments but also the general public.
f. Adult oriented businesses can cause or contribute to public health problems by the
presence of live adult entertainment in conjunction with food and/or drink on the
same premIses.
g. Sexually-oriented businesses can contribute to an increase in criminal activity in
the area in which such businesses are located, taxing city crime-prevention
programs and law enforcement services.
h. Sexually-oriented businesses can cause or contribute to public health problems by
the presence of live adult entertainment in conjunction with food and/or drink on
the same premises.
I. The risk of criminal activity and/or public health problems can be minimized
through a licensing and regulatory scheme as prescribed herein.
