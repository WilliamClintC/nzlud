balanced budgetary appropriations, matching expected revenues with
expenditures, are submitted to Town Meeting the following procedures
will be followed: During the first week of November prior to the Annual
Town Meeting, the Town Manager and the Finance Director will
communicate budgetary guidelines from the Board of Selectmen to all
Town departments; preliminary budget requests are to be returned to
the Town Manager and Finance Director by the first week in December;
during December and January, all budget requests will be analyzed
with requesting departments; and by the first Selectmen's meeting
in February, a balanced summary of budgetary appropriations will be
presented for preliminary approval. Departments and warrant articles
not following this process will receive estimated funding to maintain a
balanced budget presentation.
C.
The Selectmen shall call a Special Town Meeting to be held not later
than 45 days after receipt of a request for same in writing by 200
registered voters. They shall insert in the warrant all subjects
requested of them by the petition and all other subjects requested in
writing by 100 registered voters, any time prior to the closing of the
warrant.
D.
The Selectmen shall insert in the warrant for the Annual Meeting and

other authorities and examples of parliamentary procedure, including

GENERAL REFERENCES
Historic districts  See Ch. 145. Zoning  See Ch. 275.
§ 88-1. Purpose.
This bylaw is proposed for the purpose of preserving and protecting
significant buildings within the Town of Foxborough and to encourage
owners of such buildings to seek out persons who might be willing to
preserve, rehabilitate or restore such buildings rather than demolish them.
To achieve these purposes, the Foxborough Historical Commission (the
"Commission") is empowered to advise the Building Commissioner with
respect to the issuance of permits for the demolition of significant buildings.
The issuance of demolition permits for significant buildings is regulated as
provided in this bylaw.
§ 88-2. Definitions.
As used in this bylaw, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
BUILDING  Any combination of materials forming a shelter for persons,
animals, or property.
COMMISSION  The Foxborough Historical Commission.
DEMOLITION  Any act of pulling down, destroying, removing or razing
a building or any portion thereof, or commencing the work of total or
substantial destruction with the intent of completion.
DEMOLITION PERMIT  The permit issued by the Building Commissioner
as required by the State Building Code for the demolition or removal of
a building or structure. This permit must also indicate the location of the
facility at which the debris is to be disposed, in accordance with MGL c. 40,
§ 54, as amended in 1987.
PREFERABLY PRESERVED SIGNIFICANT BUILDING  Any significant

of the granting of such permit, a demolition permit will be issued by the
Building Commissioner. If the Commission issues a recommendation in
opposition to the granting of such a permit for demolition, no permit
shall be issued until a more thorough investigation and a public hearing
is undertaken and a final recommendation is provided by the

building would be detrimental to the historical or architectural heritage
or resources of the Town, such building shall be considered a
"preferably preserved significant building."

have been unsuccessful; or
(2)
Six months have passed since a determination under Subsection F

shall file with the Commission an application for a certificate of
appropriateness, of nonapplicability or of hardship, as the case may
be. The application shall be accompanied by such plans, elevations,
specifications, material and other information, including in the case
of demolition or removal a statement of the proposed condition and
A.
§ 145-6 FOXBOROUGH CODE § 145-8
1:86
appearance of the property thereafter, as may be reasonably deemed
necessary by the Commission to enable it to make a determination on
the application.
The Commission shall determine within 14 days of the filing of an
application for a certificate whether said application involves any
exterior architectural features which are within the jurisdiction of the
Commission.
B.
If the Commission determines that an application for a certificate does
not involve any exterior architectural features, or involves an exterior
architectural feature which is not subject to review by the Commission
under the provisions of this bylaw, the Commission shall forthwith issue
a certificate of nonapplicability.
C.
If the Commission determines that such application involves any
exterior architectural feature subject to review under this bylaw, it shall
hold a public hearing on the application, except as may otherwise be
provided in this bylaw. The Commission shall hold such a public hearing
within 45 days from the date of the filing of the application. At least
14 days before said public hearing, public notice shall be given by
posting in a conspicuous place in Town Hall and in a newspaper of
general circulation in Foxborough. Such notice shall identify the time,
place and purpose of the public hearing. Concurrently, a copy of said
public notice shall be mailed to the applicant, to the owners of all
adjoining properties and of other properties deemed by the Commission
to be materially affected thereby as they appear on the most recent
applicable tax list, to the Planning Board, to any person filing a written
request for notice of hearings, such request to be renewed yearly in
December, and to such other persons as the Commission shall deem
entitled to notice.
A public hearing on an application for a certificate need not be
held if such hearing is waived in writing by all persons entitled to
notice thereof. In addition, a public hearing on an application for
a certificate may be waived by the Commission if the Commission
determines that the exterior architectural feature involved, or its
category, is so insubstantial in its effect on the district that it may
be reviewed by the Commission without a public hearing. If the
Commission dispenses with a public hearing on an application for a
certificate, notice of such application shall be given to the owners
of all adjoining property and of other property deemed by the
Commission to be materially affected thereby as above provided,
and 10 days shall elapse after the mailing of such notice before the
Commission may act upon such application.
(1)
D.
Within 60 days after the filing of an application for a certificate, or
within such further time as the applicant may allow in writing, the
Commission shall issue a certificate or a disapproval. In the case of
a disapproval of an application for a certificate, the Commission shall
set forth in its disapproval the reasons for such disapproval. The
E.
§ 145-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 145-8
1:87
Commission may include in its disapproval specific recommendations
for changes in the applicant's proposal with respect to the
appropriateness of design, arrangement, texture, material and similar
features which, if made and filed with the Commission in a subsequent
application, would make the application acceptable to the Commission.
The concurring vote of a majority of the members present shall be
required to issue a certificate.
F.
In issuing certificates, the Commission may, as it deems appropriate,
impose certain conditions and limitations, and may require
architectural or plan modifications consistent with the intent and
purpose of this bylaw.
G.
If the Commission determines that the construction or alteration for
which an application for a certificate of appropriateness has been
filed will be appropriate for or compatible with the preservation or
protection of the district, the Commission shall issue a certificate of
appropriateness.
H.
If the construction or alteration for which an application for a
certificate of appropriateness has been filed shall be determined to
be inappropriate and therefore disapproved, or in the event of an
application for a certificate of hardship, the Commission shall
determine whether, owing to conditions especially affecting the
building or structure involved, but not affecting the district generally,
failure to approve an application will involve a substantial hardship,
financial or otherwise, to the applicant and whether such application
may be approved without substantial detriment to the public welfare
and without substantial derogation from the intent and purposes of
this bylaw. If the Commission determines that owing to such conditions
failure to approve an application will involve substantial hardship to the
applicant and approval thereof may be made without such substantial
detriment or derogation, the Commission shall issue a certificate of
hardship.
I.
The Commission shall send a copy of its certificates and disapproval to
the applicant and shall file a copy of its certificates and disapproval with
the office of the Town Clerk and the Building Commissioner. The date
of issuance of a certificate or disapproval shall be the date of the filing
of a copy of such certificate or disapproval with the office of the Town
Clerk.
J.
If the Commission should fail to issue a certificate or a disapproval
within 60 days of the filing of the application for a certificate, or within
such further time as the applicant may allow in writing, the Commission
shall thereupon issue a certificate of hardship due to failure to act.
K.
Each certificate issued by the Commission shall be dated and signed
by its Chairman or such other person designated by the Commission to
sign such certificates on its behalf.
L.

§ 145-9. Criteria for determinations.
§ 145-10. Exclusions.
A person aggrieved by a determination of the Commission may, within
20 days of the issuance of a certificate or disapproval, file a written
request with the Commission for a review by a person or persons of
competence and experience in such matters, acting as arbitrator and
designated by the regional planning agency. The finding of the person
or persons making such review shall be filed with the Town Clerk within
45 days after the request, and shall be binding on the applicant and the
Commission, unless a further appeal is sought in the Superior Court as
provided in MGL c. 40C, § 12A. The filing of such further appeal shall
occur within 20 days after the finding of the arbitrator has been filed
with the office of the Town Clerk.
M.
In deliberating on applications for certificates and other matters before
it, the Commission shall consider, among other things, the historic and
architectural value and significance of the site, building or structure;
the general design, proportions, detailing, mass, arrangement, texture,
and material of the exterior architectural features involved; and the
relation of such exterior architectural features to similar features of
buildings and structures in the surrounding area.
A.
In the case of new construction or additions to existing buildings or
structures, the Commission shall consider the appropriateness of the
scale, shape and proportions of the building or structure both in
relation to the land area upon which the building or structure is
situated and in relation to buildings and structures in the vicinity. The
Commission may in appropriate cases impose dimensional and setback
requirements in addition to those required by applicable statute or
bylaw.
B.
When ruling on applications for certificates on solar energy systems as
defined in MGL c. 40A, § 1A, the Commission shall consider the policy
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to encourage the use of solar
energy systems and to protect solar access.
C.
The Commission shall not consider interior arrangements or
architectural features not subject to public view from a public way.
D.
The Commission shall not make any recommendations or requirements
except for the purpose of preventing developments incongruous to the
historic aspects or the architectural characteristics of the surroundings
and of the district.
E.
The Commission shall exclude from its purview the following:
Temporary buildings, structures or signs; subject, however, to
conditions pertaining to the duration of existence and use, location,

The reconstruction, substantially similar in exterior design, of a
building, structure or exterior architectural feature damaged or
destroyed by fire, storm or other disaster, provided such
reconstruction is begun within one year thereafter and carried
forward with due diligence.
(7)
Upon request, the Commission shall issue a certificate of
nonapplicability with respect to construction or alteration in any
category not subject to review by the Commission in accordance with
the above provisions.
B.
Nothing in this bylaw shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance, repair or replacement of any exterior architectural
feature within a district which does not involve a change in design,
material or the outward appearance thereof, nor to prevent landscaping
with plants, trees or shrubs, nor construed to prevent the meeting
of requirements certified by a duly authorized public officer to be

This sign bylaw ("bylaw") is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by
General Laws Chapter 93, Section 29, and the Town of Foxborough's Home
Rule authority. The purpose of this bylaw is to protect the public, health,
safety and welfare by establishing reasonable and objective regulations for
all signs and other advertising devices within the Town of Foxborough on
public ways or on private property partially or entirely within public view of
a public way or public park and to create a regular and impartial process
by which signs will be reviewed and permitted. This bylaw is intended to
regulate, restrict, or place limitations on signage to assure that all signs
will be appropriate to the neighborhoods and districts, land, buildings,
or uses to which they are appurtenant; stabilize and reinforce property
values to protect public and private investment; serve the public's need
to be given helpful directions and to be informed of available products,
businesses, and services; protect against traffic and safety hazards and
nuisances to abutters; avoid visual clutter; and preserve and enhance the
natural, historic, and architectural aesthetics of the Town of Foxborough.

of insurance and other items specified in the application or reasonably
requested by the awarding authority. If the applicant does not intend
to perform the street opening work itself, it must in the application
designate a licensed contractor to perform the work as its agent. The
application shall also be accompanied by the application fee and the
refundable deposit.
A.
The Highway Department shall promptly review the application and
make written recommendations concerning approval to the awarding
authority and, if appropriate, shall include recommendations
concerning permit conditions and supplemental instructions.
B.
§ 235-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 235-4
1:181
§ 235-5. Refundable deposit and account, warranty and surety.
The awarding authority shall make a prompt determination on the
application taking into account the following and such other facts as it
may reasonably consider:
(1) The recommendation of the Highway Department.
(2) The reason for the street opening work.
(3) Whether the street is recently constructed or repaved.
Whether there are other reasonable means adequate to accomplish
the purpose for which the street opening permit is sought.
(4)
C.
If the application is considered favorably, a street opening permit
containing such conditions and supplemental instructions as the
awarding authority reasonably deems appropriate shall promptly issue.
If the application is not favorably considered, the awarding authority
shall communicate in writing to applicant the reasons its application
was not favorably considered.
D.
The amount of the refundable deposit to secure proper restoration of a
public way after street opening work is determined in the reasonable
judgment of the awarding authority based on the extent of the work. (A
current schedule of deposits for standard work is attached.9)
A.
Following notice given by permit holder that final permanent repairs
to the public way have been completed, the awarding authority or
representative will make a final inspection. Once the awarding
authority or representative has concluded that permanent repair work
has been satisfactorily concluded and that applicant has no other
uncured defaults under street opening permits, it shall release the
unexpended balance of the deposit serving as security for the street
opening permit related to the inspected work.
B.
All refundable deposits that an applicant submits for street opening
permits shall be held by the awarding authority in one account which
shall be designated as the applicant's refundable deposit account.
Applicants, upon request, may receive periodic reports as to the
balance standing within this account. Should a deposit associated with
a specific permit be insufficient to secure the proper repair of a public
way following a default by the permit holder, the awarding authority,
without limitation to other remedies available to it, can deduct the cost
of the proper repair from applicant's refundable deposit account for
the purpose of funding the proper repairs. To the extent required by
MGL Chapter 164 applicable to gas companies, the provisions of this
section and § 235-6 hereafter shall not apply to gas companies which
affirmatively claim exemption in their application for street opening
permits.

§ 235-6. Fee and deposit changes; municipal exemption.
From time to time hereafter the awarding authority, after public notice
and hearing, may amend the schedule of deposits, the application fee, the
hourly after-hours inspection charges or any other amounts due under this
bylaw. A reasonable hourly charge for inspectional services which must be
performed outside of normal working hours in accordance with a posted
schedule established by the awarding authority will be billed to a permit
holder and due and payable 15 days after billing. In extraordinary situations
where extensive installation or renewal of utility lines overburdens the
normal capacity of the municipal departments to conduct inspections, the
awarding authority can, after notice to a permit holder, or as a condition of
the permit, elect to treat all inspections as after-hours inspections and bill
a permit holder accordingly. Applicants which are municipal departments
are exempt from payment of all fees and deposits hereunder. Public utilities,
to the extent exempted as provided in § 235-5 above, are exempt from
payment of all fees except the application fee.
§ 235-7. Emergency repair procedure.
§ 235-8. Insurance.
If the conditions for emergency repair work exist, then an applicant,
after giving oral, faxed or electronic notice to the Police and Highway
Departments, may commence street opening work. All such emergency
repair work shall be done in strict compliance with this bylaw except for
compliance with any notice provision inconsistent with such emergency
action.
A.
On the business day following the commencement of emergency repair
work, the applicant shall file with the awarding authority (i) a written
statement setting forth in detail the facts and circumstances
constituting the conditions for emergency repair work, (ii) an
application for a street opening permit covering the street opening
work already commenced in accordance with § 235-4, (iii) the filing fee
and required refundable deposit. If all of the materials such as plans,
etc. are not then available to applicant, applicant will supply them as
soon as available. The awarding authority will promptly process the
application and grant the street opening permit with such conditions
and supplemental instructions as it may reasonably require.

R.
§ 235-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 235-11
1:187
in effect. In addition, the following specific requirements also apply.
Exceptions to these requirements may be made in the discretion of the
awarding authority or awarding authority representative at the time that
the street opening work is in progress.
Excavation. Existing pavement shall be cut in neat, true lines along the
area of the proposed excavation. Unstable pavement shall be removed
over cave-outs and breaks and the subgrade treated as the main trench.
Pavement edges shall be trimmed to a vertical face and neatly aligned
with the center line of the trench. Cut-outs beyond the limits of the
trench lines must be normal or aligned parallel to the center line of the
trench. Excavations shall be made in open cut. Trenches and excavation
shall be braced and sheathed in accordance with the requirements of
the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA). Sections of bituminous
or cement concrete sidewalks shall be removed to the nearest scoreline
or approved cut edge.
A.
Backfilling and compaction.
Excavations shall be filled with approved backfill. Approved backfill
consists of either controlled density fill, suitable excavated material
or gravel meeting M 1.03.0 or M 1.03.1 of the Standard
Specifications. The permit holder may select which of these three
to use in the excavation. Suitable excavated material shall mean
previously excavated granular material but which does not include
blacktop, clay, silt, organic material, concrete, roots, boulders or
stones larger than four inches in diameter. If the hole is to be filled
with suitable excavated material, a backfill course shall be placed
in approximately twelve-inch lifts of maximum compaction to four
inches below asphalt grade (See Diagrams 1, 2, and 3). A base
course consisting of four inches of processed gravel or equivalent
(i.e., suitable excavated material containing no stones larger than
1 1/2 inches in diameter) shall then be placed on top of the backfill
course. The backfill and base course shall be compacted to not less
than 95% of maximum dry density as determined by the modified
Proctor Test in accordance with ASTM 1557 Method D. The permit
holder, if directed by the awarding authority or its representative,
will retain, at its expense, a professionally qualified geotechnical
consultant to perform this test. The results of this test shall be
given to the Highway Superintendent.
(1)
If controlled density fill is used as backfill material, it must contain
a minimum of 250 pounds of Class F flyash or high air (25% plus)
and be self-leveling. It must be Type 1E or 2E (very flowable).
Flowable fill is to be batched at a ready mix plant and is to be
used at a high or very high slump (one inch to 12 inches). In
lieu of the slump test, a six-inch long, three-inch diameter tube
may be filled to the top and then slowly raised. The diameter of
the resulting "pancake" may be measured and the range of the
diameter shall be nine inches to 14 inches. It shall be flowable,

Type 1E and 2E must meet the following requirements:
Compressive 28 days 90 days
Strength 30 to 80 psi 100 psi ma.
Slump 10 to 12 inches
Air 1% to 30%
(4)
If controlled density fill is used as backfill material, it must fill
the excavation to immediately below asphalt grade. The contractor
must then plate the excavation with a heavy-duty steel plate
adequate to carry heavy traffic and wait 24 hours for the CDF to
cure prior to applying the permanent patch.
(5)
If an excavation is backfilled with controlled density fill in
accordance with this bylaw, then a temporary patch need not be
installed but a permanent patch may be installed immediately.
Permanent patches installed over controlled density fill shall
consist of four inches of bituminous concrete applied in a 2 1/2 inch
base course and a 1 1/2 inch top course of bituminous concrete, all
installed in accordance with this bylaw. If an excavation in a cement
concrete public way is filled with controlled density fill, then the
provisions of Subsection E(1) of this bylaw may be omitted, but the
provisions of Subsection E(2) and (3) must be complied with.
(6)
Temporary patches.
Bituminous concrete. Following proper compaction, a temporary
patch which shall be the thickness of the existing asphalt pavement
or a minimum of four inches, whichever is greater, shall be applied.
It shall consist of either cold patch or bituminous concrete plantmixed
hot asphalt aggregate. (See Diagrams.10)
(1)
Temporary patch to be maintained for one year. A temporary patch
that has been backfilled and compacted shall be maintained by
the permit holder or contractor so that the patched surface and
the surrounding area remain a single smooth, unbroken plane for
a period of time no shorter than one year after placement of the
temporary patch.

§ 235-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 235-11
1:189
Permanent patches.
Except when installed over controlled density fill as described
in Subsection B above, permanent patches shall be installed not
less than 12 months nor more than 18 months from the date of
installation of the temporary patch. Upon request by the permit
holder or contractor, the awarding authority representative will
inspect the temporary patch and determine if final settlement of
the trench has occurred. The awarding authority representative
will notify the permit holder or contractor within seven days of the
inspection whether the permanent patch can be installed. Public
utilities or municipal departments may schedule permanent
patches to replace all temporary patches then within the
permanent patch window without receiving prior approval from the
awarding authority but must give the awarding authority and its
representative not less than 72 hours' prior notice.
(1)
A permanent patch shall consist of one of the following: a) cold
planing the temporary patch to a depth of 1 1/2 inches and then
installing a minimum of 1 1/2 inches of top course of bituminous
concrete, or b) the excavation of the temporary patch in a
bituminous concrete public way and replacement of this material
with any additional processed gravel needed and 2 1/2 inches of
base course and 1 1/2 inches of top course of bituminous concrete
(See Diagrams 1 and 2) or c) application of the infrared process
to the temporary patch, or d) the certification by the awarding
authority representative made during the permanent patch window
that the temporary patch in his reasonable judgment meets fully
the standard of a permanent patch and thus requires no further
work.
Cold planing. If the cold planing method is used, the area
to be cold planed must extend at least 12 inches beyond all
sides of the existing temporary patch. (See Diagram 2.) This
area must be cold planed to a depth of 1 1/2 inches. Any
broken or irregular edges of existing pavement shall be cut
away in straight lines leaving a sound vertical face at least
12 inches back from all edges of the existing pavement. The
permit holder must provide a dust control system capable
of complying with environmental air quality standards during
cold planing and sweep the public way following completion
of the cold planing work. All abutting edges of the existing
pavement will be painted with an asphalt emulsion
immediately prior to the placement of the permanent patch.
The permanent patch will consist of the application of a top
course of a minimum of 1 1/2 inches of bituminous concrete
plant-mixed hot asphalt aggregate. After raking and rolling,
the grade of the permanent patch shall match the existing
bituminous surface of adjacent pavement. The finished
permanent patch shall be level, having no depressions
(a)
(2)
D.
§ 235-11 FOXBOROUGH CODE § 235-11
1:190
retaining water on any of the surfaces. All seams of the finished
perimeter shall be sealed with penetrating asphalt emulsion.
Excavation. Any temporary patch that has been patched with
cold patch must be excavated and replaced with a bituminous
concrete base in accordance with this paragraph. If the
excavation method is chosen and if additional cutting of the
existing pavement is required, it shall be done in neat, straight
lines. Any broken or irregular edges of existing pavement shall
be cut away in straight lines leaving a sound vertical face at
least 12 inches back from all edges of the existing pavement.
(See Diagrams 1 and 3.) All abutting edges of the existing
pavement shall be painted with an asphalt emulsion
immediately prior to the placement of the permanent patch.
The permit holder or contractor shall remove and dispose of
all excavated material and thoroughly compact the surface of
the subbase. Following excavation, the permanent patch shall
consist of a bituminous concrete base and top laid and rolled
in two courses. The binder (base course) shall be a minimum of
2 1/2 inches in depth and the top course shall be 1 1/2 inches in
depth. The minimum total thickness of both courses, measured
after rolling, shall be four inches or equal to the material that
was previously excavated. If, after compaction, more than four
inches of permanent patch is needed in order to restore the
excavated area to finish grade, additional bituminous concrete
shall be used in the base course. The base course shall be
placed and carefully raked and thoroughly rolled to the
required thickness. The top course shall be placed to a grade
that will match the existing bituminous surface after rolling.
All seams of the finished perimeter shall be sealed with
penetrating asphalt emulsion. The finished permanent patch
shall be level, having no depressions retaining water on any of
the surfaces.
(b)
Infrared process.
If the infrared process is utilized to install the permanent
patch, the area to be repaired shall be thoroughly cleaned
to eliminate all potential contaminants. An infrared heater
shall be positioned over the area to be repaired for a
period of time required to plasticize the existing pavement
to a depth of 1 1/2 inches. Oxidation of the pavement
caused by improper heating techniques must be avoided.
If this condition occurs, all oxidized material must be
removed and replaced with Class I bituminous concrete
meeting the Standard Specifications of the Massachusetts
Highway Department.
[1]
The softened area shall be inwardly reworked from
approximately one foot beyond all sides of the original
temporary patch. This designated area shall be treated
[2]
(c)
§ 235-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 235-11
1:191
with a penetrating asphalt emulsion, uniformly scarified
and raked to a workable condition. For street crossings
and/or trenches with jogs, the reworked area will be
extended beyond the outermost jog in a straight line
parallel with the opposite outermost jog. Under no
circumstances may the infrared heat treatable patching
mix that is used register a temperature under 200° F.
After the paving mixture has been properly admixed and
raked to grade, compacting shall be obtained by use of
a steel-wheeled roller of sufficient weight to establish a
uniform density comparable to that of the surrounding
pavement surface within the work area. The finished
permanent patch shall be level, having no depressions
retaining water on any of the surfaces. All seams of the
finished perimeter shall be sealed with penetrating asphalt
emulsion.
[3]
A petroleum resin sealant shall be applied consistently
to the entire heated area by mechanical means or hand
application at an approximate rate between 0.1 and 0.25
gallon per square yard. Actual rate will be determined on
site by an approved absorption test method. A mineral
filler will then be broadcast over the newly sealed area to
absorb any excess liquid and prevent tracking and the area
immediately opened to traffic.
[4]
Certification. If a permit holder seeks to qualify a temporary
patch as a permanent patch, it must make the application
for inspection set out above and specify in it its request for
certification. The awarding authority representative will notify
the permit holder within 30 days of the request whether the
temporary patch has been certified as a permanent patch. If
it is not so certified, the permit holder shall forthwith cause a
permanent patch utilizing one of the three remaining methods
set out above to be utilized.
(d)
Newly paved roads. On newly paved roads, the awarding
authority representative may require, in addition to the
placement of the permanent patch, that the permanent patch
shall be treated by a process (infrared, microwave or
equivalent) that will ensure that the permanent patch is
integrated into the existing bituminous surface in a seamless
manner.
(e)
Final inspection of permanent patch. Following completion of
the permanent patch, the permit holder or contractor shall
give notice thereof to the awarding authority representative,
who shall inspect the permanent patch. If the awarding
authority representative is satisfied that the road has been
restored to as good a condition as existed prior to the street
(f)
§ 235-11 FOXBOROUGH CODE § 235-11
1:192
opening work, he shall so note on the street opening permit
and any refundable deposit securing that street opening work
shall be refunded promptly to applicant. If the awarding
authority representative determines that the permit holder is
in default, the awarding authority may proceed in accordance
with § 235-13, Remedies, of this bylaw.
Special rules for cement concrete roadways. Any excavation in a
cement concrete public way or public way with a cement concrete base
with a bituminous concrete surface shall be backfilled as described
in Subsection B and temporarily patched as described in Subsection
C. Immediately prior to the installation of a permanent patch, the
following shall be done:
The temporary patch and sufficient backfilled material shall be
removed.
(1)
A six-inch reinforced concrete slab shall be laid over the backfilled
trench extending one foot beyond all edges of the trench surface
and allowing for four inches of bituminous concrete to be installed
above the slab. The slab shall have steel reinforcing for tensile
strength in accordance with good engineering practices. The
permit holder or contractor shall install a temporary heavy-duty
steel plate adequate to carry heavy traffic over the trench until the
concrete slab shall have adequately cured.
(2)
Once the concrete slab shall have cured, there shall be installed a
four-inch layer of bituminous concrete applied in a 2 1/2 inch base
course and a 1 1/2 inch top course, all in accordance with Diagram
3 and generally in accordance with this bylaw.
(3)
E.
Shoulders. Suitable excavated material shall be placed in layers not
to exceed six inches in depth and compacted, shoulders shall be
reconstructed to their existing condition and either loamed with six
inches of loam, limed, fertilized and seeded with roadside grass mix or
covered with four inches of wood chips as directed by the awarding
authority representative.
F.
Sidewalks. Any excavation in a concrete or bituminous concrete
sidewalk shall require that the entire sidewalk area containing the
trench be replaced. Any concrete sidewalk section that is excavated or
damaged by the excavation must be replaced in its entirety. Suitable
excavated material or gravel shall be placed in layers not to exceed six
inches in depth and compacted. All sidewalk areas will be installed by
the permit holder or contractor in conformance with the ADA and the
Architectural Access Board Regulations currently in effect. Bituminous
concrete sidewalks shall have two courses (two inches of binder and
one inch of top) of bituminous concrete plant-mixed hot asphalt
aggregate applied to and rolled to create a pavement surface consistent
with the adjacent bituminous concrete surface. Concrete sidewalks
shall have four inches of poured concrete applied to finish grade.

Snow Removal
[Adopted 5-8-2017 ATM by Art. 21]
§ 235-33. Introduction.
The Town of Foxborough believes that it is in the best interest of the
residents for the Town to assume basic responsibility for control of snow
and ice on the Town streets. Reasonable ice and snow control is necessary
for routine travel and emergency services. The Town will provide such
control in a safe and cost effective manner, keeping in mind safety, budget,
personnel and environmental concerns. The Town will use Town employees,
equipment and/or private contractors to provide this service.
§ 235-34. Procedures.
The Director of Public Works will decide when to begin snow or ice control
operations. The criteria for that decision are:
§ 235-35. Snow plowing method.
Snow will be plowed in a manner so as to minimize any traffic obstructions.
Snow will be plowed from inside out except where it is windrowed, and
these areas are specified in § 235-36. In times of extreme snowfall, streets
will not always be able to be completely cleared of snow.
§ 235-36. Snow removal operations; schedule.
A. Snow accumulation of two inches or more.
B. Drifting of snow that causes problems for travel.
C. Ice conditions that seriously affect travel.
The Director of Public Works will determine when snow will be removed
by truck from the area. Such snow removal will occur in areas where
there is no room on the street for snow storage and in areas where
accumulated piles of snow create a hazardous condition. Snow removal
operations will not commence until other operations have been
completed. Snow removal operations may be delayed depending on
weather conditions and personnel availability. The snow will be
removed and hauled to a snow storage area within Foxborough. The
snow storage area will be so located as to minimize environmental
problems.
A.
The Town has classified Town streets based on the importance and the
welfare of the community. These are:
Streets of the Town that provide access for emergency fire, police
and medical services.

1:225
§ 235-37. Work schedule for snowplow operators.
§ 235-38. Use of salt, sand and other chemicals.
The Town will use salt, sand and other chemicals when there is hazardous
ice or slippery conditions. The Town is concerned about the effect of such
chemicals on the environment and will limit their use for that reason.
§ 235-39. Clearing of Common and sidewalks.
The Common and school routes will be maintained throughout and after
storms. If schedules allow, additional sidewalks may be cleared in the days
following a storm. Some sidewalks are not able to be cleared due to width
restrictions and obstacles, including but not limited to telephone poles, fire
hydrants and stonewalls.
§ 235-40. Parking lots, entrances and driveways.
§ 235-41. Placement of snow on public property or obstructing
views.
In accordance with the provisions of the Town Code and state law, it is
unlawful for any person to place snow or ice upon public property, including
public streets. Furthermore, cleared snow shall be piled and accumulated
The second-priority streets are those streets providing access to
schools and commercial businesses.
(2)
(3) The third-priority streets are low-volume residential streets.
(4) The fourth-priority areas are Town parking lots.
A snow emergency may be declared any time during the year at the
discretion of the Town Manager when two or more inches of snow or
ice have covered or drifted over a street.
C.
Snowplow operators are emergency personnel. Operators will take a
fifteen-minute break every two hours and a half-hour meal break after
four hours.
A.
Weather conditions. Snow and ice control operations will be conducted
only when weather conditions do not endanger the safety of Town
employees and equipment. Factors that may delay snow and ice control
operations include severe cold, significant winds and limited visibility.
B.
Responsibility for private parking lots, entrances to lots and driveways
shall rest with the individual property owners. This includes the
clearing of additional snow that may accumulate once the Town plows
have gone by.
A.
Town snowplowing crews will be responsible for plowing the municipal
parking lots, including the schools.
B.

in a manner which does not block visibility of drivers on public streets or
cause other hazardous conditions. The Director of Public Works shall have
the authority to notify property owners who violate this section and shall
require them to remedy the situation.
§ 235-42. Property damage.
The Town recognizes that on occasion private property is damaged during
snow and ice control operations. Where this happens it shall be the policy
of the Town to handle damages in the following manner:
§ 235-43. Snow and ice emergencies.
§ 235-44. Annual review of snow removal policy and procedures.
The Town Manager and Director of Public Works shall annually review, and
present changes if necessary to the Board of Selectmen for adoption by
resolution, the Town's Snow Removal Policy and Operational Guidelines at
its first regular meeting in October.
Mailboxes. Where mailboxes are placed adjacent to the street, it shall
be the policy of the Town that snow shall be plowed as close as
practicable to the curb to allow for passage of traffic and mail delivery.
It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to keep piled snow
away from mailboxes so mail can be delivered. Where damage to
mailboxes occurs, the homeowner will assume responsibility for repair.
A.
Grass and lawn repair. The property owner shall be responsible for
repairing lawn damage due to plow equipment, including both street
and sidewalk plows.
B.
Curbs. Concrete curbs will not be replaced unless the curb back is
broken.
C.
Driveway aprons. The Town will not repair damage caused to driveway
aprons or fillets where mountable curb is in place, unless authorized by
either the Director of Public Works or the Town Manager.
D.
In order to facilitate the safe and orderly snow-clearing operations, the
Town Manager may declare a snow or ice emergency based on existing
or expected weather conditions.
A.
During a snow or ice emergency all parking on Town roads is
prohibited.
B.
Vehicles parked on Town roadways in violation of the ban may be
ticketed and/or towed at the owner's expense.

groundwater of the Town of Foxborough by controlling activities deemed
to have a significant effect upon wetland values, including but not limited
to the following: public or private water supply, groundwater, flood control,
erosion control, storm damage prevention, water pollution, fisheries,
wildlife and preservation of open space.
§ 267-2. Determination of applicability.
Any person desiring to know whether or not a proposed activity or an area
is subject to this bylaw may request a determination from the Conservation
Commission in writing. The Conservation Commission shall issue its
determination, in writing, within 21 days from receipt of such request.
§ 267-3. Notice of intent required.
§ 267-4. Definitions.
As used in this bylaw, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
No person shall remove, fill, dredge, drain or alter any bank, freshwater
wetland, flat, marsh, meadow, bog, swamp, or lands bordering any
creek, river, stream, pond or lake, or any land under said waters or
any land subject to flooding, other than in the course of maintaining,
repairing or replacing, but not substantially changing or enlarging, an
existing and lawfully located structure or facility used in the service
of the public and used to provide electric, gas, water, sanitary sewer,
storm drainage, public roadway, telephone, telegraph, and other
telecommunication services without filing written notice of his intention
to so remove, fill, dredge, drain or alter and without receiving and
complying with an order of conditions and provided all appeal periods
have elapsed. Such notice shall be sent by certified mail to the
Foxborough Conservation Commission, including such plans as may
be necessary to describe such proposed activity and its effect on the
environment.
A.
The same notice of intent, plans and specifications required to be filed
by an applicant under MGL c. 131, § 40, will be accepted as fulfilling
the requirements of this bylaw. The said Conservation Commission shall
hear any oral presentation under this bylaw at the same public hearing
required to be held under the provisions of said MGL c. 131, § 40.
Definitions, time frames, and procedures, insofar as applicable, set
forth in said chapter and section and regulations thereunder (310 CMR
10.00 et seq.) are hereby made a part of this bylaw.
B.
§ 267-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 267-4
1:243
PERSON  Includes any individual, group of individuals, association,
partnership, corporation, company, business organization, trust, estate, the
Commonwealth whenever subject to Town bylaw, or any political
subdivision of the Commonwealth whenever subject to Town bylaw,
administrative agency, public or quasi-public corporation or body, or any
other legal entity or its legal representative, agents, or assigns.
§ 267-5. Right of entry.
The Conservation Commission, its agent, officers, and employees may enter
upon the land upon which the proposed work is to be done in response
to a request for a prior determination or for the purpose of carrying out
its duties under this bylaw and may make or cause to be made such
examination or survey as deemed necessary.
§ 267-6. Denials and waivers; required setbacks.
The Conservation Commission is empowered to deny permission for any
removal, dredging, draining, filling, or altering of subject lands within the
Town if, in its judgment, such denial is necessary for the protection of
public or private water supply, groundwater, flood control, storm damage
prevention and the prevention of pollution. Due consideration shall be given
to possible effects of the proposal on all values to be protected under this
bylaw.
The following requirements (Subsection D) may be waived by the
Conservation Commission to a lesser distance by a super majority vote
(five of seven members voting in favor). If the vote is taken with six or
five members present, the affirmative vote shall be five of six or four of
five. This waiver provision shall not apply if only four or fewer members
are present and voting.
A waiver shall be specific and only include the placement of a
treatment system or separations between treatment systems.
(1)
All requests for the waiving of the placement or separation of
treatment systems must be on the standard Conservation
Commission application form, which must include information
describing the positions and separations of other existing and
proposed treatment systems and the reasons for the request. The
application must prove by expert testimony that such a waiver
would not be any more of an adverse impact on the wetlands,
aquifer, recharge area, rivers, streams and ponds than the original
setbacks.
(2)
A.
A separate public hearing shall be held on the application and will be
held within the notice of intent public hearing. The hearing notice shall
be posted and advertised in the appropriate newspaper at least seven
days before the hearing date.
B.

1:244
§ 267-7. Imposition of conditions.
The Conservation Commission may, as an alternative to a denial, impose
such conditions as it deems necessary to contribute to the protection and
preservation of the subject lands and contiguous lands in accordance with
the purposes of this bylaw.
The approval or disapproval of a request shall be final. A new
application must be submitted and a new public hearing shall be held if
a waiver request is being reapplied for.
C.
Required setbacks.
Any proposed system to be installed in connection with any newly
constructed structure (excluding additions) which discharges
foreign material into the soil over an aquifer (along with a twohundred-
fifty-foot protective strip) must be 250 feet from other
existing or proposed systems.
(1)
Any proposed system to be installed in connection with any newly
constructed structure (excluding additions) which discharges
foreign material into the soil within a recharge area (along with
a one-hundred-foot protective strip) must be 200 feet from other
existing or proposed system.
(2)
Any proposed system to be installed in connection with any newly
constructed structure (excluding additions) which discharges
foreign material into the soil must be at least 150 feet from any
wetland, river, stream or pond. The only exception to the onehundred-
fifty-foot setback will be the installation of a Department
of Environmental Protection approved enhanced nitrogen removal
system (fast system), which will be at least 100 feet from any
wetland, stream or pond.
(3)
All distances will be measured from the natural edge of the
resource area, and no setbacks may be obtained by filling, altering,
or relocating a resource area.

surety, running to the municipality and sufficient as to form and surety
in the opinion of the Commission's counsel, to secure faithful and
satisfactory performance of work required by an order of conditions, in
such sum and upon such conditions as the Conservation Commission
may require. Other evidence of financial responsibility which is
satisfactory to the Conservation Commission may be accepted in lieu
of bonding. Notwithstanding the above, the amount of such bond shall
not exceed the estimated cost of the work required or the restoration of
affected lands and properties if the work is not performed as required,
whichever is greater. Forfeiture of any such bond or other security shall
be recoverable at the suit of the municipality in Superior Court.
A.
§ 267-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 267-7
1:245
§ 267-8. Setback from vegetated wetlands and inland banks.
No activity other than the maintenance of an already existing structure
which will result in the building within or upon, removing, filling, or altering
of land within 25 feet of a bordering vegetated wetland or an inland bank
will be permitted by the Conservation Commission. The only exceptions to
the above twenty-five-foot buffer zone will be for:
§ 267-9. Emergencies.
The notice required by § 267-3 of this bylaw shall not apply to emergency
projects necessary for the protection of the health and safety of the citizens
of Foxborough and to be performed or ordered to be performed by an
administrative agency of the Commonwealth or by the Town. Emergency
projects shall mean any projects certified to be an emergency by the
Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection and the
Conservation Commission if this bylaw and MGL c. 131, § 40, as amended,
are both applicable or by the Conservation Commission if only this bylaw
is applicable. In no case shall any removal, filling, draining, dredging or
altering authorized by such certification extend beyond the time necessary
to abate the emergency.
§ 267-10. Construction near vernal pools.
No activity associated with the construction of new subdivisions (including
roadways, drainage or utility systems or individual homes) or individual
homes or commercial/industrial projects shall be performed within 100 feet
of any certified vernal pool or any isolated wetland which is identified by
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as the habitat of a state listed species.
If an addition or renovation to an existing residential structure is proposed
within 100 feet of a certified vernal pool, the Conservation Commission will
review this activity on a case-by-case basis and issue conditions necessary
to provide for maximum protection to the pool in question.
Such bond or other security shall be released upon issuance of a
certificate of compliance.
B.
A wetland crossing permitted under MGL c. 131, § 40, and this Chapter
267, the Town of Foxborough Conservation Bylaws; and/or
A.
When the Commission determines that there are no reasonable
conditions or alternatives that would allow the project to proceed in
compliance with the bylaws; and that the mitigating measures are
proposed that will allow the project to be conditioned by the
Commission so as to contribute to the protection of the interests
identified in MGL c. 131, § 40, and this Chapter 267, the Town of
Foxborough Conservation Bylaws.
B.
§ 267-7 FOXBOROUGH CODE § 267-11
1:246
§ 267-11. Rules and regulations.
After public notice and public hearing the Conservation Commission shall
promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this bylaw.
Failure by the Conservation Commission to promulgate such rules and
regulations or a legal declaration of their invalidity by a court of law shall
not act to suspend or invalidate the effect of this bylaw. At a minimum, these
regulations shall define key terms in this bylaw, define additional terms not
inconsistent with this bylaw, and impose filing and consultant fees.

See Section 9.0 for further regulations applicable in all overlay
districts. To the extent that the provisions of this Section 3.0 are in
conflict, the provisions of Section 9.0 shall govern.
1.
There shall be allowed no more than one such access way through
a residential district to serve such a stadium use, except that this
limitation shall not apply to any emergency access way serving
such stadium that is required by public safety officials of the Town
of Foxborough. For (i) all National Football League (or successor)
football games, (ii) soccer games, and (iii) six other events, for
which tickets will be made available for 50,000 or more attendees
(the "permitted events"), the one limited access way through
residential districts may be used pursuant to site plan approval
granted by the Planning Board and shall be subject to limitations as
to the time, and number and type of vehicles using said access way,
pursuant to Section 9.5.10.5. For any other stadium event for which
greater than 50,000 tickets will be made available, the Planning
Board may allow the use of said limited access way through
residential districts subject to the issuance of a special permit.
When reviewing a request for a special permit, the Planning Board
shall employ the criteria detailed in Section 10.4 of these bylaws.
Among these and other concerns, the Board shall also review the
day(s) of the week the access way is proposed to be open, the
proposed hours of operation, the proposed number and types of
vehicles to use it, and the general impacts on the neighborhood.

feet net of floor space per machine in the arcade room. There shall
be at least one dedicated employee for every 30 machines.
Considering a request for a special permit for the sale of used
or previously owned vehicles, the Board shall employ the criteria
found in Section 10.4 of these bylaws. Among other concerns, it
shall also consider the proximity of the use to residential dwellings,
the proposed location relative to similar uses, the number of
vehicles proposed for sale and the proposed landscaping, screening
and buffering.
4.
Any use that would be offensive, hazardous, or harmful to the
neighborhood or to property in the vicinity by reason of blight,
air, water or noise pollution, debris, salvage materials, junk, solid
or liquid waste, danger of explosion or fire, electric or electronic
interference, or conditions conducive to the breeding of insects and
rodents is prohibited whether or not enumerated around the uses
otherwise permitted in any district. Research and development
activities that involve radioactive materials, high-intensity
electromagnetic radiation, or chemical or biological processes in
a manner that constitutes a present or potential threat or danger
to public health, safety or welfare or to the environment when
improperly stored, treated, transported, discharged, disposed of,
used or otherwise managed, are prohibited in all districts.

Access to any outdoor athletic field or athletic facility that is
situated in the R-40 Residential and Agricultural District, whether
in its entirety or in part, shall be provided only from an accepted
way through a nonresidential district. This restriction shall not
apply to any emergency access required by public safety officials of
the Town of Foxborough. [Added 5-14-2018 ATM by Art. 10]
6.
The total gross floor area of mercantile or retail uses and retail
establishments in the S-1 District, except for restaurants with
seating, shall not exceed 75% of the gross square footage of the
buildings or structures in which any such use is situated, provided
that the Planning Board may grant a special permit to increase the
gross floor area that is used for such purposes to more than 75%
of the gross square footage of any such buildings or structures.
[Added 5-14-2018 ATM by Art. 10]
7.
Unless otherwise authorized by the special permit granting
authority, the architectural design of any accessory structure, and
the type and color of the external materials used in its construction,
shall be comparable to the principal structure to which it is
incidental and subordinate. [Added 5-14-2018 ATM by Art. 12]

Bylaws.
6.1 FOXBOROUGH CODE 6.4
1:290
Applicability. Screening, buffers and landscaping shall be required for
all nonresidential land uses, all multifamily structures and within open
space residential developments (OSRD). These requirements shall
apply to new construction or any expansion or addition to any of these
uses.
Screening, buffers and landscaping within OSRDs shall be
regulated by the provisions of Section 8.3.
1.
Insofar as the provisions of this Section 6.4 are in conflict with or
are inconsistent with the provisions of Section 9.5, the provisions
of Section 9.5 shall govern.

the required yards of nonresidential and multifamily land uses. These
yard setbacks are detailed in Tables 4-1 and 4-2 of these bylaws.
6.4.3.
Waiver or modification. Screening and buffering requirements may
be waived or modified by the appropriate board if a naturally dense
vegetative area, suitable topography or a combination of the two exists
at the time of development (and is to be maintained) within the area
where screening and buffering are required. Should such naturally
dense vegetative area die or be significantly reduced, it shall be
replaced or enhanced by a landscaped buffer in accordance with the
requirements noted herein.
6.4.4.
Use requirements; abutting residential. When a nonresidential land use
or multifamily dwelling abuts a residential zoning district or is to be

7.2.3.
7.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS 7.2
1:299
Design standards. The following standards shall be used when
preparing plans for the siting and construction of all wireless
communications facilities:
All monopoles shall be designed to be constructed at the minimum
height necessary to accommodate the anticipated and future use.
The setback of a monopole from the property line of the lot on
which it is located shall be at least equal to the height of the
monopole.
1.
No monopole or attached accessory antenna on a monopole shall
exceed 120 feet in height as measured from ground level at the
base of the pole. No monopole shall be constructed which requires
guy wires. Monopoles shall not be located on buildings.
2.
The height of antennas or dishes located on residential buildings or
in the yards of residential structures shall not exceed the tree line
on the lot. However, the height of antennas for federally licensed
amateur radio operators may be increased to accommodate radio
communications.
3.
Antennas or dishes located on nonresidential buildings shall not
exceed 10 feet in height above the roofline of the structure.
4.
All wireless communications facilities shall be sited in such a
manner that the view of the facility from adjacent abutters,
residential neighbors and other areas of the Town shall be as
limited as possible. All monopoles and dishes shall be painted or
otherwise colored so they will blend in with the landscape or the
structure on which they are located. A different coloring scheme
shall be used to blend the structure with the landscape below and
above the tree or building line.
5.
Satellite dishes and/or antennas shall be situated on or attached
to a structure in such a manner that they are screened, preferably
not being visible from abutting streets. Freestanding dishes or
antennas shall be located on the landscape in such a manner so as
to minimize visibility from abutting streets and residences and to
limit the need to remove existing vegetation. All equipment shall be
colored, molded and/or installed to blend into the structure and/or
the landscape.
6.
Wireless communications facilities shall be designed to
accommodate the maximum number of users technologically
practical. The intent of this requirement is to reduce the number of
facilities which will be required to be located within the community.
7.
All monopoles shall be located a minimum of 500 feet from the
nearest residential structure.
8.
7.2.4.
7.2 FOXBOROUGH CODE 7.2

Special permit review. Applications for special permits may be
approved or approved with conditions if the petitioner can fulfill the
requirements of this Section 7.2 to the satisfaction of the Board of
Appeals. Applications for special permits may be denied if the petitioner
cannot fulfill or address the requirements of these regulations to the
satisfaction of the Board.
When considering an application for a wireless communications
facility, the Board of Appeals shall place great emphasis on the
proximity of the facility to residential dwellings and its impact
on these residences. New facilities shall only be considered after
a finding that existing (or previously approved) facilities cannot
accommodate the proposed use(s).
1.
When considering an application for an antenna or dish proposed
to be placed on a structure, the Board of Appeals shall place
great emphasis on the visual impact of the unit from the abutting
neighborhoods and street(s).
2.
7.2.5.
Findings. Secondary effects of adult entertainment and uses and have
been found by the Planning Board to include increased crime, adverse
impacts on public health, adverse impacts on the business climate
of the Town, adverse impacts on property values of residential and

The requirements noted in Table 8-1 shall apply to all lots located
within an OSRD. All accessory structures and uses shall comply
with the requirements of Section 4 of these bylaws unless
otherwise provided for herein. Within those areas governed by the
WRPOD Zone II regulations, the minimum building lot area shall be
"upland" as defined in MGL Chapter 131. Each dwelling unit shall
have sufficient parking for two vehicles.
1.
Lots approved at the preliminary plan stage may be located on
existing streets in the special permit filing and shall comply with
the requirements of Table 8-1.
2.
Strong emphasis shall be placed upon preserving and integrating
the existing topography, natural features (such as rock outcrops,
specimen trees and clumps of trees) and man-made features such
as stonewalls into the plan.
3.
The Planning Board may place limitations on the types and location
of accessory structures which may be located within the preserved
open space in the development. Existing/proposed screening,
distances between the OSRD and existing abutters, and topography
shall all be considered. The intent is to minimize impacts on
existing abutters. A deed restriction may be required if such
limitations are applied.
4.
Swimming pools may not be located within 30 feet of a property
line of an existing single-family dwelling abutting the OSRD. The
Planning Board may increase this distance after considering those
items noted in Subsection 4, above.
5.
Screening and buffering. When determined necessary by the Board,
screening and buffering shall comply with the following:
Screening/buffering may consist of landscaped berms, evergreen
plantings, solid walls or fences complemented by suitable
1.
8.3.5.
8.3 FOXBOROUGH CODE 8.3
1:318
plantings, "no cut" provisions (for existing vegetation), or a
combination of these items.
The location of the screening/buffering and species type(s) of
vegetation shall be noted on the definitive plan. All new plantings
shall consist of evergreens and be situated in a manner acceptable
to the Planning Board.
2.
Dedicated open space.
A minimum of 45% of the parcel shall become dedicated open
space pursuant to MGL c. 40A, § 9. The Planning Board may reduce
this figure to a minimum of 35% if it determines there are unique
circumstances (re: shape of parcel, topography, wetlands, etc.) that
would individually or together preclude the construction of the
OSRD or that the open space to be provided is of exceptional value
to the Townspeople.
1.
Uses for open space: The open space may be used for wildlife
habitat and conservation and may also be the following additional
purposes: historic preservation, outdoor education, passive
recreation, aquifer protection, stormwater management,
agriculture, horticulture, forestry, or a combination of these uses,
and shall be served by suitable access for such purposes.
2.
Dedicated open space may be utilized as natural courses for
disposal for storm drainage from impervious surfaces. Other than
minor berming (maximum 3-1 slopes which shall blend into the
landscape) and riprap at pipe outflows, no significant disruptions of
the land (contour changes greater than three feet) for drainage are
permitted.
3.
Dedicated open space may be in one or more parcels of a size and
shape appropriate for its intended use. The parcels shall be laid out
to promote convenient access by the homeowners within the OSRD,
the general public or both, whatever the case may be. Wherever
practical, parcels shall be accessible via upland areas. These items
shall be agreed upon by the Planning Board and applicant.
4.
Public access to proposed preserved open space, including paths,
shall be provided. The plan shall show the location, construction
details, and signage for pathways. Paths in OSRDs shall not be
utilized for snowmobiles and other motorized travel, but may be
used for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, horseback riding, and
other non-motorized modes of travel. If appropriate, skating areas
may be designated within preserved open space areas.
5.
8.3.6.
Ownership of dedicated open space.
As agreed upon by the applicant and the Board, dedicated open
space shall either be conveyed to the Town and accepted by it for
park or open space, or be conveyed to a nonprofit organization, the
1.
8.3.7.
8.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS 8.3
1:319
principal purpose of which is the conservation of open space, or
to be conveyed to a corporation or trust owned or to be owned by
the owners of all building lots within the development. If such a
corporation or trust is utilized, ownership thereof shall pass with
conveyances of the lots or residential units. In any case, where
such land is not conveyed to the Town, a restriction enforceable by
the Town pursuant to MGL c. 40A, § 9, shall be recorded providing
that such land shall be kept in an open natural state and not be
developed or built upon.
If necessary, such restrictions shall further provide for
maintenance for the common land in a manner which will ensure
its suitability for its function, appearance, cleanliness, and proper
maintenance of drainage, utilities, and the like.
2.
Pre-permitting and study plan(s): The applicant is required to meet with
the Board to discuss alternatives and conceptual plans before filing an
application.
8.3.8.

an OSRD shall include a definitive subdivision plan with 11 copies.
It shall be prepared in accordance with the Foxborough Subdivision
Regulations. In addition, the applicant shall provide the following
information:
A detailed analysis of the site, including wetlands, soil conditions,
areas within the one-hundred-year floodplain, trees over six inches
in diameter in areas identified by the Planning Board, Water
Resource Protection Overlay District delineation and natural, and/
or man-made features and other items as the Planning Board may
request;
1.
A description of the proposed design characteristics of the site
pursuant to these regulations;
2.
Engineering data showing effects of proposed development on both
on- and off-site water resources (within 100 feet of the property
line), wetlands and natural recharge of the groundwater, yield from
abutters' private wells and possible impacts upon the quality of
surface and groundwater;
3.
A copy of any restrictive covenant(s) for the preserved open space,
association rules and regulations and/or other documentation
relating to the creation of a homeowners' association or similar
entity.
4.
8.3.9.
Application process. A pre-application meeting and public hearing are
required. The intent of such is to allow the Town the opportunity to
discuss with the applicant and review each proposal prior to the special
permit process. After the pre-application review, an applicant may then
proceed to the special permit process. A pre-application review will be
conducted in accordance with the following procedure:
8.3.10.
8.3 FOXBOROUGH CODE 8.3
1:320
An application, a preliminary set of plans, illustrating a
conventional subdivision plan and proposed OSRD shall be filed
with the Foxborough Town Clerk and the Planning Board. The
application shall be accompanied by 11 copies of the plans and any
other supporting materials, which must be prepared and stamped
by a professional civil engineer and landscape architect. This
submittal shall comply with Section 3.01 of the Subdivision
Regulations.
1.
The preliminary subdivision plan shall be used by the Planning
Board to determine the maximum number of lots which could be
created via a conventional plan. This number will be the maximum
allowed in an OSRD definitive subdivision plan submittal.
2.
The burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to prove the
proposed lot(s) are suitable for building. The Planning Board
reserves the right to challenge the status of any lot and not allow
such to be included in any definitive plan filing.
3.
Formal percolation and depth to groundwater tests shall be
conducted for each building lot unless town sewerage is available.
The results of these tests shall be submitted with the application.
Due to seasonal testing requirements, the Planning Board may
accept an application without these certified tests. However, the
applicant would proceed at his or her own risk and no development
of a building lot could commence until it has been approved by the
Board of Health.
4.
A preliminary sketch plan of the proposed OSRD shall be
submitted. It shall contain the proposed location of the road(s),
lots, drainage, and dedicated open space. General topography
(with ten-foot contours maximum), major site features and adjacent
streets shall also be shown.
5.
The Planning Board shall hold a public hearing and act on the
preliminary plan within 45 days after the receipt of the application.
6.
The conceptual OSRD shall also be reviewed and discussed during
the hearing process. Comments and recommendations shall be
incorporated in plans included in any subsequent filings.
7.
If the preliminary conventional and conceptual OSRD plans are
approved, the Planning Board shall, insofar as practical under the
law, allow the submittal of a combined special permit and definitive
subdivision plan. A combined submission will not be authorized
in those cases where either the conventional preliminary plan or
proposed OSRD sketch plan is not approved by the Planning Board.

Findings. The groundwater underlying the Town is a significant source
of its existing and future drinking water supply. The groundwater
aquifers are integrally connected with, and flow into, the surface
waters, lakes and streams which constitute significant recreational and
economic resources of the Town. Spills and discharges of petroleum
products and other toxic and hazardous materials and the discharge of
sewage have repeatedly threatened the quality of groundwater supplies
and related water resources throughout Massachusetts and elsewhere,
posing potential public health and safety hazards and threatening
economic losses to the affected communities.
9.4.1.
Purpose. The purpose of the Water Resource Protection Overlay District
(WRPOD) is to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community by:
Preserving and maintaining the existing and potential groundwater
supplies, aquifers, and recharge areas of the Town of Foxborough,
and protecting them from adverse development or land-use
practices;
1.
Preserving and protecting present and potential sources of
drinking water supply for the public health and safety;
2.
3. Conserving the natural resources of the Town;
4. Preventing blight upon and/or pollution of the environment;
Implementing the Town's authority to regulate water use pursuant
to MGL c. 41, § 69B, and MGL c. 40, § 41A, conditioned upon
a declaration of water supply emergency issued by the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).

than sanitary waste, or where disposal is through a sewer line
and comply with regulations herein.
g.
Design standards. When considering an application, the SPGA shall
give consideration to the simplicity, reliability, and feasibility of the
control measures and design standards proposed, and the degree of
threat to water quality which would result if the control measures and
design standards failed. Where applicable, the SPGA must find based
upon the requirements of this Section 9.4 that proposed alterations or
extensions are not substantially more detrimental to water resources
than the existing, nonconforming structure or use within the defined
WRPOD. The SPGA may grant a special permit if it finds that the
applicant has demonstrated that the proposed activity or use complies
with the following design standards and requirements:
1. It meets the intent and specific criteria of this Section 9.4;
It will not, during construction or thereafter, have an adverse
impact on any aquifer or recharge area in the WRPOD;
2.
It will not adversely affect an existing or potential domestic or
municipal water supply;
3.
Groundwater quality at the downgradient boundary of the property
shall not be allowed to violate state or federal drinking water
standards;
4.
Provisions shall be made to protect against toxic or hazardous
materials discharge or loss resulting from corrosion, accidental
damage, spillage or vandalism through measures such as:
prohibition of underground fuel storage tanks; spill control
provisions and clean-up in the vicinity of chemical or fuel delivery
transfer points; secured storage areas for toxic or hazardous
materials; indoor storage provisions for corrodible or dissolvable
materials/wastes; and a schedule of future monitoring of waste
streams or groundwater on the site to ensure that proper control
has been maintained;

areas and drainage basins shall be located outside the WRPOD, to
the extent feasible;
Site design shall result in no increase in the peak rate of
stormwater runoff in a ten-year storm and one-hundred-year storm.
Site design shall result in no increase in the total volume of
stormwater runoff in a one-year storm event. Areas left in an open
or vegetated state shall be located so as to increase distances
between impervious surfaces or on-site disposal systems and any
surface water body or municipal well. Where possible, stormwater
should be controlled by best management practices (BMPs). For
example, stormwater may be directed through vegetated areas
prior to infiltration into the groundwater or to surface water;
7.
Systems for artificial recharge of precipitation will not result in the
degradation of groundwater quality. Wherever possible, recharge
should occur by BMPs or through diversions into vegetated areas
where surface infiltration will occur. Dry wells shall be used for
roof runoff and in those situations where surface infiltration is not
feasible. Discharge of all runoff (excepting roof drains) shall be
preceded by, and flow through oil and grease traps, and sediment
traps which shall be maintained in accordance with a maintenance
schedule submitted as required by the SPGA;
8.
Periodic monitoring and sampling schedule may be required by
the SPGA, based upon the proposed use of the site, including,
but not limited to: sampling of wastewater disposed to on-site
systems, maintenance records for dry wells and sampling from
groundwater monitoring wells if mandated by the special permit.
If required, a monitoring report with six copies shall be submitted
within a specified time period to the SPGA, who will distribute
them to the Town Clerk, Fire Chief, Board of Health, Board of
Water and Sewer Commissioners, and Conservation Commission.
The cost of monitoring, including sampling and analysis, shall be

3.
To the extent feasible, except with respect to the access way
through residential districts allowed under Section 9.5.5.3 of these
bylaws, sidewalks, crosswalks and other pedestrian amenities shall
be incorporated into street and access drive designs. In connection
with the development of a stadium and accessory uses thereto,
the widths of such sidewalks, crosswalks and other pedestrian
amenities should reflect their proximity to such stadium, and
expected use by stadium patrons. To the extent feasible, sidewalks
should be separated from vehicle travel/breakdown lanes and
access roads by distance, grade changes or other physical
impediments.
