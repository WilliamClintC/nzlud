all courts as the Official Code and Law of the City as enacted by the Mayor and City Council.

Upon adoption by the City Council, this City Code is hereby declared to be and shall hereafter
constitute the official City Code of Roseville. This City Code of ordinances shall be known and
cited as the ROSEVILLE CITY CODE and is hereby published by authority of the City Council and
shall be supplemented to incorporate the most recent legislation of the City as provided in Section
101.04 of this Chapter. Any reference to the number of any section contained herein shall be
understood to refer to the position of the same number, its appropriate chapter and title heading,
and to the general penalty clause relating thereto, as well as to the section itself, when reference is
made to this City Code by title in any legal documents. (1995 Code)
101.02: ACCEPTANCE:
The City Code, as hereby presented in printed form, shall hereafter be received without further
proof in all courts and in all administrative tribunals of this State as the ordinances of the City of
general and permanent effect. (1995 Code)
101.03: AMENDMENTS:
Any ordinance amending the City Code shall set forth the title, chapter and section number of the
section or sections to be amended, and this shall constitute sufficient compliance with any statutory
requirement pertaining to the amendment or revision by ordinance of any part of this City Code.
All such amendments or revisions by ordinance shall be immediately forwarded to the codifiers,
and said ordinance material shall be prepared for insertion in its proper place in each copy of this
City Code. Each such replacement page shall be properly identified and shall be inserted in each
individual copy of the City Code. (1995 Code)
101.04: CODE ALTERATIONS:
It shall be deemed unlawful for any person to alter, change, replace or deface in any way any
section or any page of this City Code in such a manner that the meaning of any phrase or order

instructions when so authorized by the City Council. The City Manager shall see that the
replacement pages are properly inserted in the official copies maintained in the office of the City

101.05: COURT PROCEEDINGS:
A. Violations of Former Ordinances: No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a
former ordinance whether such former ordinance is expressly repealed or not. Any offense
committed against such former ordinance or as to any act done, any penalty, forfeiture or
punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising under the former ordinance, or in
any way whatever to affect any such offense or act so committed or done, or any penalty,
forfeiture or punishment so incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new
ordinance takes effect shall be governed by the former ordinance. Proceedings thereafter shall
conform to the ordinance in force at the time of such proceeding, so far as practicable. If any
penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be mitigated by any provision of a new ordinance, such
provision may be, by consent of the party affected, applied to any judgment announced after
the new ordinance takes effect.
B. Application of Provisions: This Section shall extend to all repeals, either by express words or
implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making any new provisions upon the same
subject or in any other ordinance.
C. Effect of Provisions: Nothing contained in this Chapter shall be construed as abating any action
now pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the City herein repealed. The
provisions of all general ordinances contained in this Code shall be deemed to be continuing
provisions and not a new enactment of the same provisions. This Chapter shall not be deemed
as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty accrued or to accrue, or as
affecting the liability of any person or as waiving any right of the City under any ordinance or
provision in force at the time of the adoption of this City Code. (1995 Code)
101.06: SEVERABILITY CLAUSE:
If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this City Code or
any part thereof is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the
remaining portions of this Code, or any part thereof. The City Council hereby declares that it
would have passed each section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase
thereof irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs,
sentences, clauses or phrases be declared unconstitutional, invalid or ineffective. (1995 Code)
101.07: CONSTRUCTION OF WORDS:
A. Rules of Construction: When interpreting this Code, the following rules of construction shall
be applied, except where the application of any rule of construction would result in an
interpretation clearly contrary to the plain intent of a provision or of any section or chapter in
which a given provision appears. The rules are as follows:
1. Common Usage: All words and phrases used in this Code shall be interpreted and
understood in accordance with the common and acceptable usage, but any technical words and
phrases, or such others which have acquired a specific or peculiar meaning, shall be
interpreted and understood in accordance with such technical, specific or peculiar meaning.
2. Gender; Singular and Plural: If any word in this Code expresses male or female gender, it
shall be extended to and shall be applied to both genders and every word expressing the plural
number shall extend to and be applied to one person or thing as well as several persons or
things.
3. Tenses: The use of any verb in the present tense shall include the future when applicable
and the use of any verb in the future tense shall include the present when applicable.
B. Application of Minnesota Statutes: In addition to the rules of construction contained in
subdivision A hereof, the rules and canons of construction, presumptions and miscellaneous
provisions pertaining to construction contained in Minnesota Statutes chapter 645 governing
statutory construction are hereby adopted by reference and made a part hereof as if fully set
forth herein. All references contained in these statutory provisions to laws and statutes shall be
construed to apply and refer to the provisions of this Code and all references to the legislature
shall be construed to apply to the City Council or appropriate governing body.
C. Changes for Clarification: The word "ordinance" contained in the ordinances of the City has
been changed in the content of this City Code to "Title", "Chapter", "Section" and/or
"subdivision" or words of like import for organizational and clarification purposes only. Such
change to the City's ordinances is not meant to amend passage and effective dates of such

B. Petty Misdemeanor Offense: A petty misdemeanor offense is an offense which is prohibited
by statute which does not constitute a crime and is classified as a petty misdemeanor for which
a sentence of a fine of not more than $300.00 or any different amounts adopted by statute may
be imposed2. (1995 Code)
C. Administrative Offense:
1. Purpose: Administrative offense procedures, established pursuant to this Section, are
intended to provide the City with an alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of
certain ordinance provisions.
2. Definitions:
a. Administrative Offense: A violation of a provision of this Code that is subject to the
administrative penalties set forth in the schedule of offenses and penalties referred to in
Subsection 11., hereafter, and which may or may not have associated compliance
requirements.
3. Notice: Any officer of the Police Department or any other person employed by the City,
authorized under Section 102.02 of this Code shall, upon determining that there has been a
violation of ordinance or Code, notify the violator or, in the case of a vehicular violation,
attach to the vehicle a notice of the violation. Said notice shall set forth the nature, date and
time of violation, the name of the official issuing the notice, the amount of the scheduled
penalty and required compliance actions, if applicable.
4. Recovery of Administrative Costs: The owner of the premises, where an administrative
offense ticket has been issued by the City’s Community Development Department, shall be
personally liable for the cost of the City for inspection of said property and administrative
costs as allowed per Minnesota Statute 429.101. Staff shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail
it to the owner. The amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the City
Manager.
5. Notice Contestation and Hearing: Any person contesting an administrative offense may,
within seven days of the time of issuance of the notice, request, in writing, a hearing. The
Hearing Officer shall forthwith conduct an informal hearing to determine if a violation has
occurred. The Hearing Officer shall have authority to dismiss the violation or reduce or waive
the penalty. If the violation is sustained by the Hearing Officer, the violator shall pay the

within seven days of the time of issuance of the notice, unless contesting the notice pursuant to
Subsection 5.of this Chapter. The amount of the fine shall be set forth on the schedule of
penalties for the violation as adopted by the City Council. The penalty may be paid in person
or by mail and payment shall be deemed to be an admission of the violation.
8. Failure to Pay Penalty and/or Administrative Costs: In the event a party charged with an
administrative offense fails to pay the penalty when due, a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor
charge may be brought against the alleged violator in accordance with applicable statutes. In
the event a party does not pay the monetary penalty and/or administrative costs, the City may
seek to collect the costs of the administrative offense procedures per Section 407.07 and/or
906 of this Code.
a. If the penalty and/or administrative cost is unpaid, the City Manager shall, on or before
September 1, list the total unpaid charges along with all other such charges, as well as other
charges for current services to be assessed under Minnesota Statute 429.101 against each
separate lot or parcel to which the charges are attributable. The City Council may then
spread the charges against such property under that statute and other pertinent statues for
certification to the County Auditor and collection along with current taxes the following
year, or in annual installments not exceeding ten, as the City Council may determine in
each case.
9. Failure to Comply: If a violation requires code compliance within a set period of time and
the compliance does not occur by the deadline specified, the City may initiate an abatement
process, as provided in Chapter 407 of the City Code, and/or charge the party with a
misdemeanor.
10. Disposition of Penalties: All penalties collected pursuant to this Section shall be paid to the
City Treasurer and may be deposited in the City's general fund.
11. Offenses and Penalties: Offenses that may be charged as administrative offenses are
infractions to the City Code. Monetary penalties associated with offenses shall be identified in
the City’s Fee Schedule. Subsection 314.05
12. Subsequent Offenses: In the event a party is charged with a subsequent administrative
offense within an 18 month period for the same or substantially similar offense, the subsequent
administrative penalty shall be increased by 100% above the previous administrative penalty.
The City shall only increase the penalty twice within this period. (Ord. 1134, 1-24-94)
(Ord. 1366, 4-21-2008)

311.02: Definitions
311.03: License Required
311.04: Application for License
311.05: Investigation by Police Department

311.12: Prohibited Acts
311.13: Adoption of Statutes by Reference
311.01: PURPOSE:
The City Council finds that pawnbrokers and precious metal dealer regulation is appropriate
because such activities provide an opportunity for the commission of crimes and their
concealment because such businesses have the ability to receive and transfer stolen property
easily and quickly. The City Council also finds that consumer protection regulation of such
activities is warranted because customers of such businesses frequently seek their services
during times of desperate financial circumstances.
To help the police department better regulate current and future pawn businesses, decrease
and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of the pawn industry, and increase
identification of criminal activities in the pawn industry through the timely collection and
sharing of pawn transaction information, this chapter also implements and establishes the
required use of the automated pawn system (APS). (Ord. 1275, 11-18-2002)

312.02: IMPOSITION OF TAX:
There is hereby imposed a tax of 3% on the rent charged by an operator for providing
lodging to any person. The tax shall be stated and charged separately and shall be collected
by the operator from the lodger. The tax collected by the operator shall be a debt owed by
the operator to the city and shall be extinguished only by payment to the city. In no case
shall the tax imposed by this section upon an operator exceed the amount of tax which the
operator is authorized and required by this chapter to collect from a lodger. (Ord. 1200, 3-
23-1998)
312.03: COLLECTIONS:
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter at the time rent is paid. The tax
collections shall be held in trust by the operator for the city. The amount of tax shall be
separately stated from the rent charged for the lodging. (Ord. 1200, 3-23-1998)
312.04: EXEMPTIONS:
An exemption shall be granted to any person as to whom or whose occupancy it is beyond

312.05: ADVERTISING NO TAX:
It shall be unlawful for any operator to advertise or hold out or state to the public or any
customer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or any party thereof will be assumed or absorbed
by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent or that, if added, it or any part thereof
will be refunded. In computing the tax to be collected, amounts of tax less than one cent

amount of taxes imposed by this chapter previously paid as a result of any transaction the
consideration for which became uncollectible during such reporting period, but only in
proportion to the portion of such consideration which became uncollectible. (Ord. 1200, 3-
23-1998)
312.07: EXAMINATION OF RETURN, ADJUSTMENTS, NOTICES
AND DEMANDS:
The Director may rely upon the "Minnesota state sales and use tax return" filed by the
operator with the state in determining the accuracy of a return filed under this chapter.
However, the Director shall be authorized to make any investigation or examination of the
records and accounts of the person making the return, if the Director reasonably determines
that such steps are necessary for determining the correctness of the return. The tax computed
on the basis of such examination shall be the tax to be paid. If the tax due is found to be
greater than that paid, such excess shall be paid to the city within ten days after receipt of a
notice thereof, given either personally or sent by registered mail to the address shown on the
return. If the tax paid is greater than the tax found to be due, the excess shall be refunded to
the person who paid the tax to the city within ten days after determination of such refund.
(Ord. 1200, 3-23-1998)
312.08: REFUNDS:
Any person may apply to the Director for a refund of taxes paid for a prescribed period in
excess of the amount legally due for that period, provided that no application for refund
shall be considered unless filed within one year after such tax was paid, or within one year
from the filing of the return, whichever period is the longer. The Director shall examine the
claim and make and file written findings thereon denying or allowing the claim in whole or
in part and shall mail a notice thereof by registered mail to such person at the address stated
upon the return. If such claim is allowed in whole or in part, the Director shall credit the
amount of the allowance against any taxes due under this chapter from the claimant and the
balance of said allowance, if any, shall be paid by the Director to the claimant. (Ord. 1200,
3-23-1998)
312.09: FAILURE TO FILE A RETURN:
A. If any operator required by this chapter to file a return shall fail to do so within the time
prescribed, or shall make, willfully or otherwise, an incorrect, false, or fraudulent
return, the operator shall, upon written notice and demand, file such return or corrected
return within five days of receipt of such written notice and shall at the same time pay
any tax due on the basis thereof. If such person shall fail to file such return or corrected
return, the Director shall make a return or corrected return, for such person from such
knowledge and information as the Director can obtain, and assess a tax on the basis
thereof, which tax, less any payments theretofore made on account of the tax for the
taxable period covered by such return shall be paid within five days of the receipt of
written notice and demand for such payment. Any such return or assessment made by
the Director shall be prima facie correct and valid, and such person shall have the
burden of establishing its incorrectness or invalidity in any action or proceeding in
respect thereto.
B. If any portion of a tax imposed by this chapter, including penalties thereon, is not paid
within 30 days after it is required to be paid, the city may institute such legal action as
may be necessary to recover the amount due plus interest, penalties, the costs and
disbursements of any action.
C. Upon a showing of good cause, the Director may grant an operator one 30-day
extension of time within which to file a return and make payment of taxes as required
by this chapter provided that interest during such period of extension shall be added to
the taxes due at the rate of 10% per annum. (Ord. 1200, 3-23-1998)
312.10: PENALTIES:
If any tax imposed by this chapter is not paid within the time herein specified for the
payment, or an extension thereof, there shall be added thereto a specific penalty equal to
10% of the amount remaining unpaid. The amount of tax not timely paid, together with any
penalty provided by this section, shall bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum from the
time such tax should have been paid until it is paid. Any interest and penalty shall be added
to the tax and be collected as part thereof. (Ord. 1200, 3-23-1998)
312.11: ADMINISTRATION OF TAX:
The Director shall administer and enforce the assessment and collection of taxes imposed by
this chapter. The Director shall cause to be prepared blank forms for the returns and other
documents required by this chapter and shall distribute the same throughout the city and
furnish them on application, but failure to receive or secure them shall not relieve any
person from any obligation required of him or her under this chapter. (Ord. 1200, 3-23-
1998)
312.12: EXAMINATION OF RECORDS:
The Director and those persons acting on behalf of the Director, authorized in writing by the
Director, may examine the books, papers and records of any operator in order to verify the
accuracy of any return made, or if no return was made, to ascertain the tax as provided in
this chapter. Every such operator is directed and required to give to the Director, or such

payment; or who shall refuse to permit the city to examine the books, records and papers
under his or her control; or who shall willfully make any incomplete, false or fraudulent
return shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. (Ord. 1200, 3-23-1998)
312.14: USE OF PROCEEDS AND ANNUAL REPORT:
95% of the proceeds obtained from the collection of taxes pursuant to this chapter shall be

section may be appealed to the City Council. A petitioner seeking to appeal the decision
must file a written notice of appeal with the city within ten days after the decision has
been mailed to the petitioner. The matter will thereupon be placed on the council
agenda as soon as it is practical. The council shall then review the findings of fact and
conclusions to determine whether they are correct. Upon a determination by the council
that the findings and conclusions are incorrect, the council may modify, reverse or
affirm the decision of the city manager, or the manager's designee, upon the same

PERMIT AND PLAN/PROJECT REVIEW FEES
City Code Sections; 307, 801, 802, 901, 1014. ** All permits, licenses, fees, registrations, &
fines are subject to a processing fee.
Building Permit Fee – Community Development
Permit fee to be based on job cost valuation. The determination of value or valuation shall be
made by the building official. The value to be used in computing the building permit and
building plan review fees shall be the total of all construction work for which the permit is
issued, as well as all finish work, painting, roofing, electrical, plumbing, heating, air
conditioning, elevators, fire-extinguishing systems and any other permanent equipment.
Plan Review Fee:
When a building permit is required and a plan is required to be submitted, a plan checking fee
shall be paid. Plan checking fees for all buildings shall be sixty five percent (65%) of the
building permit fee as set forth in Section 901.06 of this chapter, except as modified in
M.S.B.C. Section 1300. (Ord. 1110, 4-13-1992)
The plan review fees specified are separate fees from the permit fees and are in addition to the
permit fees. When submittal documents are incomplete or changed so as to require additional
plan review or when the project involves deferred submittal items an additional plan review
fee shall be charged.
Expiration of plan review:
Applications for which no permit is issued within 180 days following the date of application
shall expire by limitation, and plans and other data submitted for review may thereafter be
returned to the applicant or destroyed by the building official.
The building official may extend the time for action by the applicant for a period not exceeding
180 days on request by the applicant showing that circumstances beyond the control of the
applicant have prevented action from being taken. No application shall be extended more than
once. In order to renew action on an application after expiration, the applicant shall resubmit
plans and pay a new plan review fee.
Refund Policy:
The building official may authorize refunding of any fee paid hereunder pursuant to the
established fee policy of the Community Development department.
Investigation Fee: Work without a Permit
Whenever any work for which a permit is required from the city has been commenced without
first obtaining said permit, a special investigation shall be made before a permit may be issued
for such work.
An investigation fee, in addition to the permit fee, shall be collected whether or not a permit
is then or subsequently issued. The investigation fee shall be equal to the amount of the permit
fee required by this Fee Schedule. The payment of such investigation fee shall not exempt any
person from compliance with all other provisions of State and City Code nor from any penalty
prescribed by law.

pay the City's cost of such outside consultant.
C. Review: The City staff shall review the application in conjunction with the MPCA's
review of the proposed contaminated soil treatment and disposal. Such review shall
include examination, investigation and written comments by the Public Works Director,
Community Development Director, Fire Marshal and other City department heads
deemed appropriate. (Ord. 1075, 4-23-1990)
D. Hearing: The City Council will hold a hearing on each application for a permit to treat
or dispose of contaminated soil. Notice of the hearing shall be as provided for in

(Ord. 1078, 6-25-1990) (Ord.1355, 11-19-2007)
501.20: SPECIAL MULTIPLE DOG LICENSES: Repealed (Ord. 1355, 11-

B. Definition: As used in this Section, the following term shall have the meaning ascribed
to it in this subsection:
WILD ANIMAL: Any animal, mammal, amphibian, or reptile which is of a species
which is wild by nature or of a species which, due to size, vicious nature or other
characteristic is inherently dangerous to human beings. Examples of wild animals,
without limitation, are:
1. Any large cat of the family Felidae, such as lions, tigers, jaguars, leopards, cougars
and ocelots, except domesticated house cats.
2. Any member of the family Canidae, such as wolves, hybrid wolves, coyotes, dingoes,
and jackals, except domesticated dogs.
3. Any crossbreed such as crossbreeds between dogs and coyotes, or dogs and wolves,
but does not include crossbred domesticated animals.
4. Any poisonous snake such as a rattlesnake, coral snake, water moccasin, puff adder
or cobra.
5. Any skunk, raccoon, fox or protected animal.
6. Any bear, ape, monkey in excess of five pounds, or badger.
7. Any other animal, bird or reptile which is commonly considered wild and not
domesticated.
C. Exceptions:
1. Any person desiring to keep an animal prohibited by this Section may apply for a
permit from the City. Such permit may be issued for a period not to exceed 30 days and
shall specify conditions under which such animals shall be kept; provided, however,
that no such permit shall be issued unless such prohibited animal is being kept by a
person keeping such animal for a public zoo as a volunteer or docent. A public zoo or
other institution engaged in a permanent display of animals and any bona fide research
institution or veterinary hospital may be issued a permanent permit provided applicable
zoning requirements are met.
2. Nonpoisonous snakes, domesticated birds, hamsters, mice, rabbits, lizards, spiders
and other similar small animals capable of being kept in cages. Rats, if purchased from
a bona fide pet store are an exception to this Section.
3. Medically prescribed companion animals.
4. Wildlife rehabilitators may only possess animals with a Minnesota Department of
Natural Resources permit. Such animals will be kept in a manner as to not create
unsanitary conditions or unreasonable noise.
5. Birds and birds of prey if kept pursuant to a valid U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services
permit.
D. Impounding of Wild Animals: Any wild animal kept in violation of this Section may be
impounded by the City. The animal may be destroyed or sold five days following notice
to the owner of such animal of its impoundment and the provisions of this Section. Any
person reclaiming any such animal shall pay the costs of impounding and boarding at
the time of its release.
E. Existing Wild Animals: Anyone keeping or maintaining any wild animal at the time this
Section is adopted has thirty (30) days in which to comply with the provisions of this
Section. (Ord. 1141, 6-13-1994)
501.24: OWNER OBLIGATION FOR PROPER CARE:
No owner shall fail to provide any animal with sufficient good and wholesome food and
water, proper shelter and protection from the weather, veterinary care when needed to
prevent suffering and with humane care and treatment. No person shall beat, treat cruelly,
torment or otherwise abuse any animal or cause or permit any animal fight. No owner shall
abandon any animal. (Ord. 1078, 6-25-1990; amd. 1995 Code) (Ord.1355, 11-19-2007)
501.25: PET STORES:
The City Council finds that a significant number of puppies and kittens sold at pet stores
come from large-scale, commercial breeding facilities where the health and welfare of the
animals are not adequately provided for; and
The City Council finds that the documented abuses endemic to mass breeding facilities
include over-breeding; inbreeding; minimal to no-existent veterinary care; lack of adequate
and nutritious food, water and shelter; lack of socialization; lack of adequate space; lack of
adequate exercise; no or limited screening of genetic diseases; inadequate transportation and
shipping protocols of puppies and kittens; and indiscriminate disposal of breeding dogs and
cats who have reached the end of their profitable breeding cycle; and
The City Council finds that inhumane conditions in mass breeding facilities lead to health
and behavioral issues in the animals bred in those facilities, which many consumers are
unaware of when purchasing animals from pet stores due to both a lack of education on the
issue and misleading tactics of pet stores in some cases. These health and behavioral issues,
which may not present themselves until sometime after the purchase of the animals, can
impose exorbitant financial and emotional costs on consumers; and
The City Council finds that current Federal and State regulations do not properly address the
sale of dogs and cats in pet stores, while the City of Roseville does not possess adequate
resources to safeguard the health and well being of dogs and cats at the point of sale; and
The City Council finds that due in large part to pet overpopulation, numerous dogs and cats
are euthanized. Restricting the retail sale of puppies and kittens is likely to increase demand
from animal shelters and rescue organizations; and
The City Council finds that across the country, thousands of independent pet stores as well
as large chains operate profitably with a business model focused on the sale of pet services
and supplies and not the sale of commercially bred dogs or cats. Many of these stores
collaborate with local animal shelters and rescue organizations to offer space and support for
showcasing adoptable homeless pets on their premises; and
The City Council finds that this Ordinance will not adversely impact consumers’ ability to
obtain a dog or cat of their choice directly from an animal shelter, or breed-specific rescue
organization, or from a breeder where the consumer can see directly the conditions in which
the dogs or cats are bred or can confer directly with the breeder concerning those conditions;
and
The City Council finds that it is in the best interest of the City of Roseville to adopt
reasonable regulations to help prevent inhumane breeding conditions, promote community
awareness of animal welfare, and foster a more human environment in the City.

509.01: PURPOSE AND FINDINGS
The Roseville City Council intends to discourage underage possession and consumption of
alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and intends to hold persons
criminally responsible who host events or gatherings where persons under 21 years of age
possess or consume alcohol regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering
supplied the alcohol. The Roseville City Council finds that:
A. Events or gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or
consumed by persons under the age of twenty-one are harmful to those persons and
constitute a potential threat to public health requiring prevention or abatement.
B. Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons, as well as the
general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or
alcohol-related traffic collisions.
C. Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on
those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user.
D. Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur
outside the presence of parents. However, there are times when the parent is present and
condone the activity, and in some circumstances provide the alcohol.
E. Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime, it is difficult
to prove, and this Chapter is necessary to help further combat underage consumption.
F. A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally responsible for hosting
an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs.

This Chapter shall apply to all owners and occupants of private property which is the subject
or location of the repeat nuisance service call by the City.
This Chapter shall apply to any repeat nuisance service calls as set forth herein made by a

conduct. The repeat nuisance service call fee shall be as established by the City Fee
Schedule in Section 314.052 of the City Code.
511.04: NOTICE

A. Identify the nuisance conduct that has occurred on the property, and the dates of the
nuisance conduct activity or condition;

the payment of the fee at such person’s last known address. If the fee is not paid within such
30 day period, it will be deemed delinquent and a ten percent (10%) penalty shall be added
to the repeat nuisance service call fee. If the repeat nuisance service call fee becomes
delinquent, the City shall have, in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity
for the collection of such fee, the following remedies:
A. Seek a monetary judgment and collection thereof from such owner and/or occupant, or
B. Assess the property which was the subject of the nuisance conduct pursuant to Minn.
Stat. § 429.101.

a license which is related to the nuisance conduct for which the repeat nuisance service call
fee was imposed.

person to a hearing is waived and the repeat nuisance service call fee shall be payable in

nuisance service call fee is warranted, the person or persons responsible for the fee shall pay
the fee within ten (10) business days following the date that the written Findings of Fact and

707.01: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
A. General: to provide for the health, safety and well-being of its citizens, and to ensure the
structural integrity of its streets and the appropriate use of the rights of way, the City
strives to keep its rights of way in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary
encumbrances. Although the general population bears the financial burden for the
upkeep of the rights of way, a primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of
its rights of way is frequent excavation.
The City holds the rights of way within its geographical boundaries as an asset in trust
for its citizens. The City and other public entities have invested millions of dollars in
public funds to build and maintain the rights of way. It also recognizes that some
persons, by placing their equipment in the right of way and charging the citizens of the
City for goods and services delivered thereby, are using this property held for the public
good. Although such services are often necessary or convenient for the citizens, such
persons receive revenue and/or profit through their use of public property.
In response to the foregoing facts, the City hereby enacts this new Chapter relating to
right-of-way permits and administration. This Chapter imposes reasonable regulations
on the placement and maintenance of equipment currently within its rights of way or to
be placed therein at some future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles
of State and Federal agencies. Under this Chapter, persons disturbing and obstructing
the rights of way will bear a fair share of the financial responsibility for their integrity.
Finally, this Chapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from
persons using the public rights of way.
B. Legislative Power: By enactment of this Chapter, the City Council hereby exercises its
lawful police power and common law authority, and all statutory authority which is
available to it, including, but not limited to, the powers conferred on it under Minnesota
Statutes sections 237.162 and 237.163, while preserving all power and authority to
further require franchises from right-of-way users under Minnesota Statutes sections
216B.36, 222.37, 300.03, and 412.11, and other provisions of law. (Ord. 1209, 8-24-
1998) This chapter shall not be interpreted to limit the regulatory and police powers of
the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety
and welfare of the public. (Ord. 1549, 4-9-2018)

a breach as stated in Section 707.21 of this Chapter are not refundable. (Ord. 1209, 8-
24-1998)
707.12: RIGHT-OF-WAY REPAIR AND RESTORATION:
A. Timing: The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the patching and
restoration of the right of way as required herein, must be completed within the dates
specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work could not be done because
of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the permittee, as determined by
the Director, or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under Section
707.15 of this Chapter.
B. Patch and Restoration: Permittee shall patch its own work. The City may choose either
to have the permittee restore the right of way or to restore the right of way itself.
1. City Restoration: If the City restores the right-of-way, permittee shall pay the costs
thereof within 30 days of billing. If, during the 36 months following such restoration,
the pavement settles due to permittee's improper backfilling, the permittee shall pay to
the City, within 30 days of billing, all costs associated with having to correct the
defective work.
2. Permittee Restoration: If the permittee restores the right of way itself, it shall at the
time of application for an excavation permit, if the Director determines additional
security is necessary, post an additional performance and restoration bond in an amount
determined by the Director to be sufficient to cover the cost of restoration. If, 36 months
after completion of the restoration of the right of way, the Director determines that the
right of way has been properly restored, the surety on the performance and restoration
bond posted pursuant to this subsection shall be released.
C. Standards: The permittee shall perform patching and restoration according to the
standards and with the materials specified by the Director. The Director shall have the
authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so in written
procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The Director in exercising
this authority shall be guided by the following considerations:
1. The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations, disruptions or damage to the
right of way;
2. The traffic volume carried by the right of way; the character of the neighborhood
surrounding the right of way;
3. The pre-excavation condition of the right of way; the remaining life expectancy of
the right of way affected by the excavation;
4. Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in
reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the right of
way that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the right
of way; and
5. The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be effective in slowing
the depreciation of the right of way that would otherwise take place.
D. Guarantees: By choosing to restore the right of way itself, the permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for 36 months following its completion. During this 36
month period it shall, upon notification from the Director, correct all restoration work to
the extent necessary, using the method required by the Director. Said work shall be
completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the Director, not
including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances
constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonal or
unreasonable under Section 707.15 of this Chapter.
E. Failure to Restore: If the permittee fails to restore the right of way in the manner and to
the condition required by the Director, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all
restoration required by the Director, the Director at its option may do such work. In that
event the permittee shall pay to the City, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring
the right of way. If permittee fails to pay as required, the City may exercise its rights
under the restoration bond.
F. Degradation Fee In Lieu of Restoration: In lieu of right-of-way restoration, a right-ofway
user may elect to pay a degradation fee. However, the right-of-way user shall
remain responsible for patching, and the degradation fee shall not include the cost to
accomplish these responsibilities. (Ord. 1209, 8-24-1998)
707.13: JOINT APPLICATIONS:
A. Joint Application: Registrants may jointly apply for permits to excavate or obstruct the
right of way at the same place and time.

performed by the Director, whether or not it is a joint application by two or more
registrants or a single application, may not be required to pay some or all of the
obstruction and degradation portions of the permit fee, in the sole discretion of the
Director.
C. Shared Fees: Registrants who apply for permits for the same obstruction or excavation,
which the Director does not perform, may share in the payment of the obstruction or
excavation permit fee. Registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each
will pay and indicate the same on their applications. (Ord. 1209, 8-24-1998)

presented within the required time, the Director may revoke the permit pursuant to
Section 707.21 of this Chapter. (Ord. 1209, 8-24-1998)
707.19: WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT:
A. Emergency Situations: Each registrant shall immediately notify the Director of any
event regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. Excavators’
notification to Gopher State One Call regarding an emergency situation does not fulfill
this requirement. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to
respond to the emergency. Within two business days after the occurrence of the
emergency the registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated
therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into
compliance with this Chapter for the actions it took in response to the emergency.
If the Director becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's facilities, the
Director may attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or
potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the Director may take whatever
action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne
by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the emergency. (Ord. 1333, 03-13-2006)

6. The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition
indicated on an order issued pursuant to Section 707.18 of this Chapter.
B. Written Notice of Breach: If the Director determines that the permittee has committed a
substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or
any condition of the permit, the Director shall make a written demand upon the
permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations
may be cause for revocation of the permit. A substantial breach, as stated above, will
allow the Director, at his or her discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on
the permit.
C. Response to Notice of Breach: Within 24 hours of receiving notification of the breach,
permittee shall contact the Director with a plan, acceptable to the Director, that will cure
the breach. Permittee's failure to so contact the Director, or the permittee's failure to
submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved
plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permittee's failure
to so contact the Director, or the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or
permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall automatically place
the permittee on probation for one full year.

shall provide the Director accurate maps and drawings certifying the “as-built” location
of all equipment installed, owned and maintained by the permittee. Such maps and
drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and equipment
and shall be provided consistent with the City’s electronic mapping system when
practical or as a condition imposed by the Director. Failure to provide maps and
drawings pursuant to this Subsection shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder’s
registration. (Ord. 1333, 3-13-2006)
B. Service Laterals: All permits issued for the installation or repair of Service Laterals,
other than minor repairs as defined in Minnesota Rules 7560.0150 subpart 2, shall
require the Permittee’s use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations
of installed Service Laterals, and the Service Lateral vertical locations in those cases
where the Director reasonably requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall
submit to the Director evidence satisfactory to the Director of the installed Service
Lateral locations. Compliance with this subdivision 2 and with applicable Gopher State
One Call law and Minnesota Rules governing Service Laterals installed after December
31, 2005, shall be a condition of any City approval necessary for 1) payments to
contractors working on a public improvement project including those under Minnesota
Statutes, Chapter 429, and 2) City approval of performance under development
agreements, or other subdivision or site plan approval under Minnesota Statutes,
Chapter 462. The Director shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of
providing such information to the City. Failure to provide prompt and accurate
information on the Service Laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit
issued for the work or for future permits to the offending Permittee or its
subcontractors. (Ord. 1209, 8-24-1998); (Ord. 1333, 03-13-2006)
707.23: LOCATION OF FACILITIES:
A. Undergrounding: to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law or regulation, or

216B.34, or unless existing aboveground facilities are repaired or replaced, new
construction and the installation of new facilities and replacement of old underground
facilities shall be done underground or contained within buildings or other structures in
conformity with applicable codes, if required by the Director.
B. Corridors: The Director may assign specific corridors within the right of way, or any
particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of equipment that is or;
pursuant to current technology, the Director expects will someday be located within the
right of way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits issued by the Director
involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the proper corridor
for the facilities at issue.
Any registrant who has facilities in the right of way in a position at variance with the
corridors established by the Director shall, no later than at the time of the next
reconstruction or excavation of the area where the facilities are located, move the
facilities to the assigned position within the right of way, unless this requirement is
waived by the Director for good cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as the
remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service needs and
hardship to the registrant.
C. Nuisance: One year after the passage of this Chapter, any facilities found in a right of
way that has not been registered shall be deemed to be a nuisance. The City may
exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to,
abating the nuisance or taking possession of the facilities and restoring the right of way
to a useable condition.
D. Limitation of Space: to protect health, safety, and welfare or when necessary to protect
the right of way and its current use, the Director shall have the power to prohibit or limit
the placement of new or additional facilities within the right of way. In making such
decisions, the Director shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing
and potential users of the right of way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations
of the public interest, the public's needs for the particular utility service, the condition of
the right of way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of
existing facilities in the right of way, and future City plans for public improvements and
development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest. (Ord.
1209, 8-24-1998)
707.24: RELOCATION OF FACILITIES:
A registrant must promptly and at its own expense, with due regard for seasonal working
conditions, permanently remove and relocate its facilities in the right of way whenever the
Director for good cause requests such removal and relocation, and shall restore the right of
way to the same condition it was in prior to said removal or relocation. The Director may
make such request to prevent interference by the company's equipment or facilities with: a) a
present or future City use of the right of way, b) a public improvement undertaken by the
City, c) an economic development project in which the City has an interest or investment, d)
when the public health, safety and welfare require it, or e) when necessary to prevent
interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the right of way.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person shall not be required to remove or relocate its

permittee's facilities, the City shall reserve, to and for itself and all registrants having
facilities in the vacated right of way, the right to install, maintain and operate any
facilities in the vacated right of way and to enter upon such right of way at any time for
the purpose of reconstructing, inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same.

707.28: INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY:
By registering with the Director, or by accepting a permit under this Chapter, a registrant or
permittee agrees as follows:
A. Limitation of Liability: By reason of the acceptance of a registration or the grant of a
right-of-way permit, the City does not assume any liability: 1) for injuries to persons,
damage to property, or loss of service claims by parties other than the registrant or the
City, or 2) for claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the installation, presence,
maintenance, or operation of facilities by registrants or activities of registrants.
B. Indemnification: A registrant or permittee shall indemnify, keep, and hold the City free
and harmless from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to
property occasioned by the issuance of permits or by the construction, maintenance,
repair, inspection, or operation of registrant's or permittee's facilities located in the right
of way.
The City shall not be indemnified for losses or claims occasioned through its own
negligence except for losses or claims arising out of or alleging the local government
unit's negligence as to the issuance of permits or inspections to ensure permit
compliance. The City shall not be indemnified if the injury or damage results from the
performance in a proper manner of acts that the registrant or permittee reasonably
believes will cause injury or damage, and the performance is nevertheless ordered or
directed by the City after receiving notice of the registrant's or permittee's
determination.
C. Defense: If a suit brought against the City under circumstances where the registrant or
permittee is required to indemnify, the registrant or permittee, at its sole cost and
expense, shall defend the City in the suit if written notice of the suit is promptly given
to the registrant or permittee within a period in which the registrant or permittee is not
prejudiced by the lack or delay of notice.
If the registrant or permittee is required to indemnify and defend, it shall thereafter have
control of the litigation, but the registrant or permittee may not settle the litigation
without the consent of the City. Consent will not be unreasonably withheld.
This part is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense, immunity, or damage
limitation otherwise available to the City.
In defending an action on behalf of the City, the registrant or permittee is entitled to
assert in an action every defense, immunity, or damage limitation that the City could
assert in its own behalf. (Ord. 1209, 8-24-1998)

right-of-way user. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the matter must be
resolved by a three (3) person arbitration panel made up of one arbitrator selected by the
City, one arbitrator selected by the right-of-way user and one selected by the other two
(2) arbitrators. The costs and fees of the single arbitrator shall be borne equally by the
City and right-of-way user. In the event there is a third arbitrator, each party shall bear
the expense of its own arbitrator and shall jointly and equally bear with the other party
the expense of the third arbitrator and of the arbitration. (Ord. 1209, 8-24-1998)

facilities in the right of way under this Chapter have been lawfully assumed by another
registrant; or
2. Submit to the Director a proposal and instruments for transferring ownership of its
facilities to the City. If a registrant proceeds under this clause, the City may, at its
option:
a. Purchase the facilities; or
b. Require the registrant, at its own expense, to remove it; or
c. Require the registrant to post an additional bond or an increased bond amount
sufficient to reimburse the City for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in
removing the facilities.
B. Abandoned Facilities: Facilities of a registrant who fails to comply with subsection A of
this Section, and which, for two years, remains unused shall be deemed to be
abandoned. Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The City may exercise
any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to: 1) abating
the nuisance, 2) taking possession of the facilities and restoring them to a usable
condition, or 3) requiring removal of the facilities by the registrant, or the registrant's
successor in interest.

shall remove it from that right of way during the next scheduled excavation, unless this
requirement is waived by the Director. (Ord. 1209, 8-24-1998)
707.31: RESERVATION OF REGULATORY AND POLICE POWERS:
A permittee's or registrant's rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the City

of the public. (Ord. 1209, 8-24-1998)
707.32: FRANCHISE; FRANCHISE SUPREMACY:
The City may, in addition to the requirements of this Chapter, require any person which has
or seeks to have equipment located in any right of way to obtain a franchise to the full extent
permitted by law, now or hereinafter enacted. The terms of any franchise which are
inconsistent with any provision of this Chapter, whether granted prior or subsequent to
enactment of this Chapter, shall control and supersede the conflicting terms of this Chapter.
All other terms of this Chapter shall be fully applicable to all persons whether franchised or
not. (Ord. 1209, 8-24-1998)
707.33: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this Chapter is for any
reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent
jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and
such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a regulatory
body or a court of competent jurisdiction should determine by a final, non-appealable order
that any permit, right or registration issued under this Chapter or any portions of this
Chapter is illegal or unenforceable, then any such permit, right or registration granted or
deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered as a revocable permit with a mutual right in
either party to terminate without cause upon giving 60 days' written notice to the other. The
requirements and conditions of such a revocable permit shall be the same requirements and
conditions as set forth in the permit, right or registration, respectively, except for
conditions relating to the term of the permit and the right of termination. Nothing in this
Chapter precludes the City from requiring a franchise agreement with the applicant, as
allowed by law, in addition to requirements set forth herein. (Ord. 1209, 8-24-1998)

determined by the Public Works Director. (Ord. 855, 9-10-79; amd. 1995 Code)
K. Exception to Independent Sewer System Requirement: Under the following limited
circumstances, the requirement for an independent sewer system provided in subsection
I of this Section need not be met:
1. Where one building stands to the rear of another building on an interior lot and no
private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining
alley, court, yard or driveway, the building drain from the front building may be
extended to the rear building and the whole will be considered as one building drain.
Where such a building drain is extended, a cleanout shall be provided immediately
inside the rear wall of the front building.
2. A new structure on one parcel may be permitted to connect to an existing sewer line
serving an adjacent parcel when the following conditions are met:
a. The alternative construction of a new sewer service to serve the parcel would
create a hardship due to the necessity of crossing a railroad or roadway by method
other than open cut or as determined by the Public Works Director.
b. The owners of the property will sign and record an instrument, in perpetuity, for
joint use and maintenance of the shared service, which instrument specifically holds
the City harmless and releases the City from any and all claims relating to the shared
service. A copy of said instrument will be filed with the City for approval by the City
Attorney.
c. The Public Works Director determines that the shared sewer has adequate capacity
for anticipated flows.

802.15: DISCHARGE OF FATS, OILS AND GREASE:
A. Definitions: The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall
have the meaning:
1. Best Management Practice or BMP: Fats, Oils and Grease or FOG BMP’s are the
most effective and practicable means of controlling, preventing and minimizing
the discharge of FOG into the City’s sanitary sewer system including the
installation of devices, device maintenance, training or any other practice that
reduces FOG.
2. Food Service Establishments or FSE means any facility containing an operation
that prepares, packages, serves, vends or otherwise provides food or which
disposes of food related wastes. Food service facility does not include single or
multifamily residential facilities unless commercial kitchens, which are licensed
by Ramsey County Public Health, are present, but does include institutional
facilities and other facilities designated by the Public Works Director or their
designee, as a facility that discharges enough FOG to have significant impact on
the City’s sanitary sewer system.
3. Fats, Oils and Grease or FOG: means material composed primarily of fats, oils
and grease from animal or vegetable sources.
4. Food manufacturer/processor or FM/P means those establishments using
methods and techniques to transform raw ingredients into food for human
consumption.
5. Grease interceptor means grease retention units of the outdoor or underground
type with a 1,000- to 3,000-gallon capacity. FSE requiring a larger than 3,000-
gallon capacity interceptor shall plumb and install additional separate units.
6. Grease trap means a device for separating and retaining waterborne greases and
grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and entering the
sanitary sewer system.

oils and grease to the City’s sanitary sewer system including, but not limited to,
restaurants, grocery stores, meat markets, hotels, correctional facilities, factory
and office building cafeterias, public and private schools, hospitals, multiple
tenant housing which has commercial kitchens licensed by Ramsey County
Public Health, commercial day care centers, places of worship, and catering
services.
2. As of the effective date of this ordinance and thereafter, no FSE or FM/P shall
discharge any substance of any kind into any portion of the City’s sanitary sewer
system except in accordance with a best management practice (BMP) program
which has been approved by the City’s Public Works Director in writing.
3. No FSE or FM/P shall discharge any substance of any kind into any portion of
the sanitary sewer system which is not in conformance with the BMP program
for that FSE or FM/P.
C. FOG prohibitions. No FSE or FM/P shall;
1. Install food grinders in a plumbing or sewage system in any new construction or
renovation of a structure designed to house a FSE or FM/P;
2. Discharge any wastewater containing FOG into the sanitary sewer system except
in compliance with the BMP program for that facility;
3. Introduce any additives into the sanitary sewer system for the purpose of
emulsifying FOG or biologically or chemically treating any substance introduced
into any sanitary sewer system for the purpose of treatment or pretreatment of
wastewater, unless with a specific written authorization by the Public Works
Director;
4. Discharge wastewater at temperatures in excess of 160 degrees Fahrenheit to any
grease interceptor or grease trap;
5. Operate grease interceptors if the unit has accumulated waste, both FOG and
food solids, accounting for 25 percent or more of its wetted depth measured from
the static water level to the interior tank bottom, with FOG and solids
accumulation, exceeding 25 percent of the total operating depth of the grease
interceptor; or
6. Discharge any FOG or any other solid materials removed from the grease control
device to the sanitary sewer system.
D. FOG interceptors installation requirements.
1. Except as provided for in subsection 802.15.M, any structure designed for or
intended to be used for an FSE or FM/P must have a grease interceptor installed
prior to discharging any wastewater into a sanitary sewer system. Such grease
interceptor must comply with all conditions as set forth in the State of Minnesota
Administrative Rule 4715 and the Ramsey County Public Health Department;
2. Property owners of any new commercial construction structure designed to house
multiple tenants on a single parcel shall be responsible to install and maintain a
single grease interceptor to serve each individual tenant. If a property owner
demonstrates to the Public Works Director that it is not practically possible to
install and maintain a single grease interceptor to serve each individual unit
located in the structure, in which case the Public Works Director has the
discretion to approve a plan for such structure providing for more than one grease
interceptor or a combination of grease interceptors and grease traps to service
such property, which approval shall be in writing. Said approved plan shall
include the minimum number of grease interceptors and grease traps that can
reasonably serve the structure and the BMP program shall specifically include
service for all approved grease intercepts and grease traps;
3. The owner of any structure occupied by more than one FSE or FM/P shall be
jointly and severally liable with the owner of each FSE or FM/P served by any
grease interceptor or any grease trap for the servicing and maintenance of that
grease interceptor or grease trap and for any servicing and maintenance of any
sanitary sewer system located downstream from said structure to remove any
accumulations of FOG therefrom;
4. The Public Works Director may require existing FSE or FM/Ps and owners of
structures in which such FSE or FM/Ps are located which have been identified as
introducing FOG in any portion of the sanitary sewer system, and which
introduction of FOG, in whole or in combination with other FOG contributors,
has been responsible for causing the need for the city to clean such portion of the
sanitary sewer system more than twice in a single calendar year to install grease
interceptors or other FOG equipment as deemed necessary to comply with this
section. Such installation shall be completed and operational within 180 days of
notice by the Public Works Director.
E. Grease interceptors. Maintenance and cleaning of grease interceptors. In the
maintaining and routine cleaning of grease interceptors and any other grease control
device, the owner of the FSE or FM/P and the owner of the structure in which it is
located, if different from the owner of the FSE or FM/P shall be responsible for the
proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material. If not
performed by personnel under the direct control and direction of any such owner, such
removal and haul shall be performed by currently licensed waste disposal haulers who
are licensed for this activity.
1. Maintenance of grease interceptors shall be performed as frequently as necessary
to protect the sanitary sewer system against the accumulation of FOG.
Maintenance shall be performed as determined by inspection and application of
the 25-percent rule, or at intervals specified in the permit, whichever is more
frequent. Maintenance shall be performed at least every 90 days.
a. The 25-percent rule requires that the depth of oil and grease (floating and
settled) in a trap shall be less than 25 percent of the total operating depth of
the trap. The operating depth of a trap is determined by measuring the
internal depth from the outlet water elevation to the bottom of the trap.
F. Grease traps. Maintenance of grease traps shall be performed as frequently as necessary
to protect the sanitary sewer system against the accumulation of FOG. Maintenance shall
be performed as required by inspection and/or sampling or at intervals specified in the
permit, whichever is more frequent. Maintenance shall be performed at minimum every
14 days.
G. Maintenance modifications. Food service facilities which operate infrequently or only
for special events may request a modification to the maintenance schedule specified
above. The Public Works Director may authorize a maintenance frequency related to the
operation of the food service facility. The property owner shall submit a request for a
modified maintenance schedule which includes all details of operation for the director to
review.
H. Disposal. The property owner shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal of
the grease interceptor or trap waste. All waste removed from each grease interceptor or
trap must be disposed of properly at an appropriate facility designed to receive grease i
nterceptor or trap waste. No grease interceptor or trap waste shall be discharged into any
City sanitary or storm sewer system.
I. Maintenance log. The property owner shall be responsible for retaining records of the
maintenance of grease interceptors and traps including manifests, permits, permit
applications, correspondence, sampling data and any other documentation that may be
requested by the City. This log shall include the dates of service, volume of waste
removed, waste hauler, and disposal site of waste. These records shall be kept on-site at
the location of the grease interceptor or trap for a period of three years and are subject to
review by the City upon request without prior notification.
J. Inspection. The City will perform periodic inspections of these facilities and shall notify
the property owner of any additional required maintenance or repairs. Upon written
notification by the City, the property owner shall be required to perform the maintenance
and records of said maintenance within 14 calendar days. Upon inspection by the City
the property owner may be required to install, at their expense, additional controls to
provide a complete system which prevents discharges of FOG into the sanitary sewer
system.
K. Exception from grease interceptor requirements. If the owner of any FSE or FM/P or of
any structure in which an FSE or FM/P is located or is to be located demonstrates to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Public Works Director that installation of a grease
interceptor is not feasible, the Public Works Director may grant an exception allowing
such owner to install grease traps or other alternative treatment technology which will in
their discretion adequately control the release of FOG from the FSE or FM/P or the
structure into the sanitary sewer system. The FSE or FM/P bears the burden of
demonstrating that the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible to the
satisfaction of the Public Works Director.
L. Charge for remedial maintenance or repair of the City sanitary sewer system.
1. In the event that the owner of an FSE or FM/P or the owner of any structure in
which an FSE or FM/P is located is found to have contributed to the partial or
complete obstruction of a sanitary sewer system resulting from the discharge of
wastewater or waste containing FOG and that the City is required to act
immediately to control a public health hazard because of such blockage, such
owner shall be required to reimburse the City for all costs of abating such
condition. In situations where there are multiple owners identified as contributing
to FOG causing such obstruction, the Public Works Director will apportion the
cost of the cleanup, maintenance or repair costs on a prorated basis, based on
each owner's percentage share of the average total sanitary sewer charges for all
such owners. Further, should inspection, testing or other sampling activity by the
City confirm that any property owner is contributing FOG (including other
harmful ingredients) and is causing the repair or excessive maintenance activity
to maintain the sanitary sewer system, the Public Works Director may require
retrofitting of the structure with grease interceptors or grease traps, including
testing facilities and access thereto sufficient to resolve the problem;
2. The costs for curing any private sewer lateral failures and sewer system
overflows, including cleaning and other maintenance, caused in whole or in part
by FOG introduced into the sanitary sewer system by any FSE or FM/P, alone or
in conjunction with any other party, are the responsibility of the owner of the
FSE or FM/P and the owner of any structure in which the FSE or FM/P
contributing the FOG to the sanitary sewer system is located.
M. Compliance. Compliance with the grease control program shall be evaluated based on
the following criteria:
1. All FSE and SM/P who are implementing and documenting BMPs and
performing and documenting grease retention unit cleaning at the required
frequency will be considered to be in full compliance with this policy.
2. When an obstruction and/or sanitary sewer overflow occur due to the presence of
FOG, the records of all FSE or FM/P that discharge to the affected sanitary sewer
line may be reviewed in order to determine the responsible party. Any FSE or
FM/P found to be in noncompliance with the required grease retention unit
cleaning frequency shall be deemed a "responsible party" for cost recovery.
Payment of cost recovery does not preclude further enforcement actions for
noncompliance as per the FOG enforcement response plan.
N. Penalties and assessments for FOG program noncompliance. In the event that the owner
of an FSE or FM/P or the owner of any structure in which an FSE or FM/P is located is
found to have failed to comply with the provisions of this division, the following
penalties or assessments or both may be applied:
1. For introduction of FOG into any sanitary sewer system resulting in obstruction
to said system or in a sanitary sewer overflow:
a. The city may disconnect water and sewer service to the FSE or FM/P and to
the structure in which the FSE or FM/P is located;
b. City may impose a fine per the City ’s Fee Schedule until such owner
demonstrates that the subject FSE or FM/P or structure is in compliance with
the requirements of this section;
2. For failure to maintain records as required by the BMP program for any FSE or
FM/P, or failing or refusing to timely comply with any request for records
required to be provided to the Public Works Director, a fine per the City’s Fee
Schedule until such records are provided;
3. For failure to pass the FOG inspection due to lack of or ineffective FOG
equipment the Public Works Director may:
a. Require the subject FSE or FM/P to install additional FOG equipment as
necessary to resolve the problem;
b. Change the sewer rate class of the FSE or FM/P to reflect the presence of the
excessive FOG contribution by the FSE or FM/P

803.01: Storm Water Drainage Utility
803.02: Connection to Storm Sewers
803.03 Storm Water Illicit Discharge and Connections
803.04 Erosion and Sedimentation Control
803.01: STORM WATER DRAINAGE UTILITY:
A. Establishment: The Municipal storm sewer system shall be operated as a public utility
pursuant to Minnesota Statute, section 444.075, from which revenues will be derived
subject to the provisions of this Section and Minnesota statutes. The storm water
drainage utility will be part of the Public Works Department and under the
administration of the Public Works Director.
B. Definition: "Residential equivalent factor, (REF)" - One REF is defined as the ratio of
the average volume of runoff generated by one acre of a given land use to the average
volume of runoff generated by one acre of typical single-family residential land during
a standard one year rainfall event.
C. Fees: Storm water drainage fees for parcels of land shall be determined by multiplying
the REF for a parcel's land use by the parcel's acreage and then multiplying the REF for
a parcel's land use by the parcel's acreage and then multiplying the resulting product by
the storm water drainage rate. The REF values for various land uses are as follows1:
For the purpose of calculating storm water drainage fees, all developed one-family and
duplex parcels shall be considered to have an acreage of one-third (1/3) acre. The storm
water drainage rate used to calculate the actual charge per property shall be established
by City Council Resolution.
D. Credits: The City Council may adopt policies recommended by the Public Works
Director, by resolution, for adjustment of the storm water drainage fee for parcels based
upon hydrologic data to be supplied by property owners, which data demonstrates a
hydrologic response substantially different from the standards. Such adjustments of
storm water drainage fees shall not be made retroactively.
E. Exemptions: The following land uses are exempt from storm water drainage fees:
1. Public rights of way.
1 CLASSIFICATION LAND USES REF
1 Cemeteries golf courses 0.25
2 Parks with parking facilities 0.75
3 Single-family and duplex residential 1.00
4 Public & private school, community center 1.25
5 Multiple-family residential, churches & government buildings 2.50
6 Commercial, industrial, warehouse 5.00
7 Improved vacant As Assigned
2. Vacant, unimproved land with ground cover.
F. Payment of Fee: Statements for storm water drainage fee shall be computed every three
months and invoiced by the Finance Officer for each account on or about the fifth day
of the month following the quarter. Such statement shall be due on or before the last day
of the month in which the statement is mailed. Any prepayment or overpayment of
charges shall be retained by the City and applied against subsequent quarterly fees.
G. Recalculation of Fee: If a property owner or person responsible for paying the storm
water drainage fee questions the correctness of an invoice for such charge, such person
may have the determination of the charge recomputed by written request to the Public
Works Director made within twelve months of mailing of the invoice in question by the
City.
H. Penalty for Late Payment: Each quarterly billing for storm water drainage fees not paid
when due shall incur a penalty charge of ten percent of the amount past due.
I. Certification of Past Due Fees on Taxes: Any past due storm water drainage fees, in
excess of 90 days past due, may be certified to the County Auditor for collection with
real estate taxes, pursuant to Minnesota Statute, section 444.075, subdivision 3. In
addition, the City shall also have the right to bring a civil action or to take other legal
remedies to collect unpaid fees. (Ord. 937, 1-9-84; amd. 1995 Code) (Ord. 1383, 6-08-
2009)
803.02: CONNECTION TO STORM SEWERS:
A. Permit Required: No person shall connect any drain to a storm sewer of the City
without first obtaining a permit to do so.
B. Granting of Permits: The Public Works Director shall grant permits only to applicants
who are licensed by the City.
C. Hook Up Permit Fee: The fee for a permit to hook up to a City storm sewer shall be set
by City Council resolution. (Ord. 377, 9-10-62; amd. 1995 Code)
D. Additional Fees: Before any hook up permit shall be issued, the following conditions
shall be complied with:
1. No permit shall be issued to connect with any storm sewer system to the City directly
or indirectly from any lot or tract of land unless the Public Works Director shall have
certified:
a. That such lot or tract of land has been assessed for the cost of construction or the
storm sewer main or line with which the connection is made, or
b. If no assessment has been levied for such construction cost, the proceedings for
levying such assessment have been or will be completed in due course, or
c. If no assessment has been levied and no assessment proceedings will be
completed in due course, that a sum equal to the portion of cost of constructing
said storm sewer main which would be assessable against said lot or tract has
been paid to the City, or
2. If no such certificate can be issued by the Public Works Director no permit to
connect to any storm sewer main shall be issued unless the applicant shall pay an
additional connection fee which shall be equal to the portion of the cost of
construction of the said storm sewer main which would be assessable against said lot
or tract to be served by such connection. Said assessable cost is to be determined by
the Public Works Director upon the same basis as any assessment previously levied
against other property for the said main, including interest at a rate equal to the
interest rate of the original assessment from the date of the original assessment and
continuing for a period of20 years or the amount of years the assessment was
payable, whichever is less. Interest may be waived or decreased, when it is
determined by the Public Works Director that the improvement was not subject to
utilization until a later date. If no such assessment has been levied, the assessable
cost will be determined upon the basis of the uniform charge which may have been
or which shall be charged for similar storm sewer improvements, determined on the
basis of the total assessable cost of said main or line, allocated on a frontage basis,
acreage basis, or both.
3. No building permit shall be issued for any building where the affected lot or parcel
of land has been benefited by an assessed storm sewer improvement unless the
provisions of this subsection have been complied with. (Ord. 745, 12-30-74; amd.
1995 Code)
803.03: STORM WATER ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND
CONNECTIONS:
A. Purpose: The purpose of the ordinance is to promote, preserve and enhance the natural
resources within the City and protect them from adverse effects caused by non-storm
water discharge by regulating discharges that would have an adverse and potentially
irreversible impact on water quality and environmentally sensitive land. This ordinance
will provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of
Roseville through the regulation of non-storm water discharges to the storm drainage
system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal and state law. This
ordinance establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the
municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with requirements of
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The
objectives of this ordinance are:
1. To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer
system (MS4) by storm water discharges by any person.
2. To prohibit Illicit Connections and Discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer
system.
3. To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring
procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this ordinance.
B. Definitions: For the purposes of this ordinance, the following terms, phrases, words and
their derivatives shall have the meaning stated below.
1. BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP): Erosion and sediment control and
water quality management practices that are the most effective and practicable means
of controlling, preventing, and minimizing the degradation of surface water,
including construction-phasing, minimizing the length of time soil areas are exposed,
prohibitions, and other management practices published by state or designated areawide
planning agencies.
a. Non-structural BMP: Practices that focus on preserving open space, protecting
natural systems, and incorporating existing landscape features such as wetlands
and stream corridors to manage storm water at its source. Other practices include
clustering and concentrating development, minimizing disturbed areas, and
reducing the size of impervious areas.
b. Structural BMP: a physical device that is typically designed and constructed to
trap or filter pollutants from runoff, or reduce runoff velocities.
2. COMMERCIAL: Activity conducted in connection with a business.
3. DISCHARGE: Adding, introducing, releasing, leaking, spilling, casting, throwing, or
emitting any pollutant, or placing any pollutant in a location where it is likely to
pollute waters of the state.
4. EQUIPMENT: Implements used in an operation or activity. Examples include, but
are not limited to; lawn mowers, weed whips, shovels, wheelbarrows and
construction equipment.
5. EROSION: any process that wears away the surface of the land by the action of
water, wind, ice, or gravity. Erosion can be accelerated by the activities of man and
nature.
6. GROUNDWATER: Water contained below the surface of the earth in the saturated
zone including, without limitation, all waters whether under conned, unconfined, or
perched conditions, in near surface unconsolidated sediment or regolith, or in rock
formations deeper underground.
7. ILLEGAL/ ILLICIT DISCHARGE: Any direct or indirect non-storm water
discharge to the storm drainage system, except as exempted in this chapter.
8. ILLICIT CONNECTION: Either of the following:
a. Any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or subsurface, which allows an
illegal discharge to enter the storm drain system (including any non-storm water
discharge) including wastewater, process wastewater, and wash water and any
connections to the storm drain system from indoor drains and sinks, regardless of
whether said drain or connection had been previously allowed, permitted, or
approved by the City; or,
b. Any drain or conveyance connected from a residential, commercial or industrial
land use to the storm drain system which has not been documented in plans,
maps, or equivalent records and approved by the City.
9. IMPERVIOUS SURFACE: A hard surface area which either prevents or retards the
entry of water into the ground. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not
limited to, roof tops, walkways, patios, driveways, parking lots or storage areas,
concrete or asphalt paving, gravel roads, packed earthen materials, or other surfaces
which similarly impede the natural infiltration of surface and storm water runoff.
10. MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE (MEP): A standard for water quality that
applies to all MS4 operators regulated under the NPDES program. Since no precise
definition of MEP exists, it allows for maximum flexibility on the part of MS4
operators as they develop and implement their programs to reduce the discharge of
pollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices,
control techniques and system, design and engineering methods, and such other
provisions as the Administrator or the State determines appropriate for the control of

Standards and Grading, Erosion and Sediment Control Standards.
2. Permit required: If the City determines that the grading, erosion and sediment
control plan meets the requirements of this article, the City shall issue a permit,
valid for a specified period of time that authorizes the land disturbance activity
contingent on the implementation and completion of the grading, erosion and
sediment control plan.
3. Denial: If the City determines that the grading, erosion and sediment control plan
does not meet the requirements of this article, the City shall not issue a permit for
the land disturbance activity. The grading, erosion and sediment control plan must
be resubmitted for approval before the land disturbance activity begins. No land use
and building permits may be issued until the Permittee has an approved grading,
erosion and sediment control plan.
4. Permit suspension: If the City determines that the approved plan is not being
implemented according to the schedule or the control measures are not being
properly maintained, all land use and building permits must be suspended and stop
work order issued until the Permittee has fully implemented and maintained the
control measures identified in the approved erosion and sediment control plan. (Ord.
1550, 6-4-2018)
F. Plan Implementation And Maintenance:
1. All grading should follow the approved grading, erosion and sediment control plan.
If temporary grading is needed, it should be reflected in the grading, erosion and
sediment control plan. (Ord. 1550, 6-4-2018)
2. All storm water pollution controls noted on the approved grading, erosion and
sediment control plan shall be installed before commencing the land disturbance
activity, and shall not be removed without City approval or issuance of a Certificate
of Completion. (Ord. 1550, 6-4-2018)
3. The Permittee shall be responsible for proper operation and maintenance of all
stormwater pollution controls and soil stabilization measures in conformance with
best management practices. The Permittee shall also be responsible for
maintenance, clean-up and all damages caused by flooding of the site or
surrounding area due to in-place grading, erosion and sediment control. The
foregoing responsibilities shall continue until a Certificate of Completion is issued
to the Permittee by the City for the land disturbance activity and the obligations of
the grading, erosion and sediment control permit have been satisfied. (Ord. 1550, 6-

number provided by the Permittee.
2. Failure to Do Corrective Work: If a Permittee fails to perform any corrective work or
otherwise fails to conform to any provision of this ordinance within the time stipulated,
the City may take any one or more of the following actions:
a. Issue a stop work order whereupon the Permittee shall cease all land disturbance
activity on the site until such time as the City determines the corrective measures
that are necessary to correct the conditions for which the stop work order was
issued. Once the necessary corrective actions have been determined the Permittee
shall perform the corrective work. All corrective work must be completed before
further land disturbance activity will be allowed to resume.
b. Complete the corrective work using City forces or by separate contract. The
issuance of a land disturbance permit constitutes a right-of-entry for the City or its
contractor to enter upon the construction site for the purpose of completing the

the owner from compliance with all terms of state laws and Codes and this Code
of Ordinances for as long as any units in the facility are occupied. Failure to
comply with all terms of this Chapter during the term of revocation, suspension,
or non-renewal is a misdemeanor and grounds for extension of the term of such
revocation or suspension or continuation of non-renewal, or for a decision not to
reinstate the license, notwithstanding any limitations on the period of suspension,
revocation, or non-renewal specified in the City Council’s written decision or in
paragraph 6 of this Section.
5. New License Prohibited: A property owner who has a rental license revoked
may not receive a new rental license for another property within the City for a
period of one (1) year from the date of revocation. The property owner may

in the office of the City and made available to the public as allowed or required by laws,

relief against a property owner or designated agent who fails to comply with the

welfare. A warning in substantially the foregoing language shall be printed on the
face of the rental license.

conditions and standards should be imposed relating to development of the use. The City
Council, Planning Commission, or property owner, upon receipt of the Community
Development Department’s study, may, if appropriate, initiate an amendment to the Zoning
Code/Ordinance to provide for the particular use under consideration or shall find that the
use is not compatible for development within the City.

1004.11: High Density Residential Districts (HDR-1 and HDR-2)
1004.01: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
The residential districts are designed to protect and enhance the residential character and
livability of existing neighborhoods, and to achieve a broad and flexible range of housing
choices within the community. Each residential district is designed to be consistent with the
equivalent land-use category in the Comprehensive Plan: Low-Density Residential,
Medium-Density Residential, and High-Density Residential. The districts are also intended
to meet the relevant goals of the Comprehensive Plan regarding residential land use,
housing, and neighborhoods.
1004.02: ACCESSORY BUILDINGS
A. One- and Two-Family Dwellings: The following standards apply to accessory buildings
that serve one- and two-family dwellings.
1. Number Allowed: Each principal dwelling unit is allowed up to two detached
accessory buildings for storage meeting the standards in Table 1004-1.
2. Accessory Building Performance Standards: Accessory buildings for storage totaling
1,008 square feet may be permitted if the Community Development Department
determines that three of the following performance standards have been met:
a. Matching the roof pitch to be similar to that of the principal structure;
b. Adding windows or architectural details to improve the appearance of rear and
side walls;
c. Using raised panels and other architectural detailing on garage doors;
d. Increasing side and/or rear yard setback(s); or
e. Installing landscaping to mask or soften the larger building.
Table 1004-1 Accessory building
Maximum combined storage size/area 864 square feet; up to 1,008 square feet
by meeting performance standards in
Section 1004.02A.2.
In any case, combined area of accessory
buildings shall not exceed 85% of the
Table 1004-1 Accessory building
footprint of the principal structure.
Maximum height 15 feet; 9 feet wall height a
Minimum front yard building setback 30 feetb
Minimum rear yard building setback 5 feet
Minimum side yard building setback
Interior 5 feet
Corner 10 feet d
Reverse corner Behind established building line of
principal structure
Minimum setback from any other
building or structure on the lot
5 feet
a. Notwithstanding the allowed maximum height, the height of an accessory building shall not
exceed the height of the principal structure.
b. Where the natural grade of a lot at the building line of a house is 8 feet or more above the
established street centerline, the Community Development Department may permit a detached
garage to be erected within any required yard to enable a reduction of the slope of the driveway
to as little as 10%, provided that at least one-half of the wall height is below grade level.
c. Accessory buildings containing an Accessory Dwelling Unit shall have the same rear yard
setback as required in Table 1004-3 for principal buildings.
d. The corner side yard setback requirement applies where a parcel is adjacent to a side street or
right- of-way. The required setback from an unimproved right-of-way may be reduced to the
required interior side yard setback by the Community Development Department upon the
determination by the public Works Director that the right-of-way is likely to remain
undeveloped. (Ord. 1418, 10-10-2011) (Ord. 1450, 08-12-2013) (1487, 11/20/2015) (Ord.
1530, 7-10-2017)
B. Attached and Multi-family Buildings: Attached and multi-family buildings are allowed
one storage or maintenance structure and one garden shed per complex, plus detached
garage structures as needed. Accessory buildings and sheds shall be located in rear or
side yards behind the front building line of the principal structure. Accessory buildings
and sheds shall be set back a minimum of 10 feet from rear or side lot lines and from
principal buildings.
C. Color, Design, and Materials: The exterior design and materials of an accessory storage
building greater than 120 square feet in area and/or greater than 12 feet in height shall
be similar to or compatible with those of the principal structure.
D. Driveway Required: Any accessory building used for storing one or more motorized
vehicles and/or trailers shall be served by a hard-surfaced driveway to an adjacent
public street, if any of these items are removed from the accessory building more than 2
times in a 10-day period.
E. Construction Timing: Accessory buildings shall not be constructed prior to the
construction of the principal structure on the same site.
F. Permit Required: Permits are required for all detached accessory buildings prior to
construction.
1004.03: RESIDENCE RELOCATIONS
In order to protect the character of residential neighborhoods, relocated dwellings shall meet
all standards of the zoning district where they will be located. Relocations of dwellings
require a relocation permit.
1004.04: EXISTING SETBACKS
If existing houses on 50% or more of the frontage of any block have a predominant front
yard setback less than the minimum required in this chapter, any new construction on that
block frontage may have a reduced front yard setback equal to the average front yard
setback of the two adjacent houses on the same side of the street.
1004.05: ONE AND TWO-FAMILY DESIGN STANDARDS
A. One- and Two-Family Design Standards: The standards in this section are applicable to
all one- and two-family buildings, with the exception of accessory dwelling units. The
intent of these standards is to create streets that are pleasant and inviting, and to
promote building faces which emphasize living area as the primary function of the
building or function of the residential use.
1. Garage doors shall not occupy more than 40% of the building facade (total building
front); and
2. Garage doors shall be allowed to extend forward a maximum of 5-feet from the
predominant portion of the principal use, while still required to meet the 3-=foot
principal structure front yard setback and
3. Homes with an attached garage that is set back 100 feet or more from the front
property line are exempt from meeting the requirement in “a” above, but must meet
all other requirements of Section 1004.05A (Ord. 1405, 2-28-2011) (Ord. 1470, 8-
11-2015)
B. Requirements Apply to All New Construction: On lots with physical constraints, such
as lakefront lots, where the Community Development Department determines that
compliance with these requirements is impactful, the Community Development
Department may waive the requirements and instead require design enhancements to
the garage doors to ensure that the purpose of the requirements is achieved. Design
enhancements required for garage doors where the preceding requirements cannot be
met may include such things as paint, raised panels, decorative windows, and other
similar treatments to complement the residential portion of the facade.
1004.06: MULTI-FAMILY DESIGN STANDARDS
The standards in this Section are applicable to all structures that contain three or more units.
Their intent is to encourage multi-family building design that respects its context,
incorporates some of the features of one-family dwellings within the surrounding
neighborhood, and imparts a sense of individuality rather than uniformity.
The following standards apply to new buildings and major expansions (i.e., expansions that
constitute 50% or more of building floor area). Design standards apply only to the portion of
the building or site that is undergoing alteration.
A. Orientation of Buildings to Streets: Buildings shall be oriented so that a primary
entrance faces one of the abutting streets. In the case of corner lots, a primary entrance
shall face the street from which the building is addressed. Primary entrances shall be
defined by scale and design.
B. Street-facing Facade Design: No blank walls are permitted to face public streets,
walkways, or public open space. Street-facing facades shall incorporate offsets in the
form of projections and/or recesses in the facade plane at least every 40 feet of facade
frontage. Wall offsets shall have a minimum depth of 2 feet. Open porches and
balconies are encouraged on building fronts and may extend up to 8 feet into the
required setbacks.
In addition, at least one of the following design features shall be applied on a streetfacing
facade to create visual interest:
• Dormer windows or cupolas;
• Recessed entrances;
• Covered porches or stoops;
• Bay windows with a minimum 12-inch projection from the facade plane;
• Eaves with a minimum 6 inch projection from the facade plane; or
• Changes in materials, textures, or colors.
C. Four-sided Design: Building design shall provide consistent architectural treatment on
all building walls. All sides of a building must display compatible materials, although
decorative elements and materials may be concentrated on street-facing facades. All
facades shall contain window openings.
D. Maximum Length: Building length parallel to the primary abutting street shall not
exceed 160 feet without a visual break such as a courtyard or recessed entry.
E. Landscaping of Yards: Front yards must be landscaped according to Chapter 1011,
Property Performance Standards.
F. Detached Garages: The exterior materials, design features, and roof forms of garages
shall be compatible with the principal building served.
G. Attached Garages: Garage design shall be set back and defer to the primary building
face. Front loaded garages (toward the front street), if provided shall be set back a
minimum of 5 feet from the predominant portion of the principal use. (Ord. 1405, 2-
28-2011)
H. Surface Parking: Surface parking shall not be located between a principal building front
and the abutting primary street except for drive/circulation lanes and/or handicapped
parking spaces. Surface parking adjacent to the primary street shall occupy a maximum
of 40% of the primary street frontage and shall be landscaped according to Chapter
1019, Parking and Loading Areas.
I. All exterior wall finishes on any building must be a combination of the following
materials: face brick, natural or cultured stone, textured concrete block, stucco, wood,
vinyl siding, fiber-reinforced cement board and prefinished metal, or similar materials
approved by the Community Development Department. (Ord. 1494A, 2/22/2016)

C. Improvement Area: Improvement area, including paved surfaces, the footprints of
principal and accessory buildings, and other structures like decks, pergolas, pools, etc.,
shall be limited to 50% of the parcel area. The purpose of this overall improvement area
limit is to allow for rather liberal construction on a residential property while preventing
over-building.
1. For the purposes of this section, “improvements” does not include yard ornaments,
fences, retaining walls, gardens, planting beds, or other landscaping.
2. Within this improvement area limit, impervious surfaces shall be limited to 25% of
the parcel area for parcels within a Shoreland or Wetland Management District to
mitigate surface water impacts caused by excess storm water runoff. This impervious
surface limit may be exceeded, within the allowed improvement area and in
compliance with pertinent regulations in Chapter 1017 of this Title, by receiving
approval(s) from the City Engineer to mitigate excess storm water runoff, generated
by additional hard surfaces, through technical analysis of building materials, soils,
slopes, and other site conditions.
3. Within this improvement area limit, impervious surfaces shall be limited to 30% of
the parcel area for all other parcels. The purpose of these further limits on
impervious surfaces within the overall improvement area allowance is to prevent
problems caused by excess storm water runoff. This impervious surface limit may be
exceeded, within the allowed improvement area, by receiving approval(s) from the
City Engineer to mitigate excess storm water runoff, generated by additional hard
surfaces, through technical analysis of building materials, soils, slopes, and other site
conditions.
1004.09: LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL - 2 (LDR-2) DISTRICT
A. Statement of Purpose: The LDR-2 District is designed to provide an environment of
one-family dwellings on small lots, two-family and townhouse dwellings, along with
related uses such as public services and utilities that serve the residents in the district.
The district is established to recognize existing areas with concentrations of two-family
and townhouse dwellings, and for application to areas guided for redevelopment at
densities up to 8 units per acre or with a greater diversity of housing types.

3. Within this improvement area limit, impervious surfaces shall be limited to 35% of
the parcel area for all other parcels. The purpose of these further limits on
impervious surfaces within the overall improvement area allowances is to prevent
problems caused by excess storm water runoff. This impervious surface limit may be
exceeded, within the allowed improvement area, by receiving approval(s) from the
City Engineer to mitigate excess storm water runoff, generated by additional hard
surfaces, through technical analysis of building materials, soils, slopes, and other site
conditions. (Ord. 1508 08-22-16)
D. Building Arrangement: Buildings may be organized in several ways, including the
examples in this section.
1. Arranged along the street without a common open space, as is typical for most
residential lots. Open space is provided on individual lots.
2. Arranged around a common courtyard that faces the street (see diagram), with
parking areas taking access off a shared drive to the side and rear of the buildings.
The area of the courtyard is counted towards the overall density, toward lot coverage
calculations, and as part of the lot area per unit.
3. Arranged along the street with a common open space area to the rear or side of the
buildings, as is common in townhouse and multi-family developments. The open
space area(s) for resident use is counted towards the overall density, toward lot
coverage calculations, and as part of the lot area per unit.
(Ord. 1452, 09-09-2013)
1004.10: MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (MDR) DISTRICT
A. Statement of Purpose: The MDR District is designed to provide an environment of
varied housing types at an overall density of 5 to 12 units an acre, including singlefamily
attached dwellings, small multi-family buildings, two-family and small-lot, onefamily
dwellings, along with related uses such as public services and utilities that serve
the residents in the district. The district is intended to promote flexible development
standards for new residential developments and to allow innovative development
patterns, consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.

a The City may require a greater or lesser setback based on surrounding land uses.
b. Density in the HDR-1 district may be increased to 36 units/net acre with
approved conditional use.
c. Density in the HDR-2 district may be increased to more than 36 units/net acre
with approved conditional use.
d. Building height over 45 feet and under 65 feet requires an approved conditional
use in the HDR-1
e. Building height over 65 feet requires an approved conditional use in HDR-2
(Ord. 1405, 2-28-2011) (Ord. 1511 10-24-16)
C. Building Arrangement: Buildings may be organized in several ways, including the
examples in this section:
1. Arranged along the street without a common open space. Open space is provided on
individual lots or on privately defined spaces to the rear of attached dwellings.
2. Arranged around a common courtyard that faces the street, with parking areas taking
access off a shared drive to the side and rear of the buildings. The area of the
courtyard is counted towards the overall density, toward lot coverage calculations,
and as part of the lot area per unit.
3. Arranged along the street with a common open space area to the rear or side of the
buildings, as is common in townhouse and multi-family developments. The open
space area(s) for resident use is counted towards the overall density, toward lot
coverage calculations, and as part of the lot area per unit.

(Ord. 1483, 10/26/2015)
1005.01 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
The commercial and mixed-use districts are designed to:
A. Promote an appropriate mix of commercial, office, and residential development types
within the community;
B. Provide attractive, inviting, high-quality retail shopping and service areas, mixed-use
sites, including vertical mixed-use, and medium and high-density residential projects
that are conveniently and safely accessible by multiple travel modes including vehicle,
walking, and bicycling;
C. Improve the community’s mix of land uses, including vertical mixed-use, by
encouraging mixed medium- and high-density residential uses with high quality
commercial and employment uses in designated areas. Mixed-use is a development type
that blends residential, commercial, entertainment, or other uses, where those functions
are physically and functionally integrated, and that provides pedestrian connections;
D. Encourage appropriate transitions between higher-intensity uses within commercial and
mixed use centers and adjacent lower-density residential districts; and
E. Encourage sustainable design practices that apply to buildings, private development
sites, and the public realm in order to enhance the natural environment.
(Ord. 1542 2-12-2018)
1005.02.A DESIGN STANDARDS – NON-RESIDENTIAL AND
MIXED USE PROJECTS
The following standards apply to new buildings and major expansions of existing buildings
(i.e., expansions that constitute 50% or more of building floor area), and changes in use in
all commercial and mixed-use districts. Design standards apply only to the portion of the
building or site that is undergoing alteration.
A. Corner Building Placement: At intersections, buildings shall have front and side facades
aligned at or near the front property line.
B. Entrance Orientation: Where appropriate and applicable, primary building entrances
shall be oriented to the primary abutting public street. Additional entrances may be
oriented to a secondary street or parking area. Entrances shall be clearly visible and
identifiable from the street and delineated with elements such as roof overhangs,
recessed entries, landscaping, or similar design features. (Ord. 1415, 9-12-2011)
C. Vertical Facade Articulation: Buildings shall be designed with a base, a middle, and a
top, created by variations in detailing, color, and materials. A single-story building need
not include a middle.
1. The base of the building should include elements that relate to the human scale,
including doors and windows, texture, projections, awnings, and canopies.
2. Articulated building tops may include varied rooflines, cornice detailing, dormers,
gable ends, stepbacks of upper stories, and similar methods.
D. Horizontal Facade Articulation: Facades greater than 40 feet in length shall be visually
articulated into smaller intervals of 20 to 40 feet by one or a combination of the
following techniques:
1. Stepping back or extending forward a portion of the facade;
2. Variations in texture, materials or details;
3. Division into storefronts;
4. Stepbacks of upper stories; or
5. Placement of doors, windows and balconies.
E. Window and Door Openings:
1. For nonresidential uses, windows, doors, or other openings shall comprise at least
60% of the length and at least 40% of the area of any ground floor facade fronting a
public street. At least 50% of the windows shall have the lower sill within three feet
of grade.
2. For nonresidential uses, windows, doors, or other openings shall comprise at least
20% of side and rear ground floor facades not fronting a public street. On upper
stories, windows or balconies shall comprise at least 20% of the facade area.
3. On residential facades, windows, doors, balconies, or other openings shall comprise
at least 20% of the facade area.
4. Glass on windows and doors shall be clear or slightly tinted to allow views in and
out of the interior. Spandrel (translucent) glass may be used on service areas.
5. Window shape, size, and patterns shall emphasize the intended organization and
articulation of the building facade.
6. Displays may be placed within windows. Equipment within buildings shall be placed
at least 5 feet behind windows.
F. Materials: All exterior wall finishes on any building must be a combination of the
following materials: No less than 60% face brick; natural or cultured stone; pre-colored
or factory stained or stained on site textured pre-cast concrete panels; textured concrete
block; stucco; glass; fiberglass; or similar materials and no more than 40% pre-finished
metal, cor-ten steel, copper, premium grade wood with mitered outside corners (e.g.,
cedar redwood, and fir), or fiber cement board. Under no circumstances shall sheet
metal aluminum, corrugated aluminum, asbestos, iron plain or painted, or plain concrete
block be acceptable as an exterior wall material on buildings within the city. Other
materials of equal quality to those listed, may be approved by the Community
Development Department.
G. Four-sided Design: Building design shall provide consistent architectural treatment on
all building walls. All sides of a building must display compatible materials, although
decorative elements and materials may be concentrated on street-facing facades. All
facades shall contain window openings. This standard may be waived by the
Community Development Department for uses that include elements such as service
bays on one or more facades.
H. Maximum Building Length: Building length parallel to the primary abutting street shall
not exceed 200 feet without a visual break such as a courtyard or recessed entry, except
where a more restrictive standard is specified for a specific district.
I. Garages Doors and Loading Docks: Overhead doors, refuse, recyclables, and/or
compactors shall be located, and to the extent feasible, on rear or side facades that do
not front a public street, to the extent feasible, residential garage doors should be
similarly located. Overhead doors of attached residential garages on a building front
shall not exceed 50% of the total length of the building front. Where overhead doors,
refuse, recyclables, and/or compactors abut a public street frontage, a masonry screen
wall comprised of materials similar to the building, or as approved by the Community
Development Department, shall be installed to a minimum height to screen all activities.

elevators, shall be completely screened from eye level view from contiguous properties
and adjacent streets. Such equipment shall be screened with parapets or other materials
similar to and compatible with exterior materials and architectural treatment on the
structure being served. Horizontal or vertical slats of wood material shall not be utilized
for this purpose. Solar and wind energy equipment is exempt from this provision if
screening would interfere with system operations.
(Ord. 1435, 4-08-2013) (Ord. 1494A, 2/22/2016)
SECTION 3. §1005.02, Design Standards is further amended as follows:
1005.02.B DESIGN STANDARDS – Multi-Family Projects
The standards in this Section are applicable to all structures that contain three or more units.
Their intent is to encourage multi-family building design that respects its context,
incorporates some of the features of one family dwellings within the surrounding
neighborhood, and imparts a sense of individuality rather than uniformity.
The following standards apply to new buildings, major expansions (i.e., expansions that
constitute 50% or more of building floor area), and changes in use. Design standards apply
only to the portion of the building or site that is undergoing alteration.
A. Orientation of Buildings to Streets: Buildings shall be oriented so that a primary
entrance faces one of the abutting streets. In the case of corner lots, a primary entrance
shall face the street from which the building is addressed. Primary entrances shall be
defined by scale and design.
B. Street-facing Facade Design: No blank walls are permitted to face public streets,
walkways, or public open space. Street-facing facades shall incorporate offsets in the
form of projections and/or recesses in the facade plane at least every 40 feet of facade
frontage. Wall offsets shall have a minimum depth of 2 feet. Open porches and
balconies are encouraged on building fronts and may extend up to 5 feet into the
required setbacks. In addition, at least one of the following design features shall be
applied on a street-facing facade to create visual interest:
• Dormer windows or cupolas;
• Recessed entrances;
• Covered porches or stoops;
• Bay windows with a minimum 12-inch projection from the facade plane;
• Eaves with a minimum 6 inch projection from the facade plane; or
• Changes in materials, textures, or colors.
C. Four-sided Design: Building design shall provide consistent architectural treatment on
all building walls. All sides of a building must display compatible materials, although
decorative elements and materials may be concentrated on street-facing facades. All
facades shall contain window openings.
D. Maximum Length: Building length parallel to the primary abutting street shall not
exceed 160 feet without a visual break such as a courtyard or recessed entry.
E. Landscaping of Yards: Front yards must be landscaped according to Chapter 1011,
Property Performance Standards.
F. Detached Garages: The exterior materials, design features, and roof forms of garages
shall be compatible with the principal building served.
G. Attached Garages: Garage design shall be set back and defer to the primary building
face. Front loaded garages (toward the front street), if provided shall be set back a
minimum of 5 feet from the predominant portion of the principal use. (Ord. 1405, 2-28-
2011)
H. Surface Parking: Surface parking shall not be located between a principal building front
and the abutting primary street except for drive/circulation lanes and/or handicapped
parking spaces. Surface parking adjacent to the primary street shall occupy a maximum
of 40% of the primary street frontage and shall be landscaped according to Chapter
1019, Parking and Loading Areas.
I. Exterior Wall Finishes: All exterior wall finishes on any building must be a
combination of the following materials: face brick, natural or cultured stone, textured
concrete block, stucco, wood, vinyl, siding, fiber-reinforced cement board and
prefinished metal, or similar materials approved by the Community Development
Department. (Ord. 1494A, 2-22-2016)
(Ord. 1542 2-12-2018)

E. Frontage Requirement: A development must utilize one or more of the three options
below for placement of buildings and parking relative to the primary street:
1. At least 50% of the street frontage shall be occupied by building facades placed
within 20 feet of the front lot line. No off-street parking shall be located between the
facades meeting this requirement and the street.
2. At least 60% of the street frontage shall be occupied by building facades placed
within 65 feet of the front lot line. Only 1 row of parking and a drive aisle may be
placed within this setback area.
3. At least 70% of the street frontage shall be occupied by building facades placed
within 85 feet of the front lot line. Only 2 rows of parking and a drive aisle may be
placed within this setback area.
F. Access and Circulation: Within shopping centers or other large development sites,
vehicular circulation shall be designed to minimize conflicts with pedestrians.
G. Surface Parking: Surface parking on large development sites shall be divided into

walkways leading to building entrances.
H. Standards for Nighttime Activities: Uses that involve deliveries or other activities
between the hours of 10:00 P.M. and 7:00 A.M. (referred to as “nighttime hours”) shall
meet the following standards:
1. Off-street loading and unloading during nighttime hours shall take place within a
completely enclosed and roofed structure with the exterior doors shut at all times.
2. Movement of sweeping vehicles, garbage trucks, maintenance trucks, shopping carts,
and other service vehicles and equipment is prohibited during nighttime hours within
300 feet of a residential district, except for emergency vehicles and emergency utility
or maintenance activities.
3. Snow removal within 300 feet of a residential district shall be minimized during
nighttime hours, consistent with the required snow management plan.
1005.07 COMMUNITY MIXED-USE (CMU) DISTRICTS
A. Statement of Purpose: The Community Mixed-Use Districts are designed to encourage
the development or redevelopment of mixed-use centers that may include residential,
office, commercial, park, civic and institutional, utility and transportation, park, and
open space uses. Complementary uses should be organized into cohesive districts in
which mixed- or single-use buildings are connected by streets, sidewalks and trails, and
open space to create a pedestrian-oriented environment. The CMU districts are intended
to be applied to areas of the City guided for redevelopment and may represent varying
degrees of intensification with respect to land use, hours of operation, or building
height.
1. The CMU-1 District is the most restrictive mixed-use district, limiting building
height and excluding the most intensive land uses, and is intended for application to
redevelopment areas adjacent to low-density residential neighborhoods.
2. The CMU-2 District is less restrictive, being open to a wider variety of land uses and
building height, and is intended to provide transition from higher-density
development to parks and other natural areas.
3. The CMU-3 District is intended for moderate intensity development, suitable for
transitions between higher and lower intensity districts.
4. The CMU-4 District is a more intensive mixed-use district, intended for areas close
to high-traffic roadways and large-scale commercial developments.
B. Regulating Plan: CMU districts must be guided by a regulating plan for each location
where it is applied. A regulating plan uses graphics and text to establish requirements
pertaining to the following kinds of parameters. Where the requirements for an area
governed by a regulating plan are in conflict with the design standards established in
Section 1005.02 of this Title, the requirements of the regulating plan shall supersede,
and where the requirements for an area governed by a regulating plan are silent, Section
1005.02 shall control.
1. Street and Block Layout: The regulating plan defines blocks and streets based on
existing and proposed street alignments. New street alignments, where indicated, are
intended to identify general locations and required connections but not to constitute
preliminary or final engineering.
2. Street Type: The regulating plan may include specific street design standards to
illustrate typical configurations for streets within the district, or it may use existing
City street standards. Private streets may be utilized within the CMU districts where
defined as an element of a regulating plan.
3. Parking
a. Locations: Locations where surface parking may be located are specified by
block or block face. Structured parking is treated as a building type.

1009.01: ADMINISTRATIVE DEVIATION
A. Purpose: Administrative deviations are intended to encourage owners of residential
properties in LDR-1 or LDR-2 Districts to modernize and improve their properties
while maintaining the overall character of the community. This is accomplished by
allowing limited encroachments into certain required building and driveway setbacks
and/or limited increases in fence height.
B. Exceptions: If any part of a proposal does not meet the requirements for administrative
deviation as established in this section, the entire proposal shall be ineligible for
administrative deviation approval; all deviations greater than what is described in this
section shall adhere to the variance procedure established in Section 1009.04. If the
entrance to a driveway with a nonconforming setback is reconstructed as part of a
public improvement project or any other public action but is not closer than 2 feet from
an interior side property line, the Community Development Department may approve a
driveway setback deviation without adhering to the procedure described in Subsection
D below.
C. Limitations by Category of Administrative Deviation:
1. Building Setback Deviation: A building setback deviation is a reduction of the
required front, rear, interior side, and/or reverse-corner side yard setbacks for
principal and/or accessory buildings. A building setback deviation shall not allow the
encroachment of a building into public easements or required standard-corner side
yard setbacks.
a. A building setback deviation shall not be allowed for a principal building less
than 20 years old. Age of a principal building is calculated by subtracting the
year in which the building was constructed from the year of application for
administrative deviation. Notwithstanding this age limitation, building setback
deviations may be considered for newer homes which cannot be practically used
by mobility-impaired occupants.
b. A building setback deviation shall not allow principal building setbacks of less
than 24 feet from front or rear property lines
c. A building setback deviation shall not allow a principal building setback of less
than 3 feet from an interior side property line.
d. A building setback deviation may allow principal buildings to extend toward a
reverse-corner side property line as far as 70 feet from the opposite, interior side
property line, provided that the reverse-corner side setback shall not be less than
15 feet. A building setback deviation from a reverse-corner side property line
shall not be allowed on parcels created/subdivided after January 1, 2011.
e. A building setback deviation shall not allow an accessory building to be closer
than 3 feet to a rear or interior side property line nor closer to a reverse-corner
side property line than the principal building.
2. Driveway Setback Deviation: A driveway setback deviation is a reduction of the
required interior side yard setback for driveways and parking/turnaround areas.
a. A driveway setback deviation shall not allow encroachments into the required
setback of a driveway at the property line from corner side property lines
established in Chapter 703 of the Code.
b. A driveway setback deviation shall not allow a driveway or parking area/
turnaround setback less than 2 feet from an interior side property line.
c. A driveway setback deviation shall not allow a driveway or parking area/
turnaround setback less than 10 feet from a corner side property line.
3. Fence Height Deviation: A fence height deviation is an increase of the required fence
height limit to allow for better screening and/or noise reduction adjacent to highway
rights-of-way, busy commercial areas, or other unusual properties. A fence height
deviation shall not allow fences in excess of 8 feet in height.
D. Administrative Deviation Approval Process: The owner of property on which an
administrative deviation is proposed shall file an application for approval of the
administrative deviation by paying the fee set forth in Chapter 314 of this Code and
submitting a completed application form and supporting documents as set forth on the
application form. Complete applications shall be reviewed according to the process
established in this section.
1. Hearing and Notification: The Community Development Department shall schedule
an administrative hearing with the Administrative Deviation Committee (ADC) to
consider the application. The applicant and contiguous property owners shall be
notified in writing by the Community Development Department of the time and
place of the administrative hearing not less than 5 days prior to such hearing. All
property owners receiving notification of the administrative hearing shall be invited
to comment on the proposed project and to attend the hearing.
2. Review of Application: During the administrative hearing described above, the ADC
shall review applications for administrative deviation and provide recommendations
pertaining to the approval or denial of the request; the Community Development
Department may request additional review of applications from other City
departments or public agencies.
3. Decision: After considering any public input and the recommendations of the above
parties, the Community Development Department shall have the authority to approve
or deny administrative deviation applications.
4. Appeal: No permits shall be issued for a project requiring an administrative deviation
before the expiration of a mandatory 10-day appeal period beginning on the date of
the decision of the Community Development Department; notwithstanding the
following provisions, appeals of this decision shall adhere to the process established
in Section 1009.08.
a. Appeals may be made by the original applicant or those property owners notified
of the administrative hearing pursuant to Subsection D1 above.
b. If all of those property owners notified of the administrative hearing pursuant to
Subsection D1 above indicate to the Community Development Department that
they will not appeal the decision, the appeal period may be waived.
E. Considerations for Approval:
1. Building Setback Deviation: In addition to other requirements of this section, the
ADC shall consider the following factors prior to recommending approval or denial
of a building setback deviation:
a. The affect of the proposed project on the functional use of the property;
b. The affect of the proposed project on the enclosed storage on the property;
c. The propensity of the proposed project to create or exacerbate a drainage
problem;
d. Whether the proposed building mass would be consistent with that on contiguous
properties;
e. The proper scaling and integration of a new roof with the existing roof of the
principal building on the property;
f. The affect of the proposed project on the aesthetic quality of the property;
g. Whether the existing garage space on the property accommodates more than one
vehicle; and
h. Whether the proposed project places more vehicles adjacent to first floor
bedrooms on contiguous properties.
2. Driveway Setback Deviation: In addition to other requirements of this section, the
ADC shall consider the following factors prior to recommending approval or denial
of a driveway setback deviation:
a. The intended use of the proposed driveway or driveway expansion;
b. The proximity of the proposed driveway to bedrooms on adjacent properties;
c. The potential for the proposed driveway to cause storm water problems on
adjacent properties;
d. The aesthetic impact of the proposed driveway; and
e. The incorporation of landscaping and/or fencing to screen the proposed driveway
from adjacent properties.
3. Fence Height Deviation: In addition to other requirements of this section, the ADC
shall consider the unique circumstances surrounding an applicant’s property prior to
recommending approval or denial of a fence height deviation.
F. Additional Conditions of Approval: The Community Development Department may
add conditions to an administrative deviation approval in order to mitigate the impact(s)
of a reduced building or driveway setback on adjacent properties. The Administrative
Deviation Review Committee may recommend such conditions but such conditions
shall be imposed or remitted at the discretion of the Community Development
Department.
1009.02 CONDITIONAL USES
A. Purpose: Several land uses and structures have been designated as conditional uses in
certain zoning districts; the purpose of the conditional use review process is to ensure

to City-owned land in a Park and Recreation District, the proposed conditional use shall
be reviewed for recommendation by the Parks and Recreation Commission prior to
submission of an application for approval. Complete applications shall be reviewed in a
public hearing before the Planning Commission and acted upon by the City Council
according to the process set forth in Chapter 108 of this Code. If a proposed conditional
use is denied, an application for substantially the same conditional use on the same
property shall not be accepted within 1 year of the date of the denial.

1009.03 INTERIM USES
A. Purpose: Certain land uses might not be consistent with the land uses designated in the
Comprehensive Land Use Plan, and they might also fail to meet all of the zoning
standards established for the district within which they are proposed; some such land
uses may, however, be acceptable or even beneficial if reviewed and provisionally
approved for a limited period of time. The purpose of the interim use review process is
to allow the approval of interim uses on a case-by-case basis; approved interim uses
shall have a definite end date and may be subject to specific conditions considered
reasonable and/or necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
B. Open House Meeting: Prior to submitting an application for a proposed interim use, an
applicant shall hold a community open house meeting as described in Section 1009.07
of this Title.
C. Applications: The owner of property on which an interim use is proposed shall file an
application for approval of the interim use by paying the fee set forth in Chapter 314 of
this Code and submitting a completed application form and supporting documents as set
forth on the application form. Complete applications shall be reviewed in a public
hearing before the Planning Commission and acted upon by the City Council according
to the process set forth in Chapter 108. If a proposed interim use is denied, an
application for substantially the same interim use on the same property shall not be
accepted within 1 year of the date of the denial.
D. General Standards and Criteria: When approving a proposed interim use, the Planning
Commission and City Council shall make the following findings:
1. The proposed use will not impose additional costs on the public if it is necessary for
the public to take the property in the future;
2. The proposed use will not create an excessive burden on parks, streets, and other
public facilities; and
3. The proposed use will not be injurious to the surrounding neighborhood or otherwise
harm the public health, safety, and general welfare.
E. Expiration: An interim use approval shall expire and an approved interim use shall
cease, at the earliest of:
1. 5 years from the date of the approval;
2. Upon the expiration date established in the approval; or
3. Upon reaching some other expiration threshold established as a condition of
approval.
F. Renewals: If an approved interim use is to be continued beyond the date of its
expiration or if an expired interim use is to be reinstated, an applicant shall follow the
above process for seeking a new interim use approval. Notwithstanding this
requirement, the City Council may approve extensions to the expiration of an approved
interim use when:
1. The approved interim use has not yet commenced; and
2. The duration of the approved interim use is not to exceed 3 months.
To request an extension under these circumstances, applicants shall submit to the
Community Development Department a written request including an explanation of the
factor(s) which necessitate the extension. Within 30 days of receipt of such a request,
the matter shall be brought to the City Council for action.
1009.04 VARIANCES:
A. Purpose: Each zoning classification indicates specific development standards such as
setback and height restrictions. There are occasions, however, when the strict
application of such standards may be inappropriate because of unique circumstances to
the property. The variance procedure is authorized by MN Stat. 462.357, subd. 6 and is
designed to permit adjustment to the zoning regulations where there are practical
difficulties applying to a parcel of land or building that prevent the property from being
used to the extent intended by the zoning. Unique circumstances may include factors
such as the size, shape, topography, vegetation, wetlands, or other such characteristics
of the land. Variances should not be granted to residential density standards or type of
use. (Ord. 1413, 7-18-2011)
B. Applications: The owner of property on which a variance is proposed shall file an
application for approval of the variance by paying the fee set forth in Chapter 314 of
this Code and submitting a completed application form and supporting documents as set
forth on the application form. Complete applications shall be reviewed in a public
hearing according to the process set forth in Chapter 108 of this Code. If a proposed
variance is denied, an application for substantially the same variance on the same
property shall not be accepted within 1 year of the date of the denial. (Ord. 1413, 7-18-
2011)
C. Approval: The City may impose conditions in the granting of variances. A condition
must be directly related to, and must bear a rough proportionality to, the impact created
by the variance. In order to approve a variance request, the Variance Board shall find
based on the application submitted:
1. The proposal is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan;
2. The proposal is in harmony with the purposes and intent of the zoning ordinances;
3. The proposal puts the subject property to use in a reasonable manner;
4. There are unique circumstances to the property which were not created by the
landowner; and
5. The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality.. (Ord.
1413, 7-18-2011)
D. Validation and Expiration: A variance approval shall be validated by the applicant
through the commencement of any necessary construction (subject to the permit
requirements of Title 9 of this Code) authorized by the variance within 1 year of the
date of the approval. A variance approval shall automatically expire if the approval is
not validated pursuant this section. Notwithstanding this time limitation, the Variance
Board may approve extensions of the time allowed for validation of the variance
approval if requested in writing by the applicant; extension requests shall be submitted
to the Community Development Department and shall identify the reason(s) why the
extension is necessary along with an anticipated timeline for validation of the variance
approval.
1009.05 CHANGES TO APPROVED PLANS:
A. Purpose: To provide flexibility in responding to development constraints which were
unanticipated during the review of proposals requiring development approval (e.g.,
conditional use, variance, etc.) by allowing administrative approval of minor changes to
the approved location, size, and/or type of site improvements.
B. Minor Changes: The Community Development Department may approve such minor
changes upon review by the Development Review Committee to ensure that the
proposed changes neither cause any aspect of the project to fail to comply with
applicable Code requirements nor materially change any important representations
made to the City and surrounding residents during the original review and approval
process.
C. Major Changes: If the Development Review Committee determines that a proposed
change cannot be considered as a minor change, such change may be considered either
as an amendment to the original plan or as a new proposal; in either case, the applicant
shall follow the process established in this Title for seeking a new approval of the
appropriate type.
1009.06 ZONING CHANGES
A. Amendment: An Amendment to a Zoning Ordinance or map (“Official Zoning Map”)
may be initiated by the governing body (City Council), the planning agency (including
the Community Development Department), a property owner, or by petition of affected
property owners as defined in the City’s Zoning Ordinance. The purpose of the zoning
change review process is to consider such changes for approval where they would be
consistent with the guidance and intent of the Comprehensive Plan and would not be
injurious to the public health, safety, and general welfare.
B. Open House Meeting: Prior to submitting an application for a proposed zoning map
change, an applicant shall hold a community open house meeting as described in
Section 1009.07 of this Title.
C. Applications: The owner of property on which a zoning change is proposed shall file an
application for approval of the zoning change by paying the fee set forth in Chapter 314
of this Code and submitting a completed application form and supporting documents as
set forth on the application form. Complete applications shall be reviewed in a public
hearing before the Planning Commission and acted upon by the City Council according
to the process set forth in Chapter 108. If a proposed zoning change is denied, an
application for substantially the same zoning change on the same property shall not be
accepted within 1 year of the date of the denial.
D. Petitions: A petition containing the signatures of at least 50% of the property owners
within the public hearing notification area for a particular piece of property may be
submitted as an application for approval of a zoning change when none of the
petitioners is the owner of said property.
Such an application-by-petition, along with a letter detailing the reasons for the
requested zoning change, and the fee set forth in Chapter 314 of this Code, shall be
submitted to the Community Development Department and shall be reviewed according
the same process as established in Subsection C above, including a petitioner-sponsored
open house meeting for a proposed zoning map change as required in Subsection B
above.
1009.07 DEVELOPER OPEN HOUSE MEETINGS
A. Purpose: Certain proposals or applications for development may constitute significant
departures from the present or historical use and/or zoning of a property. Prior to
submitting an application for a Comprehensive Plan Map Change, a Zoning Map
Change, an Interim Use, a Subdivision Plat, or a Planned Unit Development an
applicant shall hold an open house meeting with property owners and renters in the
vicinity of the potential development location in order to provide a convenient forum
for engaging community members in the development process, to describe the proposal
in detail, and to answer questions and solicit feedback.
Applicant Responsibility: The applicant shall be responsible for the following items:
? Completed Open House Form (application)
? Payment of fee and escrow
? Provision of applicable information regarding the project/request
? Provision of the open house location, date, and time
? Required submittal of open house summary upon conclusion of meeting
General: Applicant shall refer to the Open House Meeting Policy that is a component of the
Open House Form (application) or contact the Community Development Department
for additional information regarding the process.
No later than the date of submission of the application the applicant/developer shall be
responsible for mailing a copy of the meeting summary ot all attendees who provided
their names and addresses on the sign-in sheet.
1009.08 APPEALS
A. An appeal pertaining to a decision of the Variance Board or an administrative ruling of
the Community Development Department regarding any interpretation of the intent of

action that is the subject of the appeal. New or additional information from the appeals
applicant(s) may be considered by the Board of Adjustments and Appeals at its sole
discretion, if that information serves to clarify information previously considered by the
Variance Board and/or staff.

SIGN REGULATIONS
SECTON:
1010.01: Purpose and Findings
1010.02: Definitions
1010.03: General Provisions
1010.04: Maintenance, Removal of Signs, Fines
1010.05: On-Premise Signs
1010.06: Sign Area Computation

1010.10: Dynamic Displays
1010.11: Master Sign Plans
1010.01: PURPOSE AND FINDINGS:
A. Purpose: The sign ordinance is intended to establish a comprehensive and balanced
system of sign control that accommodates the need for a well-maintained, safe, and
attractive community, and the need for effective communications including business
identification. It is the intent of this section to promote the health, safety, general
welfare, aesthetics, and image of the community by regulating signs that are intended
to communicate to the public, and to use signs that meet the City's goals by
authorizing:
1. Permanent signs that establish a high standard of aesthetics;
2. Signs that are compatible with their surroundings;
3. Signs that are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained in a manner that
does not adversely impact public safety or unduly distract motorists;
4. Signs that are large enough to convey the intended message and to help citizens
find their way to intended destinations;
5. Signs that are proportioned to the scale of, and are architecturally compatible
with, principal structures;
6. Permanent signs that give preference to the on-premise owner or occupant; and
7. Temporary commercial signs and advertising displays which provide an
opportunity for grand openings and occasional sales events while restricting
signs which create continuous visual clutter and hazards at public right-of-way
intersections.
B. Findings: The City of Roseville finds it is necessary for the promotion and
preservation of the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the community
that the construction, location, size, and maintenance of signs be controlled. Further,
the City finds that:
1. Permanent and temporary signs have a direct impact on and relationship to the
image of the community;
2. The manner of installation, location, and maintenance of signs affects the public
health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the community;
3. An opportunity for viable identification of community businesses and institutions
must be established;
4. The safety of motorists, cyclists, pedestrians, and other users of public streets and
property is affected by the number, size, location, and appearance of signs that
divert the attention of drivers;
5. Installation of signs suspended from, projecting over, or placed on the tops of
buildings, walks, or other structures may constitute a hazard during periods of
high winds and an obstacle to effective fire-fighting and other emergency
service;
6. Uncontrolled and unlimited signs adversely impact the image and aesthetic
attractiveness of the community and thereby undermine economic value and
growth;
7. Uncontrolled and unlimited signs, particularly temporary signs that are
commonly located within or adjacent to public right-of-way or are located at
driveway/street intersections, result in roadside clutter and obstruction of views
of oncoming traffic. This creates a hazard to drivers and pedestrians and also
adversely impacts a logical flow of information;
8. Commercial signs are generally incompatible with residential uses and should be
strictly limited in residential zoning districts; and
9. The right to express noncommercial opinions in any zoning district must be
protected, subject to reasonable restrictions on size, height, location, and number.

pictorial imager, or depict action or a special effect to imitate movement, or the
presentation of pictorials or graphics displayed in a progression of frames that
give the illusion of motion or the illusion of moving objects, moving patterns, or
bands of light or expanding or contracting shapes.
7. Time and Temperature: A display of time, date, and temperature must remain for
at least 60 seconds before changing to a different display. However,
individually, the time, date, or temperature information may change no more
often than once every 10 seconds.
1010.11: MASTER SIGN PLANS
A. Purpose: The purpose of a Master Sign Plan is to establish a fair and equitable
process for complex signage situations that accommodate the need for a wellmaintained,
safe, and attractive community, and the need for effective
communications including business identification.
B. Effect of Master Sign Plan: Upon approval of a Master Sign Plan, all future signs
shall conform to the Master Sign Plan. Modifications to the provisions of the Master
Sign Plan may be granted only with the approval of an amended Master Sign Plan.
C. Required: A Master Sign Plan is required for:
1. Building complexes

shall be used as the minimum base standard for signage in the proposed Master Sign
Plan.
E. Criteria: To assist property owners and their tenants with signage needs, the City has
established the following criteria that shall be used in developing, reviewing, and
approving each Master Sign Plan.
1. Location: No freestanding sign shall be located closer than five feet to a property
line, roadway easement, or other public easement. No freestanding sign shall be
erected that, by reason of position, shape, or color, would interfere in any way
with the proper functioning or purpose of a traffic sign or signal. No freestanding
sign shall be located within the Traffic Visibility Triangle. No freestanding sign
shall impede/impair traffic.
2. Quality: All signage shall improve the aesthetics or functional use of the site. All
freestanding signs shall include materials that complement the architectural
design/existing building materials, including but not limited to face brick, natural
or cut stone, integrally colored concrete masonry units/rock faced block, glass,
pre-finished metal stucco or similar cementation coating, and/or factory finished
metal panels. Landscaping may be integrated into any freestanding sign.
3. Type: All types of signs are permitted except those prohibited by Section
1010.03C of this Chapter.

2 times the maximum allowed under Section 1010.05 of this Chapter
5. Height: The height of any free standing sign shall be limited to 40 feet.
6. Number: The number of freestanding signs shall be reasonably related to the
number of access points to public streets and/or the number of tenants within the
multi-tenant structure.
F. Master Sign Plan Process: The following has been established by the City of
Roseville for reviewing and approving Master Sign Plans:
1. Application Requirements: The property owner, his/her agent/manager, a design,
architectural, or consulting firm, or a sign company, acting on behalf thereof,
shall submit a completed Master Sign Plan Application to the Community
Development Department. A completed application includes completion of the
application form, submittal of all applicable proposed plans and specifications,
and the submittal of the required fee as set-forth in Chapter 314 of this Code.
2. Submittal Review: Upon submittal of a Master Sign Plan application, the
Community Development Department will review the information provided for
completeness and determine whether modifications and/or clarification is
necessary. Once an application has been determined complete, the Community
Development Department will set the administrative hearing before the Master
Sign Plan Committee (MSPC).
3. Establishment of Administrative Hearing and Notice: The Community
Development Department will provide notice (postcard) to the applicant and
contiguous/effected property owners not less than one week prior to a Master
Sign Plan hearing. The Community Development Department may notify
additional property owners if a determination is made that such additional
notification is merited.
4. Hearing and Approval: The MSPC shall hold an administrative hearing for each
Master Sign Plan proposal, take public comment, and provide a recommendation
to the Community Development Director or Designee for approval. The
Community Development Director or Designee shall make the final decision and
provide written approval of a Master Sign Plan to the applicant.
G. Appeal: Should the applicant or a contiguous property owner object to the
Community Development Director or Designee decision on the Master Sign Plan, an

features such as xeriscaping, raingardens/bioswales, rooftop gardens, native
landscapes, integrated pedestrian facilities, and public art. To encourage the use of
these special design features the city acknowledges a degree of flexibility may be
necessary to adjust to unique situations. This subsection provides such flexibility and
presents alternative ways to meet the standards set for in this section. The
alternatives provided below are discretionary and are subject to approval of the
Community Development Department, unless the development application requires
approval by the City Council, in which case the City Council shall approve the

site maintenance plan approved by the Community Development Department.
Plantings which have died shall be promptly replaced in accordance with a
landscape plan approved by the City for the site.
9. Security:
a. Landscape Security Required: Prior to the issuance of a building permit for all
projects requiring approval of a landscape plan, the developer, contractor, or
property owner shall deposit a security with the City to guarantee compliance
with and to indemnify the City for any expenses incurred in enforcing the
requirements of this Section.
i. One- and Two-family Dwellings: Landscape security for detached or attached
one- or two-family dwellings shall be a cash escrow in the amount of
$500.00.
ii. All Other Uses: Landscape security for all uses except detached or attached
one- or two-family dwellings shall be in a form approved by the Community
Development Department and shall be equal to 125% of the estimated cost
necessary to furnish and plant the required landscaping and any ancillary
screening improvements such as fencing. The estimated cost shall be subject
to approval by the City. If the estimated cost submitted by the developer to
the City is not approved by the City, the City shall have the exclusive right to
determine the estimated cost.
b. Landscape Inspection: The developer, contractor, or property owner shall request
an inspection after the required landscaping has been installed. The Community
Development Department will perform the inspection and determine compliance
with the approved landscape plan.
c. Releasing the Security: Upon the determination by the Community Development
Department that a landscape installation is consistent with landscape
requirements and approved plans, the security shall be released to the developer,
contractor, or property owner according to the requirements below.
i. One- and Two-family Dwellings: A required security shall be released upon
the successful inspection of the landscape installation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no portion of the security shall be released while there are
unsatisfied obligations.
ii. All Other Uses: The landscape security for all uses except detached or
attached one- or two-family dwellings shall be held by the Community
Development Department for a minimum of 2 full years beginning upon the
successful inspection of the landscape installation. A reduction can be sought
after the first year and after an inspection is requested by the developer,
contractor, or property owner. If the Community Development Department
determines that the landscape is established appropriately, a portion of the
security may be released. That part of the security which has not been
released at the end of the first year shall be retained and shall secure the
remaining obligation to replant trees which are not alive or are unhealthy at
the end of the year and to replant missing trees. The entire security may be
released 1 year after the replanting of such trees has been satisfactorily
completed and the City has certified that those replacement trees are alive
and healthy. To be certified as alive and healthy, all of the following
conditions must exist:
--No tree shall have sustained mechanical injury to the trunk of a tree
causing loss of more than 30% of the bark circumference of the tree at
any location along the tree’s trunk.
--No tree shall have had soil compacted to 6 inches deep over more
than 30% of its root zone.
--No tree shall have had more than 30% of its roots cut for the
installation of any utility or for any other purpose.
--No more than 25% of the crown of a tree shall consist of dead
branches.
d. None of a security shall be released until the developer’s, contractor’s, property
owner’s obligations to indemnify the City for any expenses incurred in enforcing
the requirements of this Section are satisfied.
10. Penalties for Violation: Any tree that is visibly damaged, has a root system that has
been driven on, or has a root zone in which the soil has been compacted in any way,
shall be replaced in accordance to the tree replacement formula found in Section
1011.04G. Also, any person who is not authorized by the City who removes any tree
from any public property without first obtaining a permit and any person who fails to
replace trees in the manner provided in this subsection shall, in addition to the
criminal penalties prescribed by law, be required to pay to the City the estimated cost
of tree replacement in the amount determined by the City. Upon determination that
this has occurred, the City shall submit a bill for the amount of tree replacement. If
that amount is not received by the City within 90 days, such amount shall be
assessed as a special assessment on any land located in the City owned by the person
violating this Section.
B. Buffer Area Screening: The setback requirements established for uses in each district
are intended to act as buffers between those districts and uses, but heightened screening
is appropriate between low-density residential dwellings and more intensive uses. For
all new construction in all districts that lie adjacent to or across the street from LDR
Districts, therefore, additional screening shall be implemented as required herein.
1. Exception: The requirements in this subsection shall be applied in addition to the
preceding general landscaping requirements, except that they shall not apply to Low
Density Residential or Park and Recreation Districts.
2. Acceptable Screening: Screening requirements of this Title shall be satisfied through
the use of buildings, berms, solid board-on-board fences, walls, planting screens,
evergreen trees, hedges, or some combination thereof. If the topography, existing
vegetation, permanent structure, or other feature creates a barrier which achieves the
standards of this section, they may be substituted.
a. Screen Fences and Walls: Any screen fence or wall shall be constructed of
attractive, permanent finished materials, compatible with those used in the
construction of the principal structure. Such screens shall be at least 6 feet in
height and shall be 100% opaque.
b. Planted Screening: Any planting screens shall consist of healthy plants, shall be
at least 6 feet in height, and shall be designed to provide a minimum year round
opacity of 80% at the time of installation.
c. Notwithstanding these requirements, screening along street rights-of-way shall be
maintained at a height not less than 3 feet nor more than 4 feet.
3. Maintenance: Screen fences and walls which are in disrepair shall be promptly
repaired. Planted screens shall be maintained according to the normal landscape
maintenance requirement of Section 1011.03A8
C. Parking Lot Landscape: Off street parking lots with more than 25 parking stalls shall
contain interior landscaped islands. Such islands shall be bounded by a raised concrete
curb or approved equivalent and shall contain mulch to retain soil moisture. Turf grass
is permitted within landscaped areas located around the periphery of a parking lot.
1. Islands are required at the end of each row of cars, where it abuts vehicle circulation
aisles or driveways, or every 15 stalls, whichever is less.
2. Islands shall be provided to separate pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
3. All islands shall contain a minimum of 160 square feet and a minimum dimension
shall be 5 feet.
4. At least 1 canopy tree shall be provided in each island, in addition to assorted shrubs,
perennials, to assorted ornamental grass.
5. Islands shall be prepared with clean soil to a depth of 5 feet and amended to ensure
adequate drainage and nutrient and moisture-retention levels for the establishment of
plantings.
D. All perimeter and interior landscaped areas in parking lots shall be equipped with a
permanent irrigation system, unless drought-tolerant plant materials are used
exclusively. Where drought-tolerant plant materials are used, irrigation shall be required
only for the two-year period following plant installation and may be accomplished using
hoses, water trucks, or other nonpermanent means.
1011.04 Tree Preservation and Restoration in All Districts:
A. Intent and Purpose
The City of Roseville recognizes that trees are a significant element of the community
given their beauty (adding color and interest to the urban landscape, and being a source
of joy and spiritual renewal for many), their importance to the environment (purifying
air and water, helping to conserve soil and energy, reduction of noise and energy
consumption, and providing valuable habitat for all kinds of wildlife), and their positive
impact on property values (by providing buffering, protection of privacy, and a unique
sense of place within neighborhoods).
The purpose of this section is to protect and promote this important resource by:
1. Ensuring trees are protected when they are most vulnerable: during times of
development;
2. Establishing reasonable requirements for replacement of significant trees lost due to
development;
3. Incentivizing the protection and planting of trees at all times for the benefits they
provide;
4. Instituting plan requirements to ensure tree losses can be identified prior to
development, and that adequate replacement plantings will occur following land
disturbances;
5. Providing for fair, effective, and consistent enforcement of the regulations contained
herein.
B. Applicability
1. The regulations in this section shall apply to any individual, business or entity that
applies for one of the below permits or approvals.
a. An application for platting, re-platting, or any lot division application that does
not qualify as a minor lot subdivision; or
b. A building permit application to construct a new principal structure or seeking to
expand the footprint of an existing principal structure by more than 50%; or
c. A demolition permit seeking to remove more than 50% of a principal structure in
anticipation of immediate or future redevelopment; or
d. A grading permit seeking to add, move, or relocate 50 cubic yards or more in all
non-Shoreland Management Districts; or 10 cubic yards with the Shoreland
Management District.
2. If the Community Development Department determines that pre-application tree
removal occurred in order to circumvent the regulations in this section, the
Department may require equivalent tree replacement as if a tree preservation plan
had been submitted prior to removal. Pre-application tree removal shall be
considered removed within two years of application. Any costs to estimate the
removal may be charged to the applicant. Said determinations may be appealed to
the Board of Adjustment and Appeals under Section 1009.08 of this Title.
3. Activities subject to the provisions of Chapter 1017, Shoreland, Wetland, and Storm
Wastewater Management, may require tree preservation beyond that which is
required by this section. In all such instances, the more restrictive preservation
standard shall apply.
4. In all instances in which submissions by a degreed forester or certified arborist are
required, such submissions shall be reviewed and approved by City Staff or
contractors with equivalent credentials.

in height.
b. A smaller tree can be considered a heritage tree if:
i. A degreed forester or certified arborist determines it is a rare or unusual
species or of exceptional quality, or
ii. If it is specifically used by a developer as a focal point in a development
project, and the Community Development Department concurs with the
designation given the tree’s location, species, and/or likelihood to become a
prominent feature of the development.
2. Significant Trees:
a. All deciduous trees with DBH measurements of twelve (12) inches or greater, but
less than twenty-seven (27) inches.
b. All coniferous trees that are twenty-five (25) feet or greater, but less than fifty-
(50) feet in height.
3. Common Trees:

this condition shall be clearly identified on plan sets and within the required
matrix.
F. Incentive Multipliers
To incentivize the protection and preservation of the most important trees within the
community, the following incentive multipliers are to be used against the net
preservation or loss shown on a tree preservation plan as required in Section
1011.04(G)
1. Heritage Trees 2.0
2. Significant Trees 1.0
3. Common Trees: 0.5
G. Tree Preservation Plan Set Required
At the time of application for preliminary plat, grading permit, demolition permit or
building permit which includes the demolition of a principal structure; a tree

above, up to 15% of the total DBH-inches of all Heritage trees, up to 35% of the
total DBH-inches of all Significant trees, and up to 35% of the total DBH-inches
of all Common trees may be removed without tree replacement or restitution
subject to the incentive multipliers listed in Section 1011.04(F);
c. The required final planting plan shall identify the final allowed tree removal for
each lot within the proposed development.
2. Properties that are subject to the Tree Preservation requirements of Section 1011.04
due to a requested building permit, demolition permit, or grading permit shall
determine allowable removal based on the following:
a. If a tree preservation plan set was previously approved for the site within two (2)
years of the application date and the proposed activity is in substantial
conformance with the approved plan as determined by the Community
Development Department, then the approved plan set shall dictate allowed
removals on the lot.
b. If a tree preservation plan was previously approved for the site within two (2)
years of the application date, but the proposed activity was not authorized by the
approved plan as determined by the Community Development Department, then
the approved plan shall be updated.
i. The updated plan set shall be administratively reviewed and finalized in
conjunction with the triggering permit application;
ii. Additional tree replacement, if deemed necessary, shall become a condition
of approval for the application being requested.
iii. The City shall not be responsible to reimburse any party for replanting which
has already occurred if the updated plan preserves more trees than initially
anticipated.
c. If the subject lot is not party to a previously approved tree preservation plan set,
then a new tree preservation plan in conformance with Section 1011.04(F) (G) or
(H) shall be submitted, administratively reviewed, and finalized in conjunction
with the triggering permit application.
J. Replacement Tree Specifications
1. The minimum size for Deciduous replacement trees shall be 3-inch caliper, with each
caliper inch counting towards one (1) diameter breast height inch required for
replacement.

Height Range (min 6’)
Credit Against Required DBH
Replacement Inches
Less than 8 feet 1 inch
8 feet to less than 12 feet 2 inches
12 feet or greater 3 inches
3. Replacement trees shall be from balled and burlapped, certified nursery stock as
defined and controlled by MN Stat. 18.44 through 18.61, the Plant Pest Act, as may
be amended from time to time. Replacement trees may also be from bare root stock,
provided the trees are planted no later than May 15th in any year, and the planting is
inspected by the City Forester or other degreed forester or certified arborist as
assigned by the Community Development Department.
4. Replacement trees shall be covered by a minimum 2-year guarantee in accordance
with Section 1011.04(M).

by the City Forester or other degreed forester or certified arborist as assigned by the
Community Development Department.
6. Replacement trees for significant and common trees may be selected by the
applicant, but all final planting plans shall be subject to review and approval by the
City Forester or other degreed forester or certified arborist as assigned by the
Community Development Department, who will determine whether the proposed
trees are suitable to the site, are well placed, and accomplish local diversity goals.
7. Replacement trees may be utilized to meet landscaping and screening requirements if
placement, species, and location are consistent with those requirements.
8. Replacement Tree Locations. Required replacement trees shall be planted on the site
being developed unless doing so is deemed to be impractical (i.e. due to lack of
space), inappropriate (available planting areas are not ideal for new plantings or
would do little to enhance the site), or counterproductive to a property’s intent (i.e.
would entail too much screening for a retail business) as determined by the City
Forester or other degreed forester or certified arborist as assigned by the Community
Development Department. When such a determination is made, the applicant shall
comply with replacement requirements in one of three ways in the following manner:
a. As directed by the City , required replacement trees may be located on private
property within 1000 feet of the subject development site with the consent of the
property owner(s), on public improvement project sites that are not greater than
1000 feet from the development site, or on other public and private lands that are
not greater than 1000 feet from the development site if such lands are deemed to
be available, with priority given to locations near the affected area; or
b. The City may accept a cash-in-lieu tree replacement payment in accordance with
the required fee listed in the City Fee Schedule. In no instance shall a cash-inlieu
of payment exceed 10% of the Fair Market Value of the development site; or

from harm or destruction caused by soil compaction, equipment and material storage
within a tree’s identified protection zone, bark abrasions, changes in soil chemistry, outof-
season pruning, and root damage during construction.
1. Before any construction or grading of any development project occurs, a “safety
fence” per the approved tree preservation plan shall be erected meeting the following
requirements:
a. Must be at least 4 feet in height and staked with posts no less than every 5 feet.
b. Shall be placed around the identified protection zone(s) of trees to be preserved
per the approved tree preservation plan.
c. Signs shall be placed along the fence line identifying the area as a tree protection
area, and prohibiting development activities beyond the fence line.
2. The tree protection fencing shall remain in place until all grading and construction
activity is terminated; failure to maintain tree protection fencing shall be grounds for
issuance of a stop work order.
3. No equipment, construction materials, or soil may be stored within the identified
protection zone of any inventoried tree to be preserved.
4. Care must be taken to prevent a change in soil chemistry due to concrete washout
and leakage or spillage of toxic materials such as fuels or paints.
5. Drainage patterns on the site shall not change considerably causing drastic
environmental changes in the soil moisture content where trees are intended to be
preserved.
6. Pruning of oak trees and elm trees shall be subject to the following requirements:

seasonal restrictions by resolution if, in its opinion, the same is necessary for the
betterment of city wide oak and elm tree populations.
d. If pruning of either tree type is absolutely necessary during prohibited
timeframes, the city shall be notified before work begins, and the landowner shall
be required to seal all wounds with a proper wound sealing paint authorized by
the City Forester or other degreed forester or certified arborist as assigned by the
Community Development Department.
7. Unplanned Loss of Trees
a. Any tree, not previously identified for removal, that is determined by the City
Forester or other degreed forester or certified arborist as assigned by the
Community Development Department to be destroyed or damaged as a result of
development activity shall be replaced at the following rates:
Category Replacement Rate
Heritage Trees 2.5
Significant Trees 1.5
Common Trees 1.0
b. Unauthorized tree removal which results in mandatory replacement shall require
the applicant to prepare or update a final planting plan as required by Section
1011.04(G)(3)(c). Replacement plantings shall only occur once authorized by
the City Forester or other degreed forester or certified arborist as assigned by the
Community Development Department.
L. Certification of Compliance with Approved Landscape Plan
Upon completion of construction activity and/or required landscaping, the Developer
shall notify the City and request an inspection of the work. Following the inspection,
the City shall notify the Developer that additional work is still required, or issue a
letter finding that all plantings have been satisfactorily completed. The required
warranty period for plantings shall begin on the date of the issued satisfactory
completion letter.

plant replacement trees. The estimated cost shall be provided by the Developer
subject to approval by the City. The estimated cost shall be at least as much as
the reasonable amount charged by nurseries for the furnishing and planting of
replacement trees. The City reserves the right in its sole discretion to determine
the estimated cost in the event the Developer’s estimated cost is not approved.
b. The security shall be maintained for at least 2 years after the date that the last
replacement tree has been planted. Upon a showing by the Developer and such
inspection as may be made by the City, that portion of the security may be
released by the City equal to 125% of the estimated cost of the replacement trees
which are alive and healthy at the end of such year. Any portion of the security
not entitled to be released at the end of the year shall be maintained and shall
secure the Developer’s obligation to remove and replant replacement trees which
are not alive or are unhealthy at the end of such year and to replant missing trees.
Upon completion of the replanting of such trees the entire security may be
released.
2. Development or Redevelopment of Existing Lots: The developer shall provide a
cash escrow in the amount of $500.00 to guarantee compliance with the requirements

Minnesota Rules, parts 6120.2500 through 6120.3900; Minnesota Rules chapters 8410 and
8420. (Ord. 1156, 12-12-94)
(Ord. 1359, 1-28-2008)
1017.04: POLICY; STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
A. Waters and Wetland Policy:
1. The City's Comprehensive Land Use Plan identifies specific goals and policies
related to the proper management of its shoreland, lakes, wetlands, water and soil
resources.
2. The City recognizes that the uncontrolled use of shorelands, wetlands, and land
alteration activities in general in the City affects the public health, safety and general
welfare not only by contributing to the pollution of surface and ground waters, but also
by impairing the local tax base.
3. Land development and use impact all receiving waters, especially lakes, by
contributing to their impairment through point and nonpoint pollution sources.
4. The City has adopted a Surface Water Management Plan that recognizes that its
storm water system is integrated with the management of its natural lakes and wetlands.
5. Therefore, the City has determined that it is in the best interests of the public to
manage its Comprehensive Plan and Surface Water Management Plan by a consolidated
approach with this Chapter to avoid conflict and duplication to the maximum practical
extent.
B. Statement of Purpose: to achieve the policies described in the City Comprehensive Plan,
State and Federal policies and statutes, the City intends to determine, control and guide
future development within and surrounding those land areas which are contiguous to
designated bodies of public water and areas of "natural environmental significance" as
herein defined and regulated. Specifically, this Chapter purports to:
1. Regulate the placement of sanitary and storm water disposal facilities on lots;
2. Regulate the area of a lot and the length of water frontage suitable for a building site;
3. Regulate alteration of the shorelands and wetlands of public waters;
4. Control natural environment areas of ecological value to maintain existing aquatic,
vegetation and wildlife conditions to the maximum extent possible;
5. Regulate the use and subdivision of land within the corporate limits as it relates to
public waters, shorelands and storm water;
6. Provide variances from the minimum standards and criteria. (Ord. 1156, 12-12-94)

SHORELAND MANAGEMENT DISTRICT: Land located within three hundred (300)
feet from the ordinary high water level; or the first tier of riparian lots or the first tier of
lots beyond a public street when the street is adjacent to a public water body, whichever
is greater, of certain public waters as established by the City Council as established by
this code. (Ord. 1405, 2-28-2011)
SIGNIFICANT HISTORIC SITE: Any archaeological site, standing structure, or other
property that meets the criteria for eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places,
is listed in the State Register of Historic Sites, or is determined to be an unplatted
cemetery that falls under the provisions of Minnesota statutes, section 307.08. An
historic site meets these criteria if it is presently listed on either register or if it is
determined to meet the qualifications for listing after review by the Minnesota state
archaeologist or the director of the Minnesota Historical Society. All unplatted
cemeteries are automatically considered to be significant historic sites.
STEEP SLOPE: Land where agricultural activity or development is either not
recommended or described as poorly suited due to slope steepness and the site's soil
characteristics, as mapped and described in available county soil surveys or other
technical reports, unless appropriate design and construction techniques and farming
practices are used in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Where specific
information is not available, steep slopes are lands having average slopes over twelve
percent (12%), as measured over horizontal distances of fifty (50) feet or more, that are
not bluffs.

permanently, the purpose of which is to collect runoff, nutrients, and sediment prior to
releasing water into wetlands and natural water bodies.
STRUCTURE: Any building or appurtenance, including attached or detached decks and
fences. "Structure" does not include aerial or underground utility lines, such as sewer,
electric, telephone, telegraph, gas lines, towers, poles, seasonal docks, and other
supporting facilities such as at grade driveways and patios.

which lot owners have authority to use the access lot and what activities are allowed.
The activities may include watercraft launching, loading, storage, beaching, mooring, or
docking. They may also include other outdoor recreational activities that do not
significantly conflict with general public use of the public water or the enjoyment of
normal property rights by adjacent property owners. Examples of the nonsignificant
conflict activities include swimming, sunbathing, or picnicking. The covenants shall
limit the total number of vehicles allowed to be parked and the total number of
watercraft allowed to be continuously moored, docked, or stored over water, and shall
require centralization of all common facilities and activities in the most suitable

Conditional uses allowable within shoreland areas shall be subject to all of the review and
approval procedures of this Section 1009.02 of this Title. The following additional
evaluation criteria and conditions apply within shoreland areas:
A. Evaluation Criteria: A thorough evaluation of the waterbody and the topographic,
vegetation, and soil conditions on the site shall be made to ensure:
1. The prevention of soil erosion or other possible pollution of public waters, both
during and after construction;
2. The visibility of structures and other facilities as viewed from public waters is
limited;
3. The types, uses, and numbers of watercraft that the project will generate can be safely
accommodated on the site;
4. The impact the proposed use may have on the water quality of the water body is not
excessive.
B. Conditions Attached to Conditional Use Approvals: The City Council, upon
consideration of the criteria listed above and the purposes of this Chapter may attach
such conditions to Conditional Use approvals as it deems necessary. Such conditions
may include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. Increased setbacks from the ordinary high water level;
2. Limitations on the natural vegetation to be removed or the requirement that additional
vegetation be planted; and
3. Special provisions for the location, design, and use of structures, watercraft launching
and docking areas, and vehicle parking areas. (Ord. 1156, 12-12-94)
(Ord. 1359, 1-28-2008) (Ord. 1405, 2-28-2011)
1017.22: NONCONFORMITIES:
All legally established nonconformities as of the date of this Code amendment may
continue, but they shall be managed according to applicable State statutes and the
requirements of Section 1002.04 of this Title for the subjects of alterations and additions,
repair after damage, discontinuance of use and intensification of use. (Ord. 1405, 2-28-2011)
The following standards apply to nonconforming lots and uses in the shoreland management
areas:
A. Construction on Nonconforming Lots of Record:
1. Lots of record in the office on the County Recorder on the date of enactment of the
City shoreland controls (March 27, 1974) that do not meet the requirements of this
Chapter may be allowed as building sites without variances from lot size requirements
provided; the use is permitted in the zoning district; all sanitary requirements of the City
Code are complied with insofar as practical; and the minimum lot size and length of
water frontage shall be not less than seventy percent (70%) of standard lot water
frontage requirements; the lot has been in separate ownership from abutting lands since
the original adoption of the City shoreland controls (March 27, 1974).
2. A variance from setback requirements shall be obtained before any use or building
permit is issued for a lot. In evaluating the variance, the Board of Adjustment shall
consider, in addition to the requirements of Section 1017.20, public utilities available to
the lot and shall deny the variance if adequate facilities cannot be provided. (Ord. 1359,
1-28-2008)
3. If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under one ownership since the original
adoption of the City shoreland controls (March 27, 1974), any individual lot does not
meet the requirements of Section 1017.17, the lot shall not be considered as a separate
parcel of land for the purposes of development. The lot shall be combined with the one
or more contiguous lots so they equal one or more parcels of land, each meeting the
requirements of Sections 1017.14 through 1017.16 of this Chapter. (Ord. 1359, 1-28-
2008)
B. Additions/Expansions to Nonconforming Structures: All additions or expansions to the
outside dimensions of an existing nonconforming structure must meet the setback,
height, and other requirements of Sections 1017.14 through 1017.16. Any deviation
from these requirements may only be authorized by a variance pursuant to Section
1017.20.
C. Deck Additions: Deck additions may be allowed, without a variance, to a structure
which does not meet the required setback from the ordinary high water level, if all of
the following criteria and standards are met:
1. The structure existed prior to the date the City's original shoreland structure setbacks
were established on March 27, 1974.
2. A thorough evaluation of the property and structure reveals no reasonable location for
a deck meeting or exceeding the existing ordinary high water level setback of the
structure.
3. The new deck encroachment toward the ordinary high water level does not exceed
15% of the existing setback of the structure from the ordinary high water level or does
not encroach closer than 30 feet, whichever is more restrictive; and the deck shall be
constructed of materials similar to the materials of the principal structure, wood, or
earth tone; and the new deck shall not be roofed or screened.
D. Existing Decks: Existing decks, at the date of adoption of this Chapter, which meet the
required setbacks and have had valid building permits, may be enclosed as part of the
structure. Deck extensions beyond and from a nonconforming, enclosed deck which
would increase the nonconforming setback, shall not be permitted. (Ord. 1156, 12-12-
94) (Ord. 1359, 1-28-2008)
1017.23: SUBDIVISION/PLATTING PROVISIONS:
A. Land Suitability: Each lot created through subdivision shall be suitable for the proposed
use as defined by the suitability analysis. Suitability analysis shall consider
susceptibility to flooding, existence of wetlands, soil and rock formations with severe
limitations for development, severe erosion potential, steep topography, availability of
City sewer and water, near-shore aquatic conditions unsuitable for water-based
recreation, important fish and wildlife habitat, presence of significant historic sites, or
any other feature of the natural land likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare
of future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community. (Ord. 1405, 2-28-
2011)
B. Consistency With Other Controls: Subdivisions shall conform to all official controls of
this community. A subdivision shall not be approved where a later variance from one or
more standards in official controls would be needed to use the lots for their intended
purpose. Each lot shall meet the minimum lot size and dimensional requirements of
Sections 1017.14 through 1017.16.
C. Information Requirements: Sufficient information shall be submitted by the applicant
for the community to make a determination of land suitability. The information shall
include at least the following:
1. Topographic contours at two (2) foot intervals or less from City public works maps
or more accurate sources, showing limiting site characteristics;
2. The surface water features required in Minnesota Statutes, section 505.02,
subdivision 1, to be shown on plats, obtained from United States Geological Survey
quadrangle topographic maps or more accurate sources;
3. Adequate soil information to determine suitability for building and public utilities for
every lot from the most current existing sources or from field investigations such as soil
borings or other methods;
4. Information regarding adequacy of domestic City water supply; extent of anticipated
vegetation and topographic alterations; near-shore aquatic conditions, including depths,
types of bottom sediments, and aquatic vegetation; and proposed methods for
controlling storm water runoff and erosion, both during and after construction activities;
5. Location of 100-year flood plain areas and floodway districts from existing adopted
maps or data; and
6. A line or contour representing ordinary high water level, the toe and the top of bluffs,
and the minimum building setback distances from the top of the bluff and the lake or
stream.
D. Dedications: When an on-site storm water ponding area is required by a project to store
surface water runoff, the City may require easements over natural drainage or ponding
areas for future maintenance of storm water and significant wetlands.
E. Platting: All subdivisions that create three or more lots or parcels that are two and onehalf
acres or less in size shall be processed as a plat in accordance with City Subdivision
Regulations1. (Ord. 1156, 12-12-94) (Ord. 1359, 1-28-2008)

(Ord. 1557, 6-18-2018)
1017.26: STORM WATER MANAGEMENT:
The following general and specific standards shall apply to all developments within the city:
A. General Standards:
1. Existing Natural Drainageways: When possible, existing natural drainageways, and
vegetated soil surfaces shall be used to convey, store, filter, and retain storm water
runoff before discharge to public waters.
2. Minimum Disturbance: Development shall be planned and conducted in a manner
that will minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential, and
reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas shall be stabilized and protected as
soon as possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment on the site.
3. Constructed Facilities: When development density, topographic features, and soil and
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle storm water runoff using
natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities such as
diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways, and ponds may be
used. Preference shall be given to designs using surface drainage, vegetation, and
infiltration rather than buried pipes and manmade materials and facilities.
B. Specific Standards:
1. Impervious Surface Coverage: Impervious surface coverage of a site shall not exceed
25% of the site area in a shoreland or wetland overlay district unless storm water is
conveyed to an approved, on-site or regional storm water ponding/retention facility
designed to accommodate the increased runoff prior to discharge from the site into
public waters or wetlands.
2. Review by City Engineer: All proposed storm water facilities shall be reviewed by
the city engineer and certified for compliance with the city's surface water management
plan, National Urban Runoff Program (NURP) standards, the Minnesota Pollution
Control Agency's (MPCA) Urban Best Management Practices, and any established
standards of the water management organization having jurisdiction in the project area.
3. Commercial, Industrial, and Residential Development Affectation: All commercial
and industrial developments and redevelopments affecting more than five acres of land
and all residential developments affecting more than five 5 acres of land shall:
a. Be served by storm water ponding facilities, on- or off-site, designed to remove a
minimum of 90% of total suspended solids resulting from the runoff from a one inch
rainfall event, and
b. Within the development, provide for settling chambers, sumps, dry ponds or other
devices to provide for the filtering or settling of fine sands prior to discharge into the
city's storm water system.
4. Private Storm Water Facilities: All private storm water facilities shall be maintained
in proper condition consistent with the performance standards for which they were
originally designed. All settled materials from ponds, sumps, grit chambers, and other
devices, including settled solids, shall be removed and properly disposed of on a five
year interval. One to five year waivers from this requirement may be granted by the city
engineer when the owner presents evidence that the facility has additional capacity to
remove settled solids in accordance with the original design capacity.
5. Inventory of Private Storm Water Facilities: Upon adoption of this chapter, the city
engineer shall inventory and maintain a data base for all private storm water facilities
requiring maintenance to assure compliance with this section. (Ord. 1239, 4-24-2000)
(Ord. 1359, 1-28-2008)
1017.27: AMENDMENT:
This chapter may be amended whenever the public necessity and the general welfare require
such amendment by following the procedure specified in Section 1009.06 of this Code.

A. The uses must have their highest peak demand for parking at substantially different
times of the day or week or an adequate amount of parking shall be available for all
uses during shared hours of peak demand. A parking plan shall address the hours, size,
and mode of operation of the respective uses.
B. The minimum spaces required under a shared parking plan shall be based on the
following:
1. For those uses parking at substantially different times of the day or week, the number
of spaces required for the uses that require the most parking; and
2. For those uses parking at the same hours of peak demand, the minimum shall be 1.5
times the number of spaces required by the use(s) that require the most parking.
C. Shared parking facilities shall be protected by a covenant running with the land and
recorded with the County in a form approved by the City Attorney. Such a covenant
shall not be revoked without consent of the City. A certified copy of the recorded
document shall be provided to the Community Development Department prior to the
use of the shared parking arrangement.
1019.08 Proof of Parking
If it is demonstrated that the required minimum parking is in excess of the actual demand, all
of the required parking need not be constructed initially. The City Council may grant a Proof
of Parking Agreement to the developer. This agreement shall describe the required parking,
demonstrate that space exists to comply with the parking requirement, and set conditions for
the future construction of the required parking, if necessary. The agreement shall state that
the developer or future successors shall be responsible for completing parking improvements
to meet City Code requirements. The area of future parking shall be landscaped, but that
landscaping shall not be used to satisfy landscaping requirements.

constructed initially. The Community Development Department may approve a Proof of
Bicycle Parking Plan. This plan shall describe the required bicycle parking, demonstrate
that space exists to comply with the bicycle parking requirement, and set conditions for
the future construction of the required bicycle parking, if necessary. The Plan shall state
that the developer or future successors shall be responsible for completing bicycle
parking improvements to meet City Code requirements.
1019.14 Pedestrian Circulation and Access
A. Access Points: Pedestrian access points shall be provided at all pedestrian arrival points
to the development including the property edges, adjacent lots, abutting street
intersections, crosswalks, and at transit stops. Pedestrian access shall be coordinated
with existing development to provide circulation patterns between developments.
B. Conflicts: Pedestrian walkways shall form an on-site circulation system that minimizes
the conflict between pedestrians and traffic at all points of pedestrian access to on-site
parking and building entrances, and between buildings.
C. Design Standards: Pedestrian access and walkways shall meet the following minimum
design standards:
1. Access and walk walkways shall be well-lit and physically separated from driveways
and parking spaces by landscaping, berms, barriers, grade separation, or other means
to protect pedestrians from vehicular traffic;
2. Access and walkways shall be a minimum of 6 feet of unobstructed width and meet
City standards for surfacing of walkways or sidewalks;
3. Access shall be usable by mobility-impaired persons and shall be designed and
constructed to be easily located by the sight-impaired pedestrian by either grade
change, texture, or other equivalent means; and
4. A crosswalk shall be required when a walkway crosses a driveway or a paved area
accessible to vehicles. Raised crosswalks or speed bumps may be required at all
points where a walkway crosses the lane of vehicle travel.
1019.15 Off-street Loading Facilities
A. Loading Zones: The off-street loading requirement for nonresidential buildings may be
satisfied by the designation of a loading zone area on the site. This loading zone area
shall be separate from any required off-street parking area and access to the loading
zone area shall be provided such that it does not conflict with automobile circulation to,
from, or within the site.
B. Loading Docks, Berths, and Facilities:
1. Loading Facility: A loading facility includes the dock, the berth for the vehicle,
maneuvering areas, and the necessary screening walls.
2. Location:
a. All loading berth curb cuts shall be located 40 feet or more from the intersection
of two street rights-of-way.
b. No loading berth shall be located less than 50 feet from any parcel that is zoned
residential and used or subdivided for residential use, or has an occupied
institutional building, including but not limited to schools, religious institutions,
and community centers, unless the loading berth is entirely within a building.
c. Loading facilities shall not occupy the required front yard. In situations where
access to the loading berth is directly from the street and no other practicable
means of access exist, this requirement may be waived by the Community
Development Department.
3. Access: Each loading berth location shall permit vehicular access to a street in a
manner that will least interfere with traffic.
4. Surfacing: All loading facilities and accessways shall be paved with bituminous or
concrete paving to control the dust and drainage.
5. Screening: See Section 1011.03 of the City Code.
C. Accessory Use: No loading berth or access drive shall be used for the storage of goods
or inoperable vehicles. It may not be included as a part of the space necessary to meet
the off-street parking requirements.

1021.01: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT AND
PURPOSE
A. Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minnesota
Statutes Chapter 103F and Chapter 462 delegated the responsibility to local government
units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City
Council of the City of Roseville, Minnesota does ordain as follows:
B. Findings of Fact:
1. The flood hazard areas of the City of Roseville, Minnesota, are subject to periodic
inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures or flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of
which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
2. Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. This Ordinance is based upon a
reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards
established by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
3. National Flood Insurance Program Compliance. This Ordinance is adopted to
comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program
codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59 -78, as amended, so as to
maintain the community’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
C. Statement of Purpose: It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in Section B-1 by
provisions contained herein.
1021.02: GENERAL PROVISIONS
A. Lands to Which Ordinance Applies: This Ordinance shall apply to all lands within the
jurisdiction of the City of Roseville shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or the
attachments thereto as being located within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood
Fringe, or General Flood Plain Districts.
B. Establishment of Official Zoning Map: The Official Zoning Map together with all
materials attached thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
Ordinance. The attached material shall include the Flood Insurance Study for the
Ramsey County, Minnesota (All Jurisdictions); Flood Insurance Rate Map panels therein
numbered 27123C0012G, 27123C0015G, 27123C0016G, 27123C0020G,
27123C0036G, 27123C0038G, 27123C0080G, 27123C0085G and 27123C0101G; and
the Flood Insurance Rate Map Index (Map Number 27123CIND0B), all dated June 4,
2010 and prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Official
Zoning Map shall be on file in the Office of Community Development
C. Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation: The regulatory flood protection elevation shall
be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any
increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from
designation of a floodway.
D. Interpretation:
1. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be held
to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the
Governing Body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers
granted by state statutes.
2. The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the
Official Zoning Map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the district as shown on the Official Zoning Map, as for example
where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions and there is a formal appeal of the decision of the Zoning Administrator,
the Board of Adjustment shall make the necessary interpretation. All decisions will
be based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations
that existed on the site at the time the Community adopted its initial floodplain
ordinance or on the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing
the area within the 100-year floodplain if earlier, and other available technical data.
Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to present their case to the Board of Adjustment and to submit technical
evidence.
E. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this Ordinance to repeal,
abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However,
where this Ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Ordinance shall
prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this Ordinance are hereby repealed to the
extent of the inconsistency only.
F. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: This Ordinance does not imply that areas outside
the flood plain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the
City of Roseville or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
G. Severability: If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this Ordinance is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this
Ordinance shall not be affected thereby.
H. Definitions: Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Ordinance
shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage
and so as to give this Ordinance its most reasonable application.
1. Accessory Use or Structure - a use or structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure.
2. Basement - means any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor or
base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of
excavation below ground level.
3. Conditional Use - means a specific type of structure or land use listed in the official
control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review procedure and with
appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the official zoning controls or
building codes and upon a finding that:
a. Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist.
b. The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan if one
exists and are compatible with the existing neighborhood.
4. Equal Degree of Encroachment - a method of determining the location of floodway
boundaries so that flood plain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of
conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
5. Flood - a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage of a
wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
6. Flood Frequency - the frequency for which it is expected that a specific flood stage
or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
7. Flood Fringe - that portion of the flood plain outside of the floodway. Flood fringe is
synonymous with the term "floodway fringe" used in the Flood Insurance Study for
Ramsey County, Minnesota (All Jurisdictions).
8. Flood Plain - the beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or watercourse
which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.
9. Flood Proofing - a combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments to
properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or
elimination of flood damages.
10. Floodway - the bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and those
portions of the adjoining flood plain which are reasonably required to carry or store
the regional flood discharge.
11. Lowest Floor - the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement).
An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles,
building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a
building’s lowest floor.
12. Manufactured Home - a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home”
does not include the term “recreational vehicle.”
13. Obstruction - any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence,
stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any
channel, watercourse, or regulatory flood plain which may impede, retard, or change
the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris
carried by such water.
14. Principal Use or Structure - means all uses or structures that are not accessory uses or
structures.
15. Reach - a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a stream
or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban area, the
segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings would most
typically constitute a reach.
16. Recreational Vehicle - a vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400 square feet or
less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be selfpropelled
or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily not

camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the purposes of this Ordinance, the term
recreational vehicle shall be synonymous with the term travel trailer/travel vehicle.
17. Regional Flood - a flood which is representative of large floods known to have
occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be
expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year
recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term "base flood", 1-
percent annual chance flood or 100-year flood elevation.
18. Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation - The regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood
plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that
result from designation of a floodway.
19. Structure - anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the ground
or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached
garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational vehicles not meeting the
exemption criteria specified in Section 1021.09A1 of this Ordinance and other
similar items.
20. Substantial Damage - means damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed
50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
21. Substantial Improvement - within any consecutive 365-day period, any
reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after
damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of
construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred
“substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does
not, however, include either:
a. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state
or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified
by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions.
b. Any alteration of an “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structure’s continued designation as an “historic structure.” For the
purpose of this Ordinance, “historic structure” shall be as defined in 44 Code of
Federal Regulations, Part 59.1.
22. Variance - means a modification of a specific permitted development standard
required in an official control including this Ordinance to allow an alternative
development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only as
applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship, practical
difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in a community's
respective planning and zoning enabling legislation.
I. Annexations: The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference into Section B
above may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the corporate boundaries of the
City of Roseville at the time of adoption of this ordinance. If any of these floodplain
land area are annexed into the City of Roseville after the date of adoption of this
ordinance, the newly annexed floodplain lands shall be subject to the provisions of this
ordinance immediately upon the date of annexation into the City of Roseville.
1021.03: ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS
A. Districts:
1. Floodway District: The Floodway District shall include those areas designated as
Zone AE and Zone A on the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted in Section B

Section 103G.005, subdivision 14.
2. Flood Fringe District: The Flood Fringe District shall include those areas designated
as Zone AE and Zone A on the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted in Section
B that are below the 1% annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation) but
above the ordinary high water level as defined in Minnesota Statutes, Section
103G.005, subdivision 14. See Section 1021.06 for procedures to determine the 1%
annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation).
B. Compliance: No new structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be
constructed, located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance
with the terms of this Ordinance and other applicable regulations which apply to uses
within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance. Within the Floodway, Flood Fringe and
General Flood Plain Districts, all uses not listed as permitted uses or conditional uses in
Sections 1021.04 and 1021.05 that follow, respectively, shall be prohibited. In addition,
a caution is provided here that:
1. Modifications, additions, structural alterations, normal maintenance and repair, or
repair after damage to existing nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses of
structures or land are regulated by the general provisions of this Ordinance and
specifically Section 1021.11.
2. As-built elevations for elevated or flood proofed structures must be certified by
ground surveys and flood proofing techniques must be designed and certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect as specified in the general provisions of
this Ordinance and specifically as stated in Section 1021.10 of this Ordinance.
1021.04: FLOODWAY DISTRICT (FW)
The permitted and conditional uses listed below are only allowable in the floodway if not
prohibited by any other underlying zoning district classifications of the City of Roseville and
if not prohibited by any applicable state or federal law.
A. Permitted Uses:
1. General farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, and wild
crop harvesting.
2. Boat launching ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature preserves, and
fishing areas.
3. Residential lawns, gardens and play areas.
B. Standards for Floodway Permitted Uses:
1. The use shall have a low flood damage potential.
2. The use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists.
3. The use shall not obstruct flood flows or increase flood elevations and shall not
involve structures, fill, obstructions, excavations or storage of materials or
equipment.
C. Conditional Uses:
1. Extraction and storage of sand, gravel, and other materials.
2. Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves, and water control structures.
3. Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines, and pipelines.
4. Placement of fill.
D. Standards for Floodway Conditional Uses:
1. All Uses. No fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, or other
use may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase in the stage of
the 100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or
reaches affected.
2. All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and standards
contained in Section 1021.10D of this Ordinance.
3. The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if one
exists.
4. Fill:
a. Fill, dredge spoil, and all other similar materials deposited or stored in the flood
plain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or
other acceptable method.
b. Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be allowed in the
floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted which includes
an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
c. As an alternative, and consistent with Subsection (b) immediately above, dredge
spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, on-site
storage of fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to the
stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the Governing Body has
received an appropriate plan which assures the removal of the materials from the
floodway based upon the flood warning time available. The conditional use must
be title registered with the property in the Office of the County Recorder.
5. Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of other materials or equipment may
be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood
warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the Governing Body. The
storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive,
or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
6. Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to remove areas from
the regulatory flood plain shall not be allowed in the floodway.
1021.05: FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF)
A. Permitted Uses: Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as
permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district(s). If no pre-existing, underlying
zoning use districts exist, then any residential or non residential structure or use of a
structure or land shall be a permitted use in the Flood Fringe District provided such use
does not constitute a public nuisance. All permitted uses shall comply with the standards
for Flood Fringe District “Permitted Uses” listed in Section 1021.05B.
B. Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses:
1. All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the
lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one (1)
foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such
elevation at least fifteen (15) feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected
thereon.
2. As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal
investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at its largest projection may be
flood proofed in accordance with the following standards:
a. Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.
b. Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry flood proofed in
accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing classifications in the State
Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be flood proofed to
the FP-3 or FP-4 flood proofing classification in the State Building Code and, for
a detached garage, the detached garage must be used solely for parking of
vehicles and limited storage. Flood proofed accessory structures must meet the
following additional standards:
(1) The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or
lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
(2) Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to or
above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly flood proofed;
and
(3) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a
minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the structure
having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot
of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at least two
sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than
one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human
intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this
requirement for automatic openings.
3. The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory
flood protection elevation.
C. Conditional Uses: Any structure that is not elevated on fill or flood proofed in
accordance with Section 1021.05B1-B2 and or any use of land that does not comply with
the standards in Section 1021.05B3 shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An
application for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and
evaluation procedures specified in Sections 1021.05D-E and 1021.10D of this
Ordinance.
1. Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses:
a. Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate
a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These
alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or
above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The
base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-grade and not a
structure's basement or lowest floor if: 1) the enclosed area is above-grade on at
least one side of the structure; 2) it is designed to internally flood and is
constructed with flood resistant materials; and 3) it is used solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage. The above-noted alternative elevation
methods are subject to the following additional standards:
(1) Design and Certification - The structure's design and as-built condition must
be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in
compliance with the general design standards of the State Building Code
and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water
from entering or accumulating within these components during times of
flooding.
(2) Specific Standards for Above-grade, Enclosed Areas - Above-grade, fully
enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be designed
to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
(a) A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to
be used as a flood proofing technique. There shall be a minimum of two
openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all
openings shall be no higher than one-foot above grade. The automatic
openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch
for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a
registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net
area would suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with
screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they
permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters without any form of
human intervention; and
(b) That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in
accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State Building
Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or
storage.
b. Basements, as defined by Section 1021.02H2 of this Ordinance, shall be subject
to the following:
(1) Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
(2) Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood
protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry flood proofed
in accordance with Section 1021.05C1c of this Ordinance.
c. All areas of non residential structures including basements to be placed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation shall be flood proofed in accordance with
the structurally dry flood proofing classifications in the State Building Code.
Structurally dry flood proofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing
classification in the State Building Code and this shall require making the
structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures
flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted.
d. Storage of Materials and Equipment:
(1) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding,
flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant
life is prohibited.
(2) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily
removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and
in accordance with a plan approved by the Governing Body.
e. The provisions of Section 1021.05C2 of this Ordinance shall also apply.
2. Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses:
a. Commercial Uses - accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and
parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection
elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees
or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood warning
system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in
feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four (4)
upon occurrence of the regional flood.
b. Manufacturing and Industrial Uses - measures shall be taken to minimize
interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having
protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and
parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in
Section 1021.05C2a above. In considering permit applications, due
consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires
that it be located in flood plain areas.
c. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by
the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for
removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation - FEMA's
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards
should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
d. Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of
the channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse or drainage
system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified
on the Official Zoning Map.
e. Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in Section 1021.09A.
f. All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of overthe-
top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
1021.06: Procedures for determining 1% annual chance flood elevations
(100-YR flood elevations) in Zone A
A. Reserved for Future Use
B. Procedures for determining 1% annual chance flood elevations (100-YR flood
elevations) in Zone A:
1. Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within a Zone A, the
Zoning Administrator will use the 1% annual chance flood elevation for that basin
that has previously been determined in accordance with approved FEMA methods,
if available. If the 1% annual chance flood elevation has not been previously
determined, the applicant shall be required to furnish all necessary information as
deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator for the determination for the 1%
annual chance flood elevation in accordance with approved FEMA methods.
2. The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above information to a
designated engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance in
determining whether the proposed use is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District
and to determine the 1% annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation).
Procedures consistent with Minnesota Regulations 1983, Parts 6120.5000 -
6120.6200 and 44 Code of Federal Regulations Part 65 shall be followed in this
expert evaluation. The designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to
discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective
Department of Natural Resources' Area Hydrologist prior to commencing the
analysis.
3. Once the 1% annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation) has been
determined, the Zoning Administrator shall process the permit application
consistent with the applicable provisions of Section 1021.04 and 1021.05 of this
Ordinance.
1021.07: SUBDIVISIONS
A. Review Criteria: No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for the reason of
flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. All lots
within the flood plain districts shall be able to contain a building site outside of the
Floodway District at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. All
subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that comply with the
provisions of this Ordinance and have road access both to the subdivision and to the
individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation. For all subdivisions in the flood plain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe
District boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation
of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and
platting documents.
B. Procedures for determining 1% annual chance flood elevation (100-YR flood elevation)
in Zone A: In a designated Zone-A area, applicants shall provide the information
required in Section 1021.06B of this Ordinance to determine the 1% annual chance
flood elevation (100-year flood elevation) and the regulatory flood protection elevation
for the subdivision site.
C. Removal of Special Flood Hazard Area Designation: The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood
hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 1%
annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation). FEMA's requirements
incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multistructure
or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the
initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be
requested.
1021.08: PUBLIC UTILITIES, RAILROADS, ROADS, AND BRIDGES
A. Public Utilities: All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer, and
water supply systems to be located in the flood plain shall be flood proofed in
accordance with the State Building Code or elevated to above the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
B. Public Transportation Facilities: Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges to be located
within the flood plain shall comply with Sections 1021.04 and 1021.05 of this
Ordinance. Elevation to the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be provided
where failure or interruption of these transportation facilities would result in danger to
the public health or safety or where such facilities are essential to the orderly
functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads may be constructed at a
lower elevation where failure or interruption of transportation services would not
endanger the public health or safety.
C. On-Site Sewage Treatment and Water Supply Systems: Where public utilities are not
provided: 1) On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 2) New or replacement on-site sewage
treatment systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters and they shall not be
subject to impairment or contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage
treatment system designed in accordance with the State's current statewide standards for
on-site sewage treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with this
Section.
1021.09: PLACEMENT OF RECREATIONAL VEHICLES.
A. Recreational vehicles that do not meet the exemption criteria specified in Section
1021.09A1 below shall be subject to the provisions of this Ordinance and as specifically
spelled out in Sections 1021.09A3 and A4 below.
1. Exemption - Recreational vehicles are exempt from the provisions of this Ordinance
if they are placed in any of the areas listed in Section 1021.09A2 below and further
they meet the following criteria:
a. Have current licenses required for highway use.
b. Are highway ready meaning on wheels or the internal jacking system, are
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities commonly used in
campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks and the recreational vehicle has
no permanent structural type additions attached to it.
c. The recreational vehicle and associated use must be permissible in any preexisting,
underlying zoning use district.
2. Areas Exempted For Placement of Recreational Vehicles:
a. Individual lots or parcels of record.
b. Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds.
c. Existing condominium type associations.
3. Recreational vehicles exempted in Section 1021.09A1 lose this exemption when
development occurs on the parcel exceeding $500 for a structural addition to the
recreational vehicle or exceeding $500 for an accessory structure such as a garage
or storage building. The recreational vehicle and all additions and accessory
structures will then be treated as a new structure and shall be subject to the
elevation/flood proofing requirements and the use of land restrictions specified in
Sections 1021.04 and 1021.05 of this Ordinance. There shall be no development or
improvement on the parcel or attachment to the recreational vehicle that hinders the
removal of the recreational vehicle to a flood free location should flooding occur.
4. New commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds and new residential
type subdivisions and condominium associations and the expansion of any existing
similar use exceeding five (5) units or dwelling sites shall be subject to the
following:
a. All new or replacement vehicles and related contents that are not elevated
above the regulatory flood protection elevation or are not placed over properly
elevated road access in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District, as an
alternative, be allowed as a conditional use if in accordance with the following
provisions and the provisions of 1021.10D of the Ordinance. The applicant
must submit an emergency plan for the safe evacuation of all vehicles and
people during the 100 year flood. Said plan shall be prepared by a registered

proofed.
8. Notifications for Watercourse Alterations. The Community Development
Department shall notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the
Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources prior to the community
authorizing any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. If the applicant has
applied for a permit to work in the beds of public waters pursuant to Minnesota
Statute, Chapter 103G, this shall suffice as adequate notice to the Commissioner of
Natural Resources. A copy of said notification shall also be submitted to the
Chicago Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
9. Notification to FEMA When Physical Changes Increase or Decrease the 100-year
Flood Elevation. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six (6) months after
the date such supporting information becomes available, the Community
Development Department shall notify the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the
changes by submitting a copy of said technical or scientific data.
C. Variance Board:
1. Overview: Variance applications will be reviewed by City staff and discussed in a
public hearing by the Variance Board, which meets on the first Wednesday of each
month, as necessary. Minnesota State Law requires that a decision be issued for
each application within 60 days of the application submission date. Sixty-day
extensions may be obtained if more time is needed to resolve outstanding issues.
2. Application Deadline: Applications must be received by the close-of-business on
the first Friday of each month; applications received after this date cannot be heard
at the Variance Board meeting of the following month. The Variance process takes
about 6 weeks from the application deadline.
3. Submission Requirements: The attached application form must be completed and
submitted with all requested materials. Failure to submit all application materials
may delay the review process described below.
4. Initial Review: Applications will be reviewed for completeness by Community
Development Department staff, and a determination of completeness will be
provided to the applicant in the form of a letter within about 10 days of the
application submittal date. A letter in response to an incomplete application will
identify the materials that are needed in order to complete the application; once all
of the outstanding application materials are received, the 60-day action timeline will
restart. A letter in response to a complete application will outline the schedule for
the formal review and approval process described below.
5. Formal Review: Variance applications may be discussed by a panel of City staff
representing various departments. The members of this panel will address points of
concern based on their respective professional experience; a summary of these
comments will be provided to the applicant and will be reflected in the staff report
presented to the Variance Board.
6. Staff Report: Community Development staff will prepare a report summarizing the
application, reviewing it against the City’s Codes, Ordinances, and policies, and
providing a recommendation for the Variance Board. A copy of this report, along
with the relevant meeting agenda, will be provided to the applicant prior to the
public hearing at the Variance Board meeting.
7. Notice of Public Hearing:
a. Published and Mailed Notices: Minnesota State Law requires published notice
in a City’s legal newspaper a minimum of ten (10) days prior to a public
hearing. City policy further requires that notices be mailed to property owners
within 500 feet of the affected property. Both of these notices are prepared and
sent by the City of Roseville. A copy of the proposed variance application
shall be mailed sufficiently in advance so that the Commissioner of Natural
Resources will receive at least 10-days notice of the public hearing.
b. Posted Signs: Variance applications also require a “Notice of Land Use
Application” sign to be posted on the subject property by the applicant/property
owner at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the public hearing; larger sites
may require additional signs. These signs may be obtained at the Community
Development counter in City Hall; to ensure that it is ready, please call 651-
792-7005 to arrange a time to pick up the sign.
8. Variance Board Meeting: Applicants are encouraged to attend and participate in the
public hearing in order to respond to questions from the Variance Board and/or
members of the public. The public hearing will be held in the City Hall Council
Chambers, which is equipped to display drawings, photographs, video, or other
proposed variance application. Because the hearing will be televised and recorded,
applicants should be prepared to speak into the microphone at the presentation table.
9. At the Public Hearing: The Variance Board Chairperson will call the meeting to
order at the appointed time, Commissioners and representatives of the City in
attendance will be introduced, and the minutes of the previous meeting will be
reviewed. Items requiring public hearings are next. The Chairperson will introduce
the application and City staff will review the issues and recommendations detailed
in the staff report. Members of the Variance Board may ask questions about the
application to be answered by City staff and the applicant. Then members of the
public will be invited to ask questions about the application and to make comments
about the proposal. Once the public comment period has concluded, the Chairperson
will close the public hearing, and the Board Members will discuss the application
and take action.
10. Variance Board Action: The Variance Board has the authority to approve or deny an
application and its decision is final. The Variance Board will provide the rationale
for its decision and adopt a motion approving or denying the variance request. If
the decision is not appealed within the time allowed, the variance becomes
effective, and any necessary building permits may be issued; at this time the
Variance Board resolution will be sent to Ramsey County to be recorded against the
property. The Variance Board decision shall not be contrary to the public interest
and only for those circumstances such as hardship, practical difficulties or
circumstances unique to the property under consideration, as provided for in the
respective enabling legislation for planning and zoning for cities or counties as
appropriate. A copy of all decisions granting variances shall be forwarded to the
Commissioner of Natural Resources, within 10-days of such action. No variance
shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in that district,
permit a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection
elevation for the particular area, or permit standards lower than those required by
state law. The following additional variance criteria of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency must be satisfied:
a. Variances shall not be issued by a community within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
b. Variances shall only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the
granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
c. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
11. Appeals: The decision of the Variance Board may be appealed by the applicant or
by any other Roseville property owner within 10 days of the decision. Appeals are
heard by the City Council which acts as the Board of Zoning Adjustments and
Appeals. An appeal is a matter of public record, but it does not require a public
hearing and no new information will be reviewed as part of the appeal; the Board of
Zoning Adjustments and Appeals will simply review the Variance Board’s
decision-making process to determine whether it complied with City Ordinances
and State Statutes.
12. Flood Insurance Notice and Record Keeping. The Community Development
Department shall notify the applicant for a variance that: 1) The issuance of a
variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage and 2) Such construction below the 100-year or regional flood
level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with
a record of all variance actions. A community shall maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to the Administrator of the National
Flood Insurance Program.
D. Conditional Use:
1. Overview: Conditional Use applications will be reviewed by City staff and
discussed in a public hearing by the Planning Commission, which meets on the first
Wednesday of each month, before a decision to approve or deny the application is
made by the City Council at its regular meeting on the fourth Monday later that
month.
2. Application Deadline: Applications must be received by the close-of-business on
the first Friday of each month; applications received after this date cannot be heard
at the Planning Commission meeting of the following month. Minnesota State Law
requires that a decision be issued for each application within 60 days of the
submission of a complete application.
3. Submission Requirements: The attached application form must be completed and
submitted with all requested materials. Failure to submit all application materials
may delay the review process described below.
4. Escrow Deposit: Because commercial uses can involve a significant amount of
research and analysis by staff and/or outside consultants, the applicant must deposit
$1,000 in escrow in addition to the commercial application fee for a Conditional
Use. If the escrow is drawn down to $500, the applicant will be required to
replenish the account; unused escrow funds will be returned to the applicant at the
conclusion of the Conditional Use process.
5. Formal Review: Conditional Use applications may be discussed by a panel of City
staff representing various departments. The members of this panel will address
points of concern based on their respective professional experience; a summary of
these comments will be provided to the applicant and will be reflected in the staff
report presented to the Planning Commission.
6. Staff Report: Community Development staff will prepare a report summarizing the
application, reviewing it against the City’s Codes, Ordinances, and policies, and
providing a recommendation for the Planning Commission. A copy of this report,
along with the relevant meeting agenda, will be provided to the applicant prior to
the public hearing at the Planning Commission meeting.
7. Notice of Public Hearing:
a. Published and Mailed Notices: Minnesota State Law requires published notice
in a City’s legal newspaper a minimum of ten (10) days prior to a public
hearing. City policy further requires that notices be mailed to property owners
within 500 feet of the affected property. Both of these notices are prepared and
sent by the City of Roseville. A copy of the proposed conditional use
application shall be mailed sufficiently in advance so that the Commissioner of
Natural Resources will receive at least 10-days notice of the public hearing.
b. Posted Signs: Conditional Use applications also require a “Notice of Land Use
Application” sign to be posted on the subject property by the applicant/property
owner at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the public hearing; larger sites
may require additional signs. These signs may be obtained at the Community
Development counter in City Hall; to ensure that it is ready, please call 651-792-
7005 to arrange a time to pick up the sign.
8. Planning Commission Meeting: Applicants are encouraged to attend and participate
in the public hearing in order to respond to questions from the Planning
Commission and/or members of the public. The public hearing will be held in the
City Hall Council Chambers, which is equipped to display drawings, photographs,
video, or other materials. Because the hearing will be televised and recorded,
applicants should be prepared to speak into the microphone at the presentation table.
9. At the Public Hearing: The Planning Commission Chairperson will call the meeting
to order at the appointed time, Commissioners and representatives of the City in
attendance will be introduced, and the minutes of the previous meeting will be
reviewed. Items requiring public hearings are next. The Chairperson will introduce
the application and City staff will review the issues and recommendations detailed
in the staff report. Members of the Planning Commission may ask questions about
the application to be answered by City staff and the applicant. Then members of the
public will be invited to ask questions about the application and to make comments
about the proposal. Once the public comment period has concluded, the Chairperson
will close the public hearing, and the Commissioners will discuss the application
and take action.
10. Planning Commission Action: The Planning Commission does not approve or deny
an application; instead, it makes a recommendation of approval or denial to the City
Council and provides the rationale for its recommendation. The application, along
with the recommendation of the Planning Commission, is then brought to the City
Council which has authority to approve or deny the application.
11. City Council: At the scheduled time, the Mayor will call the meeting to order and it
will progress similar to the Planning Commission meeting. Based on the
recommendation from the Planning Commission in addition to its own review, the
City Council will approve or deny the proposed Conditional Use as an item on the
“Consent Agenda”. At their discretion, however, the City Council may choose to
review the application in greater detail and take public comment, similar to the
public hearing, before ultimately approving or denying the request. A copy of all
decisions granting conditional use permits shall be forwarded by mail to the
Commissioner of Natural Resources within ten (10) days of such action.
12. Procedures for Approving a Conditional Use: The following procedures shall be
followed when considering/approving a Conditional Use within all Flood Plain
Districts.
a. Require the applicant to furnish such of the following information and
additional information as deemed necessary by the Roseville Community
Development Department for determining the suitability of the particular site
for the proposed use:

where necessary, in evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights
and velocities, the seriousness of flood damage to the use, the adequacy of the
plans for protection, and other technical matters.
c. Based upon the technical evaluation of the designated engineer or expert, the
Community Development Department shall determine the specific flood hazard
at the site and evaluate the suitability of the proposed use in relation to the
flood hazard.
13. Factors upon which the Conditional Use shall be based: In approving a Conditional
Use the City shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this
Ordinance, and:
a. The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities
caused by encroachments.
b. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream to the
injury of others or they may block bridges, culverts or other hydraulic
structures.
c. The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these
systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
d. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and
the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
e. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community.
f. The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location.

1021.11: NONCONFORMITIES
A. A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the passage or
amendment of this Ordinance but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this
Ordinance may be continued subject to the following conditions. Historic structures, as
defined in Section 1021.02H21 of this Ordinance, shall be subject to the provisions of
Sections 1021.11A1 – A5 of this Ordinance.
1. No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a way that increases
its nonconformity.
2. Any structural alteration or addition to a nonconforming structure or nonconforming
use which would result in increasing the flood damage potential of that structure or
use shall be protected to the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation in accordance
with any of the elevation on fill or flood proofing techniques (i.e., FP-1 thru FP-4
floodproofing classifications) allowable in the State Building Code, except as
further restricted in 1021.11A3-A6 below.
3. The cost of all structural alterations or additions to any nonconforming structure
over the life of the structure shall not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the
structure unless the conditions of this Section are satisfied. The cost of all structural
alterations and additions must include all costs such as construction materials and a
reasonable cost placed on all manpower or labor. If the cost of all previous and
proposed alterations and additions exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the
structure, then the structure must meet the standards of Section 1021.04 or 1021.05
of this Ordinance for new structures depending upon whether the structure is in the
Floodway or Flood Fringe District, respectively.
4. If any nonconforming use is discontinued for l2 consecutive months, any future use
of the building premises shall conform to this Ordinance. The Assessor shall notify
the Zoning Administrator in writing of instances of nonconforming uses that have
been discontinued for a period of l2 months.
5. If any nonconforming use or structure is substantially damaged, as defined in
Section 1021.02H20 of this Ordinance, it shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance. The applicable provisions for
establishing new uses or new structures in Sections 1021.04 and 1021.05 will apply
depending upon whether the use or structure is in the Floodway, Flood Fringe or
General Flood Plain District, respectively.
6. If a substantial improvement occurs, as defined in Section 1021.02H21 of this
Ordinance, from any combination of a building addition to the outside dimensions
of the existing building or a rehabilitation, reconstruction, alteration, or other
improvement to the inside dimensions of an existing nonconforming building, then
the building addition and the existing nonconforming building must meet the
requirements of Section 1021.04 or 1021.05 of this Ordinance for new structures,
depending upon whether the structure is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District,
respectively.
1021.12: PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION
A. Violation of the provisions of this Ordinance or failure to comply with any of its
requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in
connection with grants of variances or conditional uses) shall constitute a misdemeanor
and shall be punishable as defined by law.
B. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Roseville from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. Such actions may
include but are not limited to:
1. In responding to a suspected Ordinance violation, the Zoning Administrator and
Local Government may utilize the full array of enforcement actions available to it
including but not limited to prosecution and fines, injunctions, after-the-fact
permits, orders for corrective measures or a request to the National Flood Insurance
Program for denial of flood insurance availability to the guilty party. The
Community must act in good faith to enforce these official controls and to correct
Ordinance violations to the extent possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in
the National Flood Insurance Program.
2. When an Ordinance violation is either discovered by or brought to the attention of
the Zoning Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall immediately investigate
the situation and document the nature and extent of the violation of the official
control. As soon as is reasonably possible, this information will be submitted to the
appropriate Department of Natural Resources' and Federal Emergency Management
Agency Regional Office along with the Community's plan of action to correct the
violation to the degree possible.
3. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the suspected party of the requirements of
this Ordinance and all other official controls and the nature and extent of the
suspected violation of these controls. If the structure and/or use is under
construction or development, the Zoning Administrator may order the construction
or development immediately halted until a proper permit or approval is granted by
the Community. If the construction or development is already completed, then the
Zoning Administrator may either: (1) issue an order identifying the corrective
actions that must be made within a specified time period to bring the use or
structure into compliance with the official controls; or (2) notify the responsible
party to apply for an after-the-fact permit/development approval within a specified
period of time not to exceed 30-days.
4. If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the Zoning Administrator
within the specified period of time, each additional day that lapses shall constitute
an additional violation of this Ordinance and shall be prosecuted accordingly. The
Zoning Administrator shall also upon the lapse of the specified response period
notify the landowner to restore the land to the condition which existed prior to the
violation of this Ordinance.
1021.13: AMENDMENTS
A. The flood plain designation on the Official Zoning Map shall not be removed from flood
plain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in error or that the area has
been filled to or above the elevation of the regulatory flood protection elevation and is
contiguous to lands outside the flood plain. Special exceptions to this rule may be
permitted by the Commissioner of Natural Resources if he determines that, through other
measures, lands are adequately protected for the intended use.
B. All amendments to this Ordinance, including amendments to the Official Zoning Map,
must be submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of Natural Resources prior to
adoption. Changes in the Official Zoning Map must meet the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's (FEMA) Technical Conditions and Criteria and must receive
prior FEMA approval before adoption. The Commissioner of Natural Resources must
be given 10-days written notice of all hearings to consider an amendment to this
Ordinance and said notice shall include a draft of the Ordinance amendment or technical
study under consideration.

CHAPTER 1022
ZONING OVERLAY DISTRICT FOR THE TWIN LAKES
REDEVELOPMENT AREA
(Rep. by Ord. 1430, 11/19/12)
CHAPTER 1023
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
SECTION:
1023.01: Purpose and Intent
1023.02: Initiation of Proceedings
1023.03: Reflection on the Official Zoning Map
1023.04: Permitted Locations for PUD Rezoning
1023.05: PUD Qualifications
1023.06: Permitted Uses Within a PUD
1023.07: Areas of Flexibility
1023.08: PUD Review Criteria
1023.09: PUD Review Procedure
1023.10: PUD Amendments
1023.11: PUD Cancellation
1023.12: Administration
1023.01: PURPOSE AND INTENT
A. The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (PUD)zoning district is to provide greater
flexibility in the development of residential and non-residential areas in order to achieve
more creative development outcomes while remaining economically viable and
marketable. This is achieved by undertaking a process that results in a development
outcome exceeding that which is typically achievable through the underlying zoning
district. The City reserves the right to deny establishment of a PUD overlay district and
direct a developer to re-apply under the standard applicable zoning district if it is
determined that proposed benefits do not justify requested flexibilities.
B. Overarching goals (not requirements) of the City in approving a PUD include but are not
limited to:
1. Higher standards of site and building design such that a new development appears
attractive and inviting from all surrounding parcels;
2. Greater utilization of new technologies in building design, construction, and land
development;
3. A more creative and efficient use of land than would otherwise be possible;
4. Incorporation of extensive landscaping and site amenities in excess of what is
required by code;
5. Creation of high-quality park, open space, and trail opportunities that exceed the
expectations established in the Comprehensive Plan;
6. Enhanced access to a convenient and efficient multi-modal transportation option to
service the daily needs of residents at peak and non-peak use levels, with high
connectivity to the larger community;
7. Creative designs that reduce initial infrastructure costs as well as long-term
maintenance and operational costs;
8. The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics (including flora
and fauna, scenic views, and screening);
9. Flexibility in design and construction to alleviate anticipated impacts to nearby
properties and to provide greater opportunity for increased buffers between uses of
differing intensities;
10. Incorporation of structured parking to hide vehicle storage and to promote
opportunities for improved buffering between intensive uses and sensitive areas;
11. Elimination of repetition by encouraging a housing mixture that diversifies the
architectural qualities of a neighborhood;
12. Facilitation of a complementary mix of lifecycle housing; and
13. Accommodation of higher development intensity in areas where infrastructure and
other systems are capable of providing appropriate levels of public services and
subsequently lower intensity in areas where such services are inadequate or where
natural features require protection and/or preservation.
1023.02: INITIATION OF PROCEEDINGS
The owner of property on which a PUD is proposed shall file the applicable application for
approval of the PUD by paying the fee(s) set forth in Chapter 314 of this Code and
submitting a completed application form and supporting documents as set forth on the
application form and within this Section. Complete applications shall be reviewed by City
Commissions as deemed necessary by the Community Development Department, including
a public hearing before the Planning Commission, and be acted upon by the City Council
according to the process set forth in Chapter 108 of this Code. If a proposed PUD is denied,
any subsequent application for a substantially similar PUD within one (1) year of the date of
denial shall fully address all findings which supported the denial prior to being accepted as
complete.
1023.03: REFLECTION ON THE OFFICIAL ZONING MAP
A. PUD provisions provide an optional method of regulating land use which permits
flexibility from standard regulating provisions. Establishment of a PUD shall require
adoption of an ordinance creating an overlay zoning district atop the boundaries of the
development area. For each PUD district, a specific ordinance shall be adopted
establishing all rules which shall supersede underlying zoning. Issues not specifically
addressed by the PUD Overlay District shall be governed by the underlying zoning
district regulations.
B. All PUDs approved prior to April 11, 2016 shall be allowed to continue per the original
conditions of approval.
1023.04: PERMITTED LOCATIONS FOR PUD REZONING
Establishment of a PUD Overlay District may be requested for any area regardless of current
zoning.
1023.05: PUD QUALIFICATIONS
A. Establishment of a PUD will be considered only for areas of land in single ownership or
control. Alternatively, multiple party ownership at the sole discretion of the City, is
acceptable when legally sufficient written consent from all persons and entities with
ownership interest is provided at the time of application.
B Projects eligible for a PUD shall have a site which consists of a parcel or contiguous
parcels of land two (2) acres or more in size. Tracts of less than two (2) acres may be
eligible for a PUD overlay district only if the applicant can demonstrate that a project of
superior design can be achieved, or that greater compliance with the comprehensive plan
goals and policies can be attained through use of the PUD process.
1023.06: PERMITTED USES WITHIN A PUD
A. The extent of permitted land uses within a PUD shall be limited to those land uses that
are either permitted or deemed by the Community Development Department to be
substantially similar to those allowed in the underlying zoning district.
B. Adopted PUD Overlay District regulations may include specific provisions governing
uses which supersede underlying zoning requirements.
C. More than one building may be placed on one lot in a PUD.
1023.07: AREAS OF FLEXIBILITY
Flexibility provided through a PUD will not be approved simply to avoid adherence to
underlying zoning regulations, but instead must be used as a springboard to new
development that would not otherwise be possible utilizing existing zoning standards. Areas
of possible flexibility include the following:
A. Building Placement – including zero lot line construction subject to building code
allowances. Specifications and standards for lots and setbacks shall be at the discretion
of the City Council and shall encourage a desirable living or working environment which
assists in achieving the goals set out for PUDs in Section 1023.01 (B).
B. Trees/Landscaping Requirements – requires specialized landscaping plans that better
address on-site needs and adjacent property concerns than would otherwise be required.
C. Open Spaces – provision of public open spaces that are enhanced with public art and
other amenities to provide a congregation area and a unique sense of place within the
development.
D. Parking Standards – a change in stall or lot configuration requirements in exchange for
structured parking, better screening of parking areas, or higher quality landscaping
throughout a parking area.
E. Exterior Materials – flexibility on exterior materials to allow for unique architectural
expression.
F. Density – up to a 10% increase in residential density if the PUD provides substantially
more site amenities and achieves more comprehensive plan goals than could be achieved
in a conventional development for the applicable land use zone.
G. Other – the City Council reserves the right to consider other modifications to underlying
zoning requirements not listed above provided such changes are supportable under the
PUD review criteria listed in Section 1023.08.
1023.08: PUD REVIEW CRITERIA
The following findings shall be made by the City Council prior to approval of a new or
amended PUD overlay district.
A. The quality of the building and site design proposed by the PUD will substantially
enhance aesthetics of the site and implement relevant goals and policies of the
comprehensive plan.
B. The design creates a unified environment within the project boundaries by ensuring
architectural compatibility of all structures, efficient vehicular and pedestrian circulation,
enhanced landscaping and site features, and efficient use of utilities;
C. The design achieves maximum compatibility with surrounding land uses, both existing
and anticipated, and shall minimize the potential adverse impacts that the PUD and
surrounding land uses may have on one another;
D. The design takes into consideration proposed modification of underlying zoning
requirements and provides appropriate solutions to eliminate adverse impacts that
proposed modifications may impose on surrounding lands.
E. If the proposed PUD involves construction over two or more phases, the applicant has
demonstrated that each phase is capable of being a stand-alone development independent
of other phases; and
F. At least one or more of the following specific goals will be achieved by the proposed
PUD:
1. Sustainability Improvements
Multiple sustainability techniques are incorporated into the development plans
including but not necessarily limited to:
a. Implementation of high-quality construction standards and the use of highquality
construction materials to ensure the longevity of the proposed project;
b. Improvements to reduce the project’s energy load, increase energy efficiency,
and maximize the use of renewable energy sources;
c. Inclusion of facilities to reuse or recycle water for on-site uses such as irrigation;
and/or
d. Enhancement of Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) by maximizing interior
daylight, investment in appropriate ventilation and moisture control, occupant
control over systems such as lighting and temperature, and avoidance of
materials with high VOC emissions.
2. Improved Storm Water Management
Where appropriate, maximize the use of ecologically based approaches to storm
water management, restoration or enhancement of on-site ecological systems, and
protection of off-site ecological systems through the application of Low Impact
Development (LID) practices.
3. Enhanced Buffering
Along property lines that abut different use types, implementation of two or more of
the following techniques:
a. Significant vegetative screening and maintenance of existing vegetation if
possible and appropriate;
b. Increased setbacks; and/or
c. Inclusion of berms, walls, fencing, or a combination of such.
4. Structured Parking
Inclusion of structure parking to minimize land area dedicated to vehicles thereby
maximizing uses elsewhere on the property.

improvement called for by the development agreement.
h. As directed by the City, documents related to the PUD shall be recorded against
the property.
4. Time Limit
a. A PUD shall be validated by the applicant through the commencement of any
necessary construction or establishment of the authorized use(s), subject to the
permit requirements of Title 9 of this Code, in support of the PUD within one (1)
year of the date of PUD Final Plan approval. Failure to meet this deadline shall
render the PUD Final Plan approval void. Notwithstanding this time limitation,
the City Council may approve extensions of the time allowed for validation of
the PUD approval if requested in writing by the applicant; extension requests
shall be submitted to the Community Development Department and shall identify
the reason(s) why the extension is necessary along with an anticipated timeline
for validation of the PUD.
b. An application to reinstate a PUD that was voided for not meeting the required
time limit shall be administered in the same manner as a new PUD beginning
with a PUD Concept Plan [The prerequisite for a previous PUD Sketch Plan
submittal shall not apply, but the required open house in 1023.09(C) must be
held].
1023.10: PUD AMENDMENTS
Approved PUDs may be amended from time to time as a result of unforeseen circumstances,
overlooked opportunities, or requests from a developer. At such a time, the applicant shall
make an application to the City for a PUD amendment.
A. Existing PUD Overlay Districts
Amendments for approved PUD Overlay Districts shall be processed as one of the
following.
1. Administrative Amendment.
The community Development Department may approve minor changes in the
location, placement, and height of buildings if such changes are required by
engineering or other circumstances, provided the changes conform to the approved
Overlay District intent and are consistent with all requirements of the PUD
ordinance. Under no circumstances shall an administrative amendment allow
additional stories to buildings, additional lots, or changes to designated uses
established as part of the PUD. An administrative Amendment shall be
memorialized in a letter signed by the Community Development Director and
recorded against the PUD property.
2. Ordinance Amendment.
A PUD change requiring a text update to the adopted PUD overlay district language
shall be administered in accordance with adopted regulations for zoning code
changes in Chapter 1009. Ordinance amendments shall be limited to changes that
are deemed by the Community Development Department to be consistent with the
intent of the original PUD approval, but are technically necessary due to construction
of the adopted overlay district language.
3. PUD Amendment.
Any change not qualifying for an administrative amendment or an ordinance
amendment shall require a PUD amendment. An application to amend a PUD shall
be administered in the same manner as that required for a new PUD beginning with a
PUD Concept Plan [the prerequisite for a previous PUD Sketch Plan submittal shall
not apply, but the required open house in 1023.09(C) must be held].
B. Pre-existing PUDs Approved as a Special Use Permit
Pre-existing PUDs authorized prior to April 11, 2016 shall continue to be governed per
the original conditions of approval until the PUD is cancelled by the City, or the PUD is
converted to a PUD overlay district. An application to amend a pre-existing PUD shall
be administered in the same manner as that required for a new PUD beginning with a
PUD Concept Plan. [The prerequisite for a previous PUD Sketch Plan submittal shall
not apply, but the required open house in 1023.09(C) must be held].
1023.11: PUD CANCELATTIONS
A PUD shall be cancelled and revoked only upon the City Council adopting an ordinance
rescinding the overlay district or special use permit establishing the PUD. Cancellation of a
PUD shall include findings that demonstrate that the PUD is no longer necessary due to
changes in local regulations over time; is inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan or other
applicable land use regulations; threatens public safety, health, or welfare; or due to other
applicable findings in accordance with law.
1023.12: ADMINISTRATION
In general, the following rules shall apply to all PUDs:
A. Rules and regulations:
No requirement outlined in the PUD review process shall restrict the City Council from
taking action on an application if necessary to meet state mandated time deadlines.
B. Preconstruction.
No building permit shall be granted for any building on land for which a PUD plan is in
the process of review, unless the proposed building is allowed under the existing zoning
and will not impact, influence, or interfere with the proposed PUD plan.
C. Effect on Conveyed Property.
In the event that any real property in an approved PUD is conveyed in total or in part, the
new owners thereof shall be bound by the provisions of the approved overlay district.

application for Minor Plat approval shall not be accepted if it represents the further
subdivision or consolidation of a lot which, itself, is the result of any subdivision or
consolidation approved within five years preceding said application.
3. Validation and Expiration: Adhering to Ramsey County’s Manual of Guidelines for
Subdivision Plats, a Minor Plat approval shall be validated by the owner through the
filing of the approved plat at the office of the Ramsey County Recorder within one
year of the date of the approval. Notwithstanding this time limitation, the City Council
may approve extensions of the time allowed for validation of the Minor Plat approval
if requested in writing; extension requests shall be submitted to the Community

plat.
6. Validation and Expiration of Final Approval: Adhering to Ramsey County’s Manual of
Guidelines for Subdivision Plats, final approval of a Major Plat shall be validated by the
owner through the filing of the approved plat at the office of the Ramsey County
Recorder within one year of the date of said final approval. Notwithstanding this time
limitation, the City Council may approve extensions of the time allowed for validation
of the final approval if requested in writing; extension requests shall be submitted to the
Community Development Department and shall identify the reason(s) why the
extension is necessary along with an anticipated timeline for validation of the final
approval. Final approval of a Major Plat shall automatically expire if the approval is not
validated as described herein.
E. Refusal to Approve
The refusal to approve a plat or platting alternative shall be set forth in the proceedings of
the City Council and reported to the owner. If approval of a proposal is so denied, an
application for approval of substantially the same plat or platting alternative on the
same property shall not be accepted within one year of the date of said denial.
1102.02: VARIANCES
A. Purpose: Regulations pertaining to the process of subdividing or consolidating land and
to the characteristics of the resulting lots are established in Title 11 (Subdivisions) and
Title 10 (Zoning) of this Code. There are occasions, however, where it may be
appropriate to vary the regulations as they apply to specific properties where an unusual
hardship on the land exists, pursuant to Minnesota Statute 462.358 Subd. 6.
B. Applications: The owner of property on which a variance is proposed shall file an
application for approval of the variance by paying the fee set forth in Chapter 314 of
this Code and submitting a completed application form and supporting documents as set
forth on the application form. Complete applications shall be reviewed in a public
hearing according to the process set forth in Chapter 108 of this Code. If a proposed
variance is denied, an application for substantially the same variance on the same
property shall not be accepted within one year of the date of the denial.
C. Approval: The City may impose conditions in the granting of variances. A condition
must be directly related to, and must bear a rough proportionality to, the impact created
by the variance. In order to approve a requested variance, the Planning Commission
may recommend, and the City Council shall adopt, findings pertaining to the following
specific grounds:
1. The proposal is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
2. The proposal is in harmony with the purposes and intent of the zoning and
subdivision ordinances.
3. An unusual hardship on the land exists.
4. The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality.
1102.03: ACCEPTANCE OF ROADWAYS
A. Approval of Plat or Annexation into City Not Considered Acceptance: If any plat or
subdivision contains public roadways which are dedicated as such, whether located
within the corporate limits of the City or outside the corporate limits or contains
existing roadways outside of said corporate limits, the approval of the plat by the City
Council or the subsequent annexation of the property to the City shall not constitute an
acceptance by the City of such roadways, nor the improvements constructed or installed
in such subdivision, irrespective of any act or acts by an officer, agent, or employee of
the City with respect to such roadways or improvements.
B. Acceptance by Resolution of City Council: The acceptance of such roadways shall be
made only by the approval of a resolution by the City Council after there has been filed,
with the City Manager, a certificate by the Public Works Director. The certificate shall
indicate that all improvements required to be constructed or installed in or upon such
roadways in connection with the approval of the plat of subdivision by the City Council
have been fully completed and approved by the Public Works Director, or a cash
deposit or bond is on file to ensure the installation of such required improvements.
However, if it appears to the City Council that a public local improvement will be
constructed in any such roadway within a reasonable foreseeable time, the City Council,
upon the recommendation of the Public Works Director may, by resolution, temporarily
accept such roadway for maintenance by the City, and defer the completion of the
roadway by the owner until such local improvement has been constructed.
1102.04: REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
No final approval of a plat shall be granted by the City Council without first receiving a
report signed by the Public Works Director certifying that the following improvements
described in the owner's preliminary plans and specifications meet the minimum
requirements of all ordinances in the City, and that they comply with the requirements
of the Public Works Design Standards manual;
A. Sewers
1. Sanitary Sewers: Sanitary sewers shall be installed to serve all properties in the
subdivision where a connection to the City sanitary sewer system is available or
where detailed plans and specifications for sanitary sewers to serve the subdivision
are available.

subdivision where a connection to the City storm sewer system is available or where
detailed plans and specifications for storm sewers to serve the subdivision are
available. Where drainage swales are necessary, the soil therein shall be stabilized in
accordance with applicable standards.
3. Development Area Grading and Drainage Plan: The developer shall submit a grading
and drainage plan for the entire area of anticipated development within the plat,
indicating the elevation of proposed houses, surrounding ground, and the direction of
flow. The developer shall not deviate from this plan without first obtaining written
acceptance from the Public Works Director of such changes.
B. Water Supply: Where a connection to the City water system is presently available,
water distribution facilities including pipe fittings, hydrants, valves, etc., shall be
installed to serve all properties within the subdivision.
C. Right-of-Way Grading: The full width of the right-of-way shall be graded, including the
subgrade of the areas to be paved.
D. Roadway Improvements: The following standards shall apply to all City and private
roadways, when newly constructed or reconstructed, as a result of plat approval. All
local residential roadways shall be constructed in conformance with the Public Works
Design Standards manual.
1. All roadways shall be paved, with curb and gutter, in conformance with standards for
the applicable functional classification.
2. Pathways shall be constructed in accordance with the Pathways Master Plan and the
applicable standards of the Public Works Department along the width of a
development site abutting any roadway of functional classification Collector or
greater.

improvement at points specified by the Public Works Department.
4. All unpaved portions of boulevards and medians within the dedicated right-of-way
area shall be graded and the soil therein stabilized in accordance with applicable
standards.
5. Roadway Width
a. To ensure adequate access for emergency vehicles, no roadway shall be
constructed to a width less than 24 feet.
b. Parking Restrictions: For roadways with functional classification of
Collector or greater, on-street parking shall be reviewed by the Public Works
Department. For Local and Marginal Access roadways, "No Parking" signs
shall be installed in accordance to the following:
= 24 feet and < 26 feet No parking on both sides of the street (signs on
both sides).
= 26 feet and < 32 feet No parking on one side of the street (signs on
one side).
= 32 feet Parking permitted on both sides of the street
(no signs needed).
In cases where the specified width is impractical, however, the City
Council may reduce this dimension, as outlined in the City street width
policy.
F. Public Utilities
1. All new electric distribution lines (excluding main line feeders and high voltage
transmission lines), telephone service lines and services constructed within the
confines of and providing service to customers in a newly platted residential area
shall be buried underground. Such lines, conduits, or cables shall be placed within
easements or dedicated public ways. The placement of transformer boxes and other
above ground facilities shall be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer.
2. The City Council may waive the requirements of underground services
as set forth in subsection 1 above if, after study and recommendation by
the Planning Commission, the City Council establishes that such
underground utilities would not be compatible with the planned
development, or unusual topography, soil, or other physical conditions make
underground installation unreasonable or impractical.
1102.05: ARRANGEMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENT
A. Development Agreement: Prior to the acceptance of the final plat, the owner shall enter
into a development agreement with the City.
1. In conjunction with this contract, the owner shall deposit with the Public Works
Director either a cash deposit or a corporate surety performance bond, approved
as to form by the City Attorney, in an amount equal to one and one-half (1 1/2)
times the Public Works Director's estimated cost of said improvements. This
bond shall also have a clause which guarantees said improvements for a period
of one year after acceptance by the City of said improvements. In lieu of this
clause, a separate one year maintenance bond approved as to form by the City
Attorney, shall be submitted to the Public Works Director upon acceptance of
said improvements by the City Council. Upon receipt of this maintenance bond
the performance bond may be released.
2. Where park dedication is required pursuant to Section 1103.06 of this Title, the
development agreement will identify the amount of land, or cash contribution,
or combination of land and cash contribution determined necessary to satisfy the
park dedication requirement. The development agreement will also specify the
time and manner such required dedication is to be made.
B. Improvements: All such improvements shall be made in accordance with the plans and
specifications prepared by a Minnesota licensed engineer and approved by the Public
Works Director, and in accordance with applicable City standards and requirements.
C. Bond: The owner shall deposit with the Public Works Director cash or an approved
indemnity bond to cover all expenses incurred by the City for engineering, legal fees,
and other incidental expenses in connection with the making of said improvements
listed in Section 1102.04. In the event of a cash deposit, any balance remaining shall be
refunded to the owner or applicant after payment of all costs and expenses to the City
have been paid.
D. Roadway Access to Improved Lots Required: It is not the intent of this Section to
require the owner to develop the entire plat, and to make all the required improvements,
at the same time. However, building permits will not be granted for development of lots
without access to roadways on which the required improvements have been made or
arranged for by cash deposit or bond as herein provided.

standards as established in Title 10 of this Code, or of the intended zoning district if the
subdivision is in conjunction with a zoning change, in addition to any requirements
herein defined.
B. Additional Standards for Lots for Single-Family Detached Residences: The shapes of
new lots shall be appropriate for their location and suitable for residential development.
Lots with simple, regular shapes are considered most appropriate and suitable for
residential development.
1. Lots which are appropriate for their location and suitable for residential
development often have:
a. Side lot lines that are approximately perpendicular or radial to the front lot
line(s) of the parcel(s) being subdivided, or
b. Side lot lines that are approximately parallel to the side lot line(s) of the
parcel(s) being subdivided, or
c. Side lot lines that are both approximately perpendicular or radial to the front lot
lines(s) and approximately parallel to the side lot line(s) of the parcel(s) being
subdivided.
2. It is acknowledged; however, that property boundaries represent the limits of
property ownership, and existing boundaries that have complex or unusual
alignments are not easily changed. Subdivisions of such irregularly shaped parcels
may be considered, but the shapes of proposed new lots might be found to be too
irregular, and consequently, applications can be denied for failing to conform
adequately to the purposes for which simple, regular parcel shapes are considered
most appropriate and suitable for residential development.
3. Flag lots are not permitted. A flag lot is a lot with two distinct parts:
a. The “flag pole” is the part of a flag lot that abuts a street with a relatively
narrow strip of land, which fails to conform to the minimum required lot
width, as defined in Section 1001.10 of this Code, and which passes beside a
neighboring parcel.
b. The “flag” is the buildable part of a flag lot, which is connected to the street
by the flag pole, and which is located behind the neighboring parcel.
4. Through Lots: Where lots abut rights-of-way at the front and back, vehicular and
pedestrian access to the lots shall be gained from the roadway of lower functional
classification.
5. Where new principal structures are constructed on lots contiguous to roadways
with functional classification of Minor Arterial or greater, driveways servicing
such lots shall be designed and constructed to provide a vehicle turnaround
facility within the lot.
6. Where new single-family residential lots are created on a new street, the driveway
cut for the new lot must be placed within the new street.
1103.06: PARK DEDICATION
A. Authority: Minnesota Statutes 462.358, subdivisions 2b and 2c permits the City to
require dedication of park land, or cash in lieu of land, as part of the subdivision process
in order to fulfill its plans for recreational facilities and open spaces. The City Council,
at its discretion, will determine whether park dedication is required in the form of land,
cash contribution, or a combination of cash and land. To properly use this authority, the
City will base its determination on existing development, the need created by the
proposed development, and the plans and policies of the City embodied by the Parks
and Recreation System Master Plan, Pathways Master Plan, and Comprehensive Plan.
B. Condition to Approval: Park dedication will be required as a condition to the approval
of any subdivision of land involving one acre or more and resulting in a net increase of
development sites. The Parks and Recreation Commission shall recommend, in
accordance with Statute and after consulting the approved plans and policies noted
herein, either a portion of land to be dedicated to the public, or in lieu thereof, a cash
deposit given to the City to be used for park purposes, or a combination of land and
cash deposit.
C. Park Dedication Amount: The portion of land to be dedicated in all residentially zoned
areas shall be 10% and 5% in all other areas. Park dedication fees shall be reviewed and
determined annually by City Council resolution and established in the fee schedule in
Chapter 314 of this Code, and the fee shall be paid as part of the Development
Agreement required in Section 1102.05 of this Title.
D. Utility Dedications Not Qualified: Land dedicated for required street right-of-way or
utilities, including drainage, does not qualify as park dedication.(Ord. 1530, 7/10/2017)

telecommunications system who has a valid lease agreement with the City to pay rent
and/or other consideration to the City for use of City land to construct and/or operate
such a system, unless such lease agreement specifically states that this subsection A
shall apply. (Ord. 1155, 11-29-94)

and only after a public hearing and at least twenty (20) days' notice to all permittees,
except as hereinafter provided. The City may raise the permit fee more than the

D. Late Payment Penalty: Fees not paid within ten (10) days after the due date shall bear
interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the date due until paid.
E. Acceptance of Payment: The acceptance of any payment required hereunder by the City
shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that the amount paid is the correct amount
due, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim which
the City may have for additional sums due and payable.

communications system shall, at the option of the City be removed from the streets,
public ways and public places at the sole expense of the permittee. (Ord. 1149, 9-12-94)

be certified by a registered survey company.
B. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as a representation, promise or guarantee by
the City that any other permit or other authorization required under the City Code for
the construction or installation of a private communication system shall be issued. The
requirements for any and all other permits as may be required by any City ordinance
shall still apply and all other applicable permit fees shall still be due. (Ord. 1149, 9-12-

permittee shall submit documentation to support the unavailability of existing poles and
a detailed plan for construction ensuring protection for existing facilities.
3. Nothing in this Chapter or any permit issued in accordance herewith, shall be
construed as authorizing the permittee to erect and maintain new poles in areas serviced
by existing poles, if the poles are available for the permittee's use. The permittee shall
obtain written approval from the Engineering Department and other appropriate City
agencies before erecting any new poles or installation of any underground conduits

Acting pursuant to the authority granted to the City of Roseville by the Minnesota State
Legislature pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, Section 160.27, Subdivision 2, the Council of
the City of Roseville does hereby adopt a nonexclusive transit stop shelter franchise
procedure subject to all the terms and conditions set forth in this franchise ordinance.
1207.02: RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF FRANCHISEES:
Any franchise granted by the City under this Ordinance shall grant to the franchisee the right
to install, repair, and maintain transit shelters with affixed advertising, at active transit stop
sites within the City of Roseville, on any street, and county road and state highway right-ofway
with proper permits, at the franchisee’s sole cost and expense for the convenience and
comfort of persons waiting for transit. The transit shelters and advertising displayed thereon
shall be subject to the limits and conditions set forth in this franchise ordinance as may be
amended from time to time by the City.
1207.03: SCOPE OF FRANCHISE:
Upon adoption of an ordinance granting a franchise to a particular franchisee and execution
of the acceptance thereof by the franchisee, the franchisee shall be bound by all the terms
and conditions contained herein. The franchisee shall also provide all services set forth in
its application and by its acceptance of the franchise. In the event of a conflict between the
application made by the franchisee and the provisions of this ordinance, that provision
which provides the greatest benefit to the City in the opinion of the City Council shall
prevail.
1207.04: TERM-RENEWAL:
The franchise shall remain in full force and effect for an initial period as specified by the
grant of the franchise. The initial period shall not exceed ten (10) years; provided, however,
that the City may revoke the franchisee’s right to use or occupy any portion of any street,
alley, right-of-way or other City property. The franchisee may be granted by the City the
option to extend the franchise on such terms and conditions as may be mutually acceptable
to the City and the franchisee, for up to two (2) additional terms. Each additional term shall
be one-half the length of the initial term. The franchisee may exercise each extension option
by providing written notice of such exercise to the City within sixty (60) days prior to the
end of the then current term of the franchise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the franchisee
shall not have the right to exercise an extension option while an uncured default by it exists
with respect to this ordinance.
1207.05: COMMENCEMENT OF TERM:
The franchise term shall commence with the effective date of the ordinance granting a
specific franchise; provided, that the franchisee has filed within thirty (30) days after
publication of this ordinance a written acceptance hereof with the City Manager in such
form as the City Attorney may approve; and provided, that a bond or letter of credit as
specified in Section 22 hereof and the evidence of comprehensive liability insurance, which
are required by this ordinance, shall have been approved and have been filed with the City
Manager within ninety (90) days after the grant of the franchise.
1207.06: AREA:
A franchise is granted for the area of the City of Roseville, as it exists and as its borders may
from time to time be changed, as is specified in the franchisee’s proposal and the ordinance
granting the specific franchise.
1207.07: POLICE POWERS:
In accepting a franchise, the franchisee acknowledges that its rights hereunder are subject to
the police power of the City to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety
and welfare of the public; and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and
ordinances enacted by the City pursuant to such power.
1207.08: OTHER FRANCHISES:
Transit stop shelters with advertising displayed thereon shall only be allowed to occupy or
use a right-of-way of any street or highway within the City of Roseville with and under the
terms of a franchise as granted to a particular franchisee. This shall apply to shelters
constructed by Metro Transit only if the Council specifically determined to make this
ordinance applicable to Metro Transit. The City may grant franchises to multiple persons
during the term of this franchise, subject to the provisions of this ordinance regarding
number and placements of such shelters, and locations as identified in the ordinance
granting the franchise. (Ord. 1318, 04-11-2005)
1207.09: NOTICES:
All notices from the franchisee to the City as required by this franchise ordinance shall be to
the Director of the Department of Public Works unless otherwise stated herein. The
franchisee shall maintain throughout the term of the franchise a local office and address for
service of notices by mail. The franchisee shall also maintain with the City a local office
and telephone number for the conduct of matters related to this franchise open during
normal business hours. The franchisee will provide an emergency phone number for
response after normal business hours. (Ord. 1318, 04-11-2005)
1207.10: BASIC SERVICE, INSTALLATION SCHEDULE & DESIGN:
Franchisees shall furnish, install, repair and maintain safe, clean and attractive illuminated
transit shelters with revenue generating advertisements. In connection therewith,
franchisees shall provide all materials, supplies, equipment, services and personnel at their
sole cost and expense without any cost or expense to the City. All transit shelters shall: (i)
be installed within one hundred eighty (180) days of the City’s issuance of the applicable
permits and licenses, (ii) contain inside lighting to illuminate the inner area of each shelter
from dusk to dawn; and (iii) be equipped with a minimum of one bench and one trash
receptacle to be emptied on a regular basis by the franchisee. The design of the transit
shelters and site plan with improvements therein shall be submitted to and approved by the
Public Works Director. The maximum size of a shelter shall be ten (10) feet in height,
fourteen (14) feet in length, and five (5) feet in width erected upon a concrete pad of a size
approved by the Public Works Director. The length of a shelter shall be determined by the
Public Works Director and shall be dependent upon the number of buses or vehicles and
users that frequent the bus stop. The franchisee shall meet all local, state and federal
requirements applicable to bus shelters, their placement, and their use for public transit
services. (Ord. 1318, 04-11-2005)
1207.11: MAINTENANCE:
Franchisees shall maintain all shelters to the reasonable satisfaction of the Director of Public
Works as set out below. The transit shelters shall be maintained a minimum of once a week
or more frequently and on an as needed basis based on specific site needs at the discretion of
the Director of Public Works with such maintenance to include sweeping, cleaning,
emptying trash receptacles, picking-up litter/debris about the shelter, removing
graffiti/stickers, removal of ice and snow from sidewalks constructed by the Franchisee
leading to public sidewalks in a manner such that each shelter shall be fully accessible
within 12 hours of a snow fall or other weather event. Franchisees shall power-wash the
shelters and sidewalks at least once each month, weather permitting.
Franchisees shall inspect each shelter a minimum of once a week, or more frequently and on
an as needed basis, based on specific site needs for any damaged or broken parts or burnedout
lighting fixtures and franchisees shall repair or replace damaged or broken parts and
burned-out lighting fixtures within forty-eight (48) hours after they become aware of the
damage, breakage, or burn-out, or at the time of weekly maintenance, whichever is sooner.
(Ord. 1318, 04-11-2005)
1207.12: ADVERTISING:
Each transit shelter installed by franchisees shall contain panels for advertising displays as
specified in the franchisee’s proposal and ordinance granting the particular franchise. Such
displays shall be used solely for advertising materials and/or public service announcements.
Franchisees shall use their best reasonable efforts to obtain revenue-generating
advertisements for the advertising display panels, except where unsold advertising panels
shall be available for City use on a space-available basis, and the City will provide the
posters to the Franchisee for posting in the shelters.
Advertising size and placement shall be as follows: The shelter signage may be up to two
(2) four (4) feet by six (6) feet advertising panels in a 2-sided display affixed to the end wall
of the shelter (or parallel to the road on a narrow right of way application) and perpendicular
to the roadway curb or edge viewable from one or both ends of the shelter. Signage on
shelters shall require permits as required by Chapter 703.05 of this code. (Ord.1349, 5-21-
2007)
Except with respect to the quarterly fee payable to the City pursuant to Section 15 hereof,
franchisees shall have the right to retain all revenues generated from the advertising displays
on all transit shelters. Under no circumstances shall any advertising display contain
indecent or vulgar pictures, graphics or language or include advertising for any alcohol or
tobacco products. Franchisees shall not display advertising relating to contraception,
pornography, politics or religion. Franchisees shall remove within forty-eight (48) hours
after their receipt of the City’s written notification requesting such removal, any
advertisements which the City in its reasonable discretion deems to be offensive to the
Community, or in conflict with the City’s health, safety and welfare concerns. In the event
that a franchisee fails to remove such advertisements within such forty-eight (48) hour
period, the City may remove the materials at the franchisee’s sole cost and expense. (Ord.
1318, 04-11-2005)
1207.13: LOCATIONS:
Location of Transit Shelters: A franchisee shall erect transit shelters at those locations that
are mutually agreed upon by the City and the franchisee, but only after a permit is approved
by the Public Works Director. The Public Works Director shall determine the location of
shelters based on need, and so as to assure that shelters do not unnecessarily impede
pedestrian traffic, or line of sight and traffic safety. All transit shelters shall be erected on
public rights-of-way, or private property with written authorization from the property
owner(s), and shall be subject to all rules, regulations and ordinances governing the use of
such rights-of-way. Prior to erecting any such shelters at any locations, the franchisee shall
secure any necessary approval and/or zoning variance that may be required from any
governmental entity. The Public Works and Transportation Commission will review site
applications of the franchisee and hold a hearing for public input regarding proposed
locations.
1207.14: ALTERATION OF SERVICES:
In the event that the City desires at any time to alter or change the nature or character of the
services to be provided by the franchisee and such alteration or change materially increases
the costs and expenses to be incurred by the franchisee or materially reduces the advertising
revenues that can be generated by the franchisee, such alterations or changes shall not be
effective until the City and the franchisee have mutually agreed to and executed an
amendment to this Franchise Ordinance, which amendment may include an adjustment to
the City’s fee under Section 15 hereof.
1207.15: FEE FOR FRANCHISE-MINIMUM FEE:
In consideration of the award of the franchise by the City, franchisees shall pay the City a
fee based upon the annual gross revenue collected that the franchisee derives from
advertising on shelters located within the City in accordance with the terms of the ordinance
granting the franchise and as follows:
Payments and a quarterly report on operations and revenue shall be made thirty (30)
days after the close of each quarter of the year. The “gross revenue” as used in this
ordinance shall mean all advertising revenue derived directly or indirectly by the
franchisee, its affiliates, subsidiaries, a parent company or corporation or any person
in which the franchisee has a financial interest, from or in connection with the
operation of the franchise prior to any deduction; provided, however, that this shall
not include any taxes on services furnished by the franchisee herein imposed directly
upon any advertiser by the City, state or other governmental unit and collected by the
franchisee on behalf of said governmental unit.
1207.16: ACCOUNTS & RECORDS:
A franchisee shall keep books of accounts and records of all transactions and costs incurred
in connection with the purchase, manufacture and installation of the shelters and advertising
on shelters, showing all financial transactions including receipts and disbursements and the
particulars thereof in a form satisfactory to the City of Roseville Finance Director. Such
books and records shall be available to the City for inspection any time during normal
business hours upon forty-eight (48) hours prior written notice thereof to the franchisee. All
such books and records shall be retained by the franchisee for a minimum of five (5) years.
Franchisees shall file annually with the City no later than one hundred twenty (120) days
after the end of the franchisee’s fiscal year, a copy of a financial report applicable to the
Roseville Transit Shelter System, including an income statement relating to its operations
during the fiscal year and a balance sheet, both of which shall be certified as correct by an
independent certified public accountant, and a statement of its properties, equipment and
facilities which are located upon the streets, highways and public places within the City
giving its investment in such facilities on the basis of original cost, less applicable
depreciation. These reports shall be certified as correct by an authorized officer of the
franchisee and shall be submitted along with such other reasonable information as the City
shall request with respect to the franchisee’s facilities and expenses related to its transit stop
shelter system operations within the City.
Franchisees shall also file with the City Manager copies of their articles of incorporation,
bylaws, agreements with any other person relating to the ownership of the transit stop shelter
system, and amendments of such documents as they become effective.
1207.17: INSURANCE AND SECURITY:
Franchisees shall procure and maintain at their own cost the following insurance coverage:
a) Workers compensation insurance in accordance with the Minnesota
Workmen’s Compensation Act.
b) Commercial general liability insurance with minimum limits of $150,000 per
person and $1,000,000 per occurrence.
c) Comprehensive automobile liability insurance with minimum limits for
bodily injury and property damage of $150,000 per person and $1,000,000
per occurrence.
The foregoing insurance coverage shall be procured and maintained with insurers that are
reasonably acceptable to the City. The liability insurance policies shall be endorsed to
include the City as an additional insured. If the above limits are less than those specified in
Minn. Stat. Ch. 466 as the liability limits of a municipality, the higher limits shall apply.
The policy shall be of type in which coverage is restored immediately after the occurrence of
any loss or accident from which liability may thereafter accrue. The policy shall contain an
endorsement which shall provide that no cancellation shall become effective without thirty
(30) days’ prior written notice to the City of intent to cancel or not to renew. In the event
such insurance is cancelled and the franchisee shall fail to immediately replace it with
another equivalent policy, the City may terminate their franchise and declare it to be
forfeited.
1207.18: INDEMNIFICATION:
Franchisees shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the City, its officers, agents,
representatives and employees from and against all liability, claims, demands and expenses
(including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees), on account of any injury, loss or
damage, arising out of or in connection with construction, operation, maintenance, location,
or removal of any transit stop shelter owned by franchisee. (Ord. 1318, 04-11-2005)
1207.19: CITY RESPONSIBILITIES:
The City shall provide franchisees with all available information (including the location of
road right-of-way and utilities) which is relevant to the Transit Shelter Program together
with the necessary guidance and direction to achieve the Program’s objectives. In
consideration of the City’s use of the transit shelters at no cost, the City hereby assures
access to and use of the nearest electrical power and waives all permit and use fees for each
transit shelter covered by this Ordinance. Provided that each transit shelter complies fully
with the provisions of this Ordinance and all applicable provisions of the City’s Municipal
Code, all necessary permits for the installation and/or maintenance of the transit shelters
shall be granted by the City. The process for obtaining such permits shall be expedited by
all city departments to assure that shelters are installed within one hundred eighty (180)
days.
1207.20: RESERVED:
1207.21: ASSIGNMENT OR TRANSFER:
A franchisee shall not assign or transfer its rights, duties and obligations under the franchise,
in whole or in part, without first obtaining the written consent of the City, provided,
however, that the City’s consent shall not be required with respect to any assignment by the
franchisee to any person or entity that controls, is controlled by, or under common control
with the franchisee or which merges with or into the franchisee or acquires substantially all
of the assets of the franchisee.
1207.22: PERFORMANCE BOND OR OPTIONAL LETTER OF
CREDIT:
A franchisee shall post with the City a performance bond guaranteeing its performance of
the obligations of the franchise, as created by this ordinance, and the ordinance granting the
particular franchise. The amount of the bond shall be as specified in the Ordinance granting
the particular franchise. The bond shall be issued by a company licensed to do business in
Minnesota, and shall be in a form acceptable to the City Attorney. In lieu of the
performance bond the franchisee may elect to give the City an irrevocable letter of credit in
the bond amount issued by a bank in the metropolitan area. The letter of credit shall provide
that it may be drawn upon under the same circumstance as a surety would be subject to a
claim under its performance bond, except that the letter of credit shall be subject to a draw
without any previous demand upon, or notice to the franchisee. The letter of credit shall
also be subject to a draw if it is effective for a limited term and is not replaced by a
replacement letter of credit at least thirty (30) days before expiration. The letter of credit
shall also be in a form approved by the City attorney and shall be on file with the City
Manager and remain so until three hundred sixty-five (365) days after the expiration or
termination of the franchise. The City shall give the Franchisee seven (7) days’ notice of its
intent to draw on a letter of credit.
1207.23: REMOVAL OF SHELTER:
Franchisees shall within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from the City remove
any transit shelters that are located at discontinued transit stop sites or which the City
reasonably determines are in condition of substantial disrepair or deteriorated condition such
as to pose a health or safety hazard or diminution of value to the abutting properties.
Additionally, franchisees shall relocate any transit shelters within thirty (30) days after their
receipt of a written request to do so by the City as a result of redevelopment, traffic hazards
or changes in bus routes. Any such relocation of a transit shelter shall be to a location
mutually agreeable to both parties, but only after issuance of all necessary permits by the
Director of Public Works.
1207.24: PUBLIC WORKS TO REGULATE INSTALLATION:
The Director of Public Works shall regulate the installation of transit shelters and if, in the
opinion of the Director of Public Works, a shelter installation is hazardous, the Director may
order a franchisee to take necessary steps at its own cost to remove or relocate the shelter or
make the necessary repairs to correct the hazard. The Director of Public Works shall have
the right to conduct reasonable inspections of shelters for this purpose.
In regulating the installation of shelters, the Director of Public Works shall regulate the size
of shelters installed, its orientation or placement on the site, and any preparatory or remedial
site work. When the City has approved a location plan, a franchisee shall submit detailed
amended plans showing any discrepancies between the site plan approved and the work
completed.
1207.25: FORFEITURE:
A. The City shall, in addition to any other rights it may have, have the right to declare that a
franchisee has forfeited a franchise in the event of a substantial breach of its terms and
conditions, including, but not limited to, the following circumstances:
(1) If the franchisee becomes insolvent or is declared bankrupt or makes any
assignment for the benefit of its creditors; and
(2) If the franchisee assigns or transfers or attempts to assign or transfer the
franchise, or sells or leases or attempts to sell or lease any of its shelters
without the Council’s permission; or
(3) If the franchisee fails to install shelters on schedule as required by this
Franchise Ordinance or the grant of the particular franchise, or fails to
conform to the specifications contained in its application or the invitation for
applications, or fails to construct the shelters in a workmanlike manner to the
satisfaction of the Director of Public Works and in conformity with City
ordinances and codes, or if the franchisee refuses or neglects when so ordered
to take down, rebuild or repair any defective or unsatisfactory work or to
maintain the shelter as required herein; or
(4) If the franchisee fails to remove any shelter when ordered to do so in
accordance with this ordinance; or
(5) If the franchisee refuses or neglects to comply with any reasonable order of
the Director of Public Works; or
(6) If the franchisee persists in any course of conduct in violation of any of the
provisions of this ordinance; or
(7) If the City receives notice of intention not to renew or the franchisee fails to
keep in force its insurance, required herein.
B. The Director of Public Works may make a written demand by certified mail that a
franchisee comply with any such provision, rule order or determination under or
pursuant to this franchise. Such notice shall be entitled “Forfeiture and Termination
Notice.” If the violation by the franchisee continues for a period of thirty (30) days
or more following such written demand, without having been corrected or remedied,
the matter of forfeiture and termination of the franchise shall then be taken before the
City Council. The City shall cause to be served upon the franchisee at least twenty
(20) days prior to the date of such Council meeting a written notice of intent to
terminate the franchise, including the time and place of the meeting. Public notice
shall be given of the meeting and the issue which the Council is to consider. The
City Council, or a committee thereof, shall hear and consider the issue and the
Council shall, in its discretion, determine whether there has been a substantial
breach. If the Council determines that there has been a substantial breach, the
franchisee shall have such period of time as the Council may set, but not less than
thirty (30) days in which to cure the substantial breach; provided, that no opportunity
for cure need be given for fraud or misrepresentation or for circumstances which
may immediately adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare. At the
expiration of the period of time set for compliance, the Council may terminate the
franchise forthwith upon finding that the franchisee has failed to cure the breach.
C. Unless otherwise approved by the City, upon termination of this franchise, the
franchisee shall remove all transit shelters and support equipment and apparatus
installed by it pursuant to this Franchise Ordinance, within sixty (60) days of
termination. However, the Director of Public Works may grant permission to the
Franchisee to leave all or any portion of the infrastructure on terms and conditions
established by the Director. If, after ninety 90 days of the termination date, the
franchisee has not removed all equipment and facilities that may be located along,
over or under any street or highway within the City, the franchisee shall forfeit said
improvements to the City. The performance bond or letter of credit posted in
accordance with Section 22 shall remain posted to insure that the streets, highways
and public places from which such equipment is removed shall be placed in good
condition. (Ord. 1318, 04-11-2005)
1207.26: DISPOSITION OF SHELTERS ON EXPIRATION OF
FRANCHISE:
A. In the event that the franchise expires and is not renewed, the City may purchase
the shelters and facilities then in place upon such terms and for such
consideration as may be agreed to by the City and the franchisee prior to the
expiration of the franchise. If prior to the expiration of the franchise or within
ninety (90) days following such expiration the City elects to award a franchise to
any other person or company, and the City elects to have the new franchisee
operate and maintain the shelters which have been installed pursuant to this
franchise, then the new franchisee shall purchase such shelters on such terms and
for such consideration as may be agreed to by the new franchisee and the prior
franchisee.
B. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph A of this section, in the event that
the term of this franchise expires and the City and franchisee have not renewed
the franchised for an additional term, the franchisee shall at its own expense
remove all of the shelters and facilities which it has installed or caused to be
installed upon or below the public streets and highways or public places of the
City and shall restore the streets and highways of the City to their former
condition in a manner satisfactory in the judgment of the Director of Public
Works. If the franchisee fails to remove all such shelters and facilities within
ninety (90) days after the expiration of the franchise, the City may have the
shelters and facilities removed and require the franchisee to pay the cost of such
removal. In the event that the shelters and facilities have not been sold pursuant
to paragraph A of this section or removed by the franchisee, all right and title to
the shelters shall be deemed to have passed to and vested in the City. The
franchisee agrees that in such circumstances it will execute such documents as
the City Attorney may require to transfer the title to such shelters and facilities.
1207.27: NONDISCRIMINATION:
The franchisee, its agents, employees, contractors and subcontractors shall at all times
comply with the provision of the City of Roseville Code and applicable state and federal law
regarding nondiscrimination and civil rights in connection with its services provided
pursuant to this Franchise Ordinance. (Ord. 1324, 08-08-2005)
1207.28: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this ordinance is for any
reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion
shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not
affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof.
1207.29: INCORPORATION IN ROSEVILLE CITY CODE:
This Ordinance shall be deemed a part of the Roseville City Code and shall be incorporated
therein as Appendix Chapter 1207.
