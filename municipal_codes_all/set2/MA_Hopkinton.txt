§ 55-1. Findings; purpose.  
It has been determined by the Hopkinton Police Department that the number of false alarms received by the Department significantly increase departmental expenses, hinders its efficiency and lowers the morale of the Department. This situation endangers the general public, homeowners, businesses and Hopkinton police officers. It is intended that the following article will reduce the number of false alarms and promote the responsible use of alarm devices in the Town of Hopkinton. 
§ 55-2. Definitions.  
A. Words used in the present tense include the future; words used in the plural number include the singular number, and words used in the singular number include the plural number. The word shall is always mandatory and not discretionary.  
B. For the purposes of this article, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivatives shall have the meaning given herein, when not inconsistent with the context:  
ALARM SYSTEM -- An assembly of equipment and devices or a single device such as a solid state unit which plugs directly into a 110 volt AC line, arranged to signal the presence of a hazard requiring urgent attention and to which police are expected to respond. Fire alarm systems and alarm systems not directly related to the detection of an unauthorized intrusion into property or premises or an attempted robbery at property or premises are specifically excluded from this article.  
 
ALARM USER or USER --Any person on whose premises an alarm system is maintained within the town, except for alarm systems on motor vehicles or proprietary systems. Excluded from this article are central station personnel and persons who use alarm systems to alert or signal persons within the premises in which the system is located of an attempted unauthorized intrusion or holdup attempt. If such a system, however, employs an audible signal emitting sounds or a flashing light or beacon designed to signal persons outside the premises, such system shall be within the definition of "alarm system" as that term is used in this article and shall be subject to this article.  
 
AUTOMATIC DIALING DEVICE -- Refers to an alarm system which automatically sends over regular telephone lines, by direct connection or otherwise, a prerecorded voice message or coded signal indicating the existence of an emergency situation that the alarm system is designed to detect.  
 
CENTRAL STATION -- An office to which remote alarm and supervisory signaling devices are connected, where operators supervise circuits or where guards are maintained continuously to investigate signals.  
 
COMMUNICATIONS CONSOLE and DIRECT CONNECT -- An alarm system which has the capability of transmitting system signals to, or receiving them at, the Hopkinton Police Department communications center. 
  
FALSE ALARM -- Activation of an alarm system through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation or negligence of the user of an alarm system or his employees or agents, or any signal or oral communication transmitted to the Police Department requesting, requiring or resulting in a response on the part of the Police Department, when in fact there has been no unauthorized intrusion or attempted unauthorized intrusion into any property or premises and no attempted robbery or burglary at any property or premises. Excluded from this definition are activation of alarm systems caused by power outages, motor vehicle accidents, act of God, telephone repairmen and similar situations.  
 
INTERCONNECT -- To connect an alarm system to a voice-grade telephone line, either directly or through a mechanical device that utilizes a standard telephone, for the purpose of using the telephone line to transmit an emergency message upon the activation of the alarm system.  
 
POLICE CHIEF -- The Chief of Police of the Town of Hopkinton or designated representative.  
 
POLICE or POLICE DEPARTMENT --The Town of Hopkinton Police Department or any authorized agent thereof.  
 
PUBLIC NUISANCE --Anything which annoys, injures or endangers the comfort, repose, health or safety of any considerable number of persons or of any community or neighborhood.

§ 55-3. Administrative rules.  
 
A. Alarm systems may be connected to the communications console in the Police Department.  
B. If such systems are so connected, the alarm company shall furnish, at no cost to the town, a communications console and the necessary telephone lines which are compatible to the receipt of alarm signals from alarm systems whose lines are connected to the Police Department. The alarm company shall set forth the annual fee each alarm user will be required to pay the alarm company for services rendered with respect to the communications console.

If the said user, due to absence from the Town or any other reasonable basis, requests an extension of the time for filing the report, the Police Chief may extend the fifteen-day period for a reasonable period. If the said user fails to submit such a report within 15 days or within any such extended period, the Police Chief may order that use of the alarm system be discontinued. Any such discontinuance shall be effectuated within 15 days from the date of receipt of the Police Chief's order.  
C. In the event the Police Chief determines that a report submitted in accordance with Subsection B of this section is unsatisfactory or that the alarm user has failed to show by the report that he has taken or will take reasonable steps to eliminate or reduce false alarms, then the Police Chief may order that use of the alarm system be discontinued. Any such discontinuance shall be effectuated within 15 days from the date of receipt of the Police Chief's order.  
D. In the event the Police Department records five false alarms within any calendar year from an alarm system, the Police Chief may order that the user of the alarm system discontinue use of the alarm system for the remainder of the calendar year or for six months from the date the alarm was disconnected, whichever of such period is longer. In the event that the Police Department records eight false alarms within any calendar year from an alarm system, the Police Chief may order that the user of the alarm system discontinue use of the alarm system for one year from the date the alarm was disconnected.  
E. Any user of an alarm system which transmits false alarms shall be assessed a fine of $50 for each false alarm in excess of three occurring within any calendar year. All fines assessed hereunder shall be paid to the Town Treasurer for deposit in the general fund. Upon failure of the user of an alarm system to pay two consecutive fines assessed hereunder within 60 days of assessment, the Police Chief may order that the user discontinue use of the alarm system. Any such discontinuance shall be effectuated within 15 days from the date of receipt of the Police Chief's order.

Any user of an alarm system who has, in accordance with this section, been ordered by the Police Chief to discontinue use of an alarm system may appeal the order of discontinuance to the Board of Selectmen. Notice of an appeal shall be filed with the Board of Selectmen within 10 days of the date of the order of discontinuance. Thereafter the Board shall consider the merits of the appeal and in connection therewith shall hear evidence presented by all interested persons. After hearing such evidence, the Board may affirm, vacate or modify the order of discontinuance.

GENERAL REFERENCES:  Zoning -- See Ch. 210. 
 
§ 96-1. Purpose. 
 
A. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive review procedure of plans for earth removal which may affect traffic, environmental quality, water resources, drainage and community character with the objective that the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare is protected. This chapter shall apply to all earth removal activities in the Town of Hopkinton, except as otherwise set forth herein. It shall apply to all areas regardless of zoning district. 
 
B. Due to the fact that earth removal activities involve the degradation of a natural resource of value to the Town and that alteration of the natural environment and its resources will impact other resources and the environment as a whole, applicants for earth removal permits must demonstrate that the earth removal activity will not have a material detrimental impact on natural resources, such as groundwater quantity and quality, wildlife habitats, natural drainage patterns, viewsheds and wetlands. 
 
§ 96-2. Definitions. 
 
  As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: 
 
 BOARD -- The Planning Board of the Town of Hopkinton. 
 
 EARTH -- All forms of soil, including, without limitation, loam, sand, gravel, clay, peat, hardpan  or rock. 
 
 LOAM -- Soil consisting of a mixture of sand, clay, silt and organic matter. 
 
 LOT -- A single piece or parcel of land lying in a solid body, under single, joint or several  ownerships and separated from contiguous land by property lines or street lines. 
 
 OWNER -- The owner of record of the land with respect to which earth is sought to be removed,  or the person lawfully standing in the stead of such owner. 
 
 REMOVAL -- Stripping, digging, excavating or blasting earth on a lot and removing or carrying it  away from said lot. 
 
 SURPLUS -- An amount or quantity in excess of what is needed or required. 
 
§ 96-3. General requirements. 
 
The following requirements shall apply to all earth removal activities, whether or not a permit is required. The Board shall have the authority to waive any of the requirements listed below, on a case-by-case basis: 
 
A. Grades at the conclusion of the earth removal operation shall not be in excess of one foot in vertical rise for every three feet of horizontal distance (3:1). Grades in excess of 3:1 may be allowed only with a waiver from the Board. When reviewing waiver requests, the Board will consider the final appearance of the lot and surrounding areas with the intent that a natural appearance, natural drainage patterns and sufficient erosion control will be maintained or established. 
 
B. Proper and reasonable surface drainage of the land affected by earth removal operations shall be assured during and after the removal operations. The applicant shall provide assurance that earth is kept out of streams and drainage-ways and that accumulated earth shall be removed at periodic intervals during and upon the conclusion of the earth removal operation. If the erosion control system includes any structural devices, these structural devices shall be in place and stabilized before excavation can begin in the affected area. All structures shall be inspected and maintained by the owner in accordance with the approved plan and the capacity of the structural device. 
 
C. At the conclusion of the earth removal operation, or of such portion thereof as the Board deems appropriate, the whole area where removal has taken place shall be covered with not less than eight inches of loam and seeded with a suitable cover crop, except where ledge rock is exposed, and all large stones and boulders which protrude above the finished grade shall be removed or buried. Alternatives to this method of restoration shall be subject to the prior approval of the Board. 
 
D. In no event shall any loam be stripped and/or removed from any land in an amount which exceeds the eight inches of loam required by Subsection C of this section. 
 
E. The depth of excavation for any earth removal operation shall not be closer than seven feet above the spring high-water table, as determined by observation of soil profiles or test wells.

B. Equipment replacement/removal. 
 
(1) After a leak is confirmed, underground tanks (or piping) must be emptied immediately and removed or repaired forthwith, under the direction of the Fire Chief. 
 
(2) A leaking tank that is 20 years old or older that does not comply with the design standards in § 119-5A (2) must be removed and may not be repaired. A permit for its removal must be obtained in accordance with MGL c. 148, § 38A. 
 
(3) A leaking tank that is less than 20 years old must be repaired or removed. If the tank operator can show to the satisfaction of the Fire Chief that (in the case of steel tanks) the leak was from internal corrosion, and that the tank can be repaired so as not to pose a continuing threat to the soils and waters of the commonwealth, considering at a minimum the corrosivity of the soil; tank age and external condition; techniques to be used for the repair; and the location of the tank, then the tank may be repaired. Operators of leaking FRP tanks must demonstrate to the Fire Chief that the tank can be repaired according to 
manufacturer's instructions. Operators who do not meet these requirements must remove the tank. 
 
(4) If it is necessary to replace an underground steel tank that has developed a corrosion-induced leak, all other steel tanks at the facility of the same age or older, whether they are leaking or not, shall be repaired or replaced with tanks that meet the requirements of § 119-5A of this chapter.

Tank owners must submit to the Fire Chief and the licensing authority a statement certifying satisfactory leak detection results over the period of the permit (in accordance with § 119-6B of this chapter), and inventory verification, at least 30 days before the issuance of a permit renewal for the time periods specified herein. Test results must accompany the permit renewal application. 
 
D. Fees necessary for the issuance and renewal of permits or licenses shall be set by the Board of Selectmen. 
 
E. The Fire Chief or his designee may, at all reasonable times and upon reasonable notice to the occupant of the premises, enter any premises, public or private, for the purpose of investigating, sampling or inspecting any record, condition, equipment, practice or property relating to activities subject to this chapter and may, at any time and upon reasonable notice to the occupant of the premises, enter such premises for the purpose of protecting the public health or safety or to prevent damage to the environment.

A copy of the rules and regulations adopted by the Commission shall be provided, free of charge, to all owners of property situated within the District.  Such rules and regulations may include the adoption of a schedule of fees to cover the costs associated with the administration and review of any application which is filed under this chapter. 
 
§ 123-8. Applications for certificates. 
  
The Commission shall determine within 14 days after the filing of an application for a certificate of appropriateness, a certificate of non-applicability or a certificate of hardship, whether the application involves any exterior architectural features which are subject to approval by the Commission.

§ 125-1. Intent and purpose. 
 
The purpose of this chapter is to establish a procedure for reviewing requests to demolish significant structures in order to record and, if appropriate, preserve the historical, cultural, and architectural heritage and character of Hopkinton. It is the intent of the Hopkinton Historical Commission that the procedures outlined in this Chapter provide an opportunity for all parties to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution. [Amended ATM 5-6-2013, Art. 44] 
 
§ 125-2. Definitions. 
 
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: 
 
APPLICANT -- Any person or entity who files an application for review under this chapter. If the applicant is not the owner of the premises upon which the structure is situated, the owner must indicate on or with the application his/her assent to the filing of the notice or application. 
 
BUILDING INSPECTOR -- The Hopkinton Director of Municipal Inspections, Local Inspector, or person(s) otherwise authorized to issue demolition permits. 
 
COMMISSION -- The Hopkinton Historical Commission. 
 
DAY -- Any calendar day, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. 
 
DEMOLITION -- Any voluntary act involving the pulling down, destroying, burning, removing, or razing in any manner whatsoever, of a structure, in whole or in part; commencing any work involving the partial, substantial or total destruction of a structure; or allowing the same to be done by others. 
 
DEMOLITION PERMIT -- Any permit, including, without limitation, a demolition, alteration or building permit issued by the Director of Municipal Inspections, as required by the State Building Code, that authorizes the demolition of a structure or component thereof, with or without the intent to replace the structure or component so affected; but excluding, however, the demolition of only the nonstructural portions of the exterior or all interior components, or both. 
 
PREFERABLY PRESERVED SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURE -- Any structure which, after hearing by the Commission, is determined to be a significant structure and in the public's interest to preserve or rehabilitate under this chapter. 
 
SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURE -- Any structure which may be worthy of preservation by reason of the fact it may have been constructed, in whole or in part, 75 or more years prior to the application date, and it is determined by the Commission to be either: 
 
A. Associated in some material respect with a person or event which has contributed to the cultural, political, economic, social, or architectural history of the Town, the Commonwealth, or the United States of America; or  
 
B. Historically or architecturally important (in terms of period, style, construction, or material association with an architect or builder), either by itself or in the context of a group of structures. 
 
STRUCTURE -- Any combination of materials giving support or forming a shelter for persons, animals, or property, and/or including, without limitation, such other buildings, signs, walls, fences, statues, monuments, bridges, burial markers or other combinations of building materials. The word "structure" shall be construed, where appropriate, as though followed by the words "or part or parts thereof." 
 
§ 125-3. Procedure. [Amended ATM 5-6-2013, Art. 44] 
 
A. Demolition Delay  


 
(1) No demolition permit for the demolition of any structure shall be issued without the prior compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 


 
(2) Upon receipt of an application for a demolition permit for any structure, the Building Inspector shall transmit a copy of the application to the Commission. 


 
(3) Within 14 days of receipt of the application, the Commission shall determine if the structure is a significant structure. The Commission shall notify the Building Inspector and the applicant in writing of this initial determination. If the structure is not determined to be a significant structure, the Building Inspector may proceed to issue a demolition permit in accordance with all applicable codes and regulations. 


 
(4) If the structure is determined to be a significant structure, the Commission shall hold a public hearing within 30 days of this initial determination to determine whether the structure should be preserved. Notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be given once in a local newspaper, at least seven days before such hearing and by posting a notice in the Town Hall for a period of at least seven days before such hearing, and by mailing a notice of hearing to the applicant and all immediate abutters to the property upon which the structure is situated. 


 
(5) The Commission shall make a determination as to whether the structure should be classified as a preferably preserved significant structure within 10 days of the close of the public hearing. The applicant, the Building Inspector, and the Town Clerk shall be provided with a copy of the written determination. 


 
(6) If the Commission determines the structure is not worthy of classification as a preferably preserved significant structure, the applicant may apply for the necessary permits to begin demolition.  


 
(7) If the Commission determines the structure is worthy of classification as a preferably preserved significant structure, no further demolition permits may be applied for or issued with respect to such structure, for a period of six months from the date of such written determination. 


 
(8) During such six-month period, the Commission will invite the applicant (and the owner of record, if different from the applicant) to participate in an investigation of alternatives to demolition. If acceptable alternatives are agreed upon by the Commission and the applicant, the Commission will file a copy of said agreement with the Building Inspector and Town Clerk and the applicant may apply for necessary permits to begin work. Work shall only be done in accordance with the terms of the agreement unless and until new permit applications are filed and processed hereunder. 


 
(9) If the Commission is satisfied that there is no feasible alternative to demolition, the Commission may so advise the applicant, the Building Inspector, and the Town Clerk in writing, at any time during this six-month period, and the Building Inspector may issue a permit to demolish the structure in accordance with all applicable codes and regulations. 


 
(10 In the event that the structure will be demolished, the applicant is encouraged to allow a representative or agent of the Commission to enter upon the premises for the purpose of documenting the historically significant features of the structure. Such documentation could include photographs, videotape recording, or making measurements of the structure. 


 
(11 An applicant may submit a request for a determination from the Commission as to whether a structure is a preferably preserved significant structure without filing an application for a demolition permit with the Building Inspector. The Commission shall follow the procedures set forth in § 125-3C through G in this chapter in making such determination. The determination and agreement, if any, shall be valid for a period of two years, during which time the application for a demolition permit may be submitted to the Building Inspector, and a demolition permit issued without reapplication to the Commission, so long as such permit is consistent with the determination and/or agreement. 


 
B. Information 


 
The Planning Board, Conservation Commission and Board of Appeals shall transmit to the Commission in electronic format copies of all applications proposing the development or alteration of land that contains a structure as defined in this Chapter.  Such applications shall be transmitted within five days of receipt of a complete application.  The Community Preservation Committee shall transmit copies of all applications for funding to the Commission if such application relates to land that contains a structure. 
 
§ 125-4. Emergency demolitions. 
 
Nothing in this chapter shall restrict the demolition of a significant structure which the Building Inspector shall have determined presents a danger to the public health, welfare or safety and which only demolition can abate. Such a determination shall be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of the State 
Building Code and after consultation with the Commission Chairperson or designee. Whenever an emergency demolition permit is issued under the provisions of this section, the Building Inspector must file a written report with the Commission describing the condition of the structure and the basis for the determination. 
 
§ 125-5. Enforcement and remedies. [Amended ATM 5-7-2018, Art. 43] 
 
A. The Commission and the Building Inspector are both authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter. 
 
B. The Building Inspector shall not issue a permit of any type pertaining to any property on which a significant structure has been demolished without first fully complying with the provisions of this chapter for a period of two years from the date of demolition.  
 
C. Any person who demolishes a building or other structure subject to this Article, or any component of such building or structure, without first obtaining and complying fully with the provisions of a demolition permit, may be penalized by noncriminal disposition as provided by M.G.L. c.40, §21D and Chapter 1, Section 1-4 of the Towns General Bylaw. The non-criminal disposition penalty shall be $300, each day or portion thereof during which a violation continues, or unauthorized demolition occurs, shall be considered a separate offense; provided, however, that at no point shall the fines imposed, which are attributable to the same demolition permit, be greater than the assessed value of the property. 
 
D. Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Building Inspector or the Commission may appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals within 30 days from the date of receipt of such written administrative decision or action. 
 
§ 125-6. Administration. 
 
A. The Commission may adopt such rules and regulations as are necessary to administer the terms of this chapter. 
 
B. The Commission is authorized to adopt a schedule of fees to cover the costs associated with the administration and review of any application which is filed under this chapter. 
 
§ 125-7. Severability. 
 
If any provision of this Chapter is determined to be invalid or unconstitutional for any reason by any court or other tribunal of appropriate jurisdiction, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall be construed as narrowly as possible, and the balance of the Chapter shall be deemed to be amended to the minimum extent necessary, so as to secure the intent and purpose thereof, as set forth in Section 125-1.

Any party shall be given an opportunity to enter into a payment agreement, thereby allowing the licensing authority to issue a certificate indicating said limitations to the license or permit, and the validity of said license shall be conditioned upon the satisfactory compliance with said agreement.

ARTICLE I 
Private Sewage Treatment Plants 
[Adopted 4-11-1988 ATM, Art. 24] 
 
 
§ 163-1. Statement of public policy and purpose. 
 
A. The Town of Hopkinton does not intend to become the owner or operator of small sewerage treatment plants proposed or in operation in subdivisions or garden apartment complexes. Keeping a sewerage treatment plant, the interconnecting piping, controls, equipment in top operating condition and performing the necessary monitoring and sludge removal is time-consuming and expensive. In addition, expensive retro-fill actions to meet new standards may be required by the state or federal government in the future. 
 
B. Further, the Town sewer system, which started construction in 1987, is limited in the amount of sewerage that can be processed and will not be available to provide service to the subdivisions and garden apartments that have failed private sewerage treatment plants. The owners of property served by these private sewerage treatment plants own and operate the plants and are financially and legally liable for their proper operation and maintenance. Potential buyers should fully investigate the potential costs and effects on resale of the property. 
 
§ 163-2. Actions required. 
 
A. The seller (property owner) or realtor showing the property will warn any potential buyer that the property is serviced by a private sewerage treatment plant and will explain fully the responsibilities, liabilities and potential operating and equipment replacement costs. 
 
B. The seller or realtor will give all potential buyers a copy of this article on the first visit to the property. The seller or realtor will keep a written record that proper notification has been given. 
 
C. The Board of Health will approve the wording of the sewerage treatment plan ownership provisions to be included in the property deed. 
 
D. The Board of Health shall require a funded reserve to be maintained at all times sufficient to protect the financial interests of the Town and ensure the public safety concerns over improperly operated or maintained privately owned sewerage treatment plants. 
 
§ 163-3. Severability. 
 
If any provision(s) of this article or the application of such provision(s) to any person, partnership or corporation or circumstances shall be held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this article and applicability of such provision(s) to persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

§ 163-4. Assessments. [Amended 5-1-2000 ATM, Art. 66] 
 
The Town of Hopkinton, acting through its Board of Selectmen, shall assess the owners of land abutting a public sewer line installed by the Town by a rate based upon any or a combination of the methods set forth in MGL c. 83, § 14 and § 15. Sewer assessments shall be determined by the Board of Selectmen and approved by Town Meeting and shall be levied as betterment assessments and/or sewer privilege fees as described herein. 
 
§ 163-5. Statutory authority. 
 
The authority to assess betterments, as well as the permitted methodologies for doing so, are described in MGL c. 80, Betterments, and c. 82, Sewers, Drains, and Sidewalks, § 14 and § 24. 
 
§ 163-6. Severability. 
 
If any provision of these regulations or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of these regulations which can be given effect without such invalid provisions or applications. 
 
§ 163-7. Method of assessing betterments; order of assessment. [Amended 5-1-2000 ATM, Art. 66] 
 
A. The Town of Hopkinton shall assess sewer betterments based upon any or a combination of the methods referred to in MGL c. 83, § 14 and § 15. Those properties abutting a sewered street which are assessed based upon the uniform unit method, shall be assessed by a rate proportional to the value assigned to the sewer unit at the time of the assessment. Said rate shall be determined by user class and shall apply to all lands developed or undeveloped abutting the sewered street. Those properties abutting a sewered street which are assessed based upon the fixed uniform rate method shall be assessed according to the frontage of such land on any way in which a sewer is constructed, or according to the area of such land within a fixed depth from such way, or according to a 
combination of both such frontage and area. Said rate shall apply to all lands developed or undeveloped abutting the sewered street. The total assessments shall not exceed the local share of the total sewer project cost which shall include total costs of engineering survey and design, construction, land acquisition, construction engineering services, legal services and all related contingencies less all state and federal aid received. 
 
B. The Board shall levy, by preparing an order of assessment, assessments against all properties abutting a sewered street. In the order of assessment, the Board shall designate the owner of each parcel, as of the preceding January 1, as liable to assessment as stipulated under the provisions of the General Laws. 
 
§ 163-8. Time of assessment. 
 
A. Betterments. The equivalent monetary value of one sewer unit shall be set at $4,000 for the Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 sewer construction projects. The equivalent monetary value of one sewer unit for the Phase 4 and Phase 5 sewer construction project shall be set at $15,840. For the Phase VI Sewer Construction Project, the betterment assessment shall be allocated by the fixed uniform rate method utilizing a combination of the area and frontage method such that area shalt constitute 75% of the calculation and frontage shall constitute 25% of the calculation. Appropriations for the construction cost of sewer projects may establish a differing equivalent monetary value of one sewer unit to be used for the construction costs of the appropriation. The time of assessment for lands abutting the sewered street shall be that date upon which the sewer system with appurtenances is approved for use. In the case where the construction of that portion of the sewer system (lateral sewers) partially funded by betterments is completed prior to the date upon which the sewer system is approved for use, it shall be within the powers of the Board to establish an earlier date of assessment. [Amended 9-28-1998 STM, Art. 5; 9-25-2000 STM, Art. 2] 
 
B. Sewer privilege fees. 
 
(1) For those properties not abutting the sewer line but tying into the system at a future date, the time of assessment shall be the date upon which that property connects into the sewer system. 


 
(2) For those properties serviced by the sewer system but subdivided at a future date, the time of assessment for the unsewered subdivision shall be the date upon which those subdivisions connect to the sewer system. 


 
C. The Phase VI Sewer Assessments shall be based upon 100% of the cost of the design and construction of the Phase VI Sewer Facilities, less any grants, gifts, or other funds received by the Town which reduces such amount, but including interest costs incurred by the Town with respect to any short-term borrowing for the project, and shall be assessed as betterments to all properties benefited by this project. [Added 9-25-2000 STM, Art. 2] 


 
§ 163-9. Sewer unit designation. 
 
A. General. Sewer units shall be designated based upon the user class of those properties to be assessed a betterment. Said classes shall include residential and nonresidential.

  (b) Duplex dwellings shall comprise two sewer units. 
 
  (c) Three-family dwellings shall comprise three sewer units. 
 
  (d) Four-family dwellings shall comprise four sewer units. 
 
(e) Multiple family dwellings (in excess of four dwelling units) shall comprise a number of sewer units based on the following methodology: 
 
[1] Rental properties (apartments) shall be assessed one sewer unit for each apartment with more than one bedroom. Rental properties shall be assessed on half of one sewer unit for each one-bedroom or studio apartment. 
 
[2] Condominium complexes shall be assessed one sewer unit for each dwelling unit. 
 
 (2) Nonresidential, developed. 
 
(a) Nonresidential property shall include all industrial, commercial and municipal properties. 
 
(b) [Amended 5-1-2000 ATM, Art. 66] Nonresidential buildings which are metered for water use shall comprise a number of sewer units based upon the average water consumption for the 12 months most recently preceding the date of the establishment of the assessment using the following formula: 
 
Nonresidential sewage 
in gallons per day (gpd) = equivalent number 
300 gpd                of sewer units 
 
(all decimals shall be rounded up to the next whole highest number). 
 
(c) Nonresidential buildings not metered for water use shall be assigned a water consumption volume based on Title 5 (Part 2, Section 13) of the State Environmental Code for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Minimum Requirements for the Subsurface Disposal of Sanitary Sewage. An equivalent number of sewer units shall then be determined by using the following formula: 
 
Nonresidential sewage 
in gallons per day (gpd) = equivalent number 
240 gpd               of sewer units 
 
(all decimals shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number). 
 
(3) Residential undeveloped. Undeveloped lots shall be assigned one sewer unit and be assessed accordingly. Future subdivisions of the assessed lot shall be subject to the assessment of sewer privilege fees. 
 
(4) Nonresidential, undeveloped. Undeveloped lots shall be assigned one sewer unit and be assessed accordingly. The lot shall be subject to the assessment of sewer privilege fees. Future use of the land shall govern the assessment of sewer privilege fees. 
 
§ 163-10. Betterment payment. 
 
A. General. Except as herein provided, the provisions of the General Laws relative to the assessment, apportionment, division, reassessment, abatement and collection of sewer assessments, to liens therefor and to interest thereon, shall apply to assessments made under this article, and the Tax Assessor of the Town shall have all of the powers conveyed by the General Laws. 
 
B. Lump-sum betterment. The lump-sum betterment payment for an assessed property shall be equivalent to the product of the total number of sewer units designated upon said property and the appropriate value for one sewer unit at the time of assessment. Said values shall be determined as described herein. 
 
C. Apportionment of betterment payment. Property owners shall have the option to finance betterment payments through apportionment. The interest rate charged by the Town shall be 2% greater than the project bond rate being paid by the Town for the sewer construction project. 
 
D. Betterment deferral. The provisions of MGL c. 80, § 13B, with regard to deferral of betterment assessments when adopted by Town Meeting would apply. 
 
E. Any dwelling which is located within the Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 municipal sewerage system which is existing as of the date on which the municipal sewerage system is completed within the way adjacent to said premises, and which must install a pressure pump to enter into the municipal sewerage system, shall pay a betterment assessment in the sum of $1,500, and any sums previously paid for betterment assessments in excess of that amount shall be refunded to the property owner by the Town by any appropriate means. Any property which is located within the Phase 4 or Phase 5 municipal sewage system and which has a low pressure sewer system, or any property which must install a pumping system to connect to the Phase 4 or Phase 5 sewer system, shall pay a betterment assessment in the sum of $12,340. [Added 5-3-1993 ATM, Art. 44; amended 9-28-1998 STM, Art. 5] 
 
§ 163-11. Sewer privilege fee. 
 
 A. Private sewer extension. 
 
(1) If a developer or a person other than the Town of Hopkinton, or duly authorized representative of same, constructs a sewer extension to the public sewer system in a phase of the sewer construction project which has been assessed a sewer betterment based upon the uniform unit method, the Town shall assess a sewer 
privilege fee in lieu of betterment assessment against each property tying into said sewer extension. The sewer privilege fee shall be equivalent to 90% of the calculated betterment assessment value pertinent to each property as determined following the procedure outlined in § 163-9 of these regulations. The sewer privilege fee for Phase 4 and Phase 5 of the sewer construction project shall be the sum of $14,256. Sewer privilege fees shall be levied at the time of connection to the public sewer system. Property owner options for payment of said fees shall reflect those related to payment of betterment assessments as described in § 163-10B and C of these regulations. [Amended 9-12-1994 STM, Art. 18; 9-28-1998 STM, Art. 5; 5-1-2000 ATM, Art. 66] 
 
(2) In addition, the developer and/or property owners connecting to private sewer extension shall bear the burden of all costs, including costs of legal services, related to the following:

(c) Application fees for a building sewer installation permit, which shall include all reasonable costs related to installation inspection performed by an inspector for the Town of Hopkinton. 
 
(3) Costs associated with the design and construction of a private sewer extension shall be considered separate to the sewer privilege fee. Payments or method of payment related to these costs shall not be reflected within the sewer privilege fee. 
 
B. For those properties which are located within areas included in phases of the sewer construction project which have been assessed a sewer betterment based upon the uniform unit method, if a property abuts a private or unaccepted way within which a public sewer has been installed, the Town shall assess the betterment assessment as described in § 163-10 of this article against said property. All rules and regulations governing the payment and the method of payment relating to betterment assessments as described in § 163-10B and C of these regulations shall apply. For the Phase 4 and Phase 5 sewer construction project, if a property abuts a private or unaccepted way within which a public sewer has been installed or if a property lies within 100 feet of a public sewer within a private or unaccepted way, the Town shall assess a sewer privilege fee in the sum of $14,256. The sewer privilege fee shall be levied at the time of the connection to the public sewer. All rules and regulations governing the payment and method of payment related to betterment assessments as described in § 163-10B and C of these regulations shall apply. [Amended 5-5-1993 ATM, Art. 43; 9-28-1998 STM, Art. 5] 
 
C. Compensatory sewer privilege fee. 
 
(1) Undeveloped property. In the situation where a betterment has been assessed to an undeveloped property based upon the number of sewer units required by these regulations and said property is ultimately developed to accommodate a number of sewer units in excess of the number used for determining the betterment assessment, the Town shall 
assess a compensatory sewer privilege fee. For the Phase 4 and Phase 5 sewer construction project, in the situation where a betterment has been assessed to an undeveloped property based upon the number of sewer units required by these regulations and said property is ultimately developed to accommodate a number of sewer units in excess of the number used for determining the betterment assessment, the Town shall assess a compensatory sewer privilege fee of $14,256. [Amended 9-28-1998 STM, Art. 5] 
 
(2) In the situation where a betterment has been assessed to a developed nonresidential property based upon the number of sewer units required by these regulations and the usage of said property is changed or increased which results in a number of sewer units in excess of the number used for determining the betterment assessment, the Town shall assess a compensatory sewer privilege fee. For the Phase 4 and Phase 5 sewer construction project, in the situation where a betterment has been assessed to developed nonresidential property based upon the number of sewer units required by these regulations and usage of said property is changed or increased which results in a number of sewer units in excess of the number used for determining the betterment assessment, the Town shall assess a compensatory sewer privilege fee of $14,256. [Amended 9-28-1998 STM, Art. 5] 
 
(3) The compensatory sewer privilege fee shall be equivalent to that sum of money that would have been charged as a betterment assessment upon the property at the time of the original assessment, under the conditions to which they have changed or increased, less the amount of the original assessment. The compensatory sewer privilege fee shall be the product of the number of sewer units applicable to a property as ultimately developed multiplied by the sewer privilege fee amount for the applicable phase of the sewer construction project. [Amended 10-21-2002 STM, Art. 14] 
 
(4) All rules and regulations governing the payment and method of payment related to betterment assessments as designated in § 163-10B and C of these regulations shall apply.

STORMWATER -- Any surface flow, runoff or drainage resulting entirely from any form of natural precipitation. 
 
§ 171-3.  Responsibility for Administration. 
 
The DPW and Planning Board shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of Chapter 171. Any powers granted to the DPW or the Planning Board by this Chapter, except the power to hear appeals, may be delegated in writing by (respectively) the DPW Director or the Planning Board to other employees or agents of the Town.

A. Prohibition of Illicit Discharges. 
 
No person shall commence, allow, conduct or continue any illicit discharge.  
 
B. Prohibition of Illicit Connections.

C. Prohibition of Obstruction of Municipal Storm Drain System. 
 
No person shall obstruct or interfere with the normal flow of stormwater into or out of the municipal storm drain system without prior written approval from the DPW.   
 
§ 171-5.  Notification of Releases. 
 
Any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation, who has information of any known or suspected release of materials at that facility or operation that are resulting or may result in illicit discharges shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of a release of hazardous material, that person shall immediately notify the Hopkinton Fire Department and shall notify the DPW within two hours. In the event of a release not involving hazardous material, that person shall notify the DPW no later than the next business day. For all releases, the initial notification shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed, or hand-delivered, to the DPW within two business days. 
 
§ 171-6.  Enforcement. 
 
A. Enforcement Orders. 
 
If any person violates or fails to comply with any of the requirements of Chapter 171, the DPW may order compliance by written notice to the responsible person via certified mail or hand delivery. The order shall include the name and address of the alleged violator, the address at which the violation is occurring or has occurred, a statement specifying the nature of the violation, a description of the actions needed to resolve the violation and come into compliance, the deadline within which such actions must be completed, and a statement that, if the violator fails to come into compliance by the specified deadline, the Town may do the work necessary to resolve the violation at the expense of the violator.  In addition, said order may require: 
. Elimination of illicit connections or illicit discharges; 

. Performance of monitoring, analyses and reporting;  

. Remediation of contamination caused by the illicit connection or illicit discharge; and  

. The implementation of source control or treatment measures. 


 
B. Appeals. 
 
Any person aggrieved by an enforcement order issued pursuant to Section 171-6.A may request a hearing before the Planning Board by submitting to the DPW and Planning Board, within 30 days of such order, a letter explaining why the order was not justified. The Planning Board shall thereupon schedule and hold a hearing regarding such request and, upon the close of such hearing, may uphold, modify or rescind the order as the facts and applicable law may require.  The Planning Boards decision shall be deemed its final action with respect to the matters determined, and any further appeal shall be to a court of competent jurisdiction. 
 
C. Action by the Town to Remedy a Violation. 
 
If a violator fails to come into compliance by the deadline specified in an enforcement order, the DPW may do the work necessary to resolve the violation at the joint and several expense of the violator and property owner.  For situations involving an immediate threat, the DPW may remove an illicit connection immediately and take such other action as is necessary to protect public health, safety or the environment.  Written notice of any remediation action undertaken by the DPW shall be provided to the property owner by hand within 48 hours of the commencement thereof or by certified mail postmarked no later than the next business day. 
 
D. Recovery of Costs. 
 
If the DPW undertakes remediation work pursuant to Section 171-6.C, it shall, within 30 days after completing the work, notify the violator and the property owner in writing of the costs incurred by the Town, including administrative costs, associated with that work. The violator and the property owner shall be jointly and severally liable to repay the Town for those costs within 30 days of receipt of that notice; provided, however, that the violator or the property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount or basis of costs with the DPW and Planning Board within such 30 days. The Planning Board shall schedule and hold a hearing regarding such protest and, upon the close of such hearing, may uphold, modify or rescind the costs required to be repaid, as the facts and applicable law may require.   
 
If the amount due is not received by the Town by the expiration of the time in which to file such a protest, or within 60 days after the final decision of the Planning Board or (if appealed to court) a court of competent jurisdiction resolving that protest, the amount of the Towns costs shall constitute a lien on the property pursuant to M.G.L. Chapter 40, Section 58.  Interest shall accrue on any unpaid costs at the statutory rate, as provided in M.G.L. Chapter 59, Section 57.  
 
E. Civil Relief. 
 
If a person violates any provision of Chapter 171 or an order issued thereunder, the Town  may seek injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction restraining the person from activities that would create further violations or compelling the person to abate or remedy the violation.   
 
F. Criminal Penalty. 
 
Any person who violates any provision of Chapter 171 or any order issued thereunder may be punished by a fine of not more than $300.00.  Each day or part thereof that such violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate offense.  A criminal complaint may be filed by the DPW or Planning Board, with the authorization of the Board of Selectmen. 
 
G. Non-Criminal Disposition (Ticketing). 
 
As an alternative to criminal prosecution, the DPW or Planning Board may elect to utilize the non-criminal disposition procedure set forth in Chapter 1, Section 1-4 of these Bylaws. The penalty for the first violation shall be $100.00. The penalty for each subsequent violation shall be $300.00.  Each day or part thereof that such violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate offense.   
 
H. Entry to Perform Duties Under this Bylaw. 
 
To the extent permitted by law, or if authorized by the owner or other party in control of the property, the Town and its agents, officers and employees may enter privately owned property for the purpose of 
performing their duties under Chapter 171 and may make or cause to be made such examinations, surveys, sampling, or remedial activities as the Town deems reasonably necessary.

§ 174-13. Abutters. 
 
The Town may only perform such repairs, reconstruction, or improvements on a private way upon the occurrence of any of the following events: the request of the Planning Board to the Board of Selectmen; the request of the Director to the Board of Selectmen; or at least 80% of the owners of properties which abut the way to be repaired have signed a petition to the Board of Selectmen requesting that such repairs to the way be performed. Such petition must state that the public convenience and necessity require such repairs, reconstruction and improvements and shall request that the Director make an investigation of the condition of the way and report the findings to the Board of Selectmen. 
 
§ 174-14. Easements. 
 
If any easements are necessary for the completion of such repairs, reconstruction or improvements, the owners of the properties abutting the way and the owners of any land or interest in land upon which such easement would be required, shall be responsible for the cost of the preparation and the grant of such easements to the Town. Such easement shall include the grant of the right to the Town, its agents, contractors and employees, to enter upon the way for the performance of the work. 
 
§ 174-15. Approval and method of payment. 
 
Upon receipt of a request from the Director, or from the Planning Board, or upon receipt of a petition from the owners of abutting properties, the Board of Selectmen shall review the report of the Director, and determine whether such repairs, reconstruction or improvements are required for the public health or safety, the protection of the environment, and the public convenience and necessity, and, if it so determines, the Board of Selectmen may approve the project and determine whether such repairs, reconstruction or improvements shall be paid by the abutters by a cash deposit; shall be paid by the abutters by betterment charges which shall be assessed to the abutters; shall be paid partly by the abutters and partly by the Town by the assessment of betterment charges for a portion of the work; or shall be paid by the Town. In the event the Board of Selectmen determines that the project should be funded in whole or in part by the assessment of betterments or by a cash deposit from the abutters, the Board of Selectmen shall hold a public hearing on such determination within 30 days thereof. The Board of Selectmen shall notify the owners of the properties abutting the way by regular mail at least seven days prior to the date of the hearing, and shall cause notice of such hearing to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town at least seven days prior to the date of the hearing. Such notices shall indicate that the Board of Selectmen is considering the assessment of betterments or a cash deposit to fund the project. The Board of Selectmen shall make the decision on the request and the method of payment therefor, within 60 days of the close of the public hearing. If the appropriation of funds or the assessment of betterments is necessary, the Selectmen shall thereupon submit an article to the next ensuing Town Meeting for approval by the Town of the repairs, reconstruction or improvements to the way and the method of payment therefor. 
 
§ 174-16. Board of Selectmen action. 
 
If the appropriation of funds, the assessment of betterments or a cash deposit is not to be required in conjunction with the project, the Board of Selectmen shall review the request at a public meeting within 21 days of receipt of the request, and shall make a decision on the request within 45 days of its receipt. 
 
§ 174-17. Liability of town. 
 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Town shall not be liable for any claim, damage, loss, cost, liability, or expense, of any name, nature or description, including attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or as a result of the repairs, reconstruction or improvements performed on any private way by the Town or any damage resulting therefrom, including that to third parties. The Board of Selectmen may in relation to any such project as it deems appropriate, require the owners of the properties abutting the way to execute an agreement pursuant to which all such owners agree to save, indemnify and hold harmless the Town from any and all such claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities or expenses, including attorney's fees, arising out of or as a result of such repairs, reconstruction or improvements. 
 
§ 174-18. Ways to be open to public use. 
 
The ways upon which the Town may perform any such repair, reconstruction or improvement, must have been open to public use for no less than one year prior to the date of the vote of the Board of Selectmen which approves such project or which authorizes the submission of the article relating thereto to the Town Meeting. 
 
§ 174-19. Standard of work. 
 
All work to be performed by the Town on any such way pursuant hereto must be to the standards established by the Department of Public Works of the Town. 
 
§ 174-20. Basis for assessment of betterments. 
 
In the event the Town Meeting authorizes such repair, reconstruction or improvement to such way, and authorizes the assessment of betterments for all or a portion of the cost of such work, it shall determine the percentage of project cost to be assessed, and such assessments shall be made based upon either the fixed uniform rate method using the linear frontage of each lot on the street as the standard for computation, or the uniform unit method, pursuant to which each existing or potential lot abutting the way shall constitute a unit. 
 
§ 174-21. Town Meeting appropriation of funds. 
 
No repair, reconstruction or improvement requiring an appropriation of funds shall be made to any way pursuant hereto unless and until the Town Meeting has appropriated any funds necessary for the project. 
 
§ 174-22. Minor repairs. 
 
Upon the request of the Director, the Planning Board or the owners of properties abutting a way, the Board of Selectmen, based on the recommendation and report and the certification of the Director that the funds necessary for the project are available, may authorize the Town to make minor repairs to private ways to a sum not to exceed $1,000 in total on any way in any one fiscal year.

ARTICLE VII 
Driveways 
[Added 5-2-2005 ATM, Art. 33] 
 
§ 174-25.  Construction of Driveways. 
 
 This Article shall apply to all driveway permits issued after the adoption of this Article.  No driveway permit shall be issued unless the requirements of this Article shall have been complied with.   The provisions of this Article shall not apply to roadways or driveways in Garden Apartment or Village Housing developments. [Amended 5-1-2017 ATM, Article 49] 
 
§ 174-26.  Permits. 
 
Any person, organization, public agency or other entity proposing the construction of a driveway shall first obtain a driveway permit from the Department of Public Works.  The Department may require the submission of an application, fee, and other materials containing such information which it determines to be necessary prior to issuing a permit. 
 
§ 174-27.  Regulations 
  
A. The slope of a driveway within 20 feet of the edge of the pavement of a public or private way shall not exceed 10%.   


 
B. No driveway which has been permitted under this Article shall discharge stormwater runoff into a public or private way so as to cause flooding, icing, erosion or sedimentation, accumulation of debris, or other negative effects which impair the use and function of the way for the general public.  If, in the opinion of the Director of Public Works (the Director), the use and function of a  way has been so impaired, the property owner shall be responsible for mitigating the  condition by  implementing such measures as are necessary to prevent the discharge into the  way.  Prior to the implementation of mitigation measures, the owner may consult the Director to review those measures which would be implemented outside the way.  The Director must approve any measures which would be implemented within the layout of the way. 


 
C. As part of its driveway permit review process, the Department of Public Works (DPW) will ensure that the roadway opening at the public or private way is adequate for proper public safety emergency vehicle access.  The DPW will consult with the Fire Department for its input as it deems necessary.  After issuance of the driveway permit and a Building Permit, the Director of Municipal Inspections will conduct a site visit to review the layout of the driveway once it is roughed in and 
before project completion, to ensure that it is adequate for proper public safety emergency vehicle access.  The Director of Municipal Inspections shall consult with the Fire Department if it appears that public safety emergency vehicle access may be impaired.  In those instances where the Fire Department has been consulted and determines that a public safety emergency vehicle cannot adequately access the property, the driveway permit holder shall prepare a plan for accommodating safety vehicles that is acceptable to the Fire Department and the Director of Municipal Inspections, and shall be responsible for implementing the plan prior to issuance of an occupancy permit. [Added 5-5-2008 ATM, Art. 28] 
D.  No driveway permit shall be issued without the written approval of the Fire Department, which may be subject to such conditions as the Fire Department may deem necessary for the protection of the public health and safety. The Fire Department shall prepare publicly available driveway permit guidelines and parameters that it shall consider in its review of every driveway permit application. [Added 5-1-2017 ATM, Article 49] 
§ 174-28.  Enforcement

§199-12 Assessments.  
 
The Town of Hopkinton, acting through its Board of Selectmen, shall assess the owners of land abutting a public water line installed by the Town by a rate based upon any or a combination of the methods set forth in MGL c. 40, §§ 42G, 42H, 42I or 42K. Water assessments shall be determined by the Board of Selectmen and approved by the Town Meeting and shall be levied as betterment assessments and/or water privilege fees as described herein.  
 
§199-13 Statutory Authority. 
  
The authority to assess betterments, as well as the permitted methodologies for doing so, are described in MGL c. 40, §§ 42G, 42H, 42I and 42K.  
 
§199-14 Severability. 
  
If any provision of these regulations or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of these regulations which can be given effect without such invalid provisions or applications.

A. The Town of Hopkinton shall assess water betterments based upon any or a combination of the methods referred to in MGL c. 40, §§ 42G, 42H, 42I and 42K.  Those properties abutting a street which is served by the town water distribution system and which are assessed based upon the uniform unit method, shall be assessed by a rate proportional to the value assigned to the water unit at the time of the assessment.  Said rate shall be determined by user class and shall apply to all lands developed or undeveloped abutting the street. Those properties abutting a street which is served by the town water distribution system and which are assessed based upon the fixed uniform rate method shall be assessed according to the frontage of such land on any way in which a water main is constructed, or according to the area of such land within a fixed depth from such way, or according to a combination of both such frontage and area. Said rate shall apply to all lands developed or undeveloped abutting the street. The total assessments shall not exceed the local share of the total water project cost which shall include total costs of engineering survey and design, construction, land acquisition, construction engineering services, legal services, interest, and all related contingencies less all state and federal aid received.  


 
B.   The Board shall levy, by preparing an order of assessment, assessments against those properties abutting a street which is served by the town water distribution system as it deems appropriate. In the order of assessment, the Board shall designate the owner of each parcel, as of the preceding January 1, as liable to the assessment as stipulated under the provisions of the General Laws.  
 
§199-16 Time of Assessment. 
  
A. Betterments  The equivalent monetary value of one water unit shall be established for the water main extension construction project based upon the local share of the cost of the project as indicated 


in §199-15A of this Chapter.  Appropriations for the construction cost of water projects may establish a differing equivalent monetary value of one water unit to be used for the construction costs of the appropriation.  The time of assessment for lands abutting the street in which the water main has been installed shall be that date upon which the water system with appurtenances is approved for use. In the case where the construction of that portion of the water system partially funded by betterments is completed prior to the date upon which the water system is approved for use, it shall be within the powers of the Board to establish an earlier date of assessment. 


 
B. Water Privilege Fees 


 
(1)  For those properties not abutting the water line but tying into the system at a future date, the time of assessment shall be the date upon which that property connects into the water system.  
 
(2)  For those properties serviced by the water system but subdivided at a future date, the time of assessment for the portions of the subdivision which receive water in the future shall be the date upon which those subdivisions connect to the water system.  
 
C.  The water main extension water assessments shall be based upon 100% of the cost of the design and construction of the water facilities, less any grants, gifts, or other funds received by the town which reduces such amount, but including interest costs incurred by the town with respect to any short-term borrowing for the project, and shall be assessed as betterments to all properties benefited by this project.  
 
§199-17 Water Unit Designation. 
  
A. General. Water units shall be designated based upon the user class of those properties to be assessed a betterment. Said classes shall include residential and nonresidential.  The nonresidential class shall include commercial, industrial, municipal and any or all other nonresidential properties.  


 
B. Water Unit Determinations. Properties receiving direct benefit from the public water system, whether developed or undeveloped, shall be designated a number of water units in accordance with the following:

    Nonresidential Water 
   in gallons per day (gpd)   =  Equivalent number 



              300 gpd         of water units  

  


(All decimals shall be rounded up to the next whole highest number).  
 
(3)  Residential Undeveloped  Undeveloped lots shall be assigned one water unit and be assessed accordingly. Future subdivisions of the assessed lot shall be subject to the assessment of water privilege fees.  

  


(4)  Nonresidential, Undeveloped  Undeveloped lots shall be assigned one water unit and be assessed accordingly. The lot shall be subject to the assessment of water privilege fees. Future use of the land shall govern the assessment of water privilege fees.  
 
§199-18 Betterment Payment. 
  
A.  General  Except as herein provided, the provisions of the General Laws relative to the assessment, apportionment, division, reassessment, abatement and collection of water assessments, to liens therefore and to interest thereon, shall apply to assessments made under this article, and the Tax Assessor of the town shall have all of the powers conveyed by the General Laws.  
 
B.  Lump-sum Betterment  The lump-sum betterment payment for an assessed property shall be equivalent to the product of the total number of water units designated upon said property and the appropriate value for one water unit at the time of assessment. Said values shall be determined as described herein.  
 
C.  Apportionment of Betterment Payment  Property owners shall have the option to finance betterment payments through apportionment. The interest rate charged by the town shall be 2% greater than the project bond rate being paid by the town for the water construction project.  
 
D.  Betterment Deferral  The provisions of MGL c. 80, § 13B, with regard to deferral of betterment assessments when adopted by Town Meeting would apply.  
 
  
§199-19 Water Privilege Fee  
 
A. Private Water Extension  
 
(1)  If a developer or a person other than the Town of Hopkinton, or duly authorized representative of same, constructs an extension to the public water system in a phase of the water construction project which has been assessed a water betterment based upon the uniform unit method, the town shall assess a water privilege fee in lieu of betterment assessment against each property tying into said water extension. The water privilege fee shall be equivalent to 90% of  the calculated betterment assessment value pertinent to each property as determined following the procedure outlined in § 199-17 of these regulations. Water privilege fees shall be levied at the time of connection to the public water system. Property owner options for payment of said fees shall reflect those related to payment of betterment assessments as described in § 199-18B and 18C of these regulations.  
  



(2)  In addition, the developer and/or property owners connecting the private water extension shall bear the burden of all costs, including costs of legal services, related to the following:  
 
(a)  Review of design plans and specifications for the private water extensions to be accepted as part of the public water system conducted by a registered professional engineer as authorized by the Board.  
 
(b)  Inspection fees of the Board related to the installation of the private water extension tying into the public water system.  
 
(c)  Application fees for a building water installation permit, which shall include all reasonable costs related to installation inspection performed by an inspector for the Town of Hopkinton.  
  



(3)  Costs associated with the design and construction of a private water extension shall be considered separate to the water privilege fee. Payments or method of payment related to these costs shall not be reflected within the water privilege fee.  
 
B.  For those properties which are located within areas included in phases of the water construction project which have been assessed a water betterment based upon the uniform unit method, if a property abuts a private or unaccepted way within which a public water main has been installed, the town shall assess the betterment assessment as described in §199-18 of this article against said property.  All rules and regulations governing the payment and the method of payment relating to betterment assessments as described in §199-18B and 18C of these regulations shall apply.  
 
 
C.  Compensatory Water Privilege Fee  
 
(1)  Undeveloped Property  In the situation where a betterment has been assessed to an undeveloped property based upon the number of water units required by these regulations and said property is ultimately developed to accommodate a number of water units in excess of the number used for determining the betterment assessment, the Town shall assess a compensatory water privilege fee.  
 
(2)  In the situation where a betterment has been assessed to a developed nonresidential property based upon the number of water units required by these regulations and usage of said property is changed or increased which results in a number of water units in excess of the number used for determining the betterment assessment, the Town shall assess a compensatory water privilege fee.  
 
(3)  The compensatory water privilege fee shall be equivalent to that sum of money that would have been charged as a betterment assessment upon the property at the time of the original assessment, under the conditions to which they have changed or increased, less the amount of the original assessment. The compensatory water privilege fee shall be the product of the number of water units applicable to a property as ultimately developed multiplied by the water privilege fee amount for the applicable phase of the water construction project.  
 
(4)  All rules and regulations governing the payment and method of payment related to betterment assessments as designated in §199-18B and 18C of these regulations shall apply.  
 
(5)  No water privilege fee shall be assessed upon properties which have been assessed a betterment assessment based upon the fixed uniform rate method.  
  


(6)  The Board of Selectmen is authorized to take any other action necessary or appropriate to accomplish the establishment and recovery of such betterment assessments.

D. This Chapter shall not apply to any activity performed for the normal maintenance or improvement of land activity devoted to agricultural use at the time of application. [Added 5-6-1996 ATM, Art. 47]  
 
E. Discretion of Commission. [Added 5-3-2000 ATM, Art. 57]  
 
(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Hopkinton Wetlands Protection Bylaw, the Commission may, in its discretion, issue an Order of Conditions and impose such conditions as will contribute to the interests identified in the Chapter permitting those limited projects identified in the Massachusetts  Wetlands Protection Regulations, 310 CMR 10.53(3). No such project may be permitted which will  have any adverse effect on specified habitat sites of rare vertebrate or invertebrate species.  
 
(2) In the exercise of this discretion, the Commission shall consider the magnitude of the alteration and the significance of the project site to the interests identified in the Chapter, the availability of reasonable or  practical alternatives to the proposed activity, the extent to which adverse impacts are minimized and the extent to which mitigation measures, including replication or restoration, are provided to contribute  to the protection of the interests identified in the Chapter. The Commission shall also consider if it is particularly important to avoid alteration of a resource area in order to protect the interests protected by the Chapter. For example when the wetland lies adjacent to or above a public water supply, particularly in an area that is the primary cone of influence to a well; is in an area of critical environmental concern (ACEC); contains rare species habitat; is a Class A designated water body by the Division of Water  Pollution Control; is an anadromous fish run or has some other special environmental attribute, the Commission may deny the proposal. [Amended 5-4-2009 ATM, Art. 17] 
 
(3) The Commission shall consider as reasonable or practical alternatives those options that were available  to the applicant but appear to be precluded due to self-imposed hardships or constraints (e.g., lot,  roadway and drainage layouts engineered without prior regard to impact on bylaw resources). In  making the determination regarding reasonable or practical alternatives, the Commission may require the applicant to evaluate the reasonableness of any previously or currently available alternatives,  including the realignment or reconfiguration of the project, to conform with the requirements of the Chapter, or to minimize to the greatest extent possible disruption of resource areas. The Commission may require the applicant to utilize an adjacent parcel of land owned by the applicant, or which the applicant has a beneficial ownership of through a realty trust, to avoid disruption of resource areas. The Commission may also consider whether adjacent property has been sold off or built on, thereby  creating a self-imposed hard-ship.  
 
F. The application and permit required by this Chapter shall not be required for emergency projects necessary to effectuate temporary repairs to preexisting structures, provided notice, oral or written, is given to the Commission prior to the commencement of work or within 24 hours after commencement; provided the Commission or its agent certifies the work as an emergency repair; provided the work is performed only for the time and place certified by the Commission or its agent for the limited purpose necessary to abate the emergency; and provided that within 21 days of commencement of the work a permit application shall be filed with the Commission for review as set forth under this Chapter. Upon failure to meet these or other requirements of the Commission, the Commission may, after notice and a  public hearing, revoke or modify an emergency project approval and order restoration and mitigation measures. [Added 5-5-2003 ATM, Art. 41]  
 
G. The application and permit required by this Chapter shall not be required for maintaining, repairing and replacing, but not substantially enlarging, an existing lawfully located structure, facility, yard or  landscaping on any pre-existing lot of record as of the time this Wetlands Protection Bylaw was first adopted by the Town. [Added 55-2003 ATM, Art. 41]  
 
H.  Minor Projects Exemption. The application and permit required by this Chapter shall not be required for Minor Projects that occur within the buffer zone but not within any resource area, provided they meet the requirements outlined herein.  Minor Projects are defined as those that occur: [Added 5-5-2004 ATM, Art. 48]  
 
(1) Within the outer or second 50 feet from a resource area but in all cases completely outside all Vernal Pool buffer zones; or 
 
(2) Within the outer riparian zone (outer or second 100 feet) from a river; or 
 
(3) Within pre-existing lawn areas where the work meets the following criteria: 
a. Lies within and/or outside the buffer zone 
b. Will not go beyond the pre-existing lawn edge 
  
(4) In all cases, where erosion and sedimentation controls shall be implemented during any construction that exposes bare soil. 
 
Minor activities include, but are not limited to  
 
(1) Unpaved pedestrian walkways for private use;  


 
(2) Plantings of native, non-invasive species of trees, shrubs, or groundcover, but excluding turf lawns;  
 
(3)  The conversion of impervious to vegetated surfaces;  
 
(4)  Fencing, stonewalls, and stacks of cordwood provided they will not constitute a barrier to wildlife movement, and where fences to contain livestock are located more than 100 feet from the mean annual high water line within  a riverfront area or 50 feet from other resource areas, whichever is farther;  
 
(5)  Mowing of pre-existing lawns and pruning of pre-existing landscaped areas but not including disposal of lawn clippings or other yard debris;  
 
(6)  Vista pruning for branches less than 1 inch in diameter, provided the activity is located more than 100 feet from the mean annual high water line within a riverfront area or 50 feet from other resource areas, whichever is farther;  
 
(7)  Conversion of lawn to uses accessory to existing single family houses such as decks, patios, and gardens, and other accessory uses as may be authorized in the Regulations provided the activity is located more than 100 feet from the mean annual high water line within a riverfront area or 50 feet from other resource areas, whichever is farther;  
 
(8) Removal of dead or dying trees or pruning of live trees that pose a hazard to structures or public safety;  
 
(9)  Repair of existing structures provided the footprint of the structure does not change; and  
 
(10)  Activities that are temporary in nature, have no permanent impacts, and are necessary for planning and design purposes (including installation of monitoring wells, exploratory 
borings, sediment sampling, surveying and other uses as may be authorized in the Regulations). [Amended 5-5-2008 ATM, Art. 56] 
 
Property owners who desire to have confirmation of Exempt status for their proposed work should submit an Exemption Request and a sketch plan to the Commission office at least seven (7) business days prior to the commencement of a minor project, for the sole purpose of determining whether the proposed work falls within its parameters.  The Exemption Request is not mandatory under this section of the Bylaw; however, if no Exemption Request is submitted the Property Owner is solely responsible for ensuring that the proposed work is in compliance with all provisions of the Hopkinton Wetlands Protection Bylaw and that all required permit applications have been submitted. 
 
§ 206-5. Applications for Permits and Requests for Determination. [Amend 5-4-2009 ATM, Art. 17] 
 
A. A written application shall be filed with the Commission to perform activities affecting resource areas protected by this Chapter. The permit application shall include such information and plans as set forth in the Hopkinton Wetlands Protection Regulations authorized under §206-10 of this Chapter and as  may be deemed necessary by the Commission to describe the proposed activities and their effects on the resource areas protected by this Chapter. No activities shall commence without receiving and complying with a permit issued pursuant to this Chapter.  
 
B. The Commission, in appropriate cases, may accept as the permit application and plans under this Chapter the Notice of Intent (NOI) or Abbreviated Notice of Resource Area Delineation (ANRAD) and  plans filed under the Wetlands Protection Act, G.L. Ch. 131, Sec. 40, and Regulations, 310 CMR  10.00.  
 
C. Any person desiring to know whether or not a proposed activity or an area is subject to this Chapter may in writing request a determination from the Commission. Such a Request for Determination of Applicability (RDA) shall include the information and plans as set forth in the Hopkinton Wetlands Protection Regulations and as may be deemed necessary by the Commission.  
 
D. At the time of filing a permit or other application, or RDA, Certificate of Compliance (COC) or other request, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified in regulations of the Commission. This fee is called the Filing Fee. The filing fee is in addition to that required by the Wetlands Protection Act,  MGL c. 131, § 40, and Regulations, 310 CMR 10.00.  
 
E. Upon receipt of a permit or other application, RDA, COC or other request, the Commission is authorized to require an applicant to pay a consultant fee, pursuant to § 206-11 of this Chapter, for the  reasonable costs and expenses borne by the Commission for specific expert engineering and other consultant services deemed necessary by the Commission to make a final decision on the application  and for enforcement services. This fee is called the Consultant Fee. The specific consultant services may include but are not limited to resource area survey and delineation and analysis of resource area values, including wildlife habitat evaluations, hydrological and drainage analysis, hydric soil analysis  and environmental or land use law.  
 
F. The Commission may waive the filing fee, for a permit or other application, RDA or other request, when such application is made by a government agency.  
 
 
G. Fees may be established by the Commission, and may be amended. No such fee schedule shall be implemented unless a public hearing is held to discuss the fee.  
H. Adequate access must be granted to the Commission, its agents and consultants, to determine the accuracy of the information submitted in the permit application and the RDA or other application requests.  


 
I. Adequate access must be granted to the Commission, its agents and consultants, to determine the accuracy of the information submitted in the permit application and the request for determination.  
 
§ 206-6. Public Hearings and Notifications. [Amended 5-4-2009 ATM, Art. 17]  
 
A. Any person filing a permit or other application, RDA, ANRAD or other request with the Commission shall, at the same time, give written notice thereof, by certified mail (return receipt requested), certificate of mailing, or hand delivery, to all abutters at their mailing addresses shown on a valid certified Assessors abutters list, including owners of land directly opposite on any public or private street or way, and abutters to the abutters within 300 feet of the property line of the applicant, including any other municipality or across any body of water. The notice to abutters shall have enclosed a summary of the project or proposal, date of the Commission hearing or meeting date if known, copy of the permit application or request, with plans, or shall state where copies may be examined and obtained by abutters. An affidavit of the person providing such notice, with a copy of the notice mailed and delivered, shall be filed with the Commission. When a person requesting a Determination is other than the owner, the notice of hearing and the Determination itself shall be sent by the Commission to the owner as well as to the person making the request.  
 
B. The Commission shall conduct a public hearing on any permit application, RDA or ANRAD. Written notice of such hearing shall be given at the expense of the applicant, at least five business days prior to the hearing, by publishing notice of same in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality.  
 
C. The Commission shall commence the public hearing within 21 days from the receipt of a completed permit application, RDA or ANRAD unless an extension is authorized in writing by the applicant.  
 
D. The Commission shall issue its permit, other order or Determination in writing within 21 days from the date of completion of the hearing held after receipt of a completed permit application or RDA unless an extension is authorized in writing by the applicant.  
 
E. The Commission in appropriate cases may combine its hearing under this Chapter with the hearing  conducted under the Wetlands Protection Act, MGL c. 131, § 40, and Regulations, 310 CMR 10.00.  
 
F. The Commission shall have the authority to continue the hearing to a certain date announced at the hearing, for reasons stated at the hearing, which may include receipt of additional information from the applicant or others deemed necessary by the Commission in its discretion, or comments and recommendations of the boards and officials listed in § 206-7. 
 
§ 206-7. Coordination with Other Boards.    [Amended 5-5-2008 ATM, Art. 58, 5-4-2009 ATM, Art. 17] 
 
Upon receipt of a permit application or request for determination, the Commission shall provide written notice thereof, by electronic mail or hand delivery, to the Board of Selectmen, Planning Board, Board of Health, Highway Surveyor and Building Inspector. A copy shall be provided in the same manner to the 
Commission of the adjoining municipality, if the application or RDA pertains to property within 300 feet of that municipality. 
 
The Commission shall not take final action until such boards and officials have had 14 days from receipt of notice to file written comments and recommendations with the Commission, which the Commission shall take into account but which shall not be binding on the Commission. The applicant shall have the right to receive copies of any such comments and recommendations, and to respond to them at the hearing of the Commission, prior to final action.  
 
§ 206-8. Determinations, Permits and Conditions. [Amended 5-4-2009 ATM, Art. 17] 
 
A. The Commission shall have the authority after a public hearing to determine whether a specific parcel  of land contains or does not contain a resource area protected by this Chapter. If the Commission finds that no such resource areas are present, it shall issue a negative Determination.  
 
B. If the Commission, after a public hearing on the permit application or other request, determines that the  activities which are the subject of the application are likely to have a significant individual or cumulative adverse effect upon the resource area values protected by this Chapter, the Commission, within 21 days of the close of the hearing, shall, subject to the provisions of § 206-8.1 of this Chapter,  issue or deny a permit for the activities requested. If it issues a permit, the Commission shall impose  such conditions that it deems necessary or desirable to protect those values, and all activities shall be  completed in accordance with those conditions. [Amended 5-3-2000 ATM, Art. 57]  
 
C. The Commission is empowered to deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements of this Chapter; for failure to submit necessary information and plans requested by the Commission; for failure to meet  design specifications, performance standards; and other requirements in the regulations of the Commission; for failure to avoid, minimize, mitigate, or prevent significant or cumulative detrimental  effects upon the resource area values protected by this Chapter; for failure to provide sufficient information; and where no conditions would be adequate to protect the resource area values set forth herein.  
 
D. The Commission may establish, in its Order of Conditions, design specifications, performance standards, and other measures and safeguards, including setbacks, no-disturb areas, no-build areas, and other work limits for protection of resource areas, including without limitation strips of continuous, undisturbed vegetative cover, unless the applicant convinces the Commission that the area or part of it may be disturbed without harm to the resource area values protected by this Chapter. 
 
E. A permit shall expire three years from the date of issuance. Notwithstanding the above, the Commission in its discretion may issue a permit expiring five years from the date of issuance for recurring or continuing maintenance work, provided that annual notification of the time and location of work is given to the Commission. Any permit may be renewed for up to three additional years at the  discretion of the Commission.  
 
F. The Commission may revoke or amend a permit issued under this Chapter after notice to the holder, public, abutters and Town Boards and a public hearing and notice in writing to the holder of the permit.  
 
G. The Commission in appropriate cases may combine the permit or other action on an application issued  under this Chapter with the Order of Conditions or other action issued or taken under the Wetlands Protection Act, MGL c. 131, § 40, and Regulations, 310 CMR 10.00.  
 
H. No work proposed in any permit application shall be undertaken until the permit issued by the Commission with respect to such work has been recorded in the Registry of Deeds or in the Land Registration section of said Registry as may be appropriate for the district wherein the land lies and until the holder of the permit provides a certified copy of the recording activity to the Commission. 
 
§ 206-8.1.  Tentative Decisions; Requests for Reconsideration. [Added 5-3-2000 ATM, Art. 57]  
 
A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, all decisions of the Commission issued under § 206-8B shall be deemed tentative decisions subject to the procedure for reconsideration and review set forth in this section.  
 
B. Any applicant aggrieved by the denial of a permit, or by conditions of approval contained in any permit, issued under this Chapter may request reconsideration and review by written notice to the Commission. Such notice shall be hand delivered or sent by certified mail to the Commission within 10 business days of the delivery or mailing of the tentative decision, shall include a statement of the grounds for the request and shall specify the changes to the decision requested. A request for reconsideration under the bylaw must be submitted to the Commission as specified herein separate from any Request for a Superseding Order of Conditions filed with the Department of Environmental  Protection. [Amended 5-5-2003 ATM, Art. 40]  
 
C. Within 21 days following the receipt of a request for reconsideration, the Commission shall either issue a final decision incorporating the changes to the tentative decision requested by the applicant, or vote to reopen the hearing. If the applicant has also filed a request for Superseding Order of Conditions under the Wetlands Protection Act, the applicant may request that the reopened hearing be scheduled after the  issuance of such Superseding Order; otherwise, the reopened hearing shall be convened within 30 days of the request for reconsideration. Such reopened hearing shall be subject to the notice requirements in § 206-6 of this Chapter.  
 
D. Following the conclusion of the reopened hearing, the Commission shall issue a final decision in which  it may reaffirm its tentative decision or modify the tentative decision as requested by the applicant in whole or in part, provided that if the Commission includes conditions of approval stricter than those imposed under the Wetlands Protection Act, or if the Commission denies a permit for a project approved under the Wetlands Protection Act, it shall include in its final decision a statement specifying each relevant respect in which this Chapter, or regulations promulgated thereunder, are stricter than the requirements of the Wetlands Protection Act as applied to the project. In the event of any appeal to the Superior Court under MGL c. 249, the tentative decision, the request for reconsideration, the Superseding Order of Conditions (if any) and the Commission's final decision shall be included in the record.  
 
E. If the applicant does not request reconsideration as provided herein, the tentative decision shall be deemed final as of the date of issuance. If the applicant files a written statement waiving the right to reconsideration or withdrawing a request for reconsideration previously filed, the tentative decision shall be deemed final as of the date such notice is received by the Commission.  
 
F. It is the policy of the Town of Hopkinton to encourage the resolution of disputes arising under this Chapter by settlement wherever possible. Consistent with this policy, in the event of an appeal to 
the Superior Court under MGL c. 249 from a final decision by the Commission, the Commission shall, subject to the availability of any funds required therefore, participate in good faith in mediation if the party appealing the decision makes a request to the Commission for it to do so, provided that all other parties to the appeal so agree.  
 
§ 206-9. Written Conditions. [Amended 5-4-2009 ATM, Art. 17] 
 
Permits or approved requests issued with conditions shall be written on the same Order of Conditions as that issued pursuant to the Wetlands Protection Act. Conditions authorized solely by the provisions of this Chapter shall be in a separate section under the heading "Additional conditions pursuant to the Town of Hopkinton Wetlands Protection Bylaw."  
 
§ 206-10. Regulations.  
 
A. After public notice and public hearing, the Commission may promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this Chapter. These regulations shall be consistent with the terms of this Chapter. The Commission may amend the rules and regulations after public notice and public hearing.  
 
B. Failure by the Commission to promulgate such rules and regulations or a legal declaration of their invalidity by a court of law shall not act to suspend or invalidate the effect of this Chapter.  
 
C. Unless otherwise stated in this Chapter or in the rules and regulations promulgated under this Chapter, the definitions, procedures and performance standards of the Wetlands Protection Act, MGL c. 131, §  40, and associated Regulations, 310 CMR 10.00, most recently promulgated shall apply.  
 
§ 206-11. Fees.  [Amended 5-4-2009 ATM, Art. 17] 
 
A. The Commission in its discretion is authorized to require an applicant to pay a filing and/or consultant fee for the reasonable costs and expenses borne by the Commission in its consideration of the application.  
 
B. The Commission is authorized to utilize the filing and/or consultant fees to obtain consultant services and/or to provide enforcement services which may include but are not limited to resource area survey and delineation, analysis of resource area values, including wildlife habitats' evaluations, hydrogeological and drainage analysis, hydric soil testing and environmental land use law.  
 
C. The exercise of discretion by the Commission in making its determination to require the payment of the filing/consultant fees shall be based upon its reasonable finding that the additional information acquirable only through outside consultants or to provide enforcement services is necessary for the rendering of an objective decision.  
 
D. At the time of a permit application, RDA, ANRAD, or other request, the applicant shall pay the filing/consultant fees as specified in the Hopkinton Wetlands Protection Regulations. Such fees are in addition to those required by the Wetlands Protection Act, MGL c. 131, § 40, and are not refundable.  The Commission may waive the filing fee and the costs and expenses for a permit application, RDA, ANRAD or other request submitted by a government agency.  Additional consultant fees may be requested where the requisite review is more expensive than originally 
calculated or where new information requires additional consultant services.  The Commission may require the payment of such additional consultant fees for any of the purposes referred to in Subsection B above at any time prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Compliance.  [Amended 5-3-2000 ATM, Art. 57, 5-4-2009 ATM, Art. 17] 
 
E. The applicant shall pay the filing/consultant fees to the Town of Hopkinton to be put into an account established pursuant to MGL c. 44, § 53E1/2, which account may be drawn upon by the Commission as necessary to carry out the provisions of this Chapter.  
 
F. Any applicant aggrieved by the imposition of or the amount of the fee, or any act related thereto, may appeal according to the provisions of the Massachusetts General Laws.  
 
G. No project shall be segmented to avoid being subject to the filing and/or consultant fees referred to herein.  
 
H. In the event that the applicant has not paid the filing and/or consultant fees as required herein, the Commission may deny the requested permit for lack of sufficient information. 
 
§ 206-12. Security. [Amended 5-4-2009 ATM, Art. 17] 
 
As part of a permit issued under this Chapter, in addition to any security required by any other municipal or state board, agency or official, the Commission may require that the performance and observance of the conditions imposed hereunder (including conditions requiring mitigation work) be secured wholly or in part by one or more of the methods described below:  
 
A. By proper bond or deposit of money or negotiable securities under a third-party escrow agreement or other undertaking of financial responsibility sufficient, in the opinion of the Commission, to be released in whole or in part upon the issuance of a Certificate of Compliance for work performed pursuant to the permit.  
 
B. By accepting a conservation restriction, easement or other covenant enforceable in a court of law, executed and duly recorded by the owner of record, running with the land to the benefit of this municipality whereby the permit condition shall be performed and observed before any lot may be conveyed other than by mortgage deed. This method shall be used only with the consent of the applicant.  
 
§ 206-13. Enforcement.  
 
A. No person shall remove, fill, dredge, build upon, degrade or otherwise alter resource areas protected by this Chapter, or cause, suffer or allow such activity, or leave in place unauthorized fill, or otherwise fail to restore illegally altered land to its original condition, or fail to comply with a permit or Enforcement  Order issued pursuant to this Chapter.  
 
B. The Commission shall have the authority to enforce this Chapter, its regulations and permits issued thereunder by violation notices, administrative orders and civil and criminal court actions. Any person who violates any provision of this Chapter may be ordered to restore the property to its original condition and to take other action deemed necessary to remedy such violation, or may be fined, or both.  
 
C. Upon request of the Commission, the Board of Selectmen, the Town Counsel or special counsel shall take legal action for enforcement of this Chapter under civil law. Upon the request of the Commission, the Chief of Police shall take legal action for enforcement under criminal law.  
 
D. Municipal boards and officers, including any police officer or other officer having police powers, shall have the authority to assist the Commission in enforcement.  
 
E. Any person who violates any provision of this Chapter, or regulations, permits or administrative orders  issued thereunder, shall be punished by a fine as set forth in the Hopkinton Wetland Protection Regulations. Each day or portion thereof during which a violation continues, or unauthorized fill or alteration remains in place, shall constitute a separate offense, and each provision of the bylaw,  regulations and permits or administrative orders violated shall constitute a separate offense.  
 
F. As an alternative to criminal prosecution in a specific case, the Commission may issue a citation under the noncriminal disposition procedure set forth in MGL c. 40, § 21D, if adopted by the Town as a general bylaw.  
 
§ 206-14. Burden of Proof.  
 
The applicant for a permit shall have the burden of providing by a preponderance of the credible evidence that the work proposed in the permit application will not have unacceptable significant or cumulative effect upon the resource area values protected by this Chapter. Failure to provide adequate evidence to the Commission supporting this burden shall be sufficient cause for the Commission to deny a permit or grant a permit with conditions.  
 
§ 206-15. Appeals.  
 
A decision of the Commission shall be reviewable in the Superior Court in accordance with MGL c. 249, § 4.  
 
§ 206-16. Relation to the Wetlands Protection Act.  
 
This Chapter is adopted under the Home Rule Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution and the Home Rule Statutes, independent of the Wetlands Protection Act, MGL c. 131, § 40, and Regulations, 310 CMR 10.00, thereunder.  
 
§ 206-17. Severability.  
 
The invalidity of any provision of this Chapter shall not invalidate any other section or provision thereof, nor shall it invalidate any permit or Determination that previously has been issued.

ARTICLE XI 
Flexible Community Development Bylaw 
[Added 5-7-2007 ATM, Art. 30] 
 
§ 210-57. Purpose and Intent.  
 
The purpose of this Article is to increase the inventory of affordable housing in Hopkinton.  It is intended that the affordable housing units that result from this Article be considered as Local Initiative Program (LIP) units, in compliance with the requirements for the same as specified by the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) and that said units shall count toward the Towns requirements under G.L. c.40B sec. 20-23.  Each affordable unit created in accordance with this Article shall have limitations governing its resale to preserve the long-term affordability of the unit and to ensure its continued availability for affordable income households.   
 
§ 210-58.  Applicability. 
 
A. In all zoning districts, the inclusionary housing provisions of this section shall apply to the following uses, hereafter called the development: 


 
(1) Any project that results in a net increase of ten (10) or more dwelling units, whether by new construction or by the alteration, expansion, reconstruction, or change of existing residential or non-residential space, with the exception of Article XIIIA, Village Housing Development projects; and 



 
(2) Any division and/or subdivision of land held in common ownership as of the effective date of this Article, or anytime thereafter, into ten (10) or more dwelling units.   



 
§ 210-59.  Administration. [Amended 5 -6-2015 ATM, Art. 39] 
 
A development shall require the grant of a Special Permit from the Planning Board.  A Special Permit shall be granted if the proposal meets the requirements of this Chapter.  If a development requires a Special Permit pursuant to any other provision of this Chapter, a separate Special Permit shall not be required.  The Planning Board shall prepare and, after a public hearing, adopt and file regulations with the Town Clerk, which shall include submission requirements, timelines, procedures and provisions necessary to implement this Article.   
 
§ 210-60.  Mandatory Provision of Affordable Units. 
 
A. In each applicable development, one dwelling unit shall be established as an affordable housing unit for every ten (10) dwelling units in the development, in any one or combination of methods provided for below.  For example, in a development of 10 to 19 units, 1 unit shall be affordable; in developments of 20 to 29 units, 2 units shall be affordable; and so on.  The use of a combination of methods shall be approved by the Planning Board. 


 
(1) Constructed or rehabilitated on the development locus; or 


 
(2) Constructed or rehabilitated on a locus different than the development; or 


 
(3) An equivalent fees-in-lieu of payment may be made. 


 
B. For every affordable unit required, one additional market rate dwelling unit may be added to the total number of dwelling units in the development.  For example, in a development of 20 units, two affordable units are required and the number of market rate units may be increased by two, for a total of 22 units. 


 
C. The Planning Board may allow a reduction in the dimensional requirements, including minimum lot area, frontage or setback requirements, applicable to the proposed development in order to accommodate the additional units on the site and to locate them within the areas most suitable for development.  Such authorization for reduction shall be included in the special permit. 


 
§ 210-61.  Provisions Applicable to Affordable Housing Units On- and Off-Site. 
 
A. All affordable units created, constructed or rehabilitated under this Article shall be situated within the development so as not to be in less desirable locations than market rate units in the development and shall, on average, be no less accessible to public amenities, such as open space, as the market-rate units. 


 
B. Affordable housing units shall be integrated with the rest of the development and shall be compatible in design, appearance, construction, and quality of materials with other units.  Interior features and mechanical systems of affordable units shall conform to the same specifications as apply to market-rate units. 


 
C. Affordable housing units shall be provided coincident to the development of market-rate units. 


 
D. The deeds to the affordable housing units sold to income eligible buyers shall contain a restriction against renting or leasing of said unit(s) during the period for which the housing unit(s) contains a restriction on affordability. 


 
E. The applicant shall comply with the mandatory set-asides and accompanying restrictions on affordability, including the execution of an acceptable deed rider.  


 
F. The location of the off-site units to be provided shall be approved by the Planning Board, and shall be provided coincident to the development of the market-rate units or in accordance with an alternate schedule approved by the Planning Board.  Exercise of this option shall not result in the destruction or demolition of existing structures, unless the Planning Board determines that: 1) such destruction or demolition is not detrimental to the neighborhood; and 2) where the proposed destruction or demolition of existing housing units is proposed, is consistent with the overall housing goals of the Town.  When the Historic Preservation Bylaw (Chapter 125 of the Bylaws of the Town of Hopkinton) applies to the structure, the Planning Board shall consult with the Historical Commission before making a determination. 


 
§ 210-62.  Fees-in-Lieu-of Affordable Housing Unit Provision. 
 
A. An applicant may contribute funds to the Town of Hopkinton Affordable Housing Trust Fund or Hopkinton Community Housing Task Force, Inc. (CHTF) to be used for the development of affordable housing in lieu of constructing and offering affordable units within the locus of the proposed development or at an off-site locus. 


 
(1) Calculation of fee-in-lieu-of units.  For each affordable unit not constructed or provided through one or a combination of the methods specified in this Article, the fee shall be an amount equal to the purchase price of a three-bedroom home that is affordable to a qualified affordable housing unit purchaser, as contained in the LIP guidelines regardless of what type of dwelling units are proposed, approved or constructed in the development. [Amended 5-1-2017, Article 34] 


 
(2) Schedule of fees-in-lieu-of-units payments. Fees-in-lieu-of-units payments shall be made according to a schedule agreed upon by the Planning Board and the applicant. 


 
§ 210-63.  Conflict with Other Bylaws. 
 
The provisions of this Article shall be considered supplemental of existing zoning bylaws.  To the extent that a conflict exists between this bylaw and others, the more restrictive bylaw, or provisions therein, shall apply.

ARTICLE XIII 
Garden Apartments in Residential Districts 
                                 [Added 3-11-1970 ATM, Art. 53; amended 3-12-1973 ATM, 
                                  Arts. 27, 28, 29, 30 and 34; 4-14-1975 ATM, Arts. 32, 33, 34

§ 210-72. Planning, design, conservation and development objectives. [Amended 5-1-2006, Art. 35] 
 
A. General intent and purposes. It is the intent and purpose of this Article XIII to maintain a working balance in the Town of Hopkinton between the demand for new development and its rewards on the one hand, and the human need for our natural resources and their maintenance on the other. The Town of Hopkinton cannot and should not prevent its citizens from owning, selling and developing their land. But it is also a fundamental and important truth that with each new house and each cut tree, the environment and ecology of the Town changes. Therefore, the control and maintenance of a reasonable balance between new development and the preservation of the town's natural resources is a legitimate area for public concern and legislation. It is, therefore, the intent of the Town that this article shall provide for the reasonable protection of its natural resources by properly conserving its land as development takes place. This shall be accomplished by establishing a procedure whereby each proposal for apartment development will be reviewed separately and judged by standards designed to protect both the special quality of the site and its environs and the Town and its environment against misuse or overdevelopment of the land. In this article, the guiding principle in judging apartment proposals will be the variety and diversity in the proposed development and the care shown by the developer in conservation, site planning and building design as applied to the specific parcel of land proposed for development. 
 
B. General objectives. The following planning, design, conservation and development objectives will apply to all proposals for apartment construction in Hopkinton: 
 
(1) To provide new housing for all citizens regardless of income, race, color, creed or other like characteristics. 
 
(2) To promote the beneficial use and conservation of land by relating proposed buildings to the unique features, conditions and natural quality of the site. Beneficial use shall be measured in terms of topography, surface and subsurface soil and drainage conditions, location with respect to adjacent or existing streets, buildings or other natural features, the type and size of trees to be retained or removed, the use and retention of natural ground cover, open space, water, swamp, other natural water source or feature, stone walls, ledge or any other feature of recognized conservation or historical significance. 
 
(3) To facilitate sound and orderly public and private development in Hopkinton by relating an apartment proposal to any public Master Plan for land use, conservation, streets or public facilities. 
 
(4) To recognize the importance of diversity and variety in the exterior quality, appearance and design of apartment structures by rejecting monotonous, look-alike designs and to encourage those designs that are specifically designed for and related to the special conditions and features of the proposed site. 
 
(5) To conserve and preserve the significant and unique natural and historic features of the proposed site in their natural state and ensure or provide for their permanent protection from 
future encroachment or development. [Amended 5-1-2006 ATM, Art. 35; Amended 5-2-2016 ATM, Art. 33] 
 
(6) To give encouragement to owners and developers to produce the highest quality design in the apartment structures to be built by using visual space planning applied to other site development elements, such as parking areas, wooded or conservation areas, adjacent streets, accessory buildings, lighting and open areas. 
 
(7) To give fair and full consideration to the opinions and statements of abutting property owners at the public hearings required for each application. 
 
(8) To provide for design review of all proposals prior to construction, to ensure compliance with the above intent and objectives and to assure that the proposal will not result in or contribute to incompatible use of the land, pollution of the soil or groundwater, traffic congestion or inappropriate site development.

§ 210-75. Administration. [Amended 5-4-2009 ATM, Art. 25] 
 
A. Application procedure. The application procedure consists of two steps: application for garden apartment concept plan special permit approval to the Planning Board and application for garden apartment site plan approval to the Planning Board. A garden apartment site plan shall be considered neither a definitive subdivision plan under the provisions of the Subdivision Control Law, nor a site plan under the provisions of Article XX of this Chapter. A garden apartment site plan shall be considered a technical administrative review of an approved concept plan. The garden apartment concept plan special permit is the special permit referred to in § 210-74A of this article. 
 
 (1) Concept plan special permit. 
 
(a) A record owner desiring to use land for garden apartments shall file with the Planning Board an application for a garden apartment concept plan special permit to use the land for garden apartments, together with such plans, drawings, specifications and additional information as set forth in the Garden Apartment Submission Requirements and Procedures Manual adopted by the Planning Board and filed with the Town Clerk. After adoption of this article, the Planning Board shall vote to adopt the Garden Apartment Submission Requirements and Procedures Manual after holding a public hearing. 
 
(b) Within seven days of receipt of the application for the garden apartment concept plan special permit, the Planning Board shall transmit copies of the application and plan to the Director of Public Works, Conservation Commission and Board of Health for comment and recommendations. The Planning Board shall not approve any such application until the final reports of such departments shall have been submitted to it or until 35 days shall have elapsed after the transmittal of the plans and additional materials without such report being submitted. Consultant review fees shall be governed and set by the Planning Board and shall be assessed to the record owner and applicant. [Amended 5-4-2009 ATM, Art. 25] 
 
(c) The Planning Board shall hold a public hearing and file its decision in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.[Amended 5-6-2015 ATM, Art. 39] 
 
(d) Approval criteria. Before the Planning Board may issue the special permit, it shall determine each of the following:

ARTICLE XIIIA 
Village Housing in Residential Districts 
[Added 5-3-2004 ATM, Art. 36] 
 
§ 210-75.1. Planning, design, conservation and development objectives. 
 
A. General intent and purposes. It is the intent and purpose of this Village Housing in Residential Districts Article to maintain a working balance in the Town of Hopkinton between the demand for new development and the provision of affordable housing and its rewards on the one hand, and the human need for our natural resources and their maintenance on the other. The Town of Hopkinton cannot and should not prevent its citizens from owning, selling and developing their land. The Town also understands the importance of providing for a variety of housing that meets the needs of all of its citizens, regardless of income. But it is also a fundamental and important truth that with each new house and each cut tree, the environment and ecology of the Town change. Therefore, the control and maintenance of a reasonable balance between new development and the preservation of the Town's natural resources is a legitimate area for public concern and legislation. It is, therefore, the intent of the Town that this Article shall provide for the provision of affordable housing under the state guidelines for the creation of such units while providing for the reasonable protection of its natural resources by properly conserving its land as development takes place. This shall be accomplished by establishing a procedure whereby each proposal for village housing will be reviewed separately and judged by standards designed to protect both the special quality of the site and its environs and the Town and its environment against misuse or overdevelopment of the land. In this Article, the guiding principle in judging village housing proposals will be the variety and diversity of the proposed development of affordable housing units and the care shown by the developer in conservation, site planning and building design as applied to the specific parcel of land proposed for development. 


 
B. General objectives. The following planning, design, conservation and development objectives will apply to all proposals for village housing construction in Hopkinton: 


 
(1) To provide affordable housing for all citizens regardless of income, race, color, creed or other like characteristics. 


 
(2) To promote the beneficial use and conservation of land by relating proposed buildings to the unique features, conditions and natural quality of the site. Beneficial use shall be measured in terms of topography, surface and subsurface soil and drainage conditions, location with respect to adjacent or existing streets, buildings or other natural features, the type and size of trees to be retained or removed, the use and retention of natural ground cover, open space, water, swamp, other natural water source or feature, stone walls, ledge or any other feature of recognized conservation or historical significance. 


 
(3) To facilitate sound and orderly public and private development in Hopkinton by relating a village housing proposal to any public Master Plan for land use, conservation, streets or public facilities. 


 
(4) To recognize the importance of diversity and variety in the exterior quality, appearance and design of housing structures by rejecting monotonous, look-alike designs and to encourage those designs that are specifically designed for and related to the special conditions and features of the proposed site. 


 
(5) To conserve and preserve the significant and unique natural features of the proposed site in their natural state and ensure or provide for their permanent protection from future encroachment or development.  [Amended 5-2-2016 ATM, Art. 33] 


 
(6) To give encouragement to owners and developers to produce the highest quality design in the housing structures to be built by using visual space planning applied to other site development elements, such as parking areas, wooded or conservation areas, adjacent streets, accessory buildings, lighting and open areas. 


 
(7) To give fair and full consideration to the opinions and statements of abutting property owners at the public hearings required for each application. 


 
(8) To provide for design review of all proposals prior to construction, to ensure compliance with the above intent and objectives and to assure that the proposal will not result in or contribute to incompatible use of the land, pollution of the soil or groundwater, traffic congestion or inappropriate site development. 


 
C. Criteria.  Before the Planning Board may issue the special permit referred to in this Article, it shall determine each of the following: 



 
(1) That the proposed development constitutes a desirable development in the neighborhood and in the Town. 


 
(2) That the proposed development will not be detrimental to the neighborhood or the Town. 


 
(3) That the plans generally provide adequately for convenience and safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement within the site and in relation to adjacent streets, property or improvements, with the understanding that review of such items will be more detailed at the site plan review stage. 


 
(4) That the plans appear to provide adequate methods of disposal of sewerage, refuse and other wastes, adequate methods for drainage of surface water and seasonal flooding, if any, and adequate provision of water for domestic purposes, with the understanding that review of such items will be more detailed at the site plan review stage. 


 
(5) That the plan complies with the Master Plan. 


 
(6) That all of the provisions of § 210-75.1 A and B of this Article have been met. 


 
(7) That the Town of Hopkinton has not met the statutory goal to provide 10% of its housing stock as affordable housing pursuant to Sections 20 through 23 of Chapter 40B of the Massachusetts General Laws, as amended.  [Amended 5-2-2016 ATM, Art. 33]

§ 210-75.4. Administration. 
 
A. Application procedure. The application procedure consists of two steps: application for village housing concept plan special permit approval to the Planning Board and application for village housing site plan approval to the Planning Board. A village housing site plan shall be considered neither a definitive subdivision plan under the provisions of the Subdivision Control Law, nor a site plan under the provisions of Article XX of this Chapter. A village housing site plan shall be considered a technical administrative review of an approved concept plan. The village housing concept plan special permit is the special permit referred to in § 210-75.3(A) of this Article. 


 
(1) Concept plan special permit. 



 
(a) A record owner desiring to use land for village housing shall file with the Planning Board an application for a village housing concept plan special permit to use the land for village housing, together with such plans, drawings, specifications and additional information as set forth in the Village Housing Submission Requirements and Procedures Manual adopted by the Planning Board and filed with the Town Clerk.

The Planning Board shall not approve any such application until the final reports of such departments shall have been submitted to it or until 35 days shall have elapsed after the transmittal of the plans and additional materials without such report being submitted. Consultant review fees shall be governed and set by the Planning Board and shall be assessed to the record owner and applicant. [Amended 5-4-2009 ATM, Art. 25] 




 
(c) The Planning Board shall hold a public hearing and file its decision in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. [Amended 5-4-2015 ATM, Art. 39] 




 
(d) Approval of the village housing concept plan special permit application shall not be considered approval of any construction. This approval is a preliminary approval intended to give guidance to the applicant for the development of the site plan and to determine whether the proposed concept meets the objectives of the bylaw and the Town. 




 
(e) After a village housing concept plan special permit application has been submitted, no tree removal, no utility installation, no ditching, grading or construction of roads, no grading of land or lots, no excavation except for purposes of soil testing, no dredging or filling and no construction of buildings or structures shall be done on any part of the site until the application has been reviewed and approved as provided by these regulations. 




 
(f) A village housing concept plan special permit shall become void within two years from the date of issue, which two years shall not include time required to pursue or await determination of an appeal referred to in MGL c. 40A, § 17. If any construction work contemplated by such special permit shall have commenced and proceeded in good faith continuously, except for good cause, but notwithstanding, the project shall not have been completed within such two-year period, the applicant must request extension of the special permit from the Board, in which case the Board shall extend the special permit for such period of time as it deems appropriate.  




 
(2) Village housing site plan. After approval of the concept plan special permit, the applicant may submit an application for approval of a village housing site plan to the Planning Board. No village housing site plan application may be submitted unless a concept plan has been approved and is currently in effect. The village housing site plan shall be designed to be in conformance with the approved concept plan special permit. If the Planning Board determines that there is a substantial variation between the concept plan special permit and the site plan, it shall hold a public hearing on the modifications of the concept plan special permit. 





 
(a) Within five days after receipt of the complete application, the Planning Board shall distribute copies of the application and plans to the Director of Public Works, Conservation Commission and Board of Health. These departments shall transmit recommendations, if any, to the Board within 35 days of receipt of the plans. 






 
(b) The Board shall hold a public hearing within 45 days of the receipt of the complete application. Notice of the time, place and subject matter of the public hearing shall be given by the Planning Board at the expense of the applicant by advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town, once in each of two successive weeks, the first publication being not less than 14 days before the day of such hearing, and by mailing a copy of such advertisement to the applicant and to all owners of land abutting the land included in such plan as appearing on the most recent tax list. 






 
(c) The Board shall file its decision with the Town Clerk within 90 days from the date of submission. This time may be extended by mutual agreement between the applicant and the Planning Board.

[1] Before the Planning Board may approve the site plan, it shall determine each of  the following: 
[a] That the plans provide adequately for convenience and safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement within the site and in relation to adjacent streets, property or improvements.

ARTICLE XIV 
Campus Style Development (CSD) District 
[Added 5-6-1996 ATM, Art. 36] 
 
§ 210-76. Development and design objectives. 
 
The purposes of the Campus Style Development (CSD) District are to permit the clustering of industrial and commercial uses upon a development site in those areas most suited for development, to avoid strip development, to mitigate the impacts of industrial and commercial development and to preserve open land. The open land set aside pursuant to this article may buffer adjacent uses or residential zoning districts or provide recreational amenities for the occupants of the parcel or residents of the town. The clustering of the uses on the development site shall be designed to be consistent with landscapes which are traditional to New England and Hopkinton. It is the intent of this article that the development site will be designed to preserve the existing streetscape by clustering the uses away from public ways and providing a visual buffer from streets. It is the further intent that the uses on the development site will be clustered away from residential uses and will not be within view from lakes and other long views. 
 
§ 210-77. Applicability. 
 
Campus style development shall be allowed only upon the issuance of a special permit by the Planning Board, only within Rural Business, Industrial A and Industrial B Districts, subject to the requirements of this Chapter for those districts, and in accordance with the additional requirements specified herein. [Amended 5-7-2007 ATM, Art. 26, 5-4-2009 ATM, Art. 25] 
 
§ 210-78. General requirements. 
 
Any parcel of land located within a zone permitting campus style development containing not less than five acres may be considered for a campus style development. The five acres may be comprised of individual lots of less than five acres which, when combined, will be considered to be one development site. Once the 
lots are combined to constitute a development site, there shall be no further subdivision of the site which would result in a development site of less than five acres. 
 
§ 210-79. Dimensional requirements. 
 
The following size and setback requirements shall apply: 
 
A. Minimum lot frontage for the development site on a public way: 50 feet. 
 
B. Minimum lot frontage within the development site: none, provided that the interior roads which must provide adequate access to all buildings on the development site shall not become public ways and are to be considered private access roads.

ARTICLE XV 
Adult Uses 
[Added 5-6-1996 ATM, Art. 45] 
 
§ 210-89. Preamble and purpose. [Amended 5-6-2008 STM, Art. 7] 
 
A. Whereas, there is documented experience in many other cities including Boston, Massachusetts; Seattle, Washington; Tacoma, Washington; Detroit, Michigan; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and St. Paul, Minnesota among other cities, showing that adult uses are distinguishable from other business uses and that the location of adult uses may degrade or adversely affect the quality of life in the areas of a community where they are located, often with impacts, including but not limited to increased levels of crime, blight, depreciation of property values and late hours of operation resulting in noise and traffic late into the night; and 
 
B. Whereas, it is the intention of the Town of Hopkinton to rely upon and reference the findings of the above municipalities and various detailed studies they have conducted that empirically document the adverse influences and effects of adult uses on surrounding properties; and 
 
C. Whereas, the Town of Hopkinton is predominantly residential in its character and development pattern and, although primarily residential, is composed of a mixture of residential, business, commercial, religious, school, park and open space uses, and such areas of use are, in many instances, located in close proximity to one another with the resulting conflicts in land use; and 
 
D. Whereas, the Town of Hopkinton desires to protect its residential lands from encroachment by commercial adult uses and to ensure and promote the town's image as a safe, pleasant and attractive place of residence for families with children, and to preserve and promote the peace and quiet enjoyment of these areas for all persons; and 
 
E. Whereas, it is a desire of the Town of Hopkinton to preserve and protect the safety of children and young people in the vicinity of schools and public parks where they may be expected to walk, congregate and 
play, and furthermore that children and young people not be subjected to confrontation with the existence of adult uses in the vicinity of schools and parks, or in commercial areas where there is significant patronage and presence of children and young people; and 
 
F. Whereas, the commercial areas of the Town of Hopkinton reflect greatly on its image in the region, and it is the desire of the Town of Hopkinton to promote a positive business community image, retain and promote safe and attractive business areas, and retain its rural character, free of crime and nuisance; and 
 
G. Whereas, the Town of Hopkinton as an aid to mitigating the above impacts of adult uses desires to physically separate commercial adult uses from residential, religious, school, park and open space uses, so that residents not be subjected to confrontation with the existence of adult uses in the vicinity of their residences, schools, parks and playgrounds and churches and chosen places of worship; and 
 
H. Whereas, adult uses engaging in the sale, rental or display of sexually explicit materials, including books, magazines, periodicals, pictures, photographs, slides, movies, videos, adult entertainment and live nudity, may legitimately be controlled by a municipality, either through concentrating in certain locations or separating from other uses which will be inordinately impacted by the sale, rental or display of sexually explicit materials, and furthermore MGL c. 40A, § 9A, specifically provides for municipal regulation of adult uses through special permits and standards related to location and separation of such uses; and [Amended 5-6-2008 STM, Art. 7] 
 
I. Whereas, the Town of Hopkinton does not desire to suppress any speech activities protected by the First Amendment, but rather to enact a content-neutral ordinance concerned with the secondary effects of adult uses on the surrounding community, especially crime and effects upon children and family life, and therefore desires reasonable regulation of the location of adult uses in order to provide for the protection of the image of the community, its property values, and to protect the residents of the community from any adverse effects of such adult land uses, while providing to those who desire to patronize adult uses such an opportunity in areas within the Town which are appropriate for location of such uses; and 
 
J. Whereas, it is the intention of the Town of Hopkinton by the adoption of this Chapter to rely upon the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts pertaining to this subject matter, to regulate and limit the location of adult uses and to promote the Town of Hopkinton's great interest in protecting and preserving the quality of its neighborhoods, commercial districts and the quality of life through effective land use planning; 
 
Now, therefore, pursuant to MGL c. 40A, § 9A, and MGL c. 272, § 31, the following is hereby established as the Adult Uses Bylaw of the Town of Hopkinton.

If applicable, annual certification demonstrating continuing compliance with the standards of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the American National Standards Institute and required maintenance shall be filed with the Director of Municipal Inspections by the special permit holder. 
 
§ 210-101. Regulations. 
 
A. To the extent feasible, all service providers shall collocate on a single facility. To the extent technologically practicable, towers shall be designed to structurally accommodate the maximum number of users. The intent of this requirement is to reduce the number of towers which will be required to be located within the community. 
 
B. New towers shall be considered by the Board of Appeals only after a determination by the Board that existing or approved towers cannot accommodate the wireless communications equipment planned for the proposed tower. 
 
C. In no event shall any tower be located closer than two miles to any other tower, except after presentation of evidence of need therefor to the Board of Appeals and the grant of a variance by it. 
 
D. Tower height shall not be more than 100 feet above the existing grade, except after presentation of evidence of need therefor to the Board of Appeals and the grant of a variance by it. 
 
E. A tower shall not be erected nearer to any property line than a distance equal to the vertical height of the tower (inclusive of any appurtenant devices), measured at the mean finished grade of the tower base.

F. To the extent feasible, all network interconnections from the communications site shall be via land lines. 
 
G. Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable. 
H. The tower shall minimize, to the extent feasible, adverse visual effects on the environment. The Board of Appeals may impose reasonable conditions to ensure this result, including painting and lighting standards. 
 
I. Traffic associated with the tower and accessory facilities and structures shall not adversely affect adjacent ways. 
 
J. Applicants proposing to erect wireless communications towers, accessory facilities and structures on municipally owned land or structures shall provide evidence of contractual authorization from the Town of Hopkinton to conduct wireless communications services on municipally owned property.

  (a) In Residence B and Residence-Lake Front Districts: 
 
                  Total Number of Lots =  Total Parcel Area - (.5X Wetlands) - (.1X Total Parcel Area) 
   45,000 
     (b) In the Agricultural District: 
 
                  Total Number of Lots =  Total Parcel Area - (.5X Wetlands) - (.1X Total Parcel Area) 
   60,000 
 
§ 210-111. Intensity regulations. [Amended 5-3-1994 ATM, Art. 25; 5-2-2000 ATM, Art. 34; 5-5-2003 ATM, Art. 24, 5-4-2005 ATM, Art. 27; 5-1-2006 ATM, Art. 35, 5-3-2010 ATM, Art. 43] 
 
The Planning Board may grant a reduction of all intensity regulations of the underlying zoning regulations for all portions of an open space and landscape preservation development if the Planning Board finds that such reduction will result in better design, improved protection of historic, natural and scenic resources and will otherwise comply with these regulations, provided that in no instance shall any lot deviate from the following Table of Minimum Requirements unless a further reduction is necessary in order to preserve a historic structure.[Amended 5-3-2010 ATM, Art. 43]

A. The lot frontage depth requirement contained in this Chapter, Article I, § 210-4, Definitions, definition of "lot frontage," may be waived by the Planning Board in order to achieve the purposes of this article. 
 
B. Dead-end streets may be permitted in an open space and landscape preservation development but shall not exceed 1,000 feet in length. No dead-end street shall provide access to more than 10 building lots. 
 
C. Common driveways may be permitted in an open space and landscape preservation development, provided that each common drive serves no more than two lots. The requirement in this Zoning Bylaw that a driveway providing the principal access to a lot be across the designated frontage of the lot shall not apply when a common driveway is to be utilized in an open space and landscape preservation development; provided, however, that the common driveway must cross the designated frontage of one of the lots it serves.  
 
§ 210-112. Development standards.  
 
A. Concept plan standards. Prior to the issuance of a special permit for an open space and landscape preservation development, the applicant shall submit the information necessary to demonstrate that the following standards have been met: 
 
(1) The development will not cause unreasonable traffic congestion or unsafe conditions both within and outside of the development. 
 
(2) The development will provide for and maintain convenient and safe emergency vehicle access to all buildings and structures at all times. 
 
(3) The site design shall preserve and, where possible, enhance the historic and natural features of the property, including scenic views, by adapting the location and placement of structures and ways to the existing topography in order to minimize the amount of soil removal, tree cutting and general disturbance to the landscape and surrounding properties. 
 
(4) The site design shall identify and ensure preservation of significant and special historic and natural features, and use of § 210-117.2, Lots with Historic Structures, shall be considered as a mechanism to do so, where appropriate.  [Amended 5-1-2006 ATM, Art. 35; Amended 5-2-2016 ATM, Art. 35] 
 
B. Definitive plan standards. Prior to the approval of a definitive plan based upon the open space and landscape preservation concept plan, the applicant shall submit the information necessary to demonstrate that the following standards have been met. These standards are in addition to the requirements of the Hopkinton Subdivision Rules and Regulations and are in no way intended to replace any portion of those regulations. 
 
(1) The nature of the soils and subsoils shall be suited for the intended purposes based upon the Soil Conservation Guidelines. This determination shall focus upon but shall not be limited to the locations, design and construction of roadways, buildings and surface water drainage systems. Soil borings or test pits may be made to provide information on soil texture, color, percolation rates and depth to the groundwater table at its maximum elevation. 
 
(2) Anticipated storm water runoff from the site shall not exceed peak runoff from the site prior to development. The applicant shall submit formal drainage calculations by a registered professional engineer for this purpose. 
 
(3) Proper soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed to prevent sedimentation and siltation of existing surface water bodies and wetlands. In areas where the land slopes downward toward any surface water body or fresh water wetland, proposed filling, cutting, clearing or grading shall be minimized and all such development activities shall be carried out in such a way as to retain the natural vegetation and topography wherever possible. The Planning Board may require that an erosion and sedimentation control plan be submitted if significant erosion is anticipated in slope areas. 
 
§ 210-113. Open space use and design standards.  
 
A. Within an open space and landscape preservation development, no less than 50% of the land area shall be devoted to common open space. The common open space shall not include land set aside for roads and/or parking uses. The Planning Board may reduce the common open space requirement to 30%, if it is demonstrated that a minimum lot area of 45,000 square feet is required because of soils and topographical conditions, or if it would facilitate the preservation of a historic structure. No more than 50% of the common open space shall contain wetlands as defined by MGL c. 131, § 40. [Amended 5-3-2010 ATM, Art. 43] 
 
B. The common open space shall be designed and maintained in accordance with the following standards: 
 
(1) Areas to remain as naturally existing woods, fields, meadows and wetlands shall be maintained and may be improved in accordance with good conservation practices. 
 
(2) Common open space shall be planned as large, contiguous units wherever possible. Strips of narrow parcels of common open space shall be permitted only when necessary for access or as vegetated buffers along the site's perimeter. 
 
(3) Common open space may be in more than one parcel, provided that the size, shape and location of such parcels are suitable for the designated uses. 
 
(4) No more than 20% of the common open space shall be covered by man-made impervious surfaces. 
 
(5) Common open space may be used for active and passive recreation, conservation, forestry, agriculture, natural buffers, structures necessary for approved uses, utilities and other facilities necessary for the convenience and enjoyment of the residents, subject to approval by the Planning Board. 
 
(6) If detention and/or retention ponds are necessary for the construction of the improvements shown on the subdivision plan, such detention and/or retention ponds shall not be located within the common open space shown on such plan. The Planning Board may waive this requirement if the Board finds that the integrity and significance of the open space and the benefit of the open space to the Town are not compromised, and that the open space created conforms with the intent and purpose of this article. In no case, however, shall permanent clearing for drainage improvements or utilities, including detention and/or retention ponds, exceed 5% of any common open space parcel. [Added 5-1-1995, ATM, Art. 32]  


 
 
 
C. Buffer areas. 
 
(1) There shall be a buffer at the perimeter of the site consisting of trees, shrubs, vegetation and topographic features sufficient to separate and/or screen the development from abutting properties. This buffer shall be no less than 100 feet in width.The buffer shall be considered common open space. Upon a finding by the Planning Board that a buffer of lesser width would be sufficient to screen and/or separate the development from adjacent property, or would allow a historic structure to be preserved the buffer may be reduced. If, however, the perimeter of the site abuts a Business (B), Downtown Business (BD), Rural Business (BR) or Industrial A (IA) or Industrial B (IB) zoning district, the Planning Board may require the buffer area abutting a B, BR, IA or IB District to be greater than 100 feet in order to ensure adequate separation and/or screening from the abutting commercial zoning districts. [Amended 5-7-2007 ATM, Art. 25 and Art. 26, 5-4-2009 ATM, Art. 25, 5-3-2010 ATM, Art. 43] 
 
(2) The Board may require no-cut easements, conservation restrictions or the like where the buffer requirement has been reduced. These easements and restrictions shall be on private property, shall not be considered a buffer and shall not be included in common open space calculations. 
 
(3) Retention and/or detention ponds may be permitted in the buffer area upon approval of the Planning Board. Structures shall not be permitted in the buffer area. [Amended 5-1-1995, ATM, Art. 32] 
 
(4) Buffer areas shall remain substantially in their current natural state; provided, however, that such areas may include new trails and trailhead parking areas as may be approved by the Planning Board. [Amended 5-6-2015 ATM, Art. 35] 
 
§ 210-114. Common open space ownership and management.  
 
A. Common open space in any open space and landscape preservation development shall be conveyed a) to the Town and may be accepted by it for park or open space use; b) a nonprofit corporation, the principal purpose of which is the conservation of open space; or c) a corporation or trust owned or to be owned by the owners of lots within the development. If a corporation or trust owned by the owners of lots is utilized, ownership thereof shall pass with the conveyances of the lots. In any case where such land is not conveyed to the town, a conservation restriction enforceable by the Town shall be recorded, which shall provide that such land shall be kept in an open or natural state and shall not be built upon for residential use or developed for accessory uses, such as parking or roadway. [5-2-2000 ATM, Art. 34] 
 
B. If the common open space is not to be conveyed to the town, then the applicant shall include, as part of the covenant, a provision that the common open space will be deeded as approved by the Planning Board. In addition, the covenant shall not be released until proof of ownership has been provided to the Planning Board. 
 
C. If the common open space is not to be conveyed to the town, the applicant for an open space and landscape preservation development special permit must include a program describing how the common open space will be maintained in perpetuity to standards satisfactory to the Planning Board. The applicant shall also provide as part of the common open space proposal an agreement empowering the Town to perform maintenance of the common open space in the event of failure to comply with the program included in the application pursuant to the preceding sentence, provided that, if the Town is required to perform any maintenance work, the owners of lots within  
 the open space and landscape preservation development shall pay the cost thereof and that the cost shall constitute a lien upon their properties until said cost has been paid. 
 
D. The Planning Board may require that all or such part of the common open space as the Planning Board deems appropriate shall be clearly identified and marked on the ground prior to the commencement of any construction activity. [Amended 5-1-1995 ATM, Art. 33] 
 
E.  The common open space shall be conveyed prior to the issuance of the first building permit in an open space and landscape preservation development.  The Planning Board may grant an extension of time to convey any portion of the common open space, but only if the entity or agency to whom the open space will be conveyed concurs with the request, or in the case of a homeowners association still under the control of the applicant, the intended recipient of the conservation restriction shall concur with the request. [Amended 5-1-2017 ATM, Art. 35] 
 
§ 210-115. Application and review process.  
 
The application process for an open space and landscape preservation development is comprised of two steps. In the first step, the applicant submits a concept plan, as outlined below, which describes the overall development plan. The Planning Board shall grant or deny a special permit based upon the information contained in the concept plan. If the special permit is granted, the applicant then submits a definitive plan, as described below, based upon the concept plan. The Planning Board then reviews the plan as a definitive subdivision plan. Two separate public hearings, one for the special permit and one for the definitive plan, must be held. 
 
A. Concept plan. 
 
(1) The applicant for an open space and landscape preservation development special permit shall first submit 10 copies of a concept plan as outlined below. The applicant shall also submit a sketch plan at the same scale showing how development of the parcel would be achieved by a conventional subdivision plan, in accordance with all applicable land use regulations. All applications for a special permit under this section shall be referred by the Planning Board to the Board of Health, Conservation Commission and other board/agency/department for its review and comments within 14 days of its submission to the Planning Board. Any such board or agency to which applications are referred for comment shall make its recommendations and send copies thereof to the Planning Board and the applicant within 35 days of receipt of the referral request from the Planning Board or there shall be deemed to be no opposition or desire to comment. The Planning Board shall not act upon said special permit until either comments from referred boards or agencies have been received or said 35 days from the date of the referral request have elapsed, whichever is sooner. A public hearing shall be held in conformance with MGL, c. 40A, § 9. 
 
(2) Concept plan. All applicants for open space and landscape preservation development special permits shall submit a concept plan prepared by a professional landscape architect registered in Massachusetts. The concept plan shall contain the following information, in addition to the requirements of a preliminary plan as specified in the Hopkinton Subdivision Rules and Regulations, Section 5.2, and information sufficient to illustrate and establish that the concept plan standards and special permit criteria of this section have been met: [Amended 5-5-2003 ATM, Art. 24; Amended 5-4-2009 ATM, Art. 25] 
 
(a) Existing landscape features, such as steep topography, including a delineation of areas with slopes over 25%, wetlands, springs, lakes and ponds, streams, rock outcrops, boulder fields, stone walls, cliffs, forest glades, drumlins, high points, hilltops and ridges. 
 
(b) Existing open areas, such as forests, farm fields, meadows and major long views. 
 
(c) In the event the parcel includes previously disturbed land, the applicant shall include a reclamation plan. 
 
(3) Special permit criteria. The special permit shall be granted only if the Planning Board finds each of the following: 
 
(a) The development meets the purpose of an open space and landscape preservation development as described in § 210-106. 
 
(b) The development standards contained in § 210-112A(1) through (4) have been met. 
 
(c) The common open space is designed in accordance with the standards set forth in § 210-113B. 
 
(d) The common open space is designed in accordance with the standards set forth in § 210-113C. 
 
(e) The parcel could be developed as a conventional subdivision under existing local, state and federal land use regulations. 
 
(f) The open space and landscape preservation development provides for efficient use and delivery of municipal and other services and infrastructure. 
 
B. Definitive plan. 
 
(1) If the open space and landscape preservation development special permit is granted, the applicant shall submit a plan in conformity with the requirements and procedures for definitive plan submission and review under the Subdivision Rules and Regulations of the Planning Board. In accordance with MGL c. 41, § 81R, the applicant may request a waiver from the Subdivision Rules and Regulations if such action is in the public interest and consistent with the intent and purposes of this article, the Subdivision Control Law, and the special permit. The Planning Board then shall review the aspects of the open space and landscape preservation development with regard to its compliance to the Subdivision Control Law, and hold a public hearing as required by MGL c. 41, § 81T. The overall concept shall only be reconsidered if there is substantial variation between the definitive plan and the concept plan. A substantial variation shall be defined as an increase in the number of lots, a decrease in the open space acreage, a change in the layout which causes dwelling units or roadways to be placed closer to a dwelling unit within 500 feet of the project and/or a change in the development pattern which adversely affects natural landscape features and open space. If the Planning Board finds that a substantial variation exists, it must hold a public hearing on the modifications of the concept plan. 




 
(2) The concept design review fee will be calculated as the preliminary plan design review fee in the Hopkinton Subdivision Rules and Regulations. The definitive plan design review fee will be calculated as the definitive design review fee in the Hopkinton Subdivision Rules and Regulations.

C. Administration. Within seven days of receipt of the special permit application, the Planning Board shall transmit a copy of the application to the Historical Commission for comment and recommendations. 


 
§ 210-118. Setbacks. 
 
A. No building need provide a greater setback or front yard than the average provided by the nearest  principal buildings on the adjoining side lots. In determining such an average, a vacant lot shall  be considered as though it had a building meeting the minimum setback requirements from the  street line. 
B. All structures must meet the minimum setback requirements from the street line as required in  this Chapter for each street abutting the lot. [Added 5-1-1995 ATM, Article 35]

§ 210-119.2. Highway buffer. [Added 5-2-2000 ATM, Article 31, Amended 5-7-2007 ATM, Article 26] 
 
On all lots which abut Interstate Routes 495 and/or 90, in every zoning district with the exception of the Rural Business and Industrial A and Industrial B Districts, there shall be a buffer adjacent to Interstate Routes 495 and 90 a minimum of 50 feet wide, measured from the edge of the highway right-of-way/property line. Buffer areas shall remain wooded, and no clearing of trees or other vegetation or the alteration of other landscape features shall be permitted. No buildings, sewage disposal systems, paved areas, athletic fields, active recreation areas or any other use which requires the clearing of trees or other vegetation or the alteration of other landscape features, with the exception of wireless communication facilities, will be permitted within the buffer area. 
 
§ 210-120.  Common Driveways [Added 5-4-2009 ATM, Article 26] 
 
A. Purpose 


 
The purpose of this Section is to promote public safety, provide for adequate sight distance, avoid site disturbance, minimize the alteration of topographical characteristics and natural resource areas, which include wetlands and historic resources, minimize stormwater runoff and retain a rural residential character.  It is not the intent to make undevelopable land developable. 
 
B. Applicability 


 
With the exception of common driveways within Open Space and Landscape Preservation Development subdivisions (Article XVII), construction of common driveways shall require a special permit from the Planning Board.  The term common driveway shall mean a single private way providing vehicular access to 2 single family dwellings (the benefitted parcels).   
 
Common driveways must be privately owned and maintained, shall not be considered streets or public ways, and shall not constitute a part of the designated or legal frontage for any lot.   
 
C. Design Requirements 


 
All common driveways must comply with the following design requirements: 
 
(1) A common driveway must extend from the benefitted parcels to a public or private street right of way.  A common driveway, as well as the individual driveways beyond the common portion of the  


 
driveway, must be located entirely within the benefitted parcels.  A common driveway must intersect the street right of way within the legal frontage of one of the benefitted parcels. 
 
(2) The benefitted parcels must have permanent access to the common driveway by easements recorded in the South Middlesex Registry of Deeds.   


 
(3) The deeds to the benefitted parcels shall require that the owners thereof must establish a maintenance association, the purpose of which is to provide for the maintenance and repair of the common driveway, or otherwise adequately provide for the maintenance and repair of the common driveway.  The term maintenance shall include, but not be limited to, snow plowing, maintaining design specifications, and repair and maintenance of surfaces and stormwater management facilities.  All property contiguous to the common driveway must be a part of the benefitted parcels which must be included within the maintenance association.  The easement containing the common driveway shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width. 


 
(4) Minimum Construction Standards.   


 
(a) The radius of the common driveway intersection with the street right of way must be sufficient to enable emergency vehicles to exit and enter the common driveway without leaving the surface of the common driveway.  Common driveways shall accommodate the Single-Unit Truck (SU-30) vehicle turning radius at all curve radii, in accordance with the January, 2006 MassHighway Project Development and Design Guide.   





 
(b) A minimum depth of 8 inches of gravel must be installed the full width of the entire common driveway traveled way. 





 
(c) The maximum grade of the common driveway shall be no greater than 5% within 40 feet of the street right of way.  The maximum grade of a common driveway for its full length beyond the initial 40 feet is 15%. 





 
(5) House numbers of sufficient visibility shall be provided at the entry point onto the street right of way and at each individual driveway along the common driveway, so that emergency vehicles can locate each dwelling.   


 
(6) Adequate sight line distance must be provided for vehicles exiting the common driveway. 


 
(7) The minimum width of the traveled way of a common driveway must be no less than 12 feet.  


 
(8) Passing turnouts shall be provided which provide a total width of at least 18 feet for a distance of 25 feet, where needed for safe site lines of passage. 


 
(9) Provisions to permit the turn around of a SU-30 vehicle shall be provided at the terminus of all common driveways longer than 500 feet. 


 
D. Administration 



 
(1) A special permit is required from the Planning Board to construct a common driveway.  A record owner desiring to construct a common driveway shall file with the Planning Board an application, together with such plans, drawings, specifications, fees and additional information as required by the Planning Board.   


(2) The Planning Board shall conduct its review, hold a public hearing and file its decision with the Town Clerk as required by the provisions of this Chapter. [Amended 5-6-2015 ATM, Art. 39] 


 
(3) An Applicant must provide documentation and plans which are sufficient, in the opinion of the Planning Board, for it to determine that the requirements, provisions and Approval Criteria of this Section are met.  Such documentation shall include, but shall not be limited to, information on impacts to the environment, public safety, scenic roads and scenic views, and lot development. 


 
(4) Approval Criteria.  Before the Planning Board may issue the special permit, it shall determine each of the following: 


 
(a) The common driveway will provide safe and reasonable access for fire, police and emergency vehicles. 


 
(b) The common driveway meets the purpose and requirements of this Section. 


 
(c) The common driveway will minimize the environmental impacts. 


 
(d) The common driveway will not serve more than two single family dwellings. 


 
(5) The Planning Board may approve the special permit with conditions, which may include, but shall not be limited to: a) a performance bond, secured by deposit of money or negotiable securities, is posted with the Town to guarantee proper construction; and b) construction standards for the common driveway.   



 
§ 210-121. Maximum heights. [Amended 5-4-1993 ATM, Art. 19; 5-5-1997 ATM, Art. 26; 5-5-2003 ATM, Art. 27] 
 
In the RA, RB, RLF and A Districts, no structure used for residential purposes shall be erected to a height greater than 40 feet. Structures used for nonresidential purposes in said Districts shall not be erected to a height greater than 35 feet. Chimneys, spikes, towers and other projections not used for human occupancy may be constructed above the foregoing height limitations upon the grant of a special permit by the Board of Appeals; provided, however, that no wireless communications facility shall be erected except in compliance with Article XVI, Wireless Communications Facilities.  
 
§ 210-121.1. Buffers around nonresidential uses in residential districts. [Added 5-3-1999 ATM, Art. 22] 
 
A. A lot which contains a nonresidential use in a Residence A, Residence B, Residence Lake Front or Agricultural District shall contain a buffer area at the perimeter of the lot. The buffer area shall consist of trees, shrubs, vegetation and topographic features sufficient to separate and/or visually screen the use from abutting properties in a residential district and shall be located on the same lot as the nonresidential use. For the purposes of this section, the following shall not be considered nonresidential uses: 
 
 (1) Lawful and permitted accessory uses to a residential use. 
 
 (2) Home occupation. 
 
 (3) Home professional office. 
 
 (4) Home personal service. 
 
 (5) Home business workshop. 
 
 (6) Home specialty retail. 
 
 (7) Agriculture, horticulture, floriculture and viticulture. 
 
 (8) Utilities. 
 
 (9) Permanently restricted open space for passive recreation. 
 
 (10) Undeveloped open land. 
 
B. The buffer shall be no less than 25 feet wide in a Residence A District; 50 feet wide in a Residence B and Residence Lake Front District; and 75 feet wide in an Agricultural District. The buffer requirement shall not apply with regard to the area adjacent to the street providing the legal frontage for the lot. The buffer requirement shall not apply to nonresidential uses which are located on a lot which abuts a residential district but, rather, shall apply only to nonresidential uses which are upon premises located within a residential district. 
 
C. Buffer areas shall remain in their natural state. If, in the opinion of the Planning Board, the current natural state is insufficient to adequately separate and/or screen the site from abutting properties, additional trees, shrubs, plantings or fencing may be required. 
 
D. Activities and structures not permitted within the buffer areas include, but are not limited to: light poles and/or fixtures; parking lots; driveways; buildings; athletic playing fields; playgrounds. Pedestrian and bicycle trails may be located within buffer areas. 
 
E. Upon a finding by the Planning Board that a buffer of lesser width would be sufficient to screen and/or separate the use from adjacent property, the width of the buffer may be reduced. The buffer width requirement may also be reduced in the event that the lot was previously developed and used for a permitted use within the district and permanent structures were erected within the buffer area. In those circumstances, it is the intent of the Board not to waive the buffer requirement, but, rather, to provide alternative screening arrangements, such as fencing and planting where possible. 
 
§ 210-122. Earth removal. 
 
Earth removal shall be permitted only in accordance with Chapter 96, Earth Removal, of the Bylaws of the Town of Hopkinton, regardless of zoning district. 
 
§ 210-123. Trailers. [Amended 3-7-1963 ATM, Art. 35]

(1) Alteration to an existing dwelling which complies with all current size and setback requirements and such alteration also complies with the current size and setback requirements and building height requirements; 
 
(2) Alteration to an existing dwelling which encroaches upon one or more required yard width or setback requirement, where the alteration will comply with all current setback and building height requirements. 
 
Alteration of a single or two family dwelling which does not conform to the foregoing circumstances shall require the issuance of a special permit by the Board of Appeals upon a finding that the  proposed change is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood.  
 
B.  Nonconforming Structures 
 
A nonconforming building or structure which is not a single or two family dwelling may be altered, reconstructed, extended or structurally changed only after the issuance of a special permit by the  Board of Appeals upon a finding that the proposed change is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood.  
 
C.  Nonconforming Lots 
 
A lot which complied with the minimum area and frontage requirements in effect at the time it was created, has not been held in common ownership with adjoining land since rendered nonconforming, and has at least 5,000 square feet of area and 50 feet of frontage, may be built upon for a single or two family dwelling as of right if the dwelling will comply with all applicable regulations of this Chapter.  Construction of a single or two family dwelling or other lawful building on such lots where the proposed dwelling or building will not comply with the applicable regulations of this Chapter is permitted only upon the issuance of a special permit by the Board of Appeals and a finding that the proposed change is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood. 
 
D.  Nonconforming Uses 
 
(1) Alteration, reconstruction, extension or structural change (collectively alteration) to a nonconforming use to provide for the use in a manner substantially different from the use to which it was put before alteration or for its use for the same purpose to a substantially greater extent shall require the issuance of a special permit by the Board of Appeals upon a finding that the proposed use is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood. 


 
(2) A change from one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use shall require the issuance of a special permit by the Board of Appeals, upon a finding that the proposed use is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood and that the proposed use is a similar or more restricted use.   


 
(3) Where an existing use lacks the required off-street parking facilities for the district in which it is located, such lack shall not render said use nonconforming, but any part of a lot containing such use that is used for parking on the effective date of this Chapter may not be thereafter built upon unless either sufficient additional parking facilities are obtained and made available to keep the ratio of parking space to floor area the same or the remaining number of parking spaces provided conforms to the requirements of this Chapter. 


 
§ 210-129. Abandonment. [Amended 4-13-1978 ATM, Art. 39] 
 
A nonconforming use may not be resumed or changed to another nonconforming use after any of the events or periods described below have taken place: 
 
A. Abandonment of use for two years (for example, removal and failure to replace installations  necessary thereto). 
 
B. Two years during which it has been neither used nor offered for sale. 
 
C. Failure to resume use or to convert to another approved nonconforming use within two years of  purchase. 
 
§ 210-130. Reversion. 
 
Once a nonconforming use reverts to a more restricted use, it may not return again to its original less restricted use. 
 
§ 210-131. Destruction. 
 
Once a nonconforming use has been destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion or other catastrophe, it may be rebuilt or restored at the same location and again used as it previously was, provided that its owner shall apply for a building permit and start operations for restoring or rebuilding on said premises within 12 months after such catastrophe; and further, provided, that the buildings as restored shall not exceed in volume or area the original nonconforming structure. 
 
§ 210-132. Existing special permit uses not nonconforming. 
 
Where an existing building use or land use is situated in a zoning district where it is permitted only upon the granting of a special permit by the Board of Appeals, said use shall not be deemed nonconforming by reason thereof; rather, the special permit shall be deemed to have been granted for the use as it was on the effective date of this Chapter. 
 
 
ARTICLE XX 
Site Plan Review 
 
 [HISTORY: Replaces Zoning Bylaw Article XX in its entirety by the Annual Town Meeting of the Town of Hopkinton 05-07-2012, Art. 45.] 
 
§ 210-133. Purpose.  
 
The purpose of this Article is to protect the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the public by providing a comprehensive review of plans for uses and structures that may have impacts on traffic, services and utilities, environmental quality, water resources, drainage and community character. The Town encourages site plans to be designed to utilize energy efficient technology and renewable energy resources, and adhere to the principles of energy-conscious design with regard to orientation, building materials, shading, landscaping and other elements.  With respect to building design, consideration should be given to the architectural style and its relation to the prevailing character and scale of buildings in the neighborhood.  Factors to be considered include appropriate building materials, screening, breaks in roof and wall lines, massing and other architectural techniques.  The construction, alteration, enlargement or reconstruction of buildings that are to be used exclusively for residential purposes shall be exempt from the provisions of this Article.  Any use or structure, or expansion thereof, referred to in section 3 of Chapter 40A of the Massachusetts General Laws shall not be exempt from the provisions of this article, provided any of the criteria contained in §210-134 also applies. 
 
§ 210-134. Definitions. 
 
As used in this Article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: 
 
MAJOR PROJECT - Any construction project that requires new construction or will result in a change in the outside appearance or a change of use of a building or buildings or premises, and that includes one or more of the following 
 
A.   Construction of 5,000 or more square feet of gross floor area; or 
 
B.   An increase in gross floor area by 50% or more, which results in a gross floor area of at least 5,000 square feet; or 
 
C.   Construction of a parking area containing 25 or more parking spaces, or the addition of 25 or more parking spaces to an existing parking lot. 
 
MINOR PROJECT - Any construction project or change of use, not included within the definition of a "major project," that includes one or more of the following: 
 
A.   An increase in gross floor area of not more than 5,000 square feet or the addition of rooftop HVAC or mechanical equipment, substantially visible from a public or private street or public place, requiring a building permit; or 
 
B.   Construction, enlargement or alteration of a parking area containing five or more parking spaces. 
 
For the purposes of Site Plan Review, the term gross floor area shall mean the sum of the gross horizontal areas of the several floors of a building including all garages, basements and cellars.  All dimensions shall be taken from the exterior faces of walls, including the exterior faces of enclosed porches. [Amended 5-1-2017 ATM, Article 37] 
 
§ 210-135. Procedure.   
 
A.   An Applicant for site plan review shall file with the Planning Board an application and submission materials as required by the Site Plan Review Submission Requirements and Procedures adopted by the Planning Board and filed with the Town Clerk. 
 
B.   The Planning Board shall, within five days of receipt of a site plan review application, transmit copies of the application and the site plan to the Director of Municipal Inspections, Conservation Commission, Board of Health, Design Review Board, and Director of Public Works for comments and recommendations. 
 
C.   The Planning Board shall hold a public hearing within 65 days of the filing of any application for a major project and shall file a decision within 90 days of the close of the hearing. The Planning Board shall hold a public hearing and shall file a decision on an application for a minor project within 60 days of the receipt of the application. Notice of the time, place, and subject matter of the public hearing shall be given by the Planning Board, at the expense of the Applicant, to the Applicant and to all owners of land abutting the land being the subject of such application as appearing on the most recent tax list on file at the Assessors Office. In addition, in the case of major project site plan review, the Planning Board shall also give notice of the time, place, and subject matter of the public hearing, at the expense of the Applicant, by advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town, once in each of two successive weeks, the first publication being not less than 14 days before the day of such hearing. The time within which the Planning Board must act on an application may be extended upon mutual agreement in writing between the Planning Board and the Applicant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Planning Board must act on a major project site plan review application for a renewable/alternative energy research and development or renewable/alternative energy manufacturing facility within six (6) months of the date of submission of a complete application.  Failure 
to act within the time limitations established in this article shall be deemed constructive approval of the application. 
 
D.   Final action shall be a "Decision of Site Plan Review" that is filed with the Office of the Town Clerk and the Director of Municipal Inspections. 
 
E.    A majority vote of the membership of the Board shall be sufficient to approve or disapprove a Decision of Site Plan Review. 
 
F.   Appeals.   
 
Any person aggrieved by a Decision of Site Plan Review by the Planning Board may appeal such Decision to the Board of Appeals within 20 days of the date filed with the Office of the Town Clerk.  All Decisions of Site Plan Review issued by the Planning Board shall include a brief notice of such rights of appeal.  Any such appeal shall contain a reasonably concise statement of the grounds therefor. 
 
If the Planning Board has issued a denial decision, the Board of Appeals shall examine the proposal and prepare its own findings to determine if the Applicant has failed to furnish the information, materials or fees required by this Article or by the Submission Requirements and Procedures adopted by the Planning Board, or if the application and site plan present a problem so intractable as to admit of no reasonable solution. 
 
If the Planning Board has issued an approval decision, the Board of Appeals shall examine the proposal and prepare its own findings to determine whether the conditions imposed by the Planning Board are reasonable, and shall limit its evaluation to those conditions at issue in the appeal.  The Board of Appeals shall determine the reasonableness of each such condition in a two-step process:  
 
(1)  The Board shall determine whether the condition relates to one of the Site Plan Standards listed in Section 210-136.1; and 
(2)  The Board shall examine the condition for reasonableness, which requires that the Board make detailed factual findings to justify its determination of the conditions reasonableness or unreasonableness. 
 
As the party requesting relief, the Appellant bears the burden of proof before the Board of Appeals.  Any party before the Board of Appeals upon appeal shall have the right to introduce testimony or evidence relating to the grounds for appeal. 
 
§ 210-136.1 Site Plan Standards 
 
The site plan shall be designed to conform to the following Site Plan Standards: 
 
A.   Site disturbance in wetland buffer zones and to slopes in excess of 25% shall be minimized. 
 
B.   Unique natural and historic features shall be preserved whenever feasible, and the use of § 210-117.2, Lots with Historic Structures, shall be considered as a mechanism to do so, where appropriate.  [Amended 5-2-2016 ATM, Art. 35] 
 
C.   Tree, vegetation and soil removal shall be minimized. 
 
D.   The site activities shown on the Site Plan shall be screened from view from abutting properties in residential use.  Methods of screening may include solid fencing, landscaping or other proposals of the 
Applicant, subject to review by the Planning Board.  Such screening may be located on or off-site.  If located off-site, written permission of the off-site property owner shall be provided to the Board. 
 
E.   All utilities shall be underground. 
 
F.   Exposed storage areas, machinery, service areas, truck loading areas, utility buildings and structures and other similar uses shall be visually screened from abutting properties and those using public ways.

I.    The site plan shall maximize the convenience and safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement within the site and to and from adjacent public ways.  If supporting documentation, such as a traffic or parking study, submitted to the Planning Board indicates that the vehicular and pedestrian traffic movement depicted on the site plan and proposed in the application will have a significant negative impact or impacts on the site or within the adjacent ways, such impacts shall be mitigated by the Applicant.   
 
J.    Parking areas shall be designed so that they are safe and convenient and do not detract from the use and enjoyment of proposed structures.  Parking areas shall be designed to facilitate safe pedestrian access to the structures and other on-site facilities. 
 
K.   The site plan shall minimize the number of curb cuts on public ways.   
 
L.   Driveways shall be designed to ensure safe sight distances at interior and exterior intersections and along driveways, in accordance with applicable AASHTO requirements.

(a) To light a primary entrance, when the fixture or lamp is wall-mounted under an architectural element (e.g., roofs over walkways, entries or overhanging, nontranslucent eaves) so that the uplighting is fully captured; 


 
(b) To light local, state or national flags; or 


 
(c) To highlight or illuminate a building facade or landscaping, or to highlight or illuminate statues or monuments. 


 
(7) Floodlighting shall be permitted only if a fully shielded fixture is utilized and no lighting will fall onto the property of others. 


 
(8) Safety and security lighting shall use motion sensors, photocells, or photocells or timers to control duration of nighttime illumination.   


 
(9) Exterior lighting of recreation facilities shall utilize fully shielded fixtures and, except as authorized by Special Permit or Site Plan Approval, shall be turned off by 10:00 p.m. or at the conclusion of an activity begun before 10:00 p.m.; provided, however, that in any event the exterior lighting shall be turned off by midnight.  


 
(10) Blinking, flashing, moving, revolving and flickering lights, as well as lighting that changes intensity or color shall be prohibited except for lighting for public safety or traffic control and lighting required by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration for air traffic control and warning purposes. 


 
(11) Notwithstanding any provisions of this subsection to the contrary, sidewalks that run along the perimeter of a site and are in a public right of way or on abutting property may be illuminated, and illumination may spill onto abutting non-residential property if requested in writing by the abutting property owner. 


 
Exterior lighting that does not conform to the provisions of this subsection may be allowed by special permit from the Planning Board if the Planning Board finds that such exterior lighting will be consistent with the Purposes of this Article, or that there are other demonstrable community, health, safety or welfare benefits that will be served by the exterior lighting.  No special permit may be granted pursuant to this subsection unless the Planning Board determines that the proposed exterior lighting is appropriate for the size and use of the property, any buildings thereon, and the neighborhood setting. 
 
O.   Adequate access shall be provided to each structure for emergency vehicles and personnel. 
 
P.    The site plan shall conform to applicable Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection Stormwater Management Regulations.  The site plan shall show adequate measures to prevent pollution of surface water and groundwater, to minimize erosion and sedimentation and to prevent changes in the potential for flooding.

B.     Disapproval of the application if the Applicant fails to furnish the information, materials or fees required in this Article or by the Submission Requirements and Procedures adopted by the Planning Board, or if the application and site plan present a problem so intractable so as to admit of no reasonable solution. 
 
Notwithstanding the above, regulation of uses and structures referred to in section 3 of Chapter 40A of the Massachusetts General Laws shall be limited to the extent required by said section. 
 
§ 210-137. Conditions of approval; building permits. 
 
Site plan approval may be made subject to reasonable conditions, modifications and restrictions relating to the Site Plan Standards contained in Section 210-136.1 as the Planning Board may deem necessary, and any construction, reconstruction, alteration or addition shall be carried out only in conformity with such conditions, modifications or restrictions and in conformity with the application and site plan. An order of conditions issued pursuant to section 40 of Chapter 131 of the Massachusetts General Laws or Chapter 206 of the Town of Hopkinton Bylaws, which imposes conditions inconsistent with a site plan approval, shall require a revision of the site plan to be submitted to the Planning Board for review and approval.  
 
In the discretion of the Planning Board, recording of a certification of the Town Clerk and the Decision of Site Plan Review at the Registry of Deeds may be made a condition of an approval. For any construction project or change in use that requires site plan review, no building permit may be issued unless and until the Applicant has complied with the provisions of this Article.  The conditions, modifications, and restrictions contained within the Decision of Site Plan Review shall be referenced in, incorporated into, and made an express condition of, such building permit.  
 
§ 210-138. Performance guarantee. 
 
As a condition of site plan approval, the Planning Board may require that a performance bond, secured by a deposit of money or negotiable securities in a form selected by the Planning Board, be posted with the Town to guarantee completion of improvements to be made in compliance with the plans submitted and approved hereunder. The Board may also require that an amount be included for land restoration not having to do with the construction of improvements. The amount of security shall be determined by an estimate from the Applicant's engineer, which may be confirmed or increased by the Board. The Town may use the secured funds for their stated purpose in the event that the Applicant does not complete all improvements in a manner satisfactory to the Board within two years from the date of approval, or the final date of the last extension of such approval, if any. 
 
§ 210-139. Duration of approval. 
 
Site plan approval for a minor or major project shall become void two years from the date of issue, which two years shall not include time required to pursue or await determination of an appeal, unless any 
construction work contemplated hereby shall have commenced and proceeded in good faith continuously to completion, except for good cause. In such case, a request for extension of the date of completion must be submitted to the Planning Board for approval. 
 
§ 210-140. Fees. 
 
Site plan review fees shall be governed and set by the Planning Board and shall be assessed to the owner and/or the Applicant. Such fee may include a deposit for review by a consultant selected by the Town.

The Board of Appeals shall cause to be made a detailed record of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact and setting forth clearly the reason or reasons for its decision, and of its other official actions, copies of all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the Town Clerk and shall be public record.

§210-152. Standards. [Removed 5-6-2015 ATM, Art. 39] 
 
A. Variances. [Amended 4-13-1978 ATM, Art. 39; 5-3-1999 ATM, Art. 24] 
(1) A variance from the terms of this chapter may be granted only where the Board of Appeals specifically finds that: 



 
(a) Owing to circumstances relating to the soil conditions, shape or topography (but not size) of such land or structures, and especially affecting such land or structures (but not affecting generally the zoning district in which it is located), a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner; and  
 
(b) Desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good, and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of this chapter. 
 
(2) Failure to establish any of the standards shall constitute grounds to deny a petition for a variance. A variance may not be granted if the circumstance creating the hardship was self-created or the hardship is unrelated to the premises for which the variance is sought. The loss of the protection afforded a nonconforming use under § 210-127 of this chapter is not a substantial hardship justifying the grant of a variance. [Amended 5-4-2009 ATM, Art. 2009] 


 
(3) If the Board grants a variance, it may impose conditions, safeguards and limitations, both of time and of use, including the continued existence of any particular structures. The Board may not impose conditions, safeguards or limitations based upon the continued ownership of the land or structures by the petitioner or any owner. 
 
B. In all matters on which it has jurisdiction to act, the Board of Appeals shall give due consideration to promoting the public health, safety, convenience and welfare, shall encourage the most appropriate use of land and shall permit no building or use injurious, noxious, offensive or detrimental to a neighborhood. To this end, it may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in each case.

 No Accessory Family Dwelling Unit for which the Board of Appeals grants a Special Permit pursuant to § 210-126 shall be deemed to be a separate Dwelling Unit for purposes of this Intensity of Use limitation. 
 
B.   Commercial Uses within the OSMUD District shall be limited to 450,000 square feet of Gross  Floor Space in the aggregate, which shall be allocated among the Subdistricts as authorized by a Master Plan Special Permit issued pursuant to § 210-172.

B.  Structures accessory to agricultural and horticultural use, including greenhouses, shall not be included  in the calculation of Gross Floor Area for purposes of the minimum parking requirements, except that  40% of the area of a greenhouse that is associated with a retail use in the same or an adjacent building  shall be included in such calculation of Gross Floor Area.  
 
C. Where parking uses have peak user demands at different times or where different uses are  accommodated by a shared parking space, as certified by a registered traffic engineer, the Planning  Board, by Special Permit may approve shared parking facilities, designed and intended to serve  more than a single use shown on a Site Plan, in satisfaction of the applicable minimum parking  requirements of § 210- 124(B) (1), as modified by this Section. 
 
D.  The Planning Board may, by Special Permit, approve an amount of parking less than applicable  minimum parking requirements of § 210- 124(B) (1), as modified by this Section, if it finds that  the lesser amount of parking will not cause excessive congestion or endanger public safety, and  that the lesser amount of parking will provide positive environmental or other benefits.  
 
E.  The Planning Board may, by Special Permit, approve a combination of on-lot and on-street parking, as is appropriate to a pedestrian-oriented environment, in satisfaction of the applicable minimum parking requirements of § 210- 124(B)(1), as modified by this Section. 
 
F.  No Special Permit shall be granted pursuant to Subsection C, D, or E above, unless the Planning Board determines that the provision of parking spaces proposed will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Chapter and adequate for all parking needs, and that all parking spaces associated with a use are within practical walking distance thereof. The Planning Board may grant such approvals with conditions, which may include, but need not be limited to, the following: 
 
(1)  A requirement that shared and off-site parking arrangements between property owners be formalized in an instrument that runs with the land and is recorded at the Registry of  Deeds;  
 
(2) A requirement that adequate space shall be set aside within the Development Project to construct additional parking spaces in the future should the mix of uses and peak  demand times change and require additional parking. 


 
§ 210-170.   Restricted Land  
 
A. Restricted Land may be used for active and passive recreation, conservation, forestry, agriculture,  natural buffers, underground utilities, municipal purposes and other similar purposes necessary  for the convenience and enjoyment of the OSMUD District or the Town, as well as other purposes  customarily associated with a use authorized by this Subsection. 


 
B. The Planning Board shall not issue a Master Plan Special Permit pursuant to §210-172 unless the  Master Plan includes not less than 500 acres of Restricted Land consistent with the development  and design objectives set forth in §210-162 and planned as large contiguous parcels wherever  possible. 


 
C. Prior to the commencement of a Construction Activity, the North Parcel, consisting of not less  than 68  acres, and the South Parcel, consisting of not less than 35 acres, both as shown on the  Official Zoning  Map, shall be made subject to a Restricted Land Covenant designating such land as open space   Restricted Land to be left in substantially its natural state, restored or landscaped, in perpetuity.   Thereafter, land designated as Restricted Land shall be subject to a Restricted Land Covenant in  accordance with the provisions of Subsection E below.  


 
D. Except with respect to the North Parcel and the South Parcel, which may not be released from their Restricted Land Covenants, the Restricted Land Covenants applicable to any Restricted Land may provide that such Restricted Land may be released from a Restricted Land Covenant by an instrument    executed by the owner, the Planning Board and the Board of Selectmen, and recorded, provided that not less than an equivalent area of land is made subject to a Restricted Land  Covenant and substituted therefor, subject to the approval of the Planning Board. The forms of Restricted Land Covenants appropriate for particular Restricted Land uses shall be approved by Town Counsel and included in the Master Plan Special Permit. 


 
E. Applications for Site Plan Review of Development Projects shall designate 1.80 acres of area to  remain as Restricted Land for every 1 acre of Buildable Area within the Development Project.   The Restricted Land so designated may be located within the Development Project for which Site  Plan Review is being sought or may be located elsewhere within the OSMUD District, and may  consist of an entire lot or of a portion of a lot.  The North Parcel and the South Parcel may be  designated to meet the Restricted Land requirement for Development Projects within the OSMUD  District.  


 
In the event that less than 500 acres have been made subject to a Restricted Land Covenant at the expiration of fifteen (15) years from the filing of a Notice pursuant to the provisions of §210-172, the owner or owners of such additional land as is required to achieve the 500-acre total shall subject such land to Restricted Land Covenants.  In the event that such owner or owners have not made such additional land as is required to achieve the 500-acre total subject to Restricted Land Covenants within 60 days of the expiration of such period, the Planning Board may designate one or more parcels as are required to achieve such 500-acre total, and such parcels shall forthwith be made subject to a Restricted Land Covenant by the owner or owners thereof.  The Planning Board shall have the authority to extend such deadline to a later date upon a finding that the holder or holders of the Master Plan Special Permit are continuing to pursue development of the OSMUD District and have not yet achieved substantial completion notwithstanding good faith efforts. The foregoing obligation shall be binding and enforceable pursuant to the provisions of Article XXIV only upon the owner of the parcels required to be restricted at the expiration of such period, as it may be extended, and shall not affect the compliance with this Chapter of any lot in a Development Project which has received Site Plan Approval prior to the expiration of such period, as it may be extended.   
 
F.  Restricted Land may be (i) owned by a Landowners Association, (ii) owned by a non-profit  entity, a  principal purpose of which is land conservation or the provision of recreational facilities, (iii)  conveyed to the Town, or (iv) owned by, made subject to easement rights benefiting, or leased to  third parties. In all such cases the uses permitted by such deeds, easements or leases of required  Restricted Land shall be consistent with the provisions of this §210-170, the Master Plan Special  Permit and the applicable Restricted Land Covenant.  A Landowners Association or other party  responsible for Restricted Land may adopt reasonable rules and regulations to govern  the use of the  Restricted Land under its control and to prevent encroachment thereon.  
 
G.  Restricted Land Covenants shall specify the permitted uses of specific parcels of Restricted Land; the  responsible party to be charged with maintenance and stewardship of the Restricted Land in  perpetuity; and a required program for such maintenance and stewardship. Applications for Site Plan  Review of Development Projects shall include an agreement  authorizing the Town to perform  maintenance or stewardship of areas designated as Restricted Land in connection with the approval  of such Development Project in the event of any failure to comply with the required program for  maintenance and stewardship of the Restricted Land, after thirty (30) days notice to  the Landowners  Association or other responsible party and failure of the Landowners Association or such party  to cure such failure; provided, however, that, if the Town elects to perform any maintenance or  stewardship work, the responsible party therefor shall pay the cost thereof, which cost shall constitute  a lien, subordinate to any mortgage or other statutory lien, upon the properties in connection with  which the Restricted Land was originally designated, until the cost has been paid.   
 
H. Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted to preclude the owner of Restricted Land from  imposing additional restrictions on the Restricted Land or a Conservation Restriction or  Agricultural Preservation Restriction under M.G.L. c. 184 §31-33 which are not inconsistent  with the  applicable Restricted Land Covenant. 
 
§ 210-171. Administration  
 
A. The Planning Board shall be the Special Permit Granting Authority for any Special Permit authorized by this Article.  The Planning Board may adopt and file with the Town Clerk Regulations governing Submission Requirements and Procedures for any such Special Permit. 


 
B. In all matters in which it has jurisdiction to issue a use Special Permit pursuant to § 210-165, the Planning Board may issue such Special Permits only upon a finding that the proposed use is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Chapter.   Any such Special Permit shall be subject to such conditions and safeguards as the Planning Board may prescribe. In reviewing any application for such Special Permit, the Planning Board shall give due consideration to promoting the public health, safety, convenience and welfare; shall encourage the most appropriate use of land and shall permit no building or use that is injurious, noxious, offensive or detrimental to its neighborhood.  


 
C. After the initial issuance of a Master Plan Special Permit, uses that require a Special Permit pursuant to § 210-165 may be authorized either by an amendment of the Master Plan Special Permit pursuant to an application filed by or on behalf of the owners of all land covered by the Master Plan Special Permit or by a separate use Special Permit pursuant to an application filed by or on behalf of the owners of the land upon which such use is proposed to be located; provided, however, that all use Special Permits shall be consistent with and subject to all provisions of the Master Plan Special Permit applicable to the OSMUD District as a whole. 


 
 
 
 
§ 210-172.   Master Plan Special Permit

Permissible Building Areas:  A Site Plan may show proposed construction within a Permissible Building Area, where the mix of uses and related construction details are subject to change, and shall specify the maximum square feet of Gross Floor Area to be constructed within such Permissible Building Area.  Although the Site Plan may show a proposed building in a specific location, the Site Plan approval shall authorize the construction of the Development Project if the structures therein and other site features thereof are located within the Permissible Building Area indicated.  After the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for a building, the amount by  which such building is less than the 
maximum square footage of Gross Floor Area allocated thereto or the amount by which the number of Dwelling Units constructed is less than the Dwelling Units proposed shall be available for reallocation to other proposed buildings or Dwelling Units within the OSMUD District, subject to further site plan review of the buildings to which such intensity of uses is reallocated, if required.

Minor modifications may be approved by the Planning Board at any regularly scheduled public meetings, without the need to hold a public hearing. [Amended 5-1-2017 ATM, Article 37] 
 
F. Duration of Approval:  Site Plan approvals under this Article shall remain in effect as to a Development Project as long as a building permit for not less than one (1) building in the Development Project is issued within two (2) years of issuance of the Site Plan approval (or the date of final resolution of any appeal of such issuance). 


 
§ 210-174.  Design Guidelines 
 
A.

A. Commercial Uses within the NMU District shall be limited to 250,000 square feet of Gross Floor  Area in the aggregate, as authorized by a Master Plan Special Permit issued pursuant to §210- 247.  No single building shall have a footprint exceeding 19,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area  or exceed 38,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area in total, with the exception of buildings used  for an Athletic Club/Health and Fitness Club.  An Athletic Club/Health and Fitness Club may  have a footprint of up to 80,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area exclusive of Air Supported  Structures or a footprint of up to 110,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area inclusive of Air  Supported Structures, but shall not exceed 150,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area inclusive of  Air Supported Structures; provided, however, that the Planning Board may, by Special Permit,  approve an Athletic Club/Health and Fitness Club with a greater area of Gross Floor Area.   


 The Planning Board may, by Special Permit, approve the re-use of a building or combination of  buildings formerly containing an Athletic Club/Health and Fitness Club for non-residential uses  permitted under §210-240.B where such re-use would exceed the maximum footprint or Gross  Floor Area otherwise permitted for such uses by this section; provided, however, that no Special  Permit may authorize an Air Supported Structure to be used for purposes that are not a  component of an Athletic Club/Health and Fitness Club.  Under no circumstances shall a Special  Permit be issued that results in more than 250,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area of  commercial uses within the NMU District. [Amended 5-1-2017 ATM, Article 37] 
 
B. For the purposes of this section, the area of buildings used for water supply or sewage treatment  facilities shall be excluded from the calculation of Gross Floor Area. [Amended 5-1-2017 ATM,  Article 37] 
  
C. Residential Uses within the NMU District shall be limited to 280 Dwelling Units, which shall be  multi-family dwellings with a maximum of 472 bedrooms in total and which shall not include  more than 20 three-bedroom units, as authorized by a Master Plan Special Permit issued pursuant  to §210-247.  
  
§210-242. Affordable Housing. 
 
Affordable Housing shall be provided in accordance with the following requirements: 
A. One (1) Dwelling Unit shall be established as an Affordable Housing Unit for every four (4)  Dwelling Units within the NMU District.  As long as the rules, regulations or guidelines of the  Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development issued pursuant to M.G.L.  c. 40B, §§ 20-23 provide that all of the units in a rental development that contains at least 25%  affordable housing units are eligible for inclusion on the Subsidized Housing Inventory, then all  Dwelling Units within the NMU District shall be operated as a rental development.   However, if  either (i) M.G.L. c. 40B, §§ 20-23 is no longer in effect, or (ii) the rules, regulations or guidelines  of the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development, issued pursuant to  M.G.L. c. 40B §§ 20-23, no longer provide that all of the units in a rental development that  contains at least 25% affordable housing units are eligible for inclusion on the Subsidized  Housing Inventory, then the Dwelling Units may be operated either as a rental development or as  a for-sale condominium development.  In such case, the number of affordable Dwelling Units  shall be no less than one (1) for every four (4) Dwelling Units within the NMU District. 


 
B. All Affordable Housing Units shall be integrated with the rest of the residential development in  which it is located, and shall be comparable in design, exterior appearance, construction, and  quality of exterior materials with other units in such residential development. The mean number  of bedrooms in Affordable Housing Units shall be equal to the mean number of bedrooms in the  market-rate Dwelling Units in the residential development in which they are located. 
 §210-243. Dimensional Requirements. 
 
A. Where a Master Plan Special Permit has not been issued, the dimensional requirements set forth  in § 210-186 shall be applicable.

Such minimum setback areas shall remain undisturbed or, if previously disturbed, shall be planted and/or landscaped. 
 
The Planning Board may authorize by special permit a lesser setback or lesser screening than set forth herein, upon a finding that such lesser setback or screening is appropriate for the Development Site and the surrounding neighborhood and uses. 
 
(2) Individual lots within the Development Site: 


 
(a) Minimum lot area for individual lots within Development Site:  None. 


 
(b) Minimum lot frontage within the Development Site:  None; provided, however, that roadways located entirely within the Development Site shall provide adequate access for all buildings on the development site, but shall not become public ways.

 §210-245. Open Conserved Land. 
 
A. Adequate pedestrian access, as determined by the Planning Board, shall be provided to the Open  Conserved Land.  The Open Conserved Land may remain as part of the overall Development Site  and need not be a separate parcel, but there shall be Open Conserved Land Covenants stating that  there shall be no further development and no activities within the Open Conserved Land that are  not consistent with the Open Conserved Land Covenants purpose.  The Open Conserved Land  may consist of a separate parcel and may be conveyed to the Town or a nonprofit organization,  the purpose of which is the preservation of open space, or may be retained by an owner of land 
 within the Development Site.  Regardless of any such conveyance, the Open Conserved Land  shall continue to be considered part of the Development Site for the purpose of calculating  dimensional requirements. 
 
B. The Open Conserved Land shall consist of land that may be used for outdoor active or passive  recreational purposes and shall be planned as large, contiguous units wherever possible.  If  privately owned, the Open Conserved Land shall be available for use by the general public,  subject to such reasonable rules and regulations to govern the use of the Open Conserved Land as  may be adopted by the owner thereof.  The Open Conserved Land may be comprised of more  than one parcel, provided that the size, shape and location of such parcels are suitable for outdoor  active or passive recreational purposes. 


 
C. Setback areas from zoning district boundaries, if more than 100 feet in depth, may be considered  to be part of the Open Conserved Land. 


 
D. Areas set aside for planned or reserved parking spaces or fire lanes shall not qualify to be part of  the Open Conserved Land. 


 
E. Open Conserved Land may be used for the provision of subsurface utilities for the NMU District  such as sewer lines, water lines, wastewater disposal beds and related underground equipment.   


 
F. Open Conserved Land Covenants shall specify the permitted uses of specific parcels of Open  Conserved Land; the responsible party to be charged with maintenance and stewardship of the  Open Conserved Land in perpetuity; and a required program for such maintenance and  stewardship. 


 
G. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to preclude the owner of Open Conserved Land from  imposing additional restrictions on the Open Conserved Land or a conservation restriction which  are not inconsistent with the applicable Open Conserved Land Covenant. 


 § 210-246.   Design Principles. 
 
A. Curb cuts on public ways abutting the Development Site shall be minimized. Whenever feasible,  Development Projects shall include interior vehicular connections to adjacent Development  Projects and to adjacent non-residential development outside the NMU District for the purpose of  reducing curb cuts and traffic flow on adjacent public ways.  The location of curb cuts shall be  determined by the Planning Board during the Site Plan Review process.  


 
B. Buildings, roadways and parking lots shall be designed to accommodate the landscape, natural  site features and natural resources.  Disturbance to the site shall be minimized so that as many  trees and natural features are retained as possible.  Natural features shall be incorporated within  the Open Conserved Land where possible. 
 
C. Outdoor lighting fixtures shall be shielded and directed to prevent illumination from falling  outside of the intended areas. 
 
D. The design of any interior roadway that connects two or more Development Projects shall  conform to the Rules and Regulations Relating to the Subdivision of Land, whether or not such  interior roadway is laid out in accordance with the Subdivision Control Law.  The Planning Board  may waive specific provisions of the Rules and Regulations Relating to the Subdivision of Land 
 if such waiver would be not be inconsistent with the design principles set forth in this section and  otherwise in the public interest.  All utilities within the Development Site shall be underground. 
 
E. The design of buildings shall be consistent with styles that are traditional to New England and  Hopkinton.  Buildings shall utilize energy efficient design and low impact development t techniques and principles, to the extent feasible.
