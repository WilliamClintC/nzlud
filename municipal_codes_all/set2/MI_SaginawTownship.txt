PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of Saginaw Charter Township, Michigan. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1986 Code, as supplemented through October 27, 1996, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of trustees. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1986 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to township staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the township readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the township's affairs.

A person convicted of a misdemeanor violation of this Code is responsible for costs of prosecution. 
(e)  Except as otherwise provided by law or ordinance: 
(1)  As to violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time, each day that the violation continues is a separate offense. 
(2)  As to other violations, each violation constitutes a separate offense. 
(f)  The imposition of a penalty does not prevent suspension or revocation of a license, permit or franchise or other administrative sanctions. 
(g)  Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of a penalty does not prevent injunctive relief or civil or quasi-judicial enforcement.

Sec. 18-401. - Purpose. 
It has been statistically demonstrated that areas with rental housing facilities are responsible for a disproportionate share of police calls for service. This disproportionate demand upon police services necessitates a disproportionate expenditure of public funds for such properties and impairs the value of these properties and the surrounding neighborhoods as well as the community as a whole. 
It is the purpose of this section to implement a crime-free rental housing program to provide a stable, more satisfied tenant base; increase demand for rental units with a reputation for active management; lower maintenance and repair costs; increase property values, and improve the personal safety for tenants, landlords, and managers. 
For these reasons, it is in the public interest for the protection of the health and safety of the people of Saginaw Charter Township to protect and promote the existence of sound and wholesome residential rental properties and rental units by the adoption of standards that encourage participation in Saginaw Charter Township's crime-free rental housing training program.

Sec. 22-72. - Purpose. 
Emergency responses are dangerous and have the potential to be costly to many township departments. Township operational and financial costs incurred to respond to incidents on public or private property requiring urgent action to mitigate threats to individual or public health, safety, or welfare, or to the environment include, without limitation, (i) purchase, maintenance, repair, replacement, storage of specialized rescue equipment and vehicles; (ii) specialized training, licensure, and certification for township personnel; (iii) payment to third party contractors or entities providing needed services; (iv) overtime costs and costs resulting from the diversion of township personnel from normal duties; and (v) repair and clean-up costs when public property is damaged or debris needs to be removed. Emergency responses often risk the health and safety of township personnel and of the general public as township personnel rush to respond. Additionally, emergency responses have collateral effects such as street closures, traffic disruptions, delays, impaired access to homes, businesses, schools and public amenities. These effects often occur regardless of whether or not the situation was a true emergency or a false alarm and regardless of whether the person(s) responsible or the victim(s) desired, requested, or believed emergency response was necessary. This article necessary to recover emergency response costs and to impose responsibility for such costs on those whose intentional, reckless or negligent acts resulted in the emergency response.

(c)  Liability shall not depend upon a determination of intent, fault, negligence, or any determination of civil or criminal liability. 
(d)  Charges under this article shall be applicable regardless of the outcome of the emergency response. 
(e)  The charges shall constitute a debt of the person(s) responsible and shall be collectible by the township in the same manner as a contractual obligation under contract. 
(f)  This article shall be construed to impose responsibility and liability of a civil nature and shall not be construed to conflict, contravene, enlarge, or reduce any criminal liability or responsibility, including, but not limited to, fines or costs imposed by a court. 
( Ord. No. 748, § 1, 7-11-2016 )

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 34-31. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Appeal means a request for a review of the chief building inspector's interpretation of any provision of this article or a request for a variance. 
Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations located within an area of special flood hazard. 
Flood and flooding mean a general and temporary condition or partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland waters; and/or 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
Flood insurance study means the official report provided in which the Federal Insurance Administration has provided flood profiles, as well as, the flood boundary-floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
Floodplain means land subject to a base flood. Within a floodplain, there exists two zones: Part is the portion known as the "floodway" and defined in this section; the balance is the "floodplain fringe" which is the balance of the land outside of the "floodway" in the floodplain. 
Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than two-tenths of a foot. 
New construction means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
Start of construction means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (other than a mobile home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings or any work beyond the stage of excavation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. For a structure (other than a mobile home) without a basement or poured footings, the "start of construction" includes the first permanent framing or assembly of the structure or any part thereof on its piling or foundation. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building, or a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either: 
(1)  Before the improvement or repair is started; or 
(2)  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored. 
For purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places. 
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this article.

(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
(4)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(e)  Notice of flood insurance cost. A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage, and such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(f)  Conditions attached to variances. Upon consideration of the factors in this article and the purposes of this article, the construction board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. 
(g)  Appeals to circuit court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the construction board of appeals, or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the circuit court as provided by statute. 
(h)  Record appeal action; report variances. The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

(6)  State law prohibits any ordinance enacted under the Fireworks Safety Act from regulating the ignition, discharge or use of consumer fireworks during the times and on the days as set forth in section 38-10(5) of this section. However, state law does not prohibit enforcement of other ordinances not adopted under the Fireworks Safety Act, nor does the state law provide immunity for noise and community disturbances committed as a result of igniting, discharging, or using consumer fireworks. Therefore, other violations of the Code committed during or as a result of the ignition, discharge, or use of consumer fireworks may still be enforced, including, but not limited to: 
(a)  Violating chapter 26, article III, sections 26-6126-65 of the Saginaw Charter Township Code of Ordinances.

Any person with control over the property who allows any adult or minor to violate this subsection shall also be in violation of this subsection. The township board of trustees hereby finds that a motivating factor for the use of consumer fireworks is the presence and reaction of spectators, and the purpose of this subsection is to discourage family members, neighbors, guests, onlookers, and spectators from too closely gathering around the use of consumer fireworks, thereby subjecting themselves to potential injury by a person who is allowed under state law to ignite consumer fireworks without any regulation of such activity. This subsection shall be liberally construed to achieve the goal of protecting spectators from potential harm. 
(8)  It shall be a misdemeanor punishable as provided by section 38-2, if, as a result of having ignited, discharged, or used a consumer firework, any harm or damage is caused to any person or the property of another.

To be in compliance with this subsection, the font on a flyer shall be no smaller than 14 point boldface type, and the lettering on a sign shall be visible and discernible from every point of sale and, for temporary facilities, from a distance of at least 20 feet outside the footprint or boundaries of the facility. Each day that a vendor remains out of compliance with the requirements of this subsection shall be chargeable as a separate offense.

ii)  Each electronic message board shall have a dimmer control to produce a distinct illumination change from a higher illumination level to a lower one for the period of time from sunset to sunrise. Each sign must appropriately adjust display brightness to conform with applicable brightness specifications as ambient light levels change at each such sign location due to sunrise, sunset, prevailing weather conditions or otherwise.

Sec. 48-11. - Nonconforming signs. 
(a)  Intent. This article is intended to encourage the eventual elimination of signs that do not comply with the article. The elimination of non-conforming signs is as much a subject of health, safety, and welfare as is the prohibition of new signs in violation of this article. Therefore, this article attempts to realize the removal of non-conforming signs and to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established property rights. 
(b)  Continuance. A nonconforming sign may be continued during the useful life of the sign if it is maintained in good condition. It shall not, however, be replaced by another nonconforming sign.

It may not be reestablished after damage or destruction if the department determines that the estimated cost of reconstruction exceeds 50 percent of the estimated replacement costs. 
All nonconforming signs in existence at the time of adoption of this article are presumed to have a useful life that ends on February 26, 2016, after which time, they must come into conformance with this article. 
Any nonconforming sign owner who believes their nonconforming sign has a useful life beyond February 26, 2016, may file a petition with the sign board of appeals, no earlier than February 26, 2015, requesting determination be made that a nonconforming sign's useful life be extended beyond February 26, 2016. 
The sign board of appeals, after hearing as provided in this article, may determine that such sign has a different useful life than established by this article, and if so, shall determine the remaining useful life of such sign. 
All petitions to extend the useful life of a nonconforming sign shall include the following information: 
(1)  Copies of all leases for the sign for the last five years; 
(2)  Copies of all maintenance records for the sign for the last five years; 
(3)  A description of all deferred maintenance on the sign that needs to be accomplished and the estimated cost;

(5)  The height of the sign above ground level; and 
(6)  A drawing showing the position of the sign and all other structures on the parcel and all roads abutting the property. 
(7)  Date when sign was installed. 
(8)  Initial capital cost of sign. 
(c)  Nuisance. An unsafe or abandoned sign is declared a public nuisance that shall be abated. 
(d)  Inventory. The department shall inventory all nonconforming signs within one year of the adoption of this article. 
(e)  Condemnation. The township board may initiate proceedings and prosecute for condemnation of nonconforming signs under the power of eminent domain in accordance with Article 149 of the Public Acts of 1911, as amended, being sections 213.21 through 213.41 of the Michigan Compiled Laws or other appropriate statutes.

In cases of emergency, where imminent hazards to persons or property are known to exist, and where the sign owner, or owner's agent, is not readily available, the department may enter the sign area for purposes of inspection or remediation. When on private property, the department shall observe rules and regulations concerning safety, internal security, and fire protection.

(1)  The sign board of appeals shall have the power to modify or reverse, wholly or partly, the notice or order, and may grant an extension of time for the performance of any act required of not more than three additional months, where the sign board of appeals finds that there is a practical difficulty resulting from the application of the provisions of this article, and that such extension is in harmony with the general purpose of this article to secure the public health, safety and welfare. 
(2)  The sign board of appeals shall return a decision upon each petition within 60 days after a request or appeal has been filed, unless a longer time is agreed upon by the parties concerned; however, the sign board of appeals may not order action on a petition until its regularly scheduled meeting.

(g)  Variances. A variance may be allowed by the sign board of appeals in cases only involving practical difficulties when the evidence in the official record of the appeal supports all of the following affirmative findings: 
(1)  That the alleged practical difficulties are exceptional and peculiar to the property of the person requesting the variance, and result from conditions which do not exist generally throughout the township. 
(2)  That the alleged practical difficulties which will result from a failure to grant the variance, include substantially more than mere inconvenience, or mere inability to attain a higher financial return. 
(3)  That allowing the variance will result in substantial justice being done, considering the public benefits intended to be secured by this article, the individual hardships that will be suffered by a failure to grant a variance, and the rights of others whose property would be affected by the allowance of the variance, and will not be contrary to the public purpose and general intent and purpose of this article. 
The above findings of fact shall be made by the sign board of appeals, which is not empowered to grant a variance without an affirmative finding of fact in each of the categories above. Every finding of fact shall be supported in the record of the proceedings of the board. 
(4)  In the case of an appeal for extension of the useful life of a nonconforming sign, the sign board of appeals finds that there is significant useful life remaining in the sign based on recent maintenance and initial capital costs that has not been amortized by the owner or leasee. 
(h)  Review by circuit court. Any party aggrieved by a final decision of the board of appeals may obtain a review thereof both on the facts and the law in Saginaw County Circuit Court.

(c)  When the cost of sidewalk construction in existing developed areas is to be borne wholly or in part by property owners, the cost may, at the request of such property owners, be assessed and spread over not more than five years against such abutting property owners and the cost shall be collected and treated in the same manner as taxes assessed under the general laws of the state. When such request is made, interest at a rate established from time to time by the township board, not exceeding the rate of eight percent per annum, shall be added to the amount spread on the tax rolls. 
(d)  Alternatively, the township board may require the owners of any lot or premises to build or repair the sidewalks within such time and in such manner as the township board may require, including before a building permit is issued for an improvement on the premises. If the owner shall fail to build or repair the sidewalks as ordered, the township board may cause such sidewalks to be built or repaired; and the expense thereof shall be assessed against such property owners.

(c)  If a parcel received a deferred assessment when the assessments were originally spread in a special assessment district created for improving water mains then, at such time as the owner seeks a permit to improve the parcel, the owner shall pay the township a readiness-to-serve charge. If a parcel which received a deferred assessment is split into parcels less than ten acres in size, in that event the property owner shall at that time pay the readiness-to-serve charge provided in this section. The readiness-to-serve charge shall be determined by the amount of the deferred assessment as shown on the assessment roll of the special assessment district in which the property is located plus interest until paid at the same rate as provided for in the special assessment district for unpaid assessments; provided, interest shall not accrue on unpaid assessments for more than 15 years.

Thereafter, the readiness to serve charge, excluding any interest, may be paid in full at any time prior to November 1, 2003. Any readiness-to-serve charge not paid, will be divided by November 1, 2003 into ten equal annual installments beginning December 1, 2003 and the same amount on the same day of the same month each year thereafter until fully paid. Said installments shall bear interest from November 1, 2003 at the rate of six percent per annum. Such readiness-to-serve charge, or any installments, not paid when due shall be considered delinquent and shall constitute a lien upon the respective parcel and shall be collected in the same manner as delinquent taxes.

a.  A nondomestic sewer user shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director and the MDEQ hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the sewerage system of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the nondomestic sewer user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such wastes per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the nondomestic sewer user: 
1.  An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; 
2.  An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; and 
3.  An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. 
A nondomestic sewer user shall provide the notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged, but notifications of changed discharges must be submitted as required under 40 CFR 403.12(j). 
b.  A discharger is exempt from the requirements of subsection (k)(16)a. of this section during a calendar month in which the discharger discharges no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the nondomestic sewer user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
c.  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of the RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the nondomestic sewer user must notify the POTW, the EPA and the MDNR of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
d.  In the case of any notification made under this subsection (k)(16), the nondomestic sewer user shall certify that a program is in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree determined to be economically practical. 
(17)  National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
a.  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
b.  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
c.  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by the EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
d.  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
(l)  Minimum permit contents. 
(1)  Wasterwater discharge permits must contain: 
a.  A statement that indicates the wastewater discharge permit duration, which in no event shall exceed five years; 
b.  A statement that the wastewater discharge permit is nontransferable without prior notification to the POTW, and provisions for furnishing the new owner or operator with a copy of the existing wastewater discharge permit; 
c.  Effluent limits are based on applicable pretreatment standards; 
d.  Self-monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification and recordkeeping requirements. Such requirements shall include an identification of pollutants to be monitored, sampling location, sampling frequency and sample type based on federal, state and local law; and 
e.  A statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for violation of pretreatment standards and requirements, and any applicable compliance schedule. Such schedule may not extend the time for compliance beyond that required by applicable federal, state or local law. 
(2)  Wastewater discharge permits may contain, but need not be limited to, the following conditions: 
a.  Limits on the average and/or maximum rate of discharge, time of discharge and/or requirements for flow regulation and equalization; 
b.  Requirements for the installation of pretreatment technology, pollution control or construction of appropriate containment devices designed to reduce, eliminate or prevent the introduction of pollutants into the treatment works; 
c.  Requirements for the development and implementation of spill control plans or other special conditions, including management practices, necessary to adequately prevent accidental, unanticipated or nonroutine discharges; 
d.  Development and implementation of waste minimization plans to reduce the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW; 
e.  The unit charge or schedule of user charges and fees for the management of the wastewater discharge to the POTW; 
f.  Requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection and sampling facilities and equipment; 
g.  A statement that compliance with the wastewater discharge permit does not relieve the permittee of responsibility for compliance will all applicable federal and state pretreatment standards, including those which become effective during the term of the wastewater discharge permit; and 
h.  Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the POTW to ensure compliance with this division, and state and federal laws, rules and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 3, 6-10-2002; Ord. No. 734, 11-25-2013 )  
Sec. 78-195. - Restricted information. 
All information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and inspections shall be available to the public without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director that the release of such information to the general public would divulge information, or processes or methods that would give a business advantage to competitors. However, all such information shall be made available to governmental agencies for use in making studies or for the use of the director or the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the information. No information regarding wastewater characteristics and constituents shall be considered confidential information and all such information and records shall be available to the director and the public without restriction. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 4, 6-10-2002)  
Sec. 78-196. - Enforcement and termination of service. 
(a)  Corrective measures. If it is determined that a discharge of wastes or other activity or inactivity has been occurring or threatens to occur in violation of this division or provisions of a discharge permit, the director may require the user to submit for approval in a specified time period, with such modifications considered necessary, a detailed time schedule of corrective and/or preventive action. Failure to provide such time schedule of corrective and/or preventive measures within the time limits specified is considered a violation of this division. Enforcement and termination of service procedures are outlined in the township's document entitled "Pretreatment Procedures and Enforcement Response Plan" which is on file at the township office. 
(b)  Search warrants. If the superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this division, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the township designed to verify compliance with this division or any permit or order issued under this division, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, the superintendent may seek issuance of a search warrant from the township. 
(c)  Notification procedure. In the event of any one or more of these actions being taken, the director shall promptly notify the user, in writing, of such action and the specific reasons for such action, which notice shall be personally served upon the individual identified by the user for such purpose. 
(d)  Notice of noncompliance (NON). The township's first response to most violations is the notice of noncompliance (NON). In general, the notice of noncompliance is used for isolated violations that have not caused immediate harm to the environment or the sewerage system. The notice of noncompliance is prepared and issued by the director. The notice of noncompliance discusses the circumstances of the violation and the consequences of continued violation. The director will issue the notice of noncompliance within 30 days from when the director identifies the noncompliance. 
(e)  Notification of violation (NOV). When the POTW finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the POTW may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 14 days of the receipt of the notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the POTW. Submission of the plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the POTW to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(f)  Consent orders. The director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include that specific action be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. 
(g)  Cease and desist. The director may issue orders to cease and desist if it is determined that a discharge of wastes has been taking place, or threatens to take place, in violation of prohibitions or limitations of this division or the provisions of a discharge permit, and direct the persons not complying with such prohibitions, limits, requirements or provisions to comply immediately, or comply in accordance with a time schedule provided by the director, and to take appropriate or remedial preventive action in the event of a threatened violation. 
(h)  Termination. The director may revoke any discharge permit or terminate, or cause to be terminated, wastewater service to any user if the director has reasonable grounds to believe a violation of this division or of a permit issued pursuant to this division exists or if a discharge of wastes or wastewater threatens to cause a viola-tion of this division or such a permit. If an excessive discharge occurs or threatens to occur, the director may immediately: 
(1)  Reject the waste or wastewater to immediately abate such condition, or any hazard or nuisance resulting therefrom; 
(2)  Upon providing the user informal notice of such action, sever any sewer connection serving the user's premises to immediately and effectively halt or prevent such discharge; or 
(3)  Require immediate pretreatment of the waste to an acceptable condition for discharge to the sewerage system. 
(i)  Civil litigation (see EPA model ordinance). If the director has determined that a user has failed to comply with the township regulations, the user's wastewater discharge permit, any other applicable local, state or federal law, or a notice of violation or order issued by the director, the director may commence judicial proceedings, through the township attorney, for appropriate relief. Generally, the director will utilize civil litigation in response to gross or persistent violations or the discharge of prohibited substances. The township shall be entitled to recover its expenses of enforcement, including its reasonable attorney fees. 
(j)  Criminal prosecution (see EPA model ordinance). Making a false statement or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document, or making a monitoring device or method inaccurate may result in punishment under the criminal laws of the state in addition to civil relief. If the township attorney, after consultation with the director, determines that criminal prosecution is appropriate in a particular case, the township attorney will refer the case to the proper authorities for prosecution. Depending upon the case, the proper authority may be a county prosecuting attorney, the attorney general's office for the state or the Environmental Protection Agency and United States Department of Justice. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 5, 6-10-2002)  
Sec. 78-197. - Charges and fees.

Sec. 78-198. - Appeal procedure. 
There shall be no administrative appeal from orders of noncompliance, including cease and desist orders, or determinations issued by the director interpreting or implementing the provisions of this division, or in any permit issued under this division. Such orders or determinations shall be subject only to judicial review. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 7, 6-10-2002)  
Sec. 78-199. - Agreements. 
No provision of this division shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the township and any person whereby sewage or waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the township for treatment, subject to the payment by such person of such additional charges as may be reasonable, except that the applicable state or federal standards regarding prohibited discharges shall not be waived and a waiver of the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards shall be obtained only through the procedures established in 40 CFR 403. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 8, 6-10-2002)  
Sec. 78-200. - Protection from damage. 
No person shall break, damage, destroy, deface or tamper with any property, structure or appurtenance which is a part of the township sewerage system. No person shall, without a permit, uncover or connect to any structure or appurtenance which is a part of the township sewerage system. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 9, 6-10-2002)  
Sec. 78-201. - Violations; penalties. 
(a)  Public nuisance. Any discharge of waste into the sewerage system or other activity or inactivity that is in violation of this division, or a violation of any condition of a discharge permit issued pursuant to this division, or of any state, federal or township laws or regulations, including categorical pretreatment standards, or which is, or threatens to be, an excessive discharge, or which does, or threatens to, contaminate any surface or subsurface waters, is hereby declared to be a public nuisance per se. No user or industry, or any person responsible for, or acting on behalf of, such a user or industry, shall cause, create, allow or maintain such a nuisance. 
(b)  Injunction infraction. 
(1)  Injunctive relief. Whenever a discharge of wastes or other material or pollutants, or other activity or inactivity, is in violation of the provisions of this division, of a permit issued pursuant to this division, or of any state, federal or township law or regulation, or otherwise causes, or threatens to cause, a condition of contamination, pollution or nuisance, the director, acting on behalf of the township, may cause a petition to be filed in the appropriate court of law for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction, or both, as may be appropriate in restraining the continuance of such discharge, and such court may order any such condition, nuisance or violation to be abated immediately and may order whatever further relief is necessary to prevent reoccurrence of any such condition, nuisance or violation. 
(2)  Enforcement activity costs to be recoverable from violator. The township may recover costs incurred as a consequence of sampling and monitoring expenses, increased operational and maintenance expenditures for the sanitary sewer system or treatment plant, or increased sludge handling expenditures, and reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities. Such costs shall be recoverable from the person found to have violated this division or the orders, rules, regulations or permits issued under this division. 
(c)  Civil penalties. The following regulations shall govern civil infractions: 
(1)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division or a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this division or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be responsible for the violation punishable as a civil infraction. 
(2)  The director or his designee is hereby authorized to issue municipal civil infraction citations under this division directing alleged violators to appear in court or to issue municipal civil infraction notices directing alleged violators to appear at the township violations bureau as provided under the ordinances of the township. 
(3)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the amount of a municipal civil infraction found due in response to the issuance of a municipal civil infraction notice for a violation of this division shall be according to the following schedule: 
a.  First offense, $1,000.00; 
b.  Second offense, $2,500.00; 
c.  Third or subsequent offense, $5,000.00. 
A copy of this schedule shall be posted at the township municipal ordinance violations bureau. 
(4)  In the case of a monthly or other longterm average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(5)  In addition to the penalties provided in this division, the township may recover costs incurred as a consequence of sampling and monitoring expenses, increased operational and maintenance expenditures for the sanitary sewer system or treatment plant, or increased sludge handling expenditures and reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities. Such costs shall be recoverable from the person found to have violated this division or the orders, rules, regulations or permits issued under this division. 
A civil infraction shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(d)  Misdemeanor. A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $500.00 per violation per day, or imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 10, 6-10-2002)  
Sec. 78-202. - Supplemental enforcement action. 
(a)  Performance bond. The township may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this division, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the township, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the township to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
(b)  Liability, insurance. The township may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this division, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that such user has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by such user's discharge. 
(c)  Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this division, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence at the user's expense, after such user has satisfactorily demonstrated such user's ability to comply. 
(d)  Contractor listing. Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the township. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the township held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion of the township. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 11, 6-10-2002)  
Sec. 78-203. - Rules and regulations. 
The township manager may authorize such rules and regulations, not in conflict with the provisions of this division, relative to industrial pretreatment, and no person shall fail to comply with any such rules or regulations. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 12, 6-10-2002)  
Sec. 78-204. - Records retention. 
All users subject to this division shall retain and preserve, for no less than three years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence and any and all summaries thereof, relating to monitoring, sampling and chemical analyses made by or on behalf of a user in connection with such user's discharge. All records which pertain to matters which are the subject of administrative adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation activities brought by the township pursuant to this division shall be retained and preserved by the user until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 13, 6-10-2002)  
Sec. 78-205. - Miscellaneous. 
(a)  Removal credits. Where applicable, the director may elect to initiate a program of removal credits as part of this division to reflect the POTW's ability to remove pollutants in accordance with 40 CFR 403.7. 
(b)  Net/gross calculations. The director may elect to adjust categorical pretreatment standards to reflect the presence of pollutants in the user's intake water, in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
(c)  Right of revision. The township reserves the right to amend this division to provide more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to a POTW where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives set forth in section 78-193(b).

Sec. 78-207. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Applicability of charge. The sewage disposal charge established in this section shall apply to each lot or parcel of land, building or premises (referred to in this section as "premises") from which sewage is discharged into any public combined sewer or public sanitary sewer, and to each premises for which a connection to any sewer is ordered to be installed, and such charges are to take effect upon the expiration of the time limit for the installation of the sewer connection or upon use of such connection for the disposal of sewage, whichever occurs first. 
(b)  Definitions. Unless the context specifically indicates otherwise, the meaning of terms used in this section and related regulations shall be as follows: 
Debt service charges means the costs of retiring sewage disposal bond issues, including reserve fund requirements, which are assessed to users in accordance with the adopted rates. 
Industrial cost recovery and ICR mean the recovery, by the township from the industrial users of the sewer system, the federal grant amount allocable to the treatment of wastes for such users. 
Industrial user class means the users discharging industrial wastes into the sewerage system. 
Operation and maintenance costs means the costs to operate and maintain the sewerage system, excluding capital costs for new construction. 
Replacement costs means the expenditures for obtaining and installing equipment, accessories or appurtenances which are necessary during the service life of the sewerage system to maintain the capacity and performances for which the system is designed and constructed. 
Residential and commercial user class means the users discharging domestic wastes into the sewerage system. 
User charges means the costs of operation, maintenance and replacement of the sewerage system which are assessed to users in accordance with the adopted rates. 
(c)  Basis of charge. 
(1)  The rates established in this section shall be based upon the amount of water used upon the customer's premises, including water from public and private supplies, or at the election of the customer as provided in this section, upon the amount of sewage discharged to the public sewers. All private water supplies, any portion of which reaches the sewer, shall be metered at the customer's expense and the consumption thereof shall be added to the consumption from the public water supply and the resultant total shall be used to establish the sewage disposal charge. Failure to meter any water supply shall not release the customer from paying the sewage disposal charge thereon. In such case, the meter size required and the total water consumption shall be estimated by the director of general services and shall be conclusive. 
(2)  The rates established in this section shall consist of both a user charge and a debt service charge for all users of the sewerage system. Such charges shall be reviewed annually to ensure they properly reflect the cost of service between user classes and the location of service. 
(d)  Optional arrangement. 
(1)  Any customer may elect to establish metering facilities registering the discharge from his premises to the public sewers. All such arrangements shall be subject to the prior approval of the director; and the expense thereof, including installation, maintenance and operation, shall be borne by the customer. 
(2)  When metering facilities registering the discharge from the premises to the public sewers have been installed as permitted by this section, the readiness-to-serve charge provided for in subsection (e)(1)a. or (f)(1)a. of this section shall be based upon the water meter size, as determined by the director, which would be required if all liquids reaching the sewage metering facilities were delivered through the public water supply. The disposal rate charge provided for in subsections (e)(1)b. and (f)(1)b. of this section shall be applied to the flow of sewage. If the metering facilities shall fail to operate or register the flow correctly, the charge shall be based upon the estimate of the director of general services of the flow of sewage for the billing period. 
(e)  Sewage disposal charges for premises within the township. 
(1)  The net rate charged for sewage disposal for premises classified as residential-commercial users within the limits of the township shall be the sum of the following user charges and the debt service charge: 
a.  User charge based on water consumption, or on the discharge into a public sewer, whichever is applicable, at the rate of $0.50 per 1,000 gallons. An additional charge, in cents per 1,000 gallons, shall be added to such user charge, based upon the township's cost for the purchase of electrical power for municipal pumping purposes during the month immediately preceding the period covered by the customer's bill. Such charge shall be computed by multiplying the township's cost for electrical power, in cents per kilowatt-hour, times 1.550. 
b.  Debt service charge based on the size of each water meter measuring water, any part of which is discharged into a public sewer: 
Meter Size

a.  User charge based on water consumption or the discharge into a public sewer, whichever is applicable, at the rate of $0.50 per 1,000 gallons. An additional charge shall be added to such user charge, in cents per 1,000 gallons, based upon the township's cost for the purchase of electrical power municipal pumping purposes during the month immediately preceding the period covered by the customer's bill. Such charge shall be computed by multiplying the township's cost for electrical power, in cents per kilowatt-hour, times 1.550.

(j)  Collection. Charges for sewage disposal service shall be billed by the water division and collected at the same time and in the same manner as provided for water bills. The water division is hereby authorized to enforce the payment of such sewer service bills by shutting off the user's water supply or an action of assumpsit may be instituted by the township against such user. The charges for sewage disposal service, which under the provisions of Public Act No. 94 of 1933 (MCL 141.101 et seq.), are made a lien on the premises to which furnished, are hereby recognized to constitute such lien; and the director of finance shall, annually, on or about May 1, certify to the township assessor all sewage disposal charges which shall be delinquent for six months, whereupon such charge shall be entered upon the next tax roll as a charge against such premises and shall be collected and the lien thereof enforced in the same manner as general township taxes against such premises are collected and the lien thereof enforced. A like lien for such charges and service shall, to the extent permitted by law, be imposed against property outside the township and shall be enforced as provided in such act, observing procedures similar to the procedures in this subsection (j) as appropriate for township taxes.

Charges for such service shall be as provided by resolution of the township board or by written agreement approved by the township board. 
(l)  Agreements with public officers and agencies. The charges for sewage disposal services furnished to the drain commissioner or to any municipality or public agency shall be provided for by written agreement approved by the township board, the schedule of charges to be set forth in such agreement or in a resolution adopted by the township board. In no event shall such charges be less than the total cost, including all direct and indirect costs of comparable service to premises within the township.

c)  Nonconforming uses shall not be changed to another nonconforming use, except after approval of the board of zoning appeals.

d)  If such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than six consecutive months, or for 18 months during any three-year period, such discontinuance shall be considered conclusive evidence of an intention to abandon the nonconforming use. The time limit of discontinuance may be extended beyond the six months for a period of time not to exceed 1½ years upon application to and approval by the board of zoning appeals within the six-month period and upon demonstration that there exists a legitimate intent to continue the nonconforming use within such time extension. At the end of this period of abandonment, the nonconforming use shall be brought into conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance. The zoning administrator shall notify the property owner of such nonconforming use, in writing, by regular mail, 30 days prior to the end of the six-month period to inform the owner of the intent of the zoning administrator to find the use abandoned and the implications of such a finding.

a)  Nonconforming structures shall not be altered or expanded without the prior approval of the board of zoning appeals, except that the following structural alterations may be permitted without such prior approval:

ii)  Structural alterations which do not add to the bulk of the structure or increase the intensity of use of the structure shall not require prior approval of the board of zoning appeals. 
b)  Nonconforming buildings or structures may be repaired and maintained so as to prolong the life of the structure. 
c)  Nonconforming structures may be reestablished in their nonconforming conditions in any zoning district after damage or destruction of the nonconforming structure, if such structure is nonconforming due only to its having an insufficient side or rear setback or due to its being located on a site having an area, width or both less than prescribed in the applicable sections of this Ordinance. 
4.  Nonconforming signs. Where a lawful sign exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance that could not be installed under the terms of this Ordinance, the use of such sign may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions:

iv)  No nonconforming sign shall be changed, altered, substituted or enlarged if the cost of resultant change, alteration, substitution or enlargement exceeds 30 percent of the appraised replacement cost of the sign as determined by the township assessor unless prior approval for such change is granted by the board of zoning appeals after a public hearing and finding that such change is in the best interest of Saginaw Charter Township. 
b)  Nothing shall prohibit the repair, reinforcement or modernization of a lawful nonconforming sign, provided such repair does not exceed an aggregate cost of 30 percent of the appraised replacement cost as determined by the township assessor, unless the subject sign is changed by repair, reinforcement or modernization to a conforming structure.

b.  Fencing around tennis courts and recreational amenities shall be exempt from the six-foot height limitation. 
iii)  Corner lots. On a corner lot, a fence, wall or hedge planting cannot exceed a height of three feet in the street side yard setback unless all of the following conditions can be satisfied: 
a.  Must begin at the back of the house or primary structure. 
b.  Does not create any safety or traffic hazard. 
c.  Houses or buildings on property adjacent to the rear of the subject parcel shall not face the same street as the street side yard in which the fence will be located. 
d.  Will not exceed a maximum height of six feet. 
e.  Will not encroach upon any existing or proposed right-of-ways.

3.  Conformance to established setbacks. 
a)  Required front yard setbacks shall conform to existing setbacks as established by existing uses in any district. 
4.  Bufferyards. 
a)  Purpose. The bufferyard is a designated unit of yard or open area, together with any plant materials, barriers or fences required thereon, designed to provide distance and screening in order to minimize negative impacts of adjacent land uses. Both the amount of land and the type and amount of landscaping specified are intended to minimize potential nuisances such as noise, glare, dirt, activity, unsightly parking areas and similar impacts. 
The bufferyard requirements are designed to be flexible. A single standard applied to all circumstances may not function as well and might impose unnecessary hardship (cost) on a developer to say nothing of promoting monotony. It is the intent of the following provisions to provide flexibility to the developer or property owner through the manipulation of four basic elements: distance, plant material type, plant material density and structural or land forms. 
i)  Location of bufferyard. Bufferyards shall be located on the side and rear lot line of a parcel extending to the lot or parcel boundary line. Bufferyards shall not extend into or be located within any portion of an existing street right-of-way or yard exceptions as provided in section 303(2). 
ii)  Bufferyards required. The type of bufferyard required shall be determined based on the proposed land use and existing adjacent land use, as such uses are defined in the comprehensive development plan, as follows: 
a)  Commercial land use. When any commercial land use is proposed adjacent to any recreation and open space, residential, agricultural or institutional land use, a type B bufferyard, as defined herein, shall be required. In addition, when the property abuts existing residential development, the developer must, upon request of the residential landowners and/or the Saginaw Charter Township Community Development Department, provide an eight-foot-tall privacy fence or wall along the abutting property line(s). The fence or wall finish and construction materials must be approved by the assistant director of community development and be consistent in design with the project and the adjoining residential area. In instances when a fence is requested, the developer shall follow the guidelines for buffer type B, showing the fence, a ten-foot buffer and a combination of trees and shrubs. 
b)  Campus Business land use. When a Campus Business land use, other than a residential or institutional land use, is proposed adjacent to any institutional land use or residentially zoned district, a buffer consisting of an eight-foot tall masonry wall shall be required within ten feet of the property line along with a ten-foot wide bufferyard as depicted in buffer A. When a residential or institutional Campus Business land use is located adjacent to a residentially zoned district, a type B bufferyard is required. In addition, when the property abuts existing residential development, the developer must, upon request of the residential landowners and/or the Saginaw Charter Township Community Development Department, provide an eight-foot-tall privacy fence or wall along the abutting property lines. The fence or wall finish and construction materials must be approved by the department and be consistent in design with the project and the adjoining residential area. In instances when a fence is requested, the developer shall follow the guidelines for a buffer type B, showing the fence, a ten-foot buffer and a combination of trees and shrubs. 
c)  Industrial land use. When any industrial land use is proposed adjacent to any recreation and open space, residential, agricultural or institutional land use, a type C bufferyard, as defined herein, shall be required. When any industrial land use is proposed adjacent to any commercial land use a type A bufferyard, as defined herein, shall be required. In addition, when the property abuts existing residential development, the developer must, upon request of the residential landowners and/or the Saginaw Charter Township Community Development Department, provide an eight-foot-tall privacy fence or wall along the abutting property line(s). The fence or wall finish and construction materials must be approved by the assistant director of community development and be consistent in design with the project and the adjoining residential area. In instances when a fence is requested, the developer shall follow the guidelines for buffer type B, showing the fence, a ten-foot buffer and a combination of trees and shrubs. 
d)  High density residential land use. When any high density residential land use is proposed adjacent to any recreation and open space, low or medium density residential, agricultural or institutional land use, a type B bufferyard, as defined herein, shall be required. In addition, when the property abuts existing residential development, the developer must, upon request of the residential landowners and/or the Saginaw Charter Township Community Development Department, provide an eight-foot-tall privacy fence or wall along the abutting property line(s). The fence or wall finish and construction materials must be approved by the assistant director of community development and be consistent in design with the project and the adjoining residential area. In instances when a fence is requested, the developer shall follow the guidelines for buffer type B, showing the fence, a ten-foot buffer and a combination of trees and shrubs. 
e)  Institutional land use. When any institutional land use is proposed adjacent to any residential land use a type A bufferyard, as defined herein, shall be required. In addition, when the property abuts existing residential development, the developer must, upon request of the residential landowners and/or the Saginaw Charter Township Community Development Department, provide an eight-foot-tall privacy fence or wall along the abutting property line(s). The fence or wall finish and construction materials must be approved by the assistant director of community development and be consistent in design with the project and the adjoining residential area. In instances when a fence is requested, the developer shall follow the guidelines for buffer type B, showing the fence, a ten-foot buffer and a combination of trees and shrubs. 
f)  [When inverse bufferyard requirements apply.] When a less intensive land use is proposed to be located adjacent to a more intensive land use, the inverse of the bufferyard requirements herein shall apply; that is, for example, if a residential land use is proposed adjacent to an existing commercial land use, a type B bufferyard shall be required to be installed on the residential parcel. 
g)  [Determination of requirements by zoning administrator.] When the parcel to be developed is located adjacent to a vacant parcel of land, the bufferyard requirement shall be determined by the zoning administrator based upon the zoning classification of said vacant parcel; that is, for example, if an industrial land use is proposed adjacent to a residentially zoned vacant parcel of land a type C bufferyard shall be required. 
h)  [Existing plant material or fences.] Existing plant material or fences may be counted as contributing to the total bufferyard requirement. 
i)  [Determination for additional bufferyard.] Should a developed use increase in intensity, the planning commission shall, during the site plan review process, determine if additional bufferyard is needed, and, if so, to what extent and type. 
iii)  Bufferyard types and development standards. Bufferyard requirements are stated in terms of the width of the bufferyard and the number of plant units required per 100 linear feet of bufferyard. The requirements may be satisfied by any of the options indicated for any given bufferyard type. 
a)  The following illustrations graphically depict the acceptable bufferyard widths, plant material types, plant material densities and structural or land forms for each bufferyard type. 
b)  All plant materials required within a specified bufferyard shall be planted to completion within six months from the date of receipt of a building permit and shall be thereafter properly maintained in a healthy, viable condition. Plant materials which are not in a healthy, viable condition shall be replaced. 
c)  Landscaping/plant material used for fulfilling the bufferyard requirements or site plan requirements shall be of the following minimum plant sizes: 
i.  Evergreen trees, a minimum of six feet in height; 
ii.  Deciduous trees, a mature canopy height of at least 24 feet and a two and one-half inches caliper at time of planting; 
iii.  Deciduous shrubs and decorative trees, at least six feet in height; shrubs and perennials, a minimum height of 12 inches in the first season.

x.  All thorned trees and shrubs 
xi.  Ribes (gooseberry) 
xii.  Cottonwood 
e)  Where fencing is required in a bufferyard, it may be eliminated on approval of the planning commission when such fencing is considered by the planning commission to be incompatible with the character of an adjacent residential use. The fence shall be replaced with an evergreen hedge, minimum six feet in height, with plant material dense enough to provide opacity. When fencing is requested as outlined in [subsection] 4.a.ii.a, it may not be replaced with landscaping, except if agreed upon in writing by the owner of the residential properties.

3.  Attached accessory structures or uses. Unless otherwise specified in this section, accessory structures or uses (including garages) which are attached to the principal building or structure shall be considered a part of the principal building for the purposes of determining conformance with area, setback and bulk requirements. For the purposes of this section, buildings or structures that are within ten feet of the principal building or structure shall be considered "attached." 
4.  Specific requirements for accessory structures and uses in residential and agricultural districts. 
a.  Size and number. Two detached accessory structures are permitted per parcel. 
i.  Lots containing less than 10,400 square feet may have one detached accessory structure not exceeding 720 square feet. The other may not exceed 144 square feet. 
ii.  Lots containing 10,400 square feet but less than 43,560 square feet may have one detached accessory structure not exceeding 720 square feet. The other may not exceed 144 square feet. An additional 20 square feet may be added to the larger accessory structure for every 1,000 square feet of lot area exceeding 10,400 square feet with a maximum of 1,200 square feet.

Accessory buildings, such as buildings for parking attendants, guard shelters, gate houses and transformer buildings, may be located in the front or side yard in nonresidential districts, upon planning commission approval. All such buildings or structures shall be architecturally and aesthetically compatible with the principal building and be located and landscaped to reduce the visual impact from surrounding properties and from public streets. 
6.  Wind-driven generating devices. Since the operations of wind-driven generating devices or windmills cause an amount of noise above that normally produced in a residential district and this noise may be produced at any time of the day and for long periods of time, these devices are hereby considered to be a nuisance in residential districts. In other zoning districts, such devices shall not be permitted within 250 feet of a residential unit or any R zoned property. 
7.  Radio and television reception devices. 
a)  Defined. Radio and television reception devices (RTRD) are herein defined as devices or structures designed to improve the reception of radio or television transmission, including antennas, antenna masts or towers, satellite television reception dishes and other similar devices. 
b)  [Additional standards.] Such devices are considered residential accessory structures and shall be regulated under the same requirements with the addition of the following standards: 
i)  RTRD's are prohibited in front yards, street side yards on corner lots, or any front or side yard between the principal structure and a public street. 
ii)  RTRD's shall not be counted in the determination of maximum allowable lot coverage. 
iii)  RTRD's shall be prohibited on that portion of the roof of all residential structures which face toward the street upon which the structure faces. 
iv)  No RTRD may contain any written or visual text, pictures, words or design other than on a small metal plate attached to the antenna that identifies the manufacturer, model and serial number of the RTRD, and other specific information as may be required by law or to insure proper identification. If any written or visual text, pictures, words, or designs other than this basic information is included on a RTRD, the antenna will be considered a sign and fall under the requirements of signs in chapter 5 of this Ordinance. 
v)  In addition to the yard requirements for accessory structures, no RTRD shall be located closer to any property line than the total height of such a device. 
c)  [Building permit required before installation.] A building permit shall be obtained before the installation of the RTRD on any lot, and said RTRD shall be installed in a permanent location on the property. 
8.  Firewood. The storage or stockpiling of logs, firewood or similar material is hereby considered to be a residential accessory use and such piles or storage areas shall not be permitted between the principal structure and a public or private street and shall be maintained in a neat and orderly fashion so as to prevent such uses from becoming a blighting influence. 
9.  Home occupations. It is the intent of this section to permit residents of the township a broad choice in the use of their residences as places of livelihood and the production or supplementation of personal and family income, while establishing criteria for the conduct of home occupations in dwelling units in residential districts to protect neighboring residential land uses from adverse impacts of activities associated with home occupations, to maintain and protect the character of residential neighborhoods, and to ensure the compatibility of home occupations with other uses permitted in residential districts. The burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to prove that the standards of this section are being met, especially regarding possible nuisances and traffic.

Sec. 306. - Reserved. 
Editor's note Ord. No. 674, adopted Oct. 25, 2004, deleted section 306 in its entirety. Former section 306, pertained to district boundary exceptions. For complete list of derivations, see Code Comparative Table.  
Sec. 307. - Approval of plats. 
No proposed plat of a new or redesigned subdivision shall hereafter be approved by either the local governing body or its agents unless the lots within the plat equal or exceed the minimum size and width requirements of this Ordinance and all other applicable codes or ordinances.  
Sec. 308. - Zoning of plats. 
All plats shall be subject to the provisions of the district within which they are located pertinent to allowed uses and further required zoning district change which may be necessary to accommodate proposed use or uses shall be made according to amendment procedures prescribed by this Ordinance.  
Sec. 309. - Public sanitary sewer connection. 
When public sewer is available or becomes available in the street, connection to the public sewer system shall be made within 90 days.  
Sec. 310. - Density computation. 
Should density computation be required for a land development project, except as specified for planned unit developments and mobile home parks, the following criteria shall be applied: 
1.  Site acreage computation. In arriving at a gross acreage figure, the following lands shall not be considered as part of the gross acreage in computing the maximum number of lots and/or dwelling units that may be created: 
a)  Land utilized by public utilities as easements, for major facilities, such as electric transmission lines, sewer lines, water mains, road easements, or other similar lands which are not available to the owner because of such easements. 
b)  Lands within floodplains. 
2.  Maximum number of lots and/or dwelling units. After the total gross area available for development has been determined by the above procedure, the maximum number of lots and/or dwelling units that may be approved shall be computed by subtracting from the total gross area available a fixed percentage of said total for street right-of-way purposes and dividing the remaining net area available by the minimum lot area requirement of the zoning district in which the planned development is located. 
The fixed percentages for street right-of-way purposes to be subtracted from the total gross area available for development shall be determined according to the following schedule: 
DISTRICT USE 
AREA 	PERCENT OF 
PROJECT 
R-1, R-1A (Single-family detached, two-family) 	25 
R-2, R-3, R-4 (Single-family detached, townhouses, two-family, multifamily) 	20 
 
These percentages shall apply regardless of the amount of land actually required for street right-of-way.  
Sec. 311. - Site plan review. 
The purpose of site plan review is to determine compliance with the provisions and intent set forth in this section and to promote the orderly development of the township and to prevent the development of or alteration of land without proper attention to setting and appearance. 
1.  Site plan review and approval required. Prior to the erection of any building or structure or additions hereto, change in use in any zoning district, any land use requiring special use approval or any planned unit development, a site plan shall be submitted for review and approval. This review and approval shall be performed by the zoning administrator or by the planning commission. 
A "building permit" or "certificate of occupancy" shall not be issued prior to final approval of the site plan. 
At no time shall a site plan be reviewed when considering a request for rezoning. A decision to rezone property should be based on the long-term goals and the future land use map as determined by the master plan of the township. Also, it is important to consider the timeliness of the development and the long-term use of land. 
In authorizing any site plan approval, the township planning commission may require that a bond of ample sum be furnished to insure compliance with requirements and/or specifications imposed by the approved site plan. 
2.  Administrative site plan review by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator may perform a site plan review for: 
a.  A residential structure having two or fewer dwelling units therein and accessory structures and uses; 
b.  Uses permitted by right or under special conditions in any "A", "R-1A", "R- 1", or "R-2" zoning district. 
c.  A change in the use of a structure or land that does not require additional parking and does not involve structural alterations. 
d.  A commercial accessory building containing 1,000 square feet or less; 
e.  An addition to an existing structure or parking lot if the addition totals 20 percent or less of the existing structure or parking lot, and only if the addition will be surfaced with material or materials which do not differ from materials on the existing structure. 
f.  The planning commission reserves the right to delegate responsibility for review to the zoning administrator for other site plans deemed appropriate by size or function. 
g.  In order to perform this review, the zoning administrator may require the submission of information set forth in this section. 
h.  The zoning administrator will transmit copies of the site plan to the departments as appropriate for review. Upon receiving recommendations from the departments, the zoning administrator shall transmit the recommendations to the applicant. If the applicant concurs with the staff recommendations, the site plan will be approved along with all the recommendations as agreed to by the applicant. 
i.  In instances where the applicant does not concur with recommendations or where the zoning administrator deems planning commission review necessary during the administrative site plan review process, the applicant or the zoning administrator may request the site plan be transmitted to the township planning commission. The applicant will be required to pay the appropriate associated fee for site plan review. 
3.  Site plan review by the township planning commission. All other structures and uses of land or buildings not covered in section 311.1(a) shall be reviewed by the township planning commission, and the following site plan review procedures shall be followed: 
a.  Application deadlines. Application for site plan review shall be made at least 14 days prior to the scheduled planning commission meeting. 
b.  Application. The application requesting site plan review must be accompanied by a fee, as established by the township board. The application will not be reviewed until all submission requirements, including the fee, has been paid. 
c.  Submission of site plan. A minimum of five copies of the initial site plan map (24" x 36") along with one reduced copy or such additional copies as may be specified by the zoning administrator, and other attachments shall be submitted and shall contain the items listed below: 
(1)  Scale. The site plan must be drawn to a consistent scale of not less than one inch equals twenty feet (1" = 20') if the proposed site is less than three acres and not less than one inch equals fifty feet (1" = 50') if the proposed site is three acres or more. 
(2)  Identification. The applicant's name, address and telephone number and the name and address of the firm(s) responsible for preparation of the site plan must be included. If the applicant does not own the property, the owner must be identified and must sign a statement certifying that the applicant is acting in the owner's behalf. 
(3)  Property information. The site plan must accurately depict the subject property and land adjacent to and across any thoroughfare from, including all existing and proposed easements or right-of-ways. Zoning of the site and the adjacent properties, and the current use of the site and of adjacent properties, must be identified. A legal description, location map and computation of the area of the property must accompany the site plan. 
(4)  Site features. The site plan should depict existing environmental conditions, including the location of wooded areas, isolated trees over six inches in diameter, topography, wetlands, any existing structures, including any site contamination, including those proposed for removal, and other significant conditions. The approximate location and use of structures and the location of the nearest driveways on adjacent or opposing parcels should be shown. 
(5)  Transportation features. The site plan must show the location and surface type of all existing and proposed public roads, access drives, internal vehicle circulation areas, all turning radii, parking lots (including number and location of handicapped parking spaces), sidewalks, loading areas or docks, truck bays, and refuse pick-up stations. 
(6)  Utilities. The site plan must show the location and size of all existing and proposed public utilities. Waterline information shall include location of existing and proposed fire hydrants and valves. Sanitary sewer information shall include location of any pumping station and approximate location of manholes.

(7)  Site drainage and grading. The site plan must show the location of storm drains, invert elevations, proposed finished grades, drainage ditches, catch basins, manholes, flow restrictors and on-site retention/detention. Allowable discharge and on site storage calculations must also be included. 
(8)  Structures. The site plan must show the location and dimensions, including height, of all proposed buildings, accessory structures and related features. Schematic plans and elevations of all structures must be included. The site plan should also show the location, arrangement, dimensions, and type of proposed signs, lighting, landscaping, screening, fences, and decorative walls. For multi-family housing developments, the number of units in each building must be identified. 
(9)  Additional information/supplementary materials. The site plan shall be supplemented by any additional information that, in the zoning administrator's discretion, is important for the site plan review process. Applicants shall be responsible for all costs of required supplementary materials. This could include, but not limited to, an assessment of the proposed project's impact on environmental, historical, social or economic conditions; traffic studies; or proposed measures to control or mitigate such impacts as noise, smoke, particulates, vibration, odors, or fire hazards. 
4.  Site plan review procedure. The review procedure begins with a pre-design meeting between the applicant's design professional and a representative of the community development department. A preliminary site plan is submitted to the planning commission for consideration. If approved with conditions, a final site plan complying with those conditions must be resubmitted to the community development department for administrative review and approval. 
a.  Pre-design meeting. In order for an applicant to have a site plan considered by the planning commission, the applicant and his/her design professional shall be responsible for coordinating a pre-design meeting with a representative of the community development department. The purpose of the meeting is to address various site plan layout alternatives and identify any major obstacles that may need further attention. Once a conceptual design is agreed upon by both parties, or differences of opinion with respect to the site plan have been identified, a preliminary site plan may be submitted for consideration by the planning commission. 
b.  Preliminary site plan review by the planning commission. The preliminary site plan shall be reviewed by the township planning commission and shall be approved, disapproved, approved with specific conditions, or tabled as may be deemed necessary to carry out the purpose of this section and other codes and regulations of the township. If, during review, the planning commission finds a site plan not in conformance with the provisions set forth in this section it may, at its discretion, return the site plan to the applicant with a written statement of the modifications necessary to secure approval. 
c.  Final site plan approval by the planning commission. If the planning commission or other department imposes conditions on a site plan approval, the applicant is required to resubmit two copies of a final site plan that reflects said conditions. Staff will then review the final site plan for compliance with those conditions. If the site plan complies with the approval conveyed by the planning commission, staff will stamp both copies "approved" and return one to the applicant. One copy will be kept on file with the community development department. If the site plan does not comply with the conditions imposed by the planning commission, staff will stamp both copies "resubmitnot approved." One copy will be returned to the applicant the other will be put into the site plan file. 
d.  Approval. Following approval of the site plan, it shall become part of the record, and subsequent actions relating to the activity authorized shall be consistent with the approved site plan unless a change or addition conforming to this section received the mutual agreement of the land owner and the township planning commission or zoning administrator, as appropriate. Incidental and minor variations of the approved site plan with written approval of the zoning administrator, shall not invalidate prior site plan approval. 
e.  Denial for specific requirements. In instances where specific dimensional or area requirements mentioned in the zoning ordinance are not satisfied on the site plan, requests for variance(s) may be initiated by the applicant to the township zoning board of appeals. Requirements not met are grounds for denial. 
5.  Interdepartmental procedures for site plan review. 
a.  Interdepartmental review. Each affected department, including the community development department, department of public services, fire department and planning department reviews the project independently. If any department finds a need to suggest or require revisions, the developer may be called in for further consultation in an effort to accommodate the condition. Each department shall write up its review comments upon completion by using criteria approved by the planning commission. Said review comments will be included in staff's report to the planning commission 
b.  Utility capacity analysis. If the general character of the site plan is acceptable to the departments, it is referred to the township engineer, who shall be a practicing, registered civil engineer appointed by the board of trustees. The township engineer shall conduct a utility capacity and design analysis at the request of the director of the department of public service. The utility capacity analysis examines the adequacy of the public sanitary sewer, municipal water, and storm drainage for the project according to design standards established by the board of trustees. It is also to ensure that specific site plans conform to the needs or plans for the total utility system of the township. If problems are encountered at this point, the site plan is referred back to the department of public service for consultation with the developer. 
(1)  If, after favorable review by the departments and the utility capacity analysis, there are no significant revisions in the site plan, then it shall be approved by the zoning administrator and the project may be issued a building permit. 
(2)  If the site plan is revised during administrative review, utility capacity analysis, or if there are differing administrative perspectives, then the site plan shall be referred again to the Saginaw Township Planning Commission. The planning commission's responsibilities then include: 
i.  Reviewing the impact and desirability of any revisions made to the site plan in terms of review criteria. 
ii.  Resolving differing viewpoints or interpretations among the administrative officials. 
iii.  Review additional data that may be provided in order to make judgments about landscaping, construction materials or appearance. 
iv.  Make a determination as to whether the site plan is acceptable as submitted, acceptable with certain revisions, or unacceptable for specific reasons or deficiencies based on the criteria required for approval. 
If the planning commission rejects the final site plan, a new site plan shall be required. If it is approved subject to certain revisions required by the planning commission, then final approval is subject to revisions required by the planning commission and upon the submittal of a revised plan to the administrative site plan review committee. If the revised plan meets the conditions specified by the planning commission, then it shall be approved by the administrative site plan review committee. If approved as submitted and the utility capacity is satisfactory, the review process is completed and the zoning administrator may issue a building permit and or certificate of occupancy. 
6.  Site plan standards and requirements. In order that buildings, open space and landscaping will be in harmony with other structures and improvements in the area, and to assure that no undesirable health, safety, noise and traffic conditions will result from the development, the township planning commission shall determine whether the site plan meets the following criteria, unless the township planning commission determines that one or more of the criteria are inapplicable: 
a.  The proposed site plan shall meet all applicable requirements of the zoning ordinance in terms of intent, use, dimensional, design guidelines and other requirements; 
b.  Safe, efficient, and convenient transportation shall be afforded the site including road rights-of-way, vehicular access and circulation, adequate parking, pedestrian and non-motorized facilities (if appropriate), and emergency vehicle access; 
c.  Appropriate consideration shall be made as to the impact on adjacent land uses including conformance to the Township Land Use Plan; relationship to the architectural scale, mass, and building materials used in it's surrounding environment; landscaping to provide buffers including fences, walks, or vegetative screens, and site lighting; and limitations and opportunities afforded by major land uses and zoning on adjacent or nearby parcels. 
d.  Adequate provisions shall be made for public utilities to, through and on the site including: sanitary sewers or on-site sewage disposal treatment, water supply and fire hydrants, storm drainage including a grading plan, restrictions and detention/retention if necessary, and disposal of solid refuse. 
e.  Protection of unique site or environmental conditions shall be ensured including, when appropriate, utilization of natural topography, vegetation, drainage, and other resources; maintenance of established conditions or continuance of established patterns of landscaping; appropriate design and orientation of structures on the site; and control of noise, smoke, vibration, odor, glare, heat, or other environmental intrusions. 
f.  Provisions for open space, recreation, storage space, and community facilities shall be required in all multiple-family developments and may be required for other large scale, intensive site uses. 
g.  Any site plan approved shall further be consistent with the purpose of the zoning ordinance as identified in Section 102 of the Saginaw Charter Township Zoning Ordinance as amended. 
h.  Pedestrian walkways and/or pathways shall be provided as deemed necessary by the township planning commission for separating pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
7.  Appeals. The applicant shall have the right to appeal from the decision of the township planning commission or administrative site plan review to the township board, whose decision will be final. 
8.  Expiration. Planning commission approval of a site plan shall expire after one year if earnest construction of an approved structure has not commenced. The zoning administrator, in his discretion, may approve an extension of up to one year.

6.  Any additions shall be constructed with similar quality workmanship as the original structure, including permanent attachment to the principal structure and construction of a foundation as required herein. 
7.  The dwelling shall be aesthetically compatible in design and appearance with other residences in the vicinity. The compatibility of design shall be determined in the first instance by the township zoning administrator upon review of the plans submitted for a particular dwelling subject to appeals by an aggrieved party 15 days from the receipt of notice of said zoning administrator's decision. Any determination of compatibility shall be based upon the standards set forth in this section as well as the character, design, and appearance of one or more residential dwellings located within 2,000 feet of the subject dwelling where such an area is developed with dwellings to the extent of not less than 20 percent of the lots situated within said area, or, where said area is not so developed, by the character, design and appearance of one or more residential dwellings located throughout the township. The foregoing shall not be construed to prohibit innovative design concepts involving such matters as solar energy, view, unique land contour, or relief from the common or standard designed home. 
8.  The foregoing standards shall not apply to a mobile home located in a licensed mobile home park except to the extent required by state or federal law or otherwise specifically required in any ordinance of Saginaw Township regulating such parks.  
Sec. 313. - Condominium projects.

Sec. 314. - General design guidelines. 
These guidelines are intended to serve as recommendations for all development and redevelopment projects completed by the private sector that require site plan approval. They are designed to enhance and protect Saginaw Charter Township's quality of life and community image as well as protect and promote the township's long-term economic vitality through quality design and architecture. 
1.  Architectural design guidelines. 
a.  While no specific or particular architectural style is required for any structure, high quality, innovative and imaginative architecture is encouraged. The use of standardized, "corporate" architectural styles associated with franchises is discouraged. Site specific design solutions are encouraged. 
b.  All buildings should be compatible in scale, mass, and form with adjacent structures and the pattern of the surrounding area. 
c.  Efforts to coordinate the actual and apparent height of adjacent structures are encouraged. This is especially applicable where buildings are located very close to each other. In terms of design, differing heights can often be made more compatible through placement of windows, belt courses and other horizontal elements that reflect similar elements on neighboring properties, including roof lines and roof pitches. 
d.  Rear and side facades, if visible from public streets or neighboring properties, should be carefully designed with similar detailing, and should be compatible with the principal facades of the building. All elevations of the building will be evaluated during review. 
e.  The incorporation of defined outdoor spaces into the buildings and site designs of all new development in the township is encouraged. Outdoor spaces, which are encouraged, include courtyards, patios, plazas, covered walkways passages, gardens, trellised areas, etc. 
f.  Building surfaces more than two stories or 35 feet high or 50 feet in length, should attempt to include a wall plane that provides strong shadow or visual interest. 
g.  New building forms and elevations should be detailed and articulated to create interesting roof lines, and strong patterns of shade and shadow. 
h.  Building frontages should be active with large non-reflective minimally tinted window openings at ground level. 
i.  Large structures should be designed to reduce their perceived height and bulk by dividing the building mass into smaller-scale components. 
j.  The rear of existing buildings shall be enhanced, where appropriate, to improve public access from parking lots. 
k.  Variations in rooflines should be encouraged to reduce the massive scale of the structure and add visual interest. Roofs should attempt to include two of the following features: parapets concealing flat roofs and roof top equipment, overhanging eaves, sloped roofs, and three or more roof surfaces. 
2.  Building equipment and service. 
a.  Access for service vehicles should be provided on the street with the least traffic volume. 
b.  Building equipment shall be located, designed, and/or screened to minimize visual impact on public streets, large surface parking fields and neighboring properties. 
c.  Trash containers and outdoor storage areas shall be screened from public streets, pedestrian areas, and neighboring properties. The screen for both the trash containers and any outdoor storage should be designed to be compatible with the architectural character of the development. It shall be constructed of durable materials similar to those of the building and should have solid (opaque) walls and doors. 
d.  When feasible and/or upon recommendation by the planning commission, service and loading areas should be separated from main circulation and parking areas and away from public streets. Loading and unloading activities shall not require circulation onto public streets. 
e.  All exterior on-site utilities, including but not limited to, sewers, gas lines, water lines, and electrical, telephone and communications wires and equipment, shall be installed and maintained underground. Drainage systems, when pertaining to retention or detention, may be installed above ground but should be well planned, attractive and integrated into the site. 
f.  Developers should work with utility companies to plan the most appropriate and unobtrusive location for utility boxes and other necessary utility installations. All utility installations should be screened by an architectural screen similar to the building. If this is not possible the utility installation shall be mitigated through landscaping, loading docks and outdoor storage areas shall be incorporated into the overall design of the building and the landscaping so that the visual and acoustic impacts of these functions are fully contained and out of view from adjacent properties and public streets. Screening walls consistent with the main structures material is encouraged. 
3.  Site design. 
a.  The sequence of continuous pedestrian activity shall not be interrupted. Blank walls and other "dead" or dull space at the street level shall be avoided. Visually interesting activities at the sidewalk edge shall be maintained and/or established to engage pedestrian interest. 
b.  Frontage design and signage locations shall be coordinated with streetscape landscaping and street trees. 
c.  Pedestrian open spaces such as covered walkways; courtyards and plazas are encouraged, as well as the development of open and attractive passageways between buildings and uses. 
d.  Outdoor seating and dining areas that face onto the street are encouraged. 
e.  The existing scale and rhythm of storefronts shall be preserved. When a parcel is redeveloped, there should be an attempt to design a structure that will positively impact, and not detract, the already built environment. Buildings over two stories high may seek to "scale down" their facades to reduce apparent height. The building wall at the street should be no more than 35 feet tall. The upper story above 35 feet should be stepped back a distance equal to the height of the building story immediately below. 
f.  All roof top mechanical equipment; antennas, etc. shall be screened from view. Roof top lighting is strongly discouraged. 
g.  Shopping cart storage areas shall be incorporated into the building design as an integral part of the development and shall be harmonious with other aspects of the development. 
h.  Stormwater detention and/or retention should be integrated into the site and addressed as a site feature and amenity as opposed to merely an infrastructure necessity. Developers should work to master plan drainage and retention facilities to improve efficiency and create larger usable areas of open space. 
i.  Lighting should operate for only the minimum number of hours required and should then be reduced in level or turned off. The design of lighting systems should anticipate lighting levels that will vary depending on building use, hours of operation, occupancy and seasonal changes. The hours of operation of site lighting should be included in the site plan submittal. 
j.  Landscape feature lighting and lighting at the pedestrian level is encouraged. 
k.  Architectural lighting should be used to highlight special features only and to embellish the lighting levels of ground level pedestrian areas. 
l.  Mailboxes and mail delivery. All mailboxes shall be centrally located and internal to the site. Mailbox location shall be off the public roadway and coordinated with the United States Post Office. 
4.  Landscaping. 
a.  Landscaping should be provided along and against buildings to anchor it to the surrounding environment and soften the structure. 
b.  Trees should be used throughout paved areas and along pedestrian pathways. Trees should be so selected and planted to provide a mix of canopy and ornamental trees. 
c.  Dense landscaping and/or architectural treatments should be provided to screen unattractive view and features, such as storage areas, trash enclosures, utility cabinets, etc. 
d.  Developers are encouraged to retain existing mature and desirable trees on site and to incorporate them into the new development. 
5.  Guidelines for the public streetscape. The streetscape environment includes all the elements that can make a pedestrian comfortable such as the sidewalk, street trees, street furniture, and the facade of the building. 
a.  All projects must incorporate pedestrian access from the street and parking areas and may be required to install pedestrian amenities as identified below: 
i.  All development and redevelopment projects must include sidewalk and sidewalk connections as deemed appropriate by the planning commission. At a minimum, these connections should provide access to, from and in between existing pedestrian hubs, such as to adjacent businesses, public areas and transit stops. 
ii.  In order to provide safe and convenient pedestrian access, all crosswalks on streets whether public or private and driveways shall be denoted by a change in surface consistent with the intent of the design guidelines and as approved by the planning commission. 
iii.  Benches and waste receptacles in a type and color specified by the Township consistent with the existing or planned streetscape in the area may be required when any of the following conditions are present: 
a.  Commercial uses, 
b.  Institutional uses, 
c.  Commercial recreation, including theaters, 
d.  Any mixed use development, or planned unit development, 
e.  Residential development at a density greater than 4 dwelling units per acre, and 
f.  Developments directly adjacent to a multi-use path, as identified as above, regardless of size. 
iv.  A minimum of two bike spaces may be required, in a type and color specified by the township, dependent on the use of the site, the intensity of the development and/or the proximity of pedestrian pathway(s). 
v.  A development located along Tittabawassee Road shall install a ten-foot wide path in lieu of installation of a public sidewalk constructed to the design and specification requirements of the Township. 
b.  Terminal street views (the point where a street connects perpendicular to a second street) should focus on a significant built or natural feature (a building, landscaping, public space - not a parking lot). 
c.  Street trees and landscaping should be designed and maintained to enhance pedestrian access and levels of comfort. 
d.  Buildings, not parking lots, should be the primary feature at the entrance to a development. 
e.  Facades facing streets or public walkways shall incorporate windows and doors so as to encourage pedestrian activity. Mirrored or smoked glass is discouraged as it acts as a wall and prevents pedestrian interaction. 
f.  Street furniture. Street furniture, including benches and trash receptacles, shall be provided at key locations at the discretion of the township, and shall be of a type and standard approved by the township. 
g.  Decorative street lights. 
i.  Any proposed street lighting that is intended to serve to light a circulation drive, a dedicated private street or intended to be a street dedicated to the county shall be of a type and standard approved by the township. If there is a corridor or streetscape plan for the area, the fixtures shall be consistent with the adopted plan. This is inclusive of residential development for corridor streetscape. 
ii.  Any freestanding light fixture (lamp post) at the entry to the building shall be of the same head fixture and color as the township specification for the area.

b.  Care should be taken to place windows around the perimeter of the building unless not feasible due to interior layout or use. If the installation of windows is deemed not feasible by both the developer and the zoning administrator, additional architectural and/or landscaping detail is required along said façade. 
v.  Roof type. There is no specific type of required roof type or pitch, except that creativity and quality design is encouraged. Large scale developments, such as strip malls and shopping centers are required to provide a façade and overall design that allows distinction between and among individual storefronts. 
vi.  Materials. Natural materials, such as natural brick and stone, are encouraged. Manmade materials are discouraged, especially on the first floors. Color schemes should be selected that enhance and compliment the materials selected. 
vii.  Entry: 
a.  Entry ways shall be the primary focus of all buildings. 
b.  Functional doorways shall be included along storefronts and other developments whenever possible. 
viii.  Height. Buildings shall have a minimum height of 18 feet. 
g.  Performance standards. In order to permit a wide range of uses and provide for creativity and flexibility for developers and the township, while still preserving the character and identity of Saginaw Charter Township, the following performance standards shall apply to all uses within the state street corridor: 
i.  All outdoor lighting shall be limited to 15 feet in height when located 300 feet from a residentially zoned district. Fixtures should be of a "cut off" type and there should be zero foot candles measured at the property lines. 
ii.  Dumpster unloading, parking lot cleaning, and similar building or site maintenance shall not take place before 7:00 a.m. nor after 10:00 p.m., excepting that snow plowing is permitted during all hours. 
iii.  No use is permitted which creates a noise level greater than which is allowed in by the noise ordinance when measured from the nearest residential property line. The planning commission may require details of operation and a map showing the areas affected by potential noise. 
iv.  No use is permitted which emits smoke, soot or noxious fumes or odors excepting smoke or odors which are typically associated with restaurants and food service establishments. 
v.  Emergency road and utility repairs, road cleaning, snow plowing and other such similar work conducted by the township, county and/or its agents operated within the road or road right-of-way shall be exempt from these standards. Additionally, sirens used by public safety agencies are exempt as well. 
vi.  Any use that evolves into a nuisance, resulting in police, fire or other such calls that exceeds by 50 percent similar uses in the township, the property owner/operator shall be issued a civil infraction as permitted in the township's general ordinance. 
9.  Administration of the design guidelines. The design guidelines in this section are to be used as guides for the township planning commission when reviewing site plans and special land use for multiple family, institutional, commercial and manufacturing uses. 
a.  Flexibility of the guidelines. Because not every development may be able to meet each specific design guideline, the guidelines were written to be flexible, to expand and contract, to fit the development and achieve the intent of the master plan. 
b.  Applicable to all developments. Although not all developments will meet all of the guidelines, each new or redevelopment project in the area should meet most of the design guidelines. Minor changes to existing developments need not comply with the design guidelines. Minor changes are defined as those changes which do not structurally alter the building or site layout. The township encourages all changes in structures, uses and site design, regardless of how minor, to attempt to meet the intent of this Ordinance. All changes in use shall comply with the intent and purpose of these design guidelines. Any addition to a structure, parking area, or other significant site features is required to meet these design guidelines.

Sec. 315. - Prohibition of (recreational) marihuana establishments. 
A.  Marihuana establishments, as authorized by and defined in the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act (the "Act"), are prohibited in all zoning districts. 
B.  No use that constitutes or purports to be a marihuana grower, marihuana safety compliance facility, marihuana processor, marihuana microbusiness, marihuana retailer, marihuana secure transporter or any other type of marihuana related business authorized by the Act, that was engaged in prior to the enactment of the ordinance codified in this section, shall be deemed to have been a legally established use under the provisions of the Saginaw Charter Township Code of Ordinances; that use shall not be entitled to claim legal nonconforming status. 
C.  Violations of this section are subject to the violations and penalties pursuant to Section 2301 of Chapter 23 and may be abated as nuisances. 
D.  This section does not supersede rights and obligations with respect to the transportation of marihuana by marihuana secure transporters through Saginaw Charter Township to the extent provided by the Act, and does not supersede rights and the regulations with respect to medical marihuana facilities established pursuant to the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act.

It is the purpose and intent of this Ordinance that off-street parking and loading areas be provided and adequately maintained by each property owner in every zoning district for the purposes of promoting safe and efficient off-street storage of motor vehicles; and to provide for sound and stable environmental conditions and the prevention of future blighted areas. 
( Ord. No. 750, 11-28-2016 )  
Sec. 402. - Off-street parking and loading general requirements. 
1.  Parking and loading requirements. In all zoning districts, off-street parking and loading requirements shall be provided in amounts not less than specified for the various land uses listed in section 404. 
2.  Requirements for a use not mentioned. Requirements for a use not mentioned shall be determined by the zoning administrator based upon those uses which are most similar to the use not listed. The zoning administrator may consider, but is not limited to, the following in establishing parking requirements for a use not mentioned: 
A.  Documentation supplied by the applicant regarding actual parking demand for the proposed use; or 
B.  Evidence available in planning and technical studies relating to the proposed use; or 
C.  Required parking for the proposed uses determined by other comparable jurisdictions. 
3.  Increase in floor area, building use capacity, intensity of use or change in use. Additional parking shall be provided and maintained in proper ratio to any increase in floor area, building use capacity or intensity of use.

Exception: reductions made in conjunction with [sub]section 402.10. of this section. 
5.  Use of off-street parking. It shall be unlawful to use any off-street parking and loading area for purposes other than short-term parking of licensed vehicles or the loading or unloading of necessary service trucks. Commercial repair work, servicing, sales, display or storage of merchandise or equipment in any parking area is prohibited except where specifically permitted in this Ordinance. If permitted, such activity may not reduce the number of off-street parking spaces available below the number required by section 404. 
6.  No parking on front lawn. No portion of a front yard lawn area shall be used for parking. 
7.  Maintenance of off-street parking areas. All off-street parking and loading areas shall be maintained as follows: 
A.  Parking and loading areas shall be adequately maintained and kept free of litter, debris and trash. 
B.  Parking and loading areas shall be kept entirely clear of snow. Snow may be stored in a parking area provided adequate on-site parking is provided in an amount equal to that required for the use or uses of the parcel. A clear sight area must be maintained from the edge of the adjacent street as defined in section 405.5 herein. Snow may not be piled higher than three feet within the clear sight area. 
C.  Parking stalls shall be distinctly marked with painted striping or similar indicators. 
D.  The surface of all parking and loading areas shall be maintained in good condition so no holes, depressions or cracks exist greater than three inches in depth and/or six inches in width or length and cracks of a width of one inch shall not interrupt more than ten percent of the surface area of any parking or loading area. 
8.  Pedestrian walkways. Where deemed necessary by the planning commission, walkways leading from parking areas, adjacent properties, and public sidewalks shall be installed to the principal building for the purpose of assuring pedestrians safe access to the site. All internal walkways shall conform to the following: 
A.  Must be paved with hard-surfaced material such as concrete, asphalt, stone, brick, tile, etc. Only nonskid paving may be used in walkway construction. 
B.  Must be curbed and raised at least six inches above the parking lot grade except where they cross driveways or aisles or where necessary to meet barrier free requirements. 
C.  Must be a minimum of five feet wide, exclusive of parked car overhangs. Where necessary to ensure five feet of unobstructed walkway, wheel stops are required. 
D.  Where pedestrian walks cross parking areas or automobile circulation lanes, the pedestrian walk must be defined by use of a contrasting material or marking, including, but not limited to, white concrete in an asphalt area, visually obvious paint stripes or other clearly defined pattern. 
9.  Shared use of drives and/or parking. The planning commission may require an access easement, development of a service drive or shared driveway to adjacent parking areas or parcels of land, to minimize the need for driveways and curb cuts to each use and thereby decreasing hazards to persons and vehicular traffic. 
A.  Shared parking. The planning commission may approve shared use of parking facilities located on separate properties if all of the following conditions are met: 
i)  A convenient pedestrian connection between the properties exists; and 
ii)  The properties are within 500 feet of each other; and 
iii)  The availability of parking for all affected properties is indicated by directional signs as permitted by the sign ordinance in chapter 5. 
iv)  The property owners shall provide parking spaces equal to the combined individual parking requirements stated in section 404, unless otherwise provided in [sub]section 402.10 [of this section] (reductions in parking requirements). 
v)  Prior to establishing shared use of parking, the property owner or owners shall file with the Saginaw Charter Township Community Development Department a written agreement providing for the shared parking use. The agreement shall be recorded on the title records of each affected property and shall be binding to future owners. Said agreement shall set forth terms for future maintenance and liability. 
B.  Shared or joint driveway. The planning commission may require adjacent property owners to share a driveway when it is determined it is in the best interest of the general public. Each property has a right to reasonable access. Reasonable access may not always be direct access, or may not be the number of access points requested by the developer or owner. 
i)  The planning commission, as part of a site plan review, may require the applicant to provide an easement to the township, which allows future access to the adjoining properties. 
ii)  The planning commission, as part of a site plan review, may require the applicant to construct a service drive leading to an adjacent property for the purpose of providing reasonable access to said property. 
iii)  Prior to establishing a shared or joint drive, the property owner or owners, shall file with the Saginaw Charter Township Community Development Department a written agreement providing for the shared or joint drive. The agreement shall be recorded on the title records of each affected property and shall be binding to future owners. Said agreement shall set forth terms for future maintenance and liability. 
10.  Reductions in parking requirements. Parking requirements may be reduced in the following situations: 
A.  Establishment of a joint or shared driveway. Where two or more abutting parcels in any B or M zoning district share a driveway complying with [sub]section 402.9 [of this section], each parcel is entitled to a ten-percent reduction in the amount of parking spaces required. This decrease is in addition to reductions allowed by other provisions of this section. 
B.  Reductions for further public benefits. In any B or M zoning district, the parking requirement for a parcel fronting on a county primary or state highway, other than an expressway, may be reduced by ten percent, in addition to other reductions allowed by this section, if three of the below-listed conditions are met: 
i)  No driveways open onto the major road.

They must be located either within a building or outside on the same lot and available for the loading or unloading of goods or merchandise and having direct and unobstructed access to a street or alley. 
C.  Perimeter edges. Concrete curb and gutter shall be required for parking lots containing more than 50 spaces that serve commercial, industrial or institutional uses. The purpose of the curb and gutter is to control storm water flow from the parking area and to protect landscaped areas such as landscaped islands and other plantings. 
i)  Parking areas containing 50 spaces or less shall have bumper guards or wheel stops installed along the perimeter of the parking lot to prevent yard encroachments. 
ii)  Concrete curb and gutter shall be a minimum of six inches in height from the grade of the parking area or drive.

v)  Every legal parcel of land is entitled to reasonable access to public streets. Where such access is not provided by way of an existing proposed service drive or access drive, cross or access easement or joint drive, one driveway may be permitted directly onto a public street. The planning commission may permit additional access drives consistent with the standards for site review. When necessary for safe ingress and egress of vehicles, the planning commission may require acceleration, deceleration, turn or passing lanes and any other similar improvement to be installed at the expense of the developer or property owner. The standards for driveway development shall be as stated in the rules for driveways promulgated by the Michigan Department of Transportation and the Saginaw County Road Commission. The planning commission may require dedication or reservation of land for future service or access drives, joint driveways or cross or access easements at the time of rezoning of a parcel, or site plan or plat approval. 
E.  Driveway spacing. Each parcel shall have no more than one driveway entrance and exit opening to any public street for each 300 feet of frontage, or fraction thereof.

i)  Minimum width: 24 feet. The planning commission may approve a 20-foot wide service drive if it can be demonstrated that a parcel has physical constraints that make it difficult to establish a 24-foot wide service drive. 
ii)  Service drives shall be setback a minimum of 20 feet from the right-of-way or proposed right-of-way, whichever is greater. 
Exception: Access management plans adopted by the planning commission may be implemented as approved. 
3.  Yard requirements. Parking and loading areas and interior circulation drives shall not be located within any road rights-of-way as described under section 303.2 and, further, parking, loading and drive areas shall conform to the front and street side yard requirements of the zoning district in which the property is located unless otherwise provided herein. Parking lots, loading areas and circulation drives shall be located a minimum of 30 feet or the required setback of the zoning district in which the property is located, whichever is greater, from any road right-of-way as described under section 303.2. However, the setback may be reduced to 20 feet by the planning commission through the site plan review process for commercial B and industrial M districts only if it does not create a safety issue, it does not encroach upon or obstruct the clear sight distance for corner lots as defined by section 405.3 and a three-foot tall landscaped berm is constructed within the front yard between the road right-of-way and the parking lot. The height of said berm shall be measured from the grade of the adjoining parking lot. Furthermore, the slope of the berm shall not exceed one vertical for every three horizontal. 
Exception: Access management plans adopted by the planning commission shall be implemented as approved. 
A.  Parking lot, loading areas and circulation drives. All parking lots, loading areas, and circulation drives shall comply with all applicable setback and buffer yard requirements stated herein. However, along interior side property lines and rear property lines where no other setback rule is specifically stated, such paved areas must be a minimum of five feet from the property line. An exception may be permitted by the planning commission if two or more parking lots are connected to essentially function as a single parking area. Also, a legally binding agreement must be recorded to ensure continued use of the parking as such (i.e., cross easement). The five-foot separation strip shall consist of natural plantings and grass with curb as a preferable border. 
B.  Building perimeter and landscaping. Parking and loading areas and circulation drives shall be no closer than five feet to any building or structure. Within said five feet a raised sidewalk shall be constructed where it is expected that pedestrians may travel. Otherwise, said five-foot requirement may consist of a raised landscaped area. A minimum of 50 percent of this landscaped area, at time of planting, shall be planted with grass, ground cover, shrubs, or other living vegetation. 
C.  [Buffer yards.] Where a parking area or circulation drive of three spaces or more is within 40 feet of an adjoining residentially zoned district or lot there shall be installed and maintained a buffer yard along the adjoining property and within said buffer yard shall be developed either of the following: 
i)  A planting strip containing approved plant materials as listed in section 405 of this Ordinance at a density of ten plants per 100 lineal feet of buffer yard and at a height of five feet at time of planting. The buffer yard shall be a minimum width of ten feet. 
ii)  A masonry wall or uniformly treated wood fence not less than five feet tall. The buffer yard shall be a minimum of five feet in width. Said buffer yard shall be of such length as the width or length of the parking area. 
4.  Single-family and two-family parking requirements. 
A.  A maximum of a 400 square-foot parking area per dwelling unit may be located in the required front yard of any single- or two-family residential use. Necessary driveways for single- or two-family uses providing access to the dwelling unit from a public street may be permitted within the setback areas and may be used for residential parking purposes. The 400 square-feet is in addition to the square footage occupied by the necessary driveway. 
B.  Off-street parking for one- and two-family residential uses shall have a durable, smooth and dustless surface consisting of asphalt, concrete, crushed stone or similar surface as approved by the zoning administrator. Any such area shall be graded so that surface water drains away from adjacent lots. 
( Ord. No. 750, 11-28-2016 )  
Sec. 404. - Off-street parking requirements. 
1.  For the purposes of this section, the following shall apply: 
A.  Floor area. Unless otherwise specified, where floor area is the unit for determining the required number of parking spaces, the [term] "unit" shall mean gross floor area. [The term] "useable floor area" shall mean the floor area used for service to the public and shall not include floor area used for storage or the processing and packaging of merchandise where it is undertaken in a room in which service to the public is not involved. 
B.  Beds. For hospitals, bassinets shall not be counted as beds. 
C.  Places of assembly. For churches, sports arenas and other places of assembly in which those in attendance occupy benches, pews or similar facilities, each 20 inches of such seating shall be counted as one seat. 
D.  Employees. For requirements stated in terms of employees, the calculation shall be based on the maximum number of employees on the premises during the largest shift. 
E.  Fractions. When units of measurement determining the number of required parking spaces result in the requirement of a fractional space, any fraction shall be counted as one additional space. 
F.  Outdoor seating. Square footage occupied by outdoor seating areas shall be calculated at 50 percent the typical required amount for that use. Outdoor seating areas that can be enclosed or utilized off-season shall be calculated at the full amount of required parking for that use.

Sec. 405. - Parking area landscaping requirements. 
1.  Intent. Landscaping is intended to provide a visual separation of uses from streets, and visual separation of compatible uses so as to soften the appearance of streets, parking areas and building elevations. 
Recognizing that the preservation or installation of vegetative cover promotes the health, safety and general welfare by aiding in the stabilization of the environment's ecological balance by contributing to the processes of air purification, oxygen regeneration, groundwater recharge and stormwater runoff retardation while at the same time aiding in noise, glare and heat abatement, the following requirements for the landscaping of parking and outdoor display areas are enacted. 
2.  Interior landscaping. Landscaping required or installed within a parking area shall be designed to control traffic, provide shade, screen views into and within vehicular use areas, and separate the parking circulation, and service areas, in accordance with the following provisions. 
A.  Required amount. 
i)  If the parking area contains no more than 50 parking spaces, at least 16 square feet of planting area must be provided as described in [sub]section 405(B) of this section for each parking stall proposed. 
ii)  If the parking area contains more than 50, but less than 100 parking spaces, at least 20 square feet of landscape development must be provided as described in [sub]section 405.B of this section for each parking stall proposed. 
iii)  If the parking area contains more than 99 parking spaces, at least 25 square feet of landscape development must be provided as described in [sub]section 405.B of this section for each parking stall proposed. 
B.  Design. The landscaping requirements listed in [sub]section 405.2[A.] [of this section] shall be incorporated into the site in the manner described below: 
i)  For parking calculations less than or equal to 128 parking spaces, a minimum of one tree and two shrubs or two treelike shrubs and two shrubs for each four parking spaces must be evenly dispersed throughout and around the perimeter of the parking, display or storage area and/or in the setback area as shown on a plan approved by the zoning administrator. When the parking calculation exceeds 128 parking spaces, any additional spaces will be calculated at a minimum of one tree and two shrubs or two treelike shrubs and two shrubs for each 16 parking spaces. All plant materials required by the sections [this subsection] shall conform to the standards of section 303(4)(b), (c), and (d). 
ii)  The remaining ground area must be landscaped with plant materials, decorative mulch or unit pavers. 
iii)  A landscaped area must be placed at the interior end of each parking row in a multiple lane parking area. This area must be at least four feet wide and must extend the length of the adjacent parking stall. 
iv)  For sites that have parking calculations greater than 300 parking spaces, the planning commission may grant approval to deviate from the required landscaping by up to 50 percent. 
3.  Clear sight distance. When an ingress or egress drive intersects a public right-of-way or when the subject property abuts the intersection of two or more public streets, all landscaping within the triangular areas described below shall provide unobstructed cross visibility at a level between three feet and eight feet. Landscaping, except grass or ground cover, shall not be located closer than three feet from the edge of any ingress or egress drive pavement. The triangular areas referred to above are: 
A.  The areas of property on both sides on an ingress or egress drive formed by the intersection of each side of the drive and the public street with two sides of each triangle being ten feet in length from the point of intersection and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the two ten-foot sides. 
B.  The area of property located at a corner formed by the intersection of two or more public road rights-of-way with two sides of the triangular area being 30 feet in length along the abutting public rights-of-way and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the two 30-foot sides. 
4.  Maintenance of landscaping. The owner, tenant and their agent, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping, which shall be maintained in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance and shall be kept free from refuse and debris. Dead, diseased, or missing vegetation shall be replaced within 30 days, or as soon as weather permits. 
( Ord. No. 750, 11-28-2016 )  
Sec. 406. - Street trees. 
Street trees shall be required for all commercial, institutional and high density residential uses. The following minimum standards shall be utilized for street tree plantings:

B.  An approved corridor landscape plan adopted by the planning commission shall take precedence over the spacing requirement stated in [subsection] 406.1.A. [of this section]. 
2.  Tree size. Street trees shall be at least 2½ inches in diameter and six feet in height at time of planting. 
3.  Tree type. Street trees shall conform to the standards listed in section 303.4(b), (c) and (d) of the Zoning Ordinance. Further, street trees shall be selected so that they are hardy to the climate and their location.

A.  An approved corridor landscape plan adopted by the planning commission shall take precedence over the standards listed in section 303.4(b), (c) and (d). 
4.  Trees required under section 405.2 may be used to satisfy this requirement. 
( Ord. No. 750, 11-28-2016 )  
Sec. 407. - Loading area requirements. 
In order to prevent undue interference with public use of streets and alleys, property owners who customarily receive or distribute goods by motor vehicle shall provide on the premises for that number of vehicles that will be at the premises at the same time on an average day of full use. 
1.  Every building housing such a use and having over 500 square feet of gross floor area shall be provided with at least one truck standing, loading and unloading space on the premises, not less than ten feet in width, 25 feet in length and 15 feet in height. One additional truck space of these dimensions shall be provided for every additional 120,000 square feet or fraction thereof [of] gross floor area in the building. 
2.  Access to a truck standing, loading, and unloading space shall be provided directly from a public street or alley, or from any right-of-way that will not interfere with public convenience, and that will permit orderly and safe movement of truck vehicles. 
( Ord. No. 750, 11-28-2016 )  
Sec. 408. - Flexibility in application. 
1.  The township recognizes that, due to the specific requirements of any given development, inflexible application of the parking standards may result in development with inadequate parking or parking far in excess of that which is needed. The former situation may lead to traffic congestion or unauthorized parking on adjacent streets or neighboring sites. The latter situation may result in excessive paving and stormwater runoff and a waste of space which could be left as open space. 
2.  The township may grant deviations from off-street parking requirements. These deviations may require more or less parking based upon a finding that such deviations are more likely to provide a sufficient number of parking spaces to accommodate the specific characteristics of the use in question. In the event that a deviation is granted, the following shall apply: 
A.  An applicant may request a parking deviation as part of a development application or as a separate and distinct action with no other concurrent request. 
B.  The applicant shall provide a parking study with adequate detail and information to assist the township in determining the appropriateness of the request. 
C.  The township may attach conditions to the approval of a deviation from the off-street parking requirements that bind such approval to the specific use in question. 
( Ord. No. 750, 11-28-2016 )  
Sec. 409. - Lighting. 
1.  Lighting of off-street parking areas. Off-street parking areas shall be lighted in accordance with a plan as approved by the township planning commission. 
A.  The maximum height of a base, a pole, and fixtures shall be 25 feet. Exterior lighting shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in a manner that minimizes off-site glare, light trespass on neighboring lots, and traffic hazards to motorists. 
B.  The maximum intensity of light within any site shall not exceed the following standards: 
Light intensity 	Maximum 
(foot-candles) 
At any point within the site 	12.0* 
Average for the overall site 	6.0* 
At any lot boundary or road right-of-way line 	1.0 
 
*Exception: Automobile service stations and similar uses as approved by the planning commission. 
C.  Parking area lighting and other exterior on-site lighting fixtures shall not exceed a height of 15 feet when located within 200 feet of a residential dwelling or district. All exterior and parking lot lighting fixtures shall be so arranged or installed with reflectors so that light is deflected away from adjacent residential land uses and adjacent streets. Further, said exterior lighting within 200 feet of a residential zone/use shall have cutoff light fixtures and shall include the submittal of an acceptable lighting plan that designates zero foot-candles at the property line. 
2.  Exceptions:

CHAPTER 20. - CB-1 CAMPUS BUSINESS DISTRICT 
 
Sec. 2001. - Intent and purpose. 
The Campus Business Zoning District is intended for a varying range of development from the highest intensity uses immediately adjacent to Tittabawassee Road to the lowest intensity uses adjacent to existing residential neighborhoods. It is intended to implement the designated future land use area within the comprehensive development plan called campus business and designed to: 
1.  Promote development that enhances Saginaw Charter Township's position as a location for corporate campuses, light industrial development that is capable of operation in such a manner as to control the external effects of the manufacturing process, such as odors, vibrations, emissions, or other nuisance characteristics through prevention or mitigation devices and conduct operations within wholly enclosed buildings. 
2.  Promote development that is adjacent to existing and/or concurrent with proposed capital improvement projects, thus not burdening the township's infrastructure; 
3.  Facilitate development that establishes a unique visual and economic identity for Saginaw Charter Township; 
4.  Protect and enhance critical environmental and natural features as well as existing residential neighborhoods; 
5.  Develop light industrial, research, office and mixed use areas that are safe, comfortable and attractive to pedestrians; and allow a mixture of complimentary land uses that may include housing, retail, offices, commercial services, and civic uses to create economic vitality; 
6.  Provide flexibility in the siting and design of new developments and redevelopment to anticipate changes in the marketplace; 
7.  Reinforce streets as public places that encourage pedestrian and bicycle travel; 
8.  Encourage efficient land use by facilitating compact development and minimizing the amount of land that is needed for surface parking.

Sec. 2003. - Uses permitted under special conditions. 
In developing the Campus Business District, the township acknowledges that there are uses which may be ancillary to those businesses for which the district was created. These ancillary uses are intended to act in a support function to the office, light industrial, research, etc., uses within the district. Though these uses may be independent of a use permitted by "right," these general commercial types of uses are not the primary purpose of the district and are therefore restricted in terms of size, square footage and location. Because the uses are intended to function as support, the following special conditions apply: 
1.  Where Campus Business District support uses, are proposed, the following development limits apply: 
a.  Uses permitted under special conditions are not intended to be located along frontage of Tittabawassee Road, as that area is designated for more intensive uses identified in Section 2002.

--- (12) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 703, adopted Sept. 8, 2008, amended this Appendix by redesignating Ch. 21, §§ 21012105, as Ch. 21a, §§ 21a0121a05. 
Cross reference Businesses, ch. 18. 
 
Sec. 21a01. - Intent and purpose. 
This district is intended for intensive industrial uses but also permits light industrial, commercial establishments not engaged in retail sales, and service establishments which are of a type not generally requiring the customer to call at the place of business. The M-2 district is designed to permit the manufacturing, processing or assembling of semifinished or finished products from raw material as well as previously prepared material. It is also intended to prohibit residential uses and intensive retail enterprise as being incompatible with the primary industrial and related uses permitted. It is the purpose of these regulations to promote sound industrial areas within the community which are also protected from incompatible uses. 
(Ord. No. 703, 9-8-2008)  
Sec. 21a02. - Uses permitted by "right." 
The following are the principal permitted uses by "right" within an M-2 district: 
1.  Uses permitted by "right" within an M-1 district. 
2.  Heating and electric power generating plants. 
3.  Any manufacturing, processing, testing, assembling, storage, and distribution of materials, goods, foodstuffs and other semifinished or finished products from raw materials. 
(Ord. No. 703, 9-8-2008)  
Sec. 21a03. - Uses permitted under special conditions. 
The following uses of land and structures are permitted, subject to the conditions hereinafter imposed for each use: 
1.  Accessory uses that are clearly subordinate to the main use of the lot or building such as: 
a)  Uses which can meet the requirements as herein specified or as defined in chapter 2, section 202(1). 
b)  Restaurant or cafeteria facilities for employees. 
c)  Caretakers' residences if situated upon a portion of the lot complying with all the requirements of the R-1 residential districts. 
2.  Signs as provided in chapter 5. 
3.  Off-street parking and loading as required and allowed. 
4.  Communications towers (meeting requirements of section 2219). 
(Ord. No. 703, 9-8-2008) 
Editor's note Ord. No. 536 added as paragraph 4 "Communications towers. (Meeting requirements of § 2219)." Ord. No. 578 effectively superseded Ord. No. 536. While Ord. No. 578 did not repeal the amendment to § 2103 made by Ord. No. 536, as the obvious intent of Ord. No. 578 was to replace Ord. No. 536, the amendment made by Ord. No. 536 has been deleted.  
Sec. 21a04. - General use requirements. 
1.  Enclosed buildings. Activities in this district shall be carried on in completely enclosed buildings.

CHAPTER 22. - SPECIAL USESSPECIAL USE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS 
 
Sec. 2201. - Intent and purpose. 
It is the intent of this section to provide a set of procedures and standards for special uses of land or structure which, because of their unique characteristics, require special consideration in relation to the welfare of adjacent properties and the community as a whole. 
It is the express purpose of the regulations and standards herein to allow on one hand practical latitude for the investor or developer, but at the same time maintain adequate provisions for the protection of the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the community. The following, together with previous references in other chapters of this Ordinance, designate the requirements, procedures and standards which must be met before a special use permit can be issued. 
(Ord. No. 718, 1-24-2011)  
Sec. 2202. - Permit procedures. 
The application for a special use permit shall be submitted and processed under the following procedures: 
1.  Submission of application. An application shall be submitted through the zoning administrator on a special form for that purpose. Each application shall be accompanied by the payment of a fee as established by the local legislative body. In the event the allowance of a desired use requires both a rezoning and special use permit, both requests may be submitted jointly, subject to the following: 
a)  The ordinance procedures for each [request] shall be followed as specified. 
b)  All applicable standards and specifications required by the ordinance shall be observed. 
2.  Data required. 
a)  The special form shall be completed in full by the applicant including a statement by the applicant that section 2203 can be complied with. 
b)  Final approval of a site plan that conforms to the requirements of section 311. 
c)  Preliminary plans and specifications of the proposed development. 
3.  Planning commission review and hearing. 
a)  The planning commission shall publish notice and hold a public hearing as required for a special use review within 60 days of receiving a technically complete special use and site plan application, as required by chapter 3, site plan review requirements and procedures and chapter 22, special uses - special use permit requirements. 
b)  The planning commission will make its recommendation regarding the special use application at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the planning commission following the public hearing held to review the application, unless additional information is required from the applicant. If additional information is required, the planning commission will make its recommendation at the next regularly scheduled meeting after receipt of the requested additional information, provided the additional information is received no later than 15 days prior to the meeting. 
c)  The recommendation of the planning commission shall be forwarded to the township board within 60 days of the approval of the minutes of the meeting at which the planning commission issues its recommendation. The township board will consider the recommendation of the planning commission and render its decision to grant or deny a special use permit, or to grant approval with conditions, as stipulated by this Ordinance at this meeting, within 60 days of the receipt of the application recommendation from the planning commission, unless additional information is requested. If additional information is requested, the township board will make its decision at the next regularly scheduled township board meeting after receipt of the requested additional information, provided the additional information is received no later than 15 days prior to the meeting. 
d)  Failure of the township to act within the above-specified time limits shall not be deemed to constitute the grant of a special use permit. 
4.  Township board action. Upon receipt of the planning commission's recommendation, the township board shall consider the special use permit application within the time frame as stated in 3.c) above. The township board shall approve or disapprove the recommendation of the planning commission. Only upon approval by the township board may a special use permit be issued by the zoning administrator. 
5.  Expiration and extensions of special use permits. 
a)  Expiration: A special use permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall be valid for one year from the date of issuance of said permit. If construction or change in use has not commenced and proceeded meaningfully toward completion by the end of this one-year period, the zoning administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of the expiration of said permit, and no further notice or hearing shall be required. 
b)  Extensions: Upon written application prior to expiration, the township board may authorize an extension of the time limit of the site plan approval for a period not to exceed one year. The extension shall be based on evidence from the applicant that the development has a likelihood of commencing construction within the extension period. The township board may require compliance with any amendments to the zoning ordinance since the site plan was originally approved. 
6.  Suspension or revocation. 
a)  The township board shall have the authority to revoke any special use permit after it has been proved that the holder of the permit has failed to comply with any of the applicable requirements in chapter 22 or other applicable requirements or the standards as set forth in 6.b) or c) below. 
b)  The township board may suspend or revoke a special use permit if one or more of the following circumstances should be found to exist:

(Ord. No. 620, 7-16-2001)  
Sec. 2207. - Planned unit development. 
1.  Authorization. Rapid and intensive urbanization over the past decades has produced a need for an economical single-family living unit that is adaptable to urban densities, while retaining many of the attractive features of the suburban home. Among the housing concepts emerging to meet this need are townhouses, row houses, garden apartments, and similar types of housing units with common property areas, cluster types of subdivisions in which housing units are arranged in cluster forms with clusters separated from each other by common open space, and housing units developed with related recreational space, such as golf courses, swimming pools, private parks, community centers, and other recreational facilities. 
It is the purpose of this section to permit greater flexibility and encourage more imaginative design of large parcels in residential areas than is possible under conventional zoning regulations without sacrificing established values and rights to adequate light, air, noise, and privacy. Rather than having specific standards applied to a development, the process of negotiation will play a significant role. Negotiation will allow each project to be reviewed on its own merits and considered in terms of what the site can bear rather than in terms of what is allowable under conventional regulations. Criteria set forth within this section will allow a planned reduction of averaging of individual lot area requirements for each zone district, providing the overall density requirements for each district remains the same. Such averaging or reduction of lot area requirements shall only be permitted when a landowner, or groups of landowners acting jointly, can plan and develop a tract of land as an entity and thereby qualify for regulation of the tract of land as one complex land use unit rather than an aggregation of individual buildings located on separate unrelated lots. 
A planned unit development shall be designed to achieve compatibility with the surrounding area, to encourage economy and efficiency in proving public services and utilities, and to bolster the development of more useful open spaces. A premises basic to this Ordinance is to consider only developments that will result in lasting value and make a contribution to both social and economic stability in the township. Finally, because flexibility is inherent in the concept of a planned unit development, a higher degree of public direction and scrutiny is an essential part of this Ordinance. Under these conditions, a special use permit may be issued for the construction and occupancy of a planned unit development, providing the standards, procedures, and requirements set forth in this section can be complied with. 
2.  Objectives. The following objectives shall be considered in reviewing any application for a special use permit for planned unit development: 
a)  To provide a more desirable living environment by preserving the natural character of open fields, stands of trees, brooks, ponds, floodplains, hills, and similar natural assets. 
b)  To encourage the provision of open space and the development of recreational facilities in a generally central location and within reasonable distance of all living units. 
c)  To encourage developers to use a more creative and imaginative approach in the development of residential areas. 
d)  To provide for more efficient and aesthetic use of open areas by allowing the developer to reduce development costs through the bypassing of natural obstacles in the residential site. 
e)  To encourage variety in the physical development pattern in the community by providing a mixture of housing types. 
3.  Definitions. 
a)  Planned unit development. A residential development planned and developed as a unit under unified control according to comprehensive and detailed plans, including a program providing for the continual maintenance and operation of such improvements, facilities, and services which will be for the common use of the occupants of the planned unit development. 
b)  Common yard areas. The area in a condominium project of a planned unit development that is utilized as part of the required setbacks for structures, including the area between the front of the structure and the street. 
c)  Common open space. Lands that are required to be set aside as part of the lot averaging or reduction requirement of this section. These lands shall be under the common ownership of all residents in the planned unit development and are to be used for park, recreation or environmental amenity. Common space shall not include public or private streets, driveways, or parking areas. Within these lands only facilities and structures for recreational purposes may be constructed. The total impervious area of roofs and paving shall constitute not more than one percent of the total open space. 
d)  Attached single-family dwelling. A single-family dwelling unit attached to one or more other single-family dwelling units by means of a common party wall or by a connecting wall or similar architectural feature, such as a garage or carport, and with such dwelling having its own doors which open outdoors. 
e)  Detached single-family dwelling. A detached building containing only one dwelling unit. 
f)  Homeowners' association. An association of all owners of a project organized for the purpose of administering, managing and maintaining the common open space and common property and facilities. This association shall be described in all covenants, deeds, or other recorded legal documents which affect the title to any land within the development. 
4.  Uses that may be permitted. The following uses of land structures may be permitted within planned unit developments, subject to the district limitation as thereinafter listed: 
a)  Single-family (in R-1A district). 
b)  Two-family dwellings (in R-2, R-3, or R-4 districts). 
c)  Townhouses and other similar housing types which can be defined as a single-family dwelling unit with no side yard between adjacent units within a structure; and further, the attached dwelling units shall offer separate and individual family living units with no other family living unit above or below it (in R-1A, R-2, R-3, or R-4 districts); provided, that in R-1A zones the density shall not exceed three units per acre and that a contiguous group with a uniform building line shall not exceed 160 feet in length within R-1A or R-2 districts. Furthermore, said units shall not have their common walls overlap by more than 30 percent so as to effectuate an offset of each dwelling unit contained within a structure. 
d)  Garden apartments, which are multiple-family structures that provide separate and individual living units at more than one level or story within a common structure of up to 2½ stories, but not exceeding 35 feet in height (in R-3 or R-4 districts). 
e)  Recreation and open space (in R-1A, R-2, R-3 or R-4 districts); provided, that only the following land uses may be set aside as common land for open space or recreation use under the provision of this section: private recreational facilities, such as golf courses, swimming pools, or other recreational facilities which are limited to the use of the owners or occupants of the lots located within the planned unit development, historic building sites or historical sites, parks and parkway area, ornamental parks, extensive areas with tree cover, areas of rough terrain when such areas have natural features worthy of scenic preservation. 
f)  Customary accessory uses, as permitted in districts where located. 
g)  Planned neighborhood shopping centers (in an R-3 or R-4 district), provided all standards of section 2208 are met and provided planned unit development contains a minimum of 40 acres. 
5.  General development standards. Any application for a special use permit shall meet all of the following conditions in order to qualify for consideration as a planned unit development: 
a)  Minimum project area. The planned unit development site shall be not less then ten acres in area. 
b)  Common open space. Common open space shall be distributed more or less uniformly throughout the total site area. Wherever possible open space shall be encouraged to be set aside in large blocks of land. Deliberate efforts must be made to preserve important landscape features and amenities of long-term value and use these features as key components of design. Common yard areas shall not be utilized as common open space. 
c)  Unified control. All common lands within a proposed planned unit development shall be under the control of a single applicant, with that applicant being an individual, partnership, corporation, or group of individuals, partnerships or corporations. 
d)  Utilities. Planned unit developments shall provide for the underground installation of utilities, including, electricity and telephone. An application shall not be approved until assurance is given that public sanitary sewer and water service will be provided to the development. 
e)  Density computation. The lot area for planned unit developments within residential districts may be averaged or reduced from those sizes required by the applicable zoning district within which said development is located by compliance with the following procedures: 
1)  Site acreage computation. The gross acreage proposed for a planned unit development shall be computed to determine the total land area available for development into lots or dwelling units. 
2)  [Gross acreage figure.] In arriving at a gross acreage figure, the following lands shall not be considered as part of the gross acreage in computing the maximum number of lots and/or dwelling units that may be created under this procedure: 
a)  Lands utilized by public utilities as easements for major facilities, such as electric transmission lines, sewer lines, water mains, road easements, or other similar lands which are not available to the owner because of such easements. 
3)  Maximum number of lots and dwelling units. After the total gross area available for development has been determined by the above procedure, the maximum number of lots and/or dwelling units that may be approved within a planned unit development shall be computed by subtracting from the total gross area available a fixed percentage of said total for street right-of-way purposes and dividing the remaining net area available by the minimum lot area requirement of the zoning district in which the planned unit development is located. 
a)  The fixed percentages for street right-of-way purposes to be subtracted from the total gross area available for development shall be determined according to the following schedule: 
District Use 	Percent of Project Area 
R-1A, R-2 (single-family, detached) 	25 
R-3, R-4 (single-family detached townhouses, two-family, multifamily) 	20 
 
These percentages shall apply regardless of the amount of land actually required for street right-of-way. 
4)  Density bonus. Recognizing that good project planning, with provisions for adequate and developed open space and sound site design minimize the effects of crowding associated with higher densities, the developer at the time of submission of a request for issuance of a special use permit may also request a maximum of up to ten percent increase in permitted dwelling unit density as computed above. 
a)  Said request may be granted as a condition of special use permit, provided increased density does not result in creation of any of these conditions: 
1)  Inconvenience or unsafe access to the planned development. Traffic congestion in streets which adjoin the planned development. 
2)  An excessive burden on public services or utilities, including schools which serve the planned development. 
5)  [Density of project; how determined.] When more than one zoning district is involved in an application for a planned unit development, the density of the project will be based on the average of the zoning districts involved, weighted in direct proportion to the size of the property within the project in each zone. 
f)  Permissive minimum lot area. Notwithstanding other procedures set forth in this section, lot sizes within planned unit developments shall not be varied or reduced in area below the following minimum standards: 
1)  One-family detached dwelling structures: 8,250 square feet of lot area. 
2)  Two-family dwelling structures: 9,350 square feet of lot area. 
3)  Townhouses, row houses, or other similar permitted dwelling types: 4,000 square feet of lot area for the first dwelling unit in each structure plus 2,800 for each additional dwelling unit within a structure. 
4)  Garden apartment structures: 4,000 square feet of lot area for the first dwelling unit in each structure plus 2,250 square feet of lot area for each additional dwelling unit within the structure.

a)  Site perimeter. 
1)  Where a planned unit development abuts a residential or commercial zoning district, all structures shall be at least 30 feet from any perimeter boundary line, except that structures in excess of 40 feet in length shall be set back an additional foot for every five feet by which the building exceeds 40 feet. 
2)  Where a planned unit development abuts a residential zoning district, no intensive recreational building or facility shall be located within 50 feet of any perimeter boundary line. 
3)  Except for single-family detached dwelling units, where a planned unit development abuts a residential district, no parking area shall be within 40 feet of any perimeter boundary line. 
b)  Dimensional requirements. 
1)  Front yard. Sixty [feet] from the centerline of the road for dwellings. Front yard requirements may be varied by the planning commission after consideration of common greens or other common open space. In no case shall front yard setbacks be less than 50 feet from the center of the road.

Sec. 2208. - Planned neighborhood shopping centers. 
1.  Authorization. Continued urban expansion, combined with the ever increasing needs of neighborhood residents for services and goods which are conveniently located and attractive, together with the undesirable nature of strip commercial and scattering of commercial uses, require a provision for planned neighborhood shopping centers within developing areas. These centers are required to have some flexibility of location, yet their impact upon adjacent properties and public facilities must be controlled in the public interest. 
A planned neighborhood shopping center is intended to permit developments that will, over time, be enhanced by coordinated site planning and a mix of uses. Such developments are intended to provide a safe and efficient system for vehicular and pedestrian traffic, to enable economic design in the location and provision of public and private utilities, and to provide for controlled growth while minimizing the impacts of scattered and sometimes leap-frog development. 
The proposed neighborhood shopping centers are then developed with unified architecture and site design. This special land use is intended to allow for flexibility of overall development design with benefits from such design flexibility intended to be derived by both the developer and the community. 
It is the purpose of this section to provide for the potential of these shopping centers, without the necessity of indicating specific sites in advance. 
2.  Objectives. The following objectives shall be considered in reviewing any application for a special use permit for a planned neighborhood shopping center: 
a)  To promote a more completed urban design which includes necessary neighborhood services conveniently located and attractively designed. 
b)  To encourage developers to use creative and imaginative approaches in the development of neighborhoods. 
c)  To allow for appropriate commercial development in conjunction with a residential planned unit development. 
3.  Qualifying conditions. In applying for a special use permit as a planned neighborhood shopping center, applicants should keep in mind that the approval of the shopping center, in terms of layout, design, uses and all other related site improvements runs with the property itself and not the property owner. This means that any transfer of property will require the new owner or owner(s) to meet the provisions of the shopping center as approved by the township. Modifications or transfer must follow requirements as set forth in section 2208(7). 
To qualify for consideration as a planned neighborhood shopping center the following conditions shall be met: 
a)  The proposed center is designed and will be developed with a unified architectural treatment as provided for in section 2208(6). 
b)  If developed independently of a residential planned unit development, the center shall be on a site of no less than four acres and shall contain at least five individual uses. 
c)  To be eligible for consideration as part of a residential planned unit development, the planned unit residential development must be a minimum of 40 acres. 
d)  The center must have one property line on a street classified as a principle arterial as shown on the township's road designation map. Ingress and egress to the development shall be coordinated and approved by the planning commission. 
4.  Uses that may be permitted. The following uses of land and structures may be permitted within a planned neighborhood shopping center: 
a)  Retail food establishments, as permitted in B-3 districts.

Sec. 2212. - Automobile service station. 
1.  Authorization. Facilities to serve motor vehicles are of considerable importance within urbanizing areas where the basic mode of transportation is by private automobile. The continued growth of motor vehicle registrations and of total miles traveled annually has stimulated additional needs for retailing gasoline and associated products. To meet the demands of location and space for this type of retail facility requires careful planning to properly integrate the service station function into the pattern of other commercial and retail activities serving the community. Because such integration requires special considerations relating to location, site layout, storage facilities, traffic, safety, and compatibility with surrounding uses of land, this Ordinance requires conformance to the standards set for a gasoline service station a[nd] permitted use within cited commercial districts. 
2.  Objectives. It is the intent of this section to exercise a measure of control over service stations and permitted buildings and their sites and to establish a basic set of standards within which individual solutions may be developed to meet the retail service needs of motor vehicles. The objective of the regulations set forth in this section are to: 
a)  Promote the type of development which will be compatible with other land use activities located in areas where service stations will be constructed. 
b)  Control those aspects of service station design, site layout, and operation which may, unless regulated, be damaging to surrounding uses of land. 
c)  Minimize the traffic congestion and safety hazards which are inherent in service station activity. 
3.  Uses that may be permitted.

Sec. 2215. - Sexually oriented businesses. 
1.  Intent. It is recognized that there are some uses, which because of their very nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. These special regulations are itemized in this chapter. Prior to adopting these regulations, the township reviewed studies prepared on these uses, reviewed ordinances and regulations prepared by other municipalities, and reviewed applicable federal and state case law. Based on evidence of the adverse effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the township board, and on findings incorporated in the cases of Pap's AM v Township of Erie, 529 US 277 (2000); Deja Vu of Nashville v Metropolitan Government of Nashville & Davidson County, 466 G3d 391 (6th Cir 2006); Sensations, Inc. v Township of Grand Rapids, 2006 WL 2504388 (WD MI 2006); Van Buren Township v Garter Belt, 258 Mich App 594; 673 NW2d 111 (2003); Bronco's Entertainment v Charter Township of Van Buren, 421 F3d 440 (6th Cir 2005); Thomas v Chicago Park District, 122 S Ct 775 (2002); Township of Renton v Playtime Theatres Inc, 475 US 41 (1986); Young v American Mini Theatres, 426 US 50 (1976); Barnes v Glen Theatre Inc, 501 US 560 (1991); California v LaRue, 409 US 109 (1972); DLS Inc v Township of Chattanooga, 107 F3d 403 (6th Cir 1997); East Brooks Books Inc v Township of Memphis, 48 F3d 2200 (6th Cir 1995); Broadway Books v Roberts, 642 F Supp 4867 (ED Tenn 1986); Bright Lights Inc v Township of Newport, 830 F Supp 378 (ED Ky 1993); Richland Bookmart v Nichols, 137 F3d 435 (6th Cir 1998); Richland Bookmart v Nichols, 278 F3d 570 (6th Cir 2002); Déjà vu of Cincinnati v Union Township Board of Trustees, 411 F3d 777 (6th Cir 2005); Déjà vu of Nashville v Metropolitan Government of Nashville, 274 F3d 377 (6th Cir 2001); Bannon Corp v Township of Dayton, 7923 F2d 470 (6th Cir 1991); Threesome Entertainment v Strittmather, 4 F Supp 2d 710 (ND Ohio 1998); JL Spoons Inc v Township of Brunswick, 49 F Supp 2d 1032 (ND Ohio 1999); Triplett Grille Inc v Township of Akron, 40 F3d 129 (6th Cir 1994); Nightclubs Inc v Township of Paducah, 202 F3d 884 (6th Cir 2000); O'Connor v Township and County of Denver, 894 F2d 1210 (10th Cir 1990); Deja Vu of Nashville Inc et al v Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, 2001 USA App LEXIS 26007 (6th Cir Dec 6, 2001); ZJ Gifts D-2 LLC v Township of Aurora, 136 F3d 683 (10th Cir 1998); Connection Distribution Co v Reno, 154 F3d 281 (6th Cir 1998); Sundance Associates v Reno, 139 F3d 804 (10th Cir 1998); American Library Association v Reno, 33 F3d 78 (DC Cir 1994); American Target Advertising Inc v Giani, 199 F3d 1241 (10th Cir 2000); ZJ Gifts D-2LLC v Township of Aurora, 136 F3d 683 (10th Cir 1998); ILQ Investments Inc v Township of Rochester, 25 F3d 1413 (8th Cir 1994); Bigg Wolf Discount Video Movie Sales Inc v Montgomery County, 2002 US Dist LEXIS 1896 (D Md Feb 6 2002); Currence v Cincinnati, 2002 US App LEXIS 1258 (3rd Cir Jan 24, 2002); and other cases; and on testimony to Congress in 136 Cong Rec S 8987; 135 Cong Rec S 14519; 135 Cong Rec S 5636; 134 Cong Rec E 3750; and reports of secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona - 1979; Minneapolis, Minnesota - 1980; Houston, Texas - 1997; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California - 1991; Los Angeles, California - 1977; Whittier, California - 1978; Austin, Texas - 1986; Seattle, Washington - 1989; Oklahoma Township, Oklahoma - 1986; Cleveland, Ohio - and Dallas, Texas - 1997; St. Croix County, Wisconsin - 1993; Bellevue, Washington, - 1998; Newport News, Virginia - 1996; New York Times Square 1993; Bellevue, Washington, - 1998; Newport News, Virginia - 1996; New York Times Square study - 1994; Phoenix, Arizona - 1995-98; and also on findings from the paper entitled "Stripclubs According to Strippers: Exposing Workplace Sexual Violence, " by Kelly Holsopple, Program Director, Freedom and Justice Center for Prostitution Resources, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and from "Sexually Oriented Businesses: An Insider's View," by David Sherman, presented to the Michigan House committee on Ethics and Constitutional Law, Jan 12, 2000, and the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the township board finds that sexually oriented businesses as a category of establishments are correlated with harmful secondary effects, and that the foregoing reports are reasonably believed to be relevant to the problems that Saginaw Township is seeking to abate and prevent in the future. The primary control or regulation is for the purpose of preventing a concentration of these uses in any one area that would create such adverse effect(s). It is further the intent of these regulations that these uses only be permitted as special land uses. Uses (collectively "regulated uses") subject to these controls are as follows: 
2.  Definitions. Sexually oriented businesses, as defined in chapter 2 (definition section of the zoning ordinance), shall be subject to the regulations of this chapter.

The distance between any two sexually oriented businesses shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects from the site or property boundary in which each business is located. Access easements or portions of the parcel that are exclusively used to provide access to the site of the sexually oriented business shall be excluded from the parcel boundary in determining whether the site complies with the required separation. The intent of this exclusion is to allow sexually oriented businesses to comply with the separation requirement from major thoroughfares by means of an access easement or access strip of land from the site to the thoroughfare.

Sec. 2220. - Open space preservation developments. 
1)  Authorization. The purpose of this section is to provide open space preservation provisions for residential development as required by Public Act 177 of 2001. It grants developer's greater flexibility and efficiency in the design of single-family residential developments by allowing homes to be clustered on smaller lots and then surrounded permanently with preserved open space. The development community supports the concept because it reduces the cost of many infrastructure components including roads and public utilities. The environmental community supports the concept because it allows developers to avoid and preserve unique characteristics of a given parcel including small wetlands, tree lots and steep terrain. 
2)  Objectives. It is the intent of this section to encourage alternative subdivision designs which preserve Saginaw Charter Township's character and other important environmental elements, while providing neighborhoods that are desired by the community and the general public through permanent dedication of open space and a planned reduction of individual lot area requirements. 
a)  To promote the type of development that will compliment and enhance other land use activities located in the Agricultural and Low Density Residential Transitional areas of the township. 
b)  To encourage the use of open space provisions that will encourage developers to be creative and imaginative in the development of residential areas. 
c)  To utilize dedicated open space within a development as an amenity. 
d)  Maintain an image of open space within the township. 
3)  Definitions. 
a)  Common driveway. A driveway shared by two or more people and not considered to be road frontage. Frontage requirements can only be met by having frontage on a private or public road. 
b)  Cluster. A development design technique that concentrates buildings on a part of the site to allow the remaining land to be used for recreation, common open space, and preservation of environmentally sensitive features. 
c)  Cluster subdivision. A form of development that permits a reduction in lot area and bulk requirements, provided there is no increase in the number of lots permitted under a conventional subdivision or increase in the overall density of development, and the remaining land area is devoted to open space, active recreation, preservation of environmentally sensitive areas or agriculture. 
d)  Front-loaded garage. Accessed from the side facing the street or roadway. 
e)  Open space. Land within or related to a development that is set aside as common land for recreational, conservation and agricultural uses and preserved in an undeveloped state or in such fashion approved by the planning commission. Further subdivision of open space lands or their use for other than recreation, conservation or agriculture shall be prohibited.

For the purposes of this Ordinance, the zoning administrator shall have the power of the code enforcement officer and shall delegate the duties of such as needed. 
2.  Duties of zoning administrator. All applications for sign permits or certificates of occupancy shall be submitted to the zoning administrator who may issue certificates of occupancy or sign permits when all applicable provisions of this Ordinance have been met. The zoning administrator shall be empowered to make inspections of buildings or premises to carry out his duties in the enforcement of this Ordinance. 
Under no circumstances is the zoning administrator permitted to make changes in this Ordinance nor to vary the terms of this Ordinance in carrying out his duties. 
3.  Sign permit. Prior to the construction, erection or structural alteration of a sign, a permit shall be obtained from the zoning administrator. Application shall be on a standard prepared form obtained from the zoning administrator. 
4.  Certificate of occupancy. A certificate of occupancy shall be obtained from the zoning administrator for any of the following: 
a)  Occupancy and use of vacant land (including parking lot construction) or of a building hereafter erected or structurally altered. 
b)  Change in the use of land or building, except to another use which represents a continuation of a use under a previous certificate of occupancy. 
c)  Any change in use or enlargement of a nonconforming use or building. 
No such occupancy, use or change of use shall take place until a certificate of occupancy therefor shall have been issued by the zoning administrator. 
5.  Application for certificate of occupancy. 
a)  Application. In all cases where a building permit is required, written application for a certificate of occupancy shall be made coincident with the application for such building permit, and in all cases shall be made not less than ten days prior to the time when a new, changed, or enlarged use of a building or structure is intended to begin. 
b)  Information required. Application for certificate of occupancy shall be accompanied by a plat, in duplicate and drawn to scale, showing the exact dimensions of the premises to which the certificate of occupancy is to apply; the lines of all lots or parcels under separate ownership contained therein; the width and alignment of all abutting streets, alleys, easements of access and public open spaces; the size, position and height of all buildings or structures erected or altered thereon; and such other information as may be deemed necessary by the zoning administrator for the proper enforcement of this Ordinance. 
c)  Accessory buildings or structures. When erected at the same time as the principal building or structure on a lot shown on the application therefor, [accessory buildings or structures] shall not require a separate certificate of occupancy. 
d)  Record of applications. A record of all such applications for certificate of occupancy shall be kept on file by the zoning administrator. Whenever the buildings, structures, premises and uses thereof as set forth on the application are in conformity with the provisions of this code and other applicable regulations, it shall be the duty of the building inspector to issue any necessary building permit, and when such permit is denied, to state such refusal in writing, with cause. 
e)  Issuance of certificate of occupancy. After notification that the building, structure or premises, or part thereof, is ready for occupancy and inspection, the zoning administrator shall make final inspection thereof, and if all provisions of this code and other applicable regulations have been complied with, he shall issue a certificate of occupancy which shall show such compliance. When a certificate of occupancy is denied on the grounds of a zoning violation, such refusal shall be stated in writing with reasons for said denial.

e)  The probability of any significant negative environmental impacts which would result if the petitioned zoning change occurred and the resulting permitted structures were built. 
f)  The effect of approval of the petition on the condition of and/or value of property in the township or in adjacent civil divisions. 
g)  The effect of approval of the petition on adopted development policies of Saginaw Township and other government units. 
h)  Whether the proposed change is consistent with other zones, land uses and the trend of development in the area. 
i)  All findings of fact shall be made a part of the public records of the meetings of the planning commission and the township board. An amendment shall not be approved unless these and other identified facts are affirmatively resolved in terms of the general health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Saginaw Township or civil divisions where applicable. 
5.  Conditional rezoning request. Saginaw Charter Township will not require nor imply that conditional zoning or zoning agreements are a necessity or a condition for approval. 
a)  A request for conditional zoning or a zoning agreement shall be submitted, in writing, to the zoning administrator, chairman of the township planning commission and the township supervisor. The request shall be required prior to any application for rezoning or appearance before the planning commission. 
b)  Upon receipt of the request, the zoning administrator will prepare a memo to the planning commission and the township board detailing that a request has been received, from whom and the area proposed for rezoning. The applicant will receive a copy as well. The zoning administrator, the township supervisor and the chairman of the planning commission will arrange for an informal meeting with the developer to discuss the specific request or requests. 
c)  Informal review process. An informal meeting will be held with the zoning administrator, the township supervisor and chairman of the planning commission and the proposed developer or developers. During the meeting the developer should be prepared to provide the following information, in writing: 
i.  The zoning district desired. 
ii.  The specific use proposed. 
iii.  A conceptual layout. A full site plan is not needed at this time. 
iv.  Identification of particular items that might be necessary to mitigate the proposed rezoning and associated development. 
d)  From this informal meeting, the township will provide a follow-up letter to the developer and copied to the planning commission and township board which details the following: 
i.  The proposed use of the parcel and the desired zoning district. 
ii.  A discussion of all related zoning requirements included within the existing zoning ordinance. 
iii.  A discussion of potential items in addition to the typical zoning requirements, which may be necessary or desirable to mitigate the proposed rezoning, and associated development. 
iv.  A proposed timeline for the process, identifying key dates for submittal, public hearings and tentative approval. 
v.  An overview of the discussion, including any relative buffering or other such items which may be considered by the planning commission in terms of surrounding uses, intensity of surrounding uses and the purpose and intent of the zoning regulations and the adopted master plan and any other policy documents or guide so adopted by the township. 
e)  Formal review process. Using the proposed timeline as a guide, the developer or developers will submit all their required information, which for conditional zoning or zoning agreement shall be: 
i.  At a minimum, a site plan done to such a level of detail that assures the basic arrangement of any structures and connection to required utilities. 
ii.  An elevation of the proposed structure. 
iii.  The rezoning request must be submitted in accordance with the township's rezoning policy, which requires submission at least 30 days prior to the next regularly scheduled planning commission meeting. 
 It is important to note that these items will be made part of the approval of the rezoning. Failure to complete the project as approved by the township may result in a loss of the status of the conditional zoning. 
f)  All public notifications, reviews and hearings will be scheduled and advertised as set forth in the zoning ordinance and as typically practiced in the township for the rezoning of land. If the proposed use requires a special land use permit, the special land use permit and hearing may be conducted concurrently if the site plans and appropriate documentation are provided. 
g)  The township attorney will draft a zoning agreement for execution by the township and the developer. 
h)  Any and all conditions imposed as part of the conditional zoning or zoning agreement process must meet the following criteria: 
i.  Conditions such as building appearance, landscaping, setbacks in an amount more than what is required by the current zoning ordinance; screening or buffering in an amount more than what is required by the current zoning ordinance, etc., shall be directly related to the proposed project and serve to mitigate any potentially deleterious effects on surrounding properties or properties in general. 
ii.  Conditions serving as additional performance standards, including but not limited to lighting, noise, traffic, etc., shall be directly related to the proposed project and development and should serve to mitigate any potentially deleterious effects on surrounding properties, the road network, and the general area. 
iii.  Conditions limiting the specific use of the property are permitted, however, the planning commission and township board should be mindful of being too specific. For example, limiting a use to a "professional office" may prevent the parcel from being used for something similar in intensity, yet different, such as a day care center or commercial or private school. Care should be taken to be specific in terms of standards and intensity and more flexible in terms of naming specific uses. 
iv.  The planning commission will forward their recommendations to the township board for consideration. 
i)  If the planning commission recommends, and the township board approves a conditional zoning or zoning agreement request, the zoning designation will be noted on the zoning map as an overlay district and the zoning will be referenced as a footnote on the map itself. The footnote will refer to the actual zoning case, the zoning approval and specific conditions and the ordinance number. 
j)  Final zoning agreement. A zoning agreement shall be drafted by the township attorney and executed. The developer shall be responsible for all costs associated with the drafting and executing of the zoning agreement. 
i.  The developer, the chairman of the planning commission and the township clerk shall all sign the submitted documentation. A copy will be returned to the developer and the original shall stay with the township. 
ii.  A copy will be recorded at the Saginaw County Register of Deeds office. 
k)  Enforcement. By approving the conditional zoning or zoning agreement, the township grants rezoning and then, subsequently or concurrently, site plan approval. The specific conditions imposed and agreed to by the developer and the township become part of the approval. 
l)  Should the developer not meet the conditions as specified, they will be considered in violation of the Township Zoning Ordinance and will be pursued as such. 
m)  Any change to the conditions shall require a rezoning and shall follow the same procedure as identified in subsection 2303.5. 
n)  Should the developer not complete the proposed project within 18 months, the property shall revert to the previous zoning classification. 
o)  Should the developer abandon the specific use and it is vacant and/or abandoned for a period of 18 months, the parcel shall convert to its previous zoning classification. 
p)  A property that reverts from conditional zoning will be considered a legal nonconforming use and subject to all applicable zoning regulations. Reversion of the subject property shall require: 
i.  The original developer, the current property owner (if different) and the occupant(s) of the property shall be notified of the pending reversion by certified mail. The township board and planning commission shall receive the same notice. The notice will provide a 30-day period for which the developer/owner can seek an extension of the time frame or begin construction. 
ii.  If, after the 30 day time frame, no action or formal request has been made, the property in question and so legally described and noted, will be published as a rezoning. The same notice and publication requirements followed for a typical rezoning process shall be followed. The notice will include a time and date for a public hearing at which comments related to the reversion will be held.

Sec. 2304. - Board of appeals. 
1.  Creation and membership. 
a)  Establishment. The township board, upon exercising the authority of Public Act No. 184 of 1943 (MCL 125.271 et seq.), provides that a township board of appeals be established. 
b)  Membership, terms of office. The township board of appeals shall consist of five members. The first member of the board of appeals shall be a member of the township planning commission. The remaining members of the board of appeals shall be selected from the electors of the township. The members selected shall be representative of the population distribution and of the various interests present in the township. One member may be a member of the township board. An elected officer of the township shall not serve as chairman of the board of appeals. An employee or contractor of the township board may not serve as a member or an employee of the township board of appeals. The township board may appoint not more than two alternate members for the same term as regular members to the zoning board of appeals. An alternate member may be called as specified to serve as a member of the zoning board of appeals in the absence of a regular member if the regular member will be unable to attend one or more meetings. An alternate member may also be called to serve as a member for the purpose of reaching a decision on a case in which the member has abstained for reasons of conflict of interest. The alternate member appointed shall serve in the case until a final decision is made. The alternate member has the same voting rights as a regular member of the zoning board of appeals. A member of the zoning board of appeals may be removed by the township board for misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office upon written charges and after public hearing. A member shall disqualify himself or herself from a vote in which the member has a conflict of interest. Failure of a member to disqualify himself or herself from a vote in which the member has a conflict of interest constitutes malfeasance in office. The term of office for members appointed to the zoning board of appeals shall be for three years, except for members serving because of their membership on the planning commission or legislative body, whose terms shall be limited to the time they are members of those bodies. The term of each member shall be for three years, except that of the members first appointed two shall serve for two years and the remaining members for the three years. A successor shall be appointed not more than one month after the term of the preceding member has expired. All vacancies for unexpired terms shall be filled for the remainder of the term. A township board of appeals shall not conduct business unless a majority of the members of the board are present. 
2.  Organization and procedures. 
a)  Rules of procedure. The board of appeals shall adopt its own rules of procedure as may be necessary to conduct its meetings and carry out its function. The board shall choose its chairman and, in his absence, an acting chairman. 
b)  Meetings. Meetings shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such times as the board of appeals may determine. All meetings by the board shall be open to the public. The board may declare any meetings, or part of any meeting, a study meeting to pursue matters of business without comment or interruption from the public in attendance. 
c)  Records. Minutes shall be recorded of all proceedings which shall contain evidence and date relevant to every case considered, together with the votes of the members and the final disposition of each case. Such minutes shall be filed in the office of the township clerk and shall be made available to the general public. 
d)  Counsel. The township attorney shall act as legal counsel for the board and shall be present at all meetings upon request by the board. 
3.  Appeals to the appeals board. 
A.  A demand for a zoning appeal is received by the zoning administrator. Appeals can be filed by: 
(1)  A person aggrieved; or 
(2)  An officer, department, board, or bureau of the state or local unit of government. 
B.  The appeals board shall have the authority to hear appeals concerning: 
(1)  All questions that arise in the administration of the zoning ordinance, including interpretation of the zoning map. 
(2)  All administrative orders, requirements, decisions or determinations made by an administrative official or body charged with enforcement of the zoning ordinance. 
(3)  All decisions of the zoning administrator. 
(4)  All decisions concerning site plan review. 
C.  A fee as established by the legislative body shall be paid to the zoning administrator at the time of filing application with the board. The purpose of such fee is to cover in part the necessary advertisements, investigations and other expenses incurred by the board in connection with the appeal. 
D.  Upon receipt of a demand for appeal, the zoning administrator will review the demand for appeal to insure it is complete and the fee is paid. 
(1)  If the application is not complete, the zoning administrator will return the application to the applicant with a letter that specifies the additional material required. 
(2)  If the application is complete, the zoning administrator shall establish a date to hold a hearing on the appeal. 
E.  The appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed, unless the body or officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the zoning board of appeals that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in the opinion of the body or officer cause imminent peril of life or property, in which case proceedings may be stayed by a restraining order issued by the zoning board of appeals or a circuit court. 
F.  The notices shall be given in accordance with section 2305 of this Ordinance. 
G.  The appeals board shall hold a hearing on the demand for appeal. 
(1)  Representation at hearing. Upon the hearing, any party or parties may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. 
(2)  Standards for variance decisions by the appeals board. The appeals board shall base its decision on variances from the strict requirements of this Ordinance so that the spirit of the ordinance is observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice done based on the following standards: 
a.  For dimensional variances. A dimensional variance may be granted by the zoning board of appeals only in cases where the applicant demonstrates in the official record of the public hearing that a practical difficulty exists by showing all of the following: 
(i)  That the need for the requested variance is due to unique circumstances or physical conditions of the property involved, such as narrowness, shallowness, shape, water, or topography and is not due to the applicant's personal or economic difficulty. 
(ii)  That the need for the requested variance is not the result of actions of the property owners or previous property owners (self-created). 
(iii)  That strict compliance with regulations governing area, setback, frontage, height, bulk, density or other dimensional requirements will unreasonably prevent the property owner from using the property for a permitted purpose, or will render conformity with those regulations unnecessarily burdensome. 
(iv)  That the requested variance is the minimum variance necessary to do substantial justice to the applicant as well as to other property owners in the district. 
(v)  That the requested variance will not cause an adverse impact on surrounding property, property values, or the use and enjoyment of property in the neighborhood or zoning district. 
H.  If the demand for appeal is for a variance the appeals board shall either grant, grant with conditions, or deny the application. The appeals board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit. A majority vote of the membership of the appeals board is necessary to grant a dimensional variance and rule on an interpretation of the ordinance. The decision shall be in writing and reflect the reasons for the decision. 
(1)  At a minimum, the record of the decision shall include: 
a.  Formal determination of the facts; 
b.  The conclusions derived from the facts (reasons for the decision); 
c.  The decision. 
(2)  After the zoning board of appeals approves the minutes of its decision or otherwise certifies its decision in writing, it shall be copied and delivered by first class mail to the person demanding the appeal, the administrator, and other parties. 
I.  Any person having an interest affected by such decision shall have a right to appeal to circuit court within 30 days of the certified decision of the appeals board, as provided by law.

[CHAPTER 24. - ACCESS CONTROL] 
 
Sec. 2401. - Arterial street access driveway regulations. 
1.  Intent and purpose. This article is intended to recognize the unique and disparate functions of major and minor arterials which include long-distance traffic movement as well as land access to individual traffic generators. It is the purpose of this article to serve the public interest by minimizing operational difficulties caused by these generally incompatible traffic functions. 
The regulations of this article strive to promote the efficient use of public thoroughfares, protect the public investment in long-distance traffic-carrying facilities, diminish hazardous traffic conditions, minimize accidents and property damage, and avoid future degradation of arterial street traffic capacity. Simultaneously, the regulations strive to protect the right of abutting land owners to reasonable access. 
These regulations are in effect in all communities that abut the Tittabawassee Road Corridor, as defined in section 2. The presence of this language in each municipality's zoning ordinance is intended to promote the consistent and continued intent and purpose of this Ordinance. 
2.  Applicability. The regulations set forth in this article will apply to the Tittabawassee Road Corridor from M-47 (Midland Road) to the Saginaw River and as designated on the official municipal zoning map. These regulations shall apply as an overlay district to the General Ordinance, as shown on the official Saginaw Charter Township Zoning Map. 
These regulations will only apply when the average daily bi-directional traffic volumes on Tittabawassee Road, for one-half mile east or west of the proposed access point, exceed 13,000 vehicles. In addition, these regulations will apply if traffic development is expected to cause the average daily bi-directional traffic volume to exceed 13,000 vehicles for one-half mile east or west of the proposed access point. 
As an overlay zone, these regulations will apply in addition to those regulations presently in force. Where there are actual or implied conflicts between regulations in the overlay zone and the base zoning district, the Tittabawassee Road Corridor Overlay Zone regulations shall apply. Construction or any alteration of a direct access driveway, except resurfacing, along any public street, road or highway within the overlay zone shall require issuance of an access permit from the planning commission and the Saginaw County Road Commission. 
The Saginaw County Road Commission will count and determine the average daily traffic count on Tittabawassee Road for purposes of this Ordinance. 
3.  Description of access control overlay zone. The overlay zone in Saginaw Township will be along the frontage of Tittabawassee Road from I-675 to M-47 (Midland Road) for a depth of 600 feet as measured from the proposed right-of-way line for Tittabawassee Road. Intersecting road frontages will also be included in the overlay zone for a distance of 600 feet. The overlay zone is shown on the Saginaw Charter Township Zoning Map. 
4.  Performance standards. It shall be unlawful to construct or utilize any direct access driveway which does not meet the following criteria: 
a)  Any driveway design utilized must allow an entering vehicle turning speed of 15 miles per hour to help reduce interference with through street traffic. 
b)  Driveway design and placement must be in harmony with internal circulation and parking design such that the entrance can absorb the maximum rate of inbound traffic during a normal weekday peak traffic period as determined by a traffic survey method approved by the planning commission. 
c)  There must be sufficient on-site storage to accommodate at least five queued vehicles waiting to park or exit without utilizing any portion of the paved street or in any other way interfering with street traffic. 
d)  Provisions for circulation between adjacent parcels should be provided through coordinated or joint parking systems, service drives, or other methods determined at the time of site plan review. 
e)  Driveway entrances must be able to accommodate all vehicle types having occasion to enter the site, including delivery vehicles, without inhibiting other vehicles either on the road or those entering or exiting the site. 
f)  Driveway placement should be such that loading and unloading activities will in no way hinder vehicle ingress or egress. 
g)  Direct access driveway placement must be such that an exiting vehicle has an unobstructed sight distance from the stop bar, according to the following schedule: 
Road Design Speed 
(mph) 	Site Distance 
(Feet) 
30 	220 
35 	225 
40 	275 
45 	325 
50 	350 
 
h)  Driveway design must be such that an entering vehicle will not encroach upon the exit lane of a two-way driveway. In addition, an exiting vehicle turning right must be able to enter traffic utilizing only the first through traffic lane available without encroachment into the adjacent through lane. 
5.  Permit application. All applications for driveway approach permits shall be made on a form prescribed by and available at Saginaw Township and the Saginaw County Road Commission. 
a)  Permit applications shall be accompanied by clear, scaled drawings (minimum of 1? = 20) in triplicate showing the following items: 
i)  Location and size of all structures proposed on the site. 
ii)  Size and arrangement of parking stalls on aisles. 
iii)  Proposed plan of routing motor vehicles entering and leaving the site. 
iv)  Property lines. 
v)  Right-of-way lines (existing and proposed, if different) 
vi)  Intersecting roads, streets, and driveways within 300 feet either side of the property on both sides of the corridor. 
vii)  Width of right-of-way. 
viii)  Width of road surface. 
xi)[ix)]  Type of surface and dimensions of driveways. 
x)  Proposed turning radii. 
xi)  Proposed treatment of right-of-way adjacent to driveway(s) and between the right-of-way line and property line. Show all proposed landscaping, signs, aboveground utilities, etc. 
xii)  Traffic analysis and trip generation survey results and methodology obtained from a licensed engineer if determined necessary by the planning director. 
xiii)  Design dimensions and justification for any alternative or innovative access design. 
xiv)  Dumpster location. 
xv)  Adjacent parcel information, such as, but not limited to, parking lots, buildings, structures, mutual drives, etc. 
6.  Permit review process. 
a)  Application for an access permit may be obtained from Saginaw Township. 
b)  The completed application must be received by the Saginaw Township Zoning Administrator at least 14 days prior to the planning commission meeting where the permit will be reviewed. 
c)  The applicant, the Saginaw County Road Commission and the zoning administrator may meet prior to the planning commission meeting to review the application and proposed access design. 
d)  The planning commission shall review and recommend approval, or denial, or request additional information prior to forwarding the access application to the Saginaw County Road Commission for their review. 
e)  The Saginaw County Road Commission shall review the access permit application and conclusions of the planning commission. One of three actions may result: 
i)  If the planning commission and the road commission approve the application as submitted, the access permit shall be granted. 
ii)  If both the planning commission and the road commission deny the application, the permit shall not be granted. 
iii)  If either the planning commission or road commission requests additional information, approve with conditions, or do not concur in approval or denial, there shall be a joint meeting of the administrative staff of the Saginaw County Road Commission, Saginaw Township Planning Commission and the applicant. The purpose of this meeting will be to review the application to obtain concurrence between the planning commission and the road commission regarding approval or denial. 
No application will be considered approved, nor will any permit be considered valid unless both above-mentioned agencies have indicated approval. 
f)  The zoning administrator shall keep a record of each application for an access permit which has been submitted, including the disposition of each one. This record shall be a public record. 
g)  An access permit remains valid for a period of one year from the date it was issued. If the permit holder fails to begin earnest construction authorized by the access permit by the end of one year, the permit is automatically null and void. Any additional rights which have been granted by the planning commission or the zoning board of appeals, such as special use permits or variances, expire together with the access permit. 
Any performance guarantee shall be refunded to the permit holder unless the failure to initiate activity has resulted in costs to Saginaw Township or the road commission. If any amount of the guarantee remains after said costs are satisfied, the balance of the guarantee shall be released and returned to the permit holder. 
h)  The permit may be extended for a period not to exceed one year. The extension must be required in writing by the permit holder before the expiration of the initial permit period. Administrative staff of Saginaw Township may approve a permit extension, provided there are no existing or planned deviations from the original access permit site or other sites within 300 feet, and there are no violations of applicable ordinances. If there is any deviation or cause for question, the administrative staff of the municipality shall consult a representative of the Saginaw County Road Commission for input. 
i)  Reissuance of an access permit which has expired requires a new access application form to be filled out and processed independently of previous action. 
j)  The permittee shall assume all responsibility for all maintenance of such driveway approaches from the right-of-way line to the paved edge of the traveled roadway. 
k)  Where a permit has been granted for entrances to a parking facility, said facility shall not be altered or the plan of operation changed until a revised plan has been submitted and approved as specified in this section. 
l)  Application for a permit to construct or reconstruct any driveway entrance and approach to a site shall also cover the reconstruction or closing of all nonconforming or unused entrances and approaches to the same site at the expense of the property owner. 
m)  When a building permit is sought for the reconstruction or remodeling of an existing site or a zoning or occupancy certificate is sought for use or change of use for any land, buildings, or structures, all of the existing as well as proposed driveway approaches and parking facilities shall comply or be made to comply with all design standards as set forth in this Ordinance prior to the issuance of a zoning or occupancy certificate. 
n)  Saginaw Township and the Saginaw County Road Commission acting jointly may require a performance bond or cash deposit in any sum not to exceed $5,000.00 for each such approach or entrance to insure compliance with all of the terms of the permit. Such bond shall terminate and the deposit be returned to the permittee when the terms of the permit have been met or when the permit is canceled or terminated. 
7.  Driveway spacing. Driveway spacing will be determined as a function of arterial road operating speeds. Spacing will be determined according to the following schedule: 
Driveway Spacing* 
Table 1 
Posted Road Speed 
(mph) 	Minimum Spacing 
(feet) 
25 	105 
30 	125 
35 	150 
40 	185 
45 	230 
50 	275 
 
*(Standards are derived from the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials, Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, Table of Stopping Sight Distance.) 
These spacings are based on average vehicle acceleration and deceleration rates and are considered necessary to maintain safe stopping distances and traffic operation. Spacing will be measured from the midpoint of each driveway. In the event that a particular parcel or parcels lack sufficient arterial frontage to maintain adequate spacing, the landowner(s) have the following options: 
a)  The adjacent landowners may agree to establish a common driveway in compliance with the regulations stated herein. The driveway must meet standard specifications, and the estimated driveway volume will be the sum of the trip generation rate of all land uses in question. A joint easement agreement among all properties involved must be entered into prior to an access permit being granted. 
b)  If a common driveway cannot be established, for reasons beyond the property owners' (both the proponent and adjacent landowner's) control, the proponent can seek a variance from the zoning board of appeals from minimum spacing, but in no case should the variance be greater than the next lowest classification on Table 4. For example, on a 40 mile per hour arterial requiring a 185-foot spacing, the distance may be reduced to no less than 150 feet, which is the standard for a 35 mile per hour facility. 
8.  Number of driveways per parcel. 
a)  A maximum of one driveway opening may be permitted to a particular site from Tittabawassee Road and one abutting street. Wherever feasible, access must be obtained from an abutting street. 
b)  When, in the opinion of the Saginaw Township or the road authority's traffic engineer, and in the views of the permittee, it is in the interest of good traffic operation, the board may permit one additional driveway entrance along a continuous site frontage in excess of 300 feet or two additional driveway entrances along a continuous site frontage in excess of 600 feet. 
c)  Where a dual service driveway, as depicted in Figure 5, is used, it will be considered, for purposes of this section, to be only one direct access driveway. 
d)  In the case of dual one-way driveways, one pair may be used per 250 feet of frontage. Only one pair of one-way drives may be used per street frontage. 
9.  Design criteria. The design features described and illustrated in this section shall be used by the applicant in dimensioning a proposed driveway or driveway system or plans accompanying the driveway permit application. Figure 1 depicts the standard minimum driveway design. Every driveway constructed along and within a public right-of-way must at least meet the listed design criteria. 
a)  [Driveway traffic volumes in excess of 750/vehicles per day.] If projected driveway traffic volumes exceed 750/vehicles per day for all traffic using the driveway, a departure from the standard design may be required. Saginaw Township, in conjunction with the Saginaw County Road Commission, may specify a driveway system which will accommodate vehicle movements normally expected without creating undue congestion or hazard on the road. 
The applicant may also request a particular alternative design as part of the site plan accompanying the driveway application permit. 
i)  The following figures (1 through 8) and tables (2 through 5) depict driveway standards and reasonable working ranges for each standard. 
This standard shall be used unless the zoning administrator, in consultation with the Saginaw County Road Commission, determines that another dimension within the range is more suitable for a particular site or special condition and is approved by the appropriate road authority and municipality.

(See Table 2)  
Standard two-way driveways permitted by right 
b)  [Right-turn lanes and tapers.] Right-turn lanes and tapers will be required when: 
i)  Expected right-turn ingress movements meet or exceed 50/hour during a typical weekday peak traffic period. 
ii)  When driveway volumes are expected to meet or exceed 1,000 vehicles per day. 
iii)  When the Saginaw County Road Commission or Saginaw Township Engineer can document, through traffic analysis, that such treatment is necessary to avoid congestion and/or unsafe conditions on the public thoroughfare. 
c)  [Center left-turn lanes with tapers.] Center left-turn lanes in conjunction with tapers will be required when: 
i)  Existing traffic volume or traffic generated by any new development or change to an existing development causes any bi-directional hourly volume to exceed 825 vehicles for one-half mile east or west of the proposed access point. The required storage length for left-turn lanes shall be according to the Federal Highway Administration's standards for left turn storage lanes, available in the Saginaw County Planning Office. 
A right-turn lane shall be preceded by a taper. The design feature dimensions of a right-turn lane and taper shall conform to those given in Figure 2 and Table 2.

* If a right-turn lane is used, the entering or existing taper standard shall be 50 feet. Without a right-turn lane, the entering or existing taper standard shall be 150 feet. 
This standard shall be used unless the zoning administrator in consultation with the traffic engineer determines that another dimension within the range is suitable for a particular site or special condition. 
d)  Driveway profile. Driveway profiles shall be determined using the following criteria: 
i)  The grade of a two-way, one-way or divided commercial driveway shall not exceed 1.5 percent for a minimum distance of 25 feet from the edge of the pavement. Beyond this distance the grade shall not exceed five percent. 
ii)  If the road is curbed and if the sidewalk is ten feet or less from the edge of the pavement, the grade of a driveway shall be the grade required to meet the sidewalk elevation. If that grade would exceed the maximums specified in paragraph 1) above, the sidewalk shall be either tilted or inclined. 
iii)  If the road is uncurbed, the grade of the driveway between the road edge of pavement and the edge of the shoulder shall conform to the slope of the shoulder to the edge of the driveway approach. From that point the dimensions specified in section 2) will apply. 
iv)  For a driveway on an upgrade towards the road, a grade of 1.5 percent for a distance of 100 feet from the edge of the pavement is required. Beyond this distance, the grade shall not exceed four percent and the difference in grades where there is a change of grade shall not exceed three percent. 
v)  Vertical curves with a minimum length of 15 feet shall be provided at a change of grade of four percent or more. 
vi)  If the sidewalk elevation has to be adjusted to meet the driveway, the sidewalk shall be inclined at a rate not to exceed one foot vertical for every 24 feet horizontal. 
e)  Drainage. 
i)  A driveway shall be constructed so that it does not adversely affect the road drainage. The drainage and the stability of the road subgrade shall not be altered by driveway construction or roadside development. 
ii)  Drainage from adjacent parking or storage areas on private property in excess of existing drainage shall not be discharged into the road drainage system.

Standard Profile Design  
Standard profile design 
f)  Surfacing and curbing along curbed roads. A driveway shall be paved and curbed from the paved road edge to the proposed right-of-way line (section 303(2), as determined by the engineer. 
g)  Surfacing and curbing along uncurbed roads. A driveway shall be paved and curbed from the paved road surface to the proposed right-of-way line (section 303(2)) or to the point of curvature between the driveway edge and the larger radius, point (b) in Figure 2. The curb ending adjacent to the driveway shall be located at least 13.5 feet from the parallel to the edge of the pavement. 
h)  Surface materials and thickness. The surface of a paved driveway, excluding right-turn lanes, shall be concrete, bituminous or equivalent surfacing material. The thickness of the surface and the base to be used shall be sufficient to provide the bearing capacity needed to carry the proposed traffic loads. A 2½-inch, 250 pound per square yard bituminous mix on eight inches of compacted gravel, eight inches of nonreinforced concrete or equivalent surfacing material which meets current MDOT Standard Specifications for construction is acceptable for normal driveway traffic loads over stable soil. These specifications are minimum requirements and apply to the driveway only. 
i)  Surfacing of right-turn lanes and tapers. 
i)  The pavement of a right-turn lane and accompanying tapers shall match the road pavement, unless the road commission and Saginaw Township both permit the use of an equivalent pavement. 
ii)  The cross slope of a right-turn lane and tapers shall be: 
a)  A continuation of the cross slope of the roadway if the road is curbed. 
b)  Equal to the shoulder slope if the road is uncurbed. 
j)  Shoulders. 
i)  The surface of the shoulder adjacent to a right-turn lane and tapers shall be of the same material as the shoulder and conform to the material as the shoulder and conform to the current Michigan Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Roadway Construction. 
ii)  If the distance between two paved commercial driveways serving the same property is less than 100 feet, measured between adjacent ends of the nearest curbed radii, the applicant shall pave the shoulder between the driveways. 
k)  Driveway curb detail. The driveway curb shall either match the existing curb or shall conform to the current standards for curb and gutter as determined by the township and road commission. 
10.  Corner clearance. Intersecting streets and direct access driveways shall be spaced according to the same regulations for distances between direct access driveways, as listed in section 3, with the exception of the following: direct access driveways must be at least 400 feet from the intersections of M-84 (Bay Road), North Center Road, and Mackinaw Road. 
11.  Consistency with comprehensive plan. In some cases, on a particularly congested arterial, the Saginaw Township Planning Commission may call for specific innovative treatment of access control. Examples may include service drives, continuous right-turn lanes, access off and collector streets, commercial parks, and combined, coordinated parking/access systems. In such cases, any innovative design meeting the spirit and intent of these regulations, and performance standards, may be considered through site plan review. 
12.  Temporary driveway permits. Temporary driveway permits are intended to allow existing driveways and new driveways, necessary to access sites remote from adjacent access, to remain in use until such time as the conditions specified on the permit are met. 
a)  A temporary permit may be granted for: 
i)  Existing driveways that access existing development or are necessary to service farm fields and are only used for that purpose. Existing driveways are legal nonconforming driveways and may exist without a temporary permit under the conditions specified in subsection 13, nonconforming driveways. 
ii)  New driveways necessary to access new development where the new development is remote from adjacent drives that shared access is not feasible at the time of development. 
b)  Conditions upon which the temporary permit will expire may include: 
i)  Adjacent development within 15 feet of the site where the temporary driveway is located is planned. At this time, joint access provisions with the adjacent property owner must take place. 
ii)  The use of the site for which the temporary permit was granted has ceased for six months or more or the use of the site or the driveway has changed such that the use of the driveway is increased to any degree. 
13.  Nonconforming driveways. 
a)  Driveways that do not conform to the regulations in this Ordinance and were constructed before the adoption of this Ordinance shall be considered legal nonconforming driveways. 
Existing driveways granted a temporary permit are legal nonconforming driveways until such time as the temporary permit expires. 
b)  Loss of legal nonconforming status results when a nonconforming driveway ceases to be used for its intended purpose, as shown on the approved site plan, for a period of six months or more. Any reuse of the driveway may only take place after the driveway conforms to all aspects of this Ordinance. 
c)  Legal nonconforming driveways may remain in use until such time as the use of the driveway or property is changed or expanded in such a way that it impacts the use of the driveway. At that time, the driveway must be made to conform with all aspects of this Ordinance. 
d)  Driveways that do not conform to the regulations in this Ordinance and have been constructed after adoption of this Ordinance shall be considered illegal nonconforming driveways. 
e)  Illegal nonconformities must be cited as violations of this Ordinance, made to cease use of the driveway, and correct any nonconforming aspects of the driveway. Driveways constructed in illegal locations must be closed and all evidence of the driveway removed from the right-of-way and site on which it is located. 
f)  Nothing in this Ordinance shall prohibit the repair, improvement, or modernization of lawful nonconforming driveways. 
14.  Variances for driveway designs. The applicant may apply for a variance from the standard driveway designs, under the following conditions: 
a)  When driveway volumes are expected to meet or exceed 1,000 vehicles per day. 
b)  When expected turning ingress or egress movements meet or exceed 50 per hour during a typical weekday peak traffic period as determined by a traffic study or generally accepted trip generation table, approved by the planning commission, such as the Institute of Transpiration Engineers Trip General Manual. 
c)  When in the judgment of the Saginaw County Road Commission or municipal traffic engineer, specific site conditions require alternative design treatments to provide for safe and efficient driveway operation. 
d)  When a joint or coordinated access-parking system is being used. When two adjacent property owners agree to combine access points, the municipality may grant an incentive bonus. The total road frontage normally required will each be reduced by ten percent for both landowners. (Site circulation and safety standards will still be enforced.) 
e)  When a permittee seeks a variance for an innovative method for access design or operations. 
Variances should be granted only where practical difficulties require an innovative access design or dimensional change that is consistent with the intent of this Ordinance. Variances may not be granted for financial hardship or in any instance where the intent of this Ordinance can be met by abiding by the standards in this document. 
The Saginaw Township Board of Appeals and one representative of the Saginaw County Road Commission shall hear and decide all requests for a variance, interpretation or administrative review of access control regulations.

[CHAPTER 25. - ACCESS MANAGEMENT AND OVERLAY] 
 
Sec. 2501. - M-84 and M-58 access management and overlay. 
1.  Purpose, intent and application. The provisions of this Ordinance are intended to: 
a)  Promote safe and efficient travel within the M-84 overlay district. 
b)  Minimize disruptive and potentially hazardous traffic conflicts. 
c)  Ensure safe access by emergency vehicles. 
d)  Protect the substantial public investment in the road system by preserving capacity and avoiding the need for unnecessary and costly reconstruction which disrupts business and traffic flow. 
e)  Separate traffic conflict areas by reducing the number of driveways. 
f)  Provide safe spacing standards between driveways and between driveways and intersections. 
g)  Provide for shared access between abutting properties. 
h)  Implement the M-84 and M-58 corridor access management plans and map recommendations. 
i)  Ensure reasonable access to properties, though not always by the most direct access. 
j)  Coordinate access decisions with the Michigan Department of Transportation and/or the Bay and Saginaw County Road Commission, as applicable. 
2.  Description of applicability. The provisions of this Ordinance apply to an area described as 660 feet east and west of the center line of M-84 between Weiss Street and 660 feet north and south of the center line of M-58 between M-47 and Passolt Road, in Saginaw Township, Saginaw County and M-13/Euclid Avenue in Monitor Township, Bay County. Single-family residential driveways are exempt from this Ordinance. 
In instances where this Ordinance conflicts with the Tittabawassee Road Corridor Overlay Ordinance, the Tittabawassee Overlay Ordinance and any subsequent amendments shall take precedence. 
Any development within the area described in this section that also requires a site plan review at the municipal level will be required to comply with the provisions of this Ordinance. In instances where the site plan review procedure or site plan review standards conflict with the local procedures or standards, this Ordinance shall prevail. Aspects of the site plan that are not addressed in this Ordinance shall be governed by the municipality's Ordinance where applicable. 
3.  M-84 access management plan map and M-58 access management plan map. The M-84 and M-58 access management plan maps identify six and seven types of modifications, respectively, that will further the intent of this Ordinance. These modifications are listed both by number and color. Application of the regulations in this Ordinance are intended to achieve the mapped modifications at such time that a site is developed for the first time, redeveloped to the extent that a site plan is required, the owner chooses to make the modifications indicated, or the township causes the modification to take place to achieve necessary safety improvements. Driveways shown on the map without any modifications planned are permitted to exist as they are constructed and located. 
The modifications listed are: 
M-84 	M-58 
a) Entrance closed 	a) Close drive 
b) New entrance 	b) Modify drive 
c) Modify 	c) New drive 
d) Move entrance 	d) Combine existing drives with new drive 
e) Add curb/define entry 	e) Add curb and develop new cross access 
f) Future non-motorized facility 	f) Cross drive when rear access is placed 
g) Restrict access according to ordinance. 	
 
4.  Permanent access for undeveloped parcels or existing developments. 
a)  Each parcel or lot having a single property tax number, as of the effective date of this Ordinance (hereafter referred to as "the parent parcel"), that shares a lot line for less than 450 feet with right-of-way within the corridor as defined in this plan, shall be entitled to one driveway or road access per parcel onto M-84 or M-58. Where a parcel is divided by M-84 or M-58, the portion of the parcel on each side of M-84 or M-58 shall be entitled to access according to the Ordinance. 
i)  All subsequent land divisions of a parent parcel shall not increase the number of driveways or road accesses beyond those entitled to the parent parcel on the effective date of this Ordinance. 
ii)  Parcels subsequently divided from the parent parcel, either by metes and bounds descriptions, or as a plat under the applicable provisions of the Land Division Act, Public Act 288 of 1967, as amended, or as a condominium project in accord with the Condominium Act, Public Act 59 of 1978, as amended, shall have access by another public road, an approved private road if the township permits, or by a service drive meeting the requirements of section 6 service drives, of this Ordinance. 
iii)  If the parcel is a corner lot and a second driveway is warranted, the second driveway shall have access from the abutting street. 
b)  All driveways or access points located on parcels greater than 450 feet shall be at least 450 feet from the nearest access point on the same or adjacent parcels. Residential and farm access driveways are exempt from this regulation. 
c)  A second driveway may be permitted if a registered traffic engineer determines that topographic conditions on the site, curvature on the road, or sight distance limitations demonstrate a second driveway within a lesser distance is safer or the nature of the land use to be served requires a second driveway for safety. The affected agencies, including the local municipality, MDOT and SCRC or the BCRC, as applicable, must unanimously agree to such deviation. 
d)  For parcels or lots abutting M-58, the provisions of this subsection 2501.4 may be superseded by the M-58 conceptual plan, if the planning commission determines that the conceptual plan's recommendations would better ensure the health, safety, welfare and aesthetics of the M-58 corridor. 
5.  Application review, approval and coordination process. 
a)  All standards of the Michigan Department of Transportation and the Saginaw County and Bay County Road Commissions, as applicable, shall be met prior to approval of an access application under this Article. 
b)  Application, review and approval process applications for driveway or access approval related to M-84 shall be made on a form prescribed by and available at Saginaw Charter Township, Kochville Township, Frankenlust Township, and Monitor Township, the Saginaw County or Bay County Road Commission, and/or the Michigan Department of Transportation - Bay City Transportation Service Center. Application related to M-58 shall be made on a form prescribed by and available at Saginaw Charter Township, Saginaw County Road Commission, and/or the Michigan Department of Transportation - Bay City Transportation Service Center. 
c)  Saginaw Charter Township, Kochville Township, Frankenlust Township, and Monitor Township, the Saginaw/Bay County Planning Department, and the Saginaw/Bay County Road Commission and the Michigan Department of Transportation shall meet at least twice each year, at the initiation of the MDOT, to ensure that there is appropriate coordination of the access management review process and outcomes. 
i)  Applications shall be accompanied by clear, scaled drawings (minimum of 1"=20') in triplicate showing the following items: 
a)  Location and size of all structures proposed on the site. 
b)  Size and arrangement of parking stalls on aisles. 
c)  Proposed plan of routing vehicles entering and leaving the site (if passenger vehicles are to be separated from delivery trucks indicate this on the drawing). 
d)  Driveway placement. 
e)  Property lines. 
f)  Intersecting roads, streets and driveways within 300 feet either side of the property on both sides of the street. 
g)  Width of road surface. 
h)  Type of surface and dimensions of driveway. 
i)  Proposed inside and outside turning radii. 
j)  Show all existing and proposed landscaping, signs, and other structures or treatments within and adjacent to the right-of-way. 
k)  Traffic analysis and trip generation survey results, obtained from a licensed traffic engineer for all developments with over 750 vehicle trips per day or one hundred 100 directional peak hour trips. 
l)  Design dimensions and justification for any alternative or innovative access design. 
m)  Dumpsters or other garbage containers. 
n)  Existing and proposed utility box placement. 
ii)  Applications are strongly encouraged to include the following sources for access designs, the National Access Management Manual, TRB, 2002 and the AASHTO Green Book. The following techniques are addressed in these guidebooks and are strongly encouraged to be used when designing access that includes: 
a)  Not more than one driveway access per abutting road. 
b)  Shared driveways. 
c)  Service drives: front, rear and perpendicular. 
d)  Parking lot connections with adjacent property(ies). 
e)  Other appropriate designs to limit access points on an arterial or collector road. 
iii)  Applications may be accompanied by an escrow fee for professional site plan and/or traffic analysis review to be determined by the township in which the project is located. 
d)  Review and Approval Process. The following process shall be completed to obtain access approval: 
i)  A site plan review access application meeting the requirements of section 5 shall be submitted to the zoning administrator, clerk or other township designee of the township. MDOT form 2205, Driveway Permit, shall be submitted concurrently to the MDOT- Bay City Transportation Service Center. 
ii)  The completed application must be received by the township zoning administrator at least 30 days prior to the planning commission meeting where the application will be reviewed. 
iii)  The township in which the application is being made shall forward a copy of the access management application and the site plan to MDOT and the appropriate county road commission. MDOT and the road commission shall provide written comment to the township and discuss any outstanding issues with the township with the intent of reaching consensus on a recommendation for the access management application and site plan. 
In the event that consensus cannot be reached on access management issues, MDOT or the township shall call a meeting of the appropriate road agencies and municipal planning commission representatives prior to the planning commission meeting to review the document and reach consensus on the issue. Applications not forwarded to MDOT and the road commission shall not have completed the review process and may not be acted on by the township planning commission. 
iv)  The planning commission may obtain professional consultation prior to making a decision on the application. Costs for such review shall be the responsibility of the applicant provided the applicant is made aware of the costs prior to the application being considered by the planning commission. 
v)  The township planning commission in which the development is proposed shall review the application and make its determination regarding the driveway. 
vi)  The zoning administrator shall keep a record of each application that has been submitted, including the written disposition of each application. MDOT shall provide the township with a copy of the written permit or any other disposition of the permit for the township's records. This record shall be a public record. 
vii)  Written approval of an application remains valid for a period of one year from the date it was authorized. If authorized construction is not initiated by the end of one year, the authorization is automatically null and void, unless the township specifically extends the time period during which the application remains valid by planning commission action. Any additional approvals that have been granted by the planning commission or the zoning board of appeals, such as a special use permit or variance, also expire at the end of one year. 
viii)  An approval may be extended for a period not to exceed six months. The extension must be requested, in writing, by the applicant before the expiration of the initial approval. The zoning administrator may approve extension of an authorization provided there are no deviations from the original approval present or planned, there are no violations of applicable ordinances and no development on abutting property has occurred with a driveway location that creates an unsafe condition. If there is any deviation or cause for question, the zoning administrator shall consult a representative of the Saginaw/Bay County Planning Commission staff, the Saginaw and/or Bay County Road Commission as applicable, and the Michigan Department of Transportation for input. 
ix)  Re-issuance of an authorization that has expired requires a new access application form to be filled out and processed independently of any previous action. 
x)  The applicant shall assume all responsibility for all maintenance of such driveway approaches from the right-of-way line to the edge of the traveled roadway. 
xi)  Where authorization has been granted for entrances to a parking facility, said facility shall not be altered or the plan of operation changed until a revised access application has been submitted and approved as specified in this section. 
xii)  Application to construct or reconstruct any driveway entrance and approach to a site requires a permit, but shall also address and achieve the reconstruction or closing of all nonconforming or unused entrances and approaches to the same site at the expense of the property owner. 
xiii)  When a building permit is sought for the modification or reconstruction to the extent that a site plan is required in the municipality or by MDOT's requirements (R 247.214. Processing of permits), all of the existing, as well as proposed driveway approaches and parking facilities shall comply, or be brought into compliance, with all design standards as set forth in this Ordinance and the adopted M-84 or M-58 access management plan and map, as applicable, prior to the issuance of a zoning or occupancy certificate and pursuant to the procedures of this section. 
xiv)  The Michigan Department of Transportation, as applicable, shall require a performance bond or cash deposit in any sum of a minimum of $10,000.00 for each such new or reconstructed approach or entrance to a commercial use, to ensure compliance with an approved application. Such performance bond shall terminate and the deposit be returned to the applicant when the term of approval have been met or when the authorization is cancelled or terminated. No performance bond is required for residential uses. 
 
Review and Approval Process Flow Chart 
6.  Service drives. 
a)  The use of shared access, parking lot connections and service drives in conjunction with driveway spacing, is intended to preserve traffic flow along thoroughfares and minimize traffic conflict, while retaining reasonable access to the property. Where noted above, or where the planning commission determines that restricting new access points or reducing the number of existing access points may have a beneficial impact on traffic operations and safety while preserving the property owner's right to reasonable access, then access from a side street, a shared driveway, a parking lot connection, or service drive connection to the arterial or collector street may be required. However, where traffic safety would be improved, and the driveway spacing requirements of this Ordinance can be met, then direct connection to the arterial or collector street may be allowed in addition to a required service drive. 
i)  In particular, shared access, service drives or at least a connection between abutting land uses may be required in the following cases: 
a)  Where the driveway spacing standards of this section within this Ordinance cannot be met. 
b)  Where recommended in the M-84 access management plan and map. 
c)  When the driveway could potentially interfere with traffic operations at an existing or planned traffic signal location. 
d)  The site is along a collector or arterial street with high traffic volume, or along segments experiencing congestion or a relatively high number of crashes. 
e)  The property frontage has limited sight distance. 
f)  The fire or emergency services department recommends a second means of emergency access. 
ii)  In areas where frontage roads or rear service drives are recommended, but adjacent properties have not yet developed, the site shall be designed to accommodate a future road/facility designed according to the standards cited in this Ordinance. The planning commission may approve temporary access points where a continuous service drive is not yet available and a performance bond or escrow is accepted to assure elimination of temporary access when the service road is constructed. (See section 7.) 
7.  Standards for construction. Notwithstanding the requirements of the municipality's land division ordinance, the standards for all service drives shall be as follows: 
a)  Site plan review. The planning commission shall review and approve all service drives to ensure safe and adequate continuity of the service drive between contiguous parcels as part of the site plan review process. 
b)  Front and rear service drives. A front or rear service drive may be established on property that abuts only one public road. The design of a service road shall conform with national design guidelines such as those identified in the National Access Management Manual by TRB, the ASSHTO Greenbook, and National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP), "Access Management Guidelines to Activity Centers" Report 348 and "Impacts of Access Management Techniques" Report 420. 
c)  Location. Service roads shall generally be parallel to the front property line and may be located whether in front of, or behind, principal buildings and may be placed in required yards. In considering the most appropriate alignment for a service road, the planning commission shall consider the setbacks of existing and/or proposed buildings and anticipated traffic flow for the site. 
d)  Width and construction. A service drive shall be within an access easement permitting traffic circulation between properties. The easement shall be recorded with the county register of deeds. This easement shall be at least 32 feet wide. A service drive shall have a minimum pavement width of 24 feet, measured face to face at the curb with an approach width of a minimum of 27 feet at the intersection. The service drive shall be constructed of a paved surface material that is resistant to erosion and shall meet the Saginaw/Bay County Road Commission standards for base and thickness of asphalt or concrete, unless the community has more restrictive standards. 
e)  Snow storage and landscaping areas. A minimum of six feet of snow storage/landscaping area shall be reserved along both sides of the service drive. 
f)  Stacking. A minimum of 60 feet of storage at the intersection for entering and existing vehicles as measured from the pavement edge must be provided for all frontage roads. At driveways where it can be demonstrated that traffic volumes will exceed 750 vehicles per day or 100 vehicles during the peak hour, a minimum of 80 feet of stacking space shall be required. 
g)  Distance from intersection on service drives. Frontage roads and service drive intersections at the collector or arterial street shall be designed according to the same minimum standards as described for driveways. 
h)  Driveway entrance. The planning commission shall approve the location of all access to the service drive, based on the driveway spacing standards referenced in this Ordinance. Access to the service drive shall be located so that there is no undue interference with the free movement of service drive and emergency vehicle traffic, where there is safe sight distance, and where there is a safe driveway grade as established by the MDOT and Saginaw/Bay County Road Commission. 
i)  Driveway radii. All driveway radii shall be shall be concrete curbs and conform with the requirements of the MDOT Access Management Guidebook. 
j)  Acceleration lanes and tapers. The design of the driveway, acceleration, deceleration or taper shall conform with the requirements of the MDOT Access Management Guidebook. 
k)  Elevation. The elevation of a service drive shall be uniform or gently sloping between adjacent properties. 
l)  Service drive maintenance. No service drive shall be established on existing public right-of-way. The service drive shall be a public street (if dedicated and accepted by the applicable road commission) or a private road if permitted, maintained by the adjoining property owners it serves who shall enter into a formal agreement for the joint maintenance of the service drive. The agreement shall also specify who is responsible for enforcing speed limits, parking and related vehicular activity on the service drive. This agreement shall be approved by the municipality's attorney and recorded with the register of deeds. If the service drive is a private road, the local government shall reserve the right to make repairs or improvements to the service drive and charge back the costs. 
m)  Landscaping. Landscaping along the service drive shall conform to the requirements of the municipality's zoning ordinance. Installation and maintenance of landscaping shall be the responsibility of the developer or a property owners association. 
n)  Parking areas. All separate parking areas (those that do not use joint parking cross access) shall have no more than one access point or driveway on the service drive. 
o)  Parking. The service road is intended to be used exclusively for circulation, and not as parking, loading or unloading aisle. Parking shall be prohibited along two-way frontage roads and service drives that are constructed at the minimum width. One-way roads or two-way roads designed with additional width for parallel parking may be allowed if it can be demonstrated through traffic studies that on-street parking will not significantly affect the capacity, safety or operation of the frontage road or service drive. Perpendicular or angle parking along either side of a designated frontage road or service drive is prohibited. The planning commission may require the posting of "no parking" signs along the service road. 
p)  Directional signs and pavement markings. Pavement markings may be required to help promote safety and efficient circulation. The property owner shall be required to maintain all pavement markings. All directional signs and pavement markings along the service drive shall conform with the current Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
q)  Assumed width of pre-existing service drives. Where a service drive in existence prior to the effective date of this provision has no recorded width, the width will be considered to be 26 feet for the purpose of establishing setbacks and will be measured an equal distance from the midpoint of the road surface. 
r)  Alternate cross access. In the case of expansion, alteration to redesign of existing development where it can be demonstrated that preexisting conditions prohibit installation of a frontage road or service drive in accordance with these standards, the planning commission shall have the authority to allow and/or require alternate cross access between adjacent parking areas through the interconnection of main circulation aisles. Under these conditions, the aisles serving the parking stalls shall be aligned perpendicularly to the access aisle, with islands, curbing and signage to further delineate the edges of the route to be used by through traffic. (See the MDOT Access Management Guidebook for further detail and sample drawings.) 
8.  Temporary access permits. 
a)  A temporary access permit may be conditionally issued to a property included in this adopted corridor or access management plan that plans road improvements and installation of service drives and shared driveways that would eliminate the need for the temporary driveway. 
b)  A temporary access permit shall be reviewed using the temporary permit form during the site plan review process. Failure to use this form and supply the justification for a temporary permit according to the provisions of the form prohibit a temporary access point on the site. A copy of this completed form shall be kept on file with the approved site plan at the township and recorded with the deed to the property for which it applies. This form is included as an appendix to this Ordinance. 
c)  Conditions may be included in the temporary access permit including but not limited to, a limitation on development intensity on the site until adjoining parcels develop which can provide a shared driveway, shared access via a service drive, and/or cross parking lot connection consistent with the requirements of section 6. 
d)  A site plan for property that cannot meet the access requirements of section 6 and has no alternative means of reasonable access to the public road system may be issued a temporary access permit. When adjoining parcels develop which can provide a shared driveway, shared access via a service drive or a cross parking lot connection, the temporary access permit shall be rescinded and an application for an access permit consistent with the requirements of section 5 and 6 shall be required. 
e)  The municipality and the Michigan Department of Transportation, as applicable, may require a performance bond or cash deposit in any sum of a minimum of $10,000.00 for each temporarily permitted driveway to insure compliance with removal of the driveway at such time as the permit stipulates. Such performance bond shall terminate and deposit be returned to the applicant when the term of approval have been met or when the authorization is cancelled or terminated. 
9.  Nonconforming driveways. 
a)  Driveways that do not conform to the regulations in this Ordinance and were constructed before the effective date of this Ordinance and existing driveways granted a temporary access permit, shall be considered legal nonconforming driveways. 
b)  Loss of legal nonconforming status results when a change to the site or use requires a new site plan, according to the township zoning ordinance. Any reuse of the driveway may only take place after the driveway conforms to all aspects of this Ordinance. 
c)  When the owner of a property with an existing nonconforming driveway or driveways applies for a permit to upgrade the property, the planning commission will determine whether it is necessary and appropriate to retrofit the existing driveway or driveways. If the developer is proposing a change in use of the driveway the nonconforming status is no longer valid and a permit for the driveway is required from the Michigan Department of Transportation or the road commission as applicable according to the standards of this Ordinance. 
i)  The property owner may be required to establish a retrofit plan. The objectives of the retrofit plan will be to minimize the traffic and safety impacts of development by bringing the number, spacing, location, and design of driveways into conformance with the standards and requirements of this Ordinance to the extent possible without imposing unnecessary hardship on the property owner. The retrofit plan may include: 
a)  Elimination of driveways. 
b)  Realignment or relocation of driveways. 
c)  Provision of shared driveways and/or cross parking lot connection. 
d)  Access by means of a service drive. 
e)  Restriction of vehicle movements (e.g. elimination of left-turns in and out). 
f)  Relocation of parking. 
g)  Traffic demand management (e.g. a reduction in peak hour trips). 
h)  Signalization based on warrants. 
i)  Such other changes as may enhance traffic safety. 
ii)  The requirements of the retrofit plan shall be incorporated as conditions to the permit for the change or upgrade of use and the property owner shall be responsible for the retrofit. 
d)  Driveways that do not conform to the regulations in this Ordinance and have been constructed after adoption of this Ordinance, shall be considered illegal nonconforming driveways. 
e)  Illegal nonconforming driveways are a violation of this Ordinance. The property owner shall have 30 days in which to correct the violation. The property owner shall be issued a violation notice which may include closing off the driveway until any nonconforming aspects of the driveway are corrected. Driveways constructed in illegal locations shall be immediately closed upon detection and all evidence of the driveway removed from the right-of-way and site on which it is located. The costs of such removal shall be borne by the property owner. 
f)  Nothing in this Ordinance shall prohibit the repair, improvement, or modernization of lawful nonconforming driveways, provided it is done consistent with the requirements of this Ordinance. 
10.  Variances. 
Variance standards: The following standards shall apply when the board of appeals considers a request for a variance from the standards of this Article. 
a)  The granting of a variance shall not be considered until a temporary access permit under section 7 has been considered and rejected. 
b)  Applicants for a variance must provide proof of practical difficulties unique to the parcel (such as wetlands, steep slopes, an odd parcel shape or narrow frontage, or location relative to other buildings, driveways or an intersection or interchange) that make strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance impractical. This shall include proof that: 
i)  Indirect or restricted access cannot be obtained; and, 
ii)  No reasonable engineering or construction solution can be applied to mitigate the condition; and, 
iii)  No reasonable alternative access is available from a road with a lower functional classification than the primary road; and, 
iv)  Without the variance, there is no reasonable access to the site. 
c)  The board of appeals shall make a finding that the applicant for a variance met their burden of proof under b)ii) above, that a variance is consistent with the intent and purpose of this Ordinance, and is the minimum necessary to provide reasonable access. 
d)  Under no circumstances shall a variance be granted unless not granting the variance would deny reasonable access, endanger public health, welfare or safety, or cause an unnecessary hardship on the applicant. No variance shall be granted where such hardship is self-created.
