PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Charter Township of Oxford, Michigan. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were ordinances adopted by the township board. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Gary R. Rentrop, Township Attorney, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the township readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the township's affairs.

Sec. 1-9. - Provisions deemed continuation of existing ordinances.

Sec. 2-111. - Recovery of expenses of emergency responses to incidents involving motor vehicles and alcohol or drugs. 
(a)  Purpose. The township finds that a significant number of traffic arrests and traffic accidents in the township involve drivers who are operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of, or impaired by, an intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination thereof, or having an unlawful blood alcohol level. In addition, the township finds that, when a traffic accident involves drivers who were operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of, or impaired by, an intoxicating liquor or controlled substance or a combination thereof, or having an unlawful blood alcohol level, there is a greater likelihood of personal injury and property damage. As a result, a greater operational and financial burden is placed upon the township's police, firefighting and rescue services by persons who are operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of, or impaired by, an intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance or a combination thereof, or having an unlawful blood alcohol level. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Emergency response means: 
(1)  The providing, sending, or dispatch of police, firefighting, emergency medical or rescue services by personnel employed by and/or acting on behalf of the township at an accident involving a motor vehicle or vehicles where one or more of the drivers of such vehicle or vehicles was operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of, or impaired by, intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination thereof, or having an unlawful blood alcohol level. 
(2)  The making of a traffic stop and arrest by a law enforcement officer where a driver was operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of, or impaired by, intoxicating liquor, or a controlled substance, or a combination thereof, or having an unlawful blood alcohol level. 
Expense of an emergency response means the direct and reasonable costs incurred by the township, a public entity under contract with the township, an intergovernmental entity of which the township is a part, or a private person, authority, or corporation operating at the request or direction of the township, when making an emergency response, including the costs of providing police, firefighting and rescue services at the scene of the emergency response. These costs further include all of the salaries and wages of the personnel responding, all salaries and wages of the personnel engaged in investigation, supervision and report preparation, all costs connected with the administration and provision of all chemical tests of his or her blood, breath, or urine and all costs related to any prosecution of the person causing the incident. 
(c)  Liability for expense of emergency response. 
(1)  Responsible person. Any person is liable for the expense of an emergency response, if while under the influence of, or impaired by, an intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or the combined influence of an intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance, or having an unlawful blood alcohol level, such person's operating of a motor vehicle proximately causes an emergency response, and that person is determined to be guilty of any of such drunk driving offenses in a district court proceeding associated with the emergency response. 
(2)  Charge against person. The expense of an emergency response shall be a charge against the person liable for the expenses under this section. The charge constitutes a debt of that person and is collectible by the township for incurring those costs in the same manner as in the case of an obligation under a contract, express or implied. Additionally, the district court is authorized to collect such debt for the township and may charge a service fee for such collection in an amount mutually agreed upon by the court and the township. 
(3)  Cost recovery schedule. The township shall, by resolution, adopt a schedule of the costs to be charged and included within the expense of an emergency response. This schedule shall be available to the public from either the township clerk or the county sheriff's department. 
(4)  Billing. The township clerk or his or her designee may, within 30 days of receiving the itemized costs, or any part thereof, incurred by the township for emergency response, submit a bill for these costs by first class mail or personal service to the person liable for the expenses as enumerated under this section. The bill(s) shall require full payment in 30 days from the date of service. The 30-day period shall begin two days after the bill is postmarked. 
(5)  Failure to pay bill; procedure to recover costs. Any person described in this section as liable for the expense of an emergency response failing to pay the bill within 30 days of service shall be considered to be in default. The 30-day period shall begin two days after service is postmarked. The failure to pay may further be considered a violation of probation if the payment was ordered by the court at the time of sentencing. The township may commence civil suit to recover the expenses, attorneys' fees, and all costs allowed by law.

(Ord. No. 89-A, § 8, 11-10-1999)  
Sec. 2-150. - Fee. 
(a)  The township may charge a fee for the production of documents pursuant to a FOIA (MCL 15.231 et seq.) request, including the costs of searching for a public record, copying the record and providing the record, or the township may search for and/or furnish such documents without charge or at a reduced charge if the township determines that a waiver or reduction is in the public interest. The township shall search for and/or furnish public records without charge for the first $20.00 of the fee for each request, to an individual who submits an affidavit stating that the individual is then receiving public assistance, or, if not receiving public assistance, stating facts showing inability to pay the cost because of indigence, provided the individual is entitled to information under the FOIA. Fees shall otherwise not be dependent upon the identity of an individual making a request. 
(b)  The fee, if any, shall be calculated to include the following charges, in accordance with the following method and policy: 
(1)  Actual mailing costs. 
(2)  Actual duplication costs, using the most economical means available. 
(3)  Actual labor costs, which shall be calculated based on the hourly wage of the lowest paid employee of the township capable of retrieving the information necessary to comply with the FOIA (MCL 15.231 et seq.) request, and these labor costs shall include time spent for search, examination, review, deletion and separation of exempt from nonexempt information, duplication and mailing. Upon receipt of a FOIA request, the township clerk or designee, as acting FOIA coordinator, shall make a determination as to which township employee is capable of conducting the search, examination, review and deletion and separation of exempt from nonexempt information (referred to in this section as "FOIA processing"). The FOIA coordinator shall select the lowest paid capable employee to conduct FOIA processing. When selecting a capable employee with the lowest hourly wage, a determination of the lowest hourly wage shall include the employee's salary plus the township's cost of fringe benefits provided to that employee. The FOIA applicant shall then be charged for the time necessary for the employee to conduct the FOIA processing based on the employee's hourly wage, plus the actual cost of duplicating and mailing the requested documents. 
(4)  If FOIA processing takes no longer than one-half hour, there shall be no charge for processing costs, although duplication, copying and mailing costs shall be determined and be assessed to the FOIA applicant. For the purpose of this subsections the Township Board of Trustees has determined that a response to a FOIA request requiring time in excess of one-half hour represents an unreasonably high cost to the township unless the township is able to be reimbursed for its processing costs. 
(5)  These costs shall be calculated for each separate request so that each individual pays the actual costs of providing to the individual the requested information. 
(c)  If the FOIA coordinator, upon receipt of the FOIA (MCL 15.231 et seq.) request, estimates that the total cost of responding to the FOIA request will exceed $50.00, the FOIA coordinator may request a deposit from the applicant equal to one-half the estimated cost of responding to the FOIA request. If a deposit is requested pursuant to this section, the township need not commence a response to the FOIA request until the deposit has been paid. 
(d)  The township shall provide each FOIA (MCL 15.231 et seq.) applicant a statement of the bill which categorizes the costs to the township as to mailing, duplication and labor costs. 
(e)  Once a FOIA request has been fully processed and documents prepared, and the total costs of the FOIA response have been determined, the township shall not release the requested documents to the FOIA applicant until the total costs of the FOIA response have been paid. The FOIA coordinator shall treat each FOIA request as a separate request, and the FOIA coordinator shall not decline to respond to an applicant's new FOIA request based upon the applicant's failure to pay the costs associated with a prior distinct FOIA request by the same applicant.

A waiver from the terms of this article shall not be granted by the planning commission unless and until: 
(1)  A written application for a waiver is submitted demonstrating that literal enforcement of the article will result in either practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship: 
a.  The existence of practical difficulties shall be determined upon consideration of the following factors: 
1.  Strict compliance with the terms of the article will unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or will render article conformity unnecessarily burdensome; 
2.  The waiver will do substantial justice to the applicant, as well as to other property owners; 
3.  A lesser waiver than requested will not give substantial relief to the applicant and will not be more consistent with justice to other property owners; 
4.  The need for the waiver is due to the unique circumstances peculiar to the property and not generally applicable in the area or to other properties; 
5.  The problem and resulting need for the waiver has not been self-created by the applicant and/or the applicant's predecessors; 
b.  Unnecessary hardship shall be established by demonstrating that: 
1.  The property cannot reasonably be used in compliance with this article; and 
2.  The need for the waiver is due to the unique circumstances peculiar to the property and not generally applicable in the area or to other properties; and 
3.  The requested waiver will not adversely affect surrounding properties; and 
4.  The hardship was not unreasonably self-created by the applicant; 
(2)  No incidence of noncompliance with this article by any person or on any property shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a waiver. 
(3)  Notice of a public hearing on the waiver application shall be given. The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. 
(4)  The planning commission shall make findings of fact based upon competent evidence that the requirements of subsection (1)a. or b. have been met. 
(5)  The planning commission shall further make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of a waiver, and that the waiver is the minimum waiver that will make possible the reasonable use of the property; 
(6)  The planning commission shall further make a finding that the granting of the waiver will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this article, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
(7)  In granting any waiver, the planning commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this article. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the waiver is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this article and punishable as such.

Sec. 22-132. - Purpose of article. 
(a)  Consistent with the letter and spirit of part 303 of Public Act No. 451 of 1994 (MCL 324.30301 et seq.), the township finds that rapid growth, the spread of development, and increasing demands upon natural resources have had the effect of encroaching upon, polluting, impairing or destroying many of its wetlands and other natural resources and processes associated therewith which, if preserved and maintained in an undisturbed and natural condition, constitute important physical, aesthetic, recreational and economic assets to existing and future residents of the township. 
(b)  Protection of the natural resources is essential to the protection of the public health, safety and welfare within the township. 
(c)  This article provides for the protection, preservation, proper maintenance, and use of township wetlands and watercourses in order to prevent pollution, impairment or destruction of them. This article adopts the definition of a wetland that is provided under part 303 of Public Act No. 451 of 1994 (MCL 324.30301 et seq.) which is specifically authorized by section 30307(4) of such act (MCL 324.30307(4)).

(3)  If a nonconforming activity or use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any resumption of the activity or use shall conform to this article. 
(Ord. No. 80B, § 9, 6-12-1996)  
Sec. 22-136. - Variances. 
The planning commission may, upon appeal in a specific case, authorize such variance from the terms of this article as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this article would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of this article shall not be granted by the planning commission unless and until: 
(1)  A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating that: 
a.  Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; 
b.  Literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this article; 
c.  The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; 
d.  Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this article to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; or 
e.  Unnecessary hardship would result, which was not self-created, such that no useful purpose would be served by strict enforcement of the terms of this article.

(3)  The planning commission shall make findings of fact based upon competent evidence that the requirements of subsections (a)(1)a through d of this section or subsection (a)(1)e of this section have been met. 
(4)  The planning commission shall further make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of a variance, and that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure. 
(5)  The planning commission shall further make a finding that the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this article, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
(6)  In granting any variance, the planning commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this article. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this article and punishable under section 22-133. Conditions imposed shall meet all of the following requirements: 
a.  Be designed to protect natural resources, health, safety and welfare, and the social and economic well-being of those who will use the building, land or activity under consideration, residents and landowners immediately adjacent to the proposed building, land use or activity, and the community as a whole.

(b)  The applicant for an approval required in conjunction with site plan approval or subdivision approval shall, at the time of the submission, elect to have the application processed under one of the following procedures: 
(1)  The wetland application shall be reviewed immediately, either prior to or concurrent with the review of the site plan, plat or other proposed land use submitted by the applicant, with the understanding that the land use review may not be completed at the time the decision is rendered on the wetland application. Election of this alternative may require a re-opening of the wetland application if the land use approval is inconsistent with the wetland approval; or 
(2)  The wetland application shall be reviewed and acted upon concurrently with the review of the site plan, plat or other proposed land use submitted by the applicant, and the 90-day review period limitation specified in section 30307(2) of Public Act No. 451 of 1994 (MCL 324.30307(2)) is thereby extended accordingly. 
(c)  In determining whether the activity is in the public interest, the benefit which reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal shall be balanced against the reasonably foreseeable detriments of the activity. The decision shall reflect the national, state, and local concern for the protection of natural resources from pollution, impairment, and destruction. The commission may issue development permits for certain acts in the watercourses and wetlands of the township, provided such development permit does not violate the intent of this article or of other township, county, or state ordinances or statutes. In reviewing such application, the commission shall consider the possible effects of the proposed operation upon: 
(1)  Water quality, including filtering action; 
(2)  Fish or wildlife, including their habitats, damage or change; 
(3)  Effect upon adjoining wetland or drainage areas and water tables; 
(4)  Economic impact; 
(5)  Land use for which the property is zoned or planned; and 
(6)  Recreational impact. 
(d)  No approval shall be given if the planning commission determines that the action has or is likely to pollute, impair or destroy a wetland or watercourse of one acre or more in size, unless it determines that there are no feasible and prudent alternatives and that the approval is consistent with the public interest in light of the purposes of this article. 
(e)  The planning commission may hold a public hearing on the application before making a decision. The commission shall provide the applicant with the reasons for denying the permit application. 
(f)  Whenever a use permit is granted, the commission shall: 
(1)  Impose such conditions on the manner and extent of the proposed activity or use as are necessary to ensure that the intent of this article is carried out and that the activity or use will be conducted in such a manner as will cause the least possible damage, encroachment or interference with natural resources and natural processes within the watercourse and/or wetland area. 
(2)  Fix a reasonable time within which any wetland operation must be completed, which time period may be extended by the planning commission only for good cause shown. 
(3)  Require the filing with the township of a cash bond or irrevocable letter of credit, in such form and amount as determined necessary by the township board to ensure compliance with the approved development permit. 
(g)  If a use permit is denied, the commission shall inform the applicant of the reasons for denial in writing. The failure to supply complete information with a permit application may be reason for denial of a permit. 
(h)  After the planning commission reaches its final decision, it shall forward its decision to the state as provided in part 303 of Public Act No. 451 of 1994 (MCL 324.30301 et seq.). 
(i)  Following approval of the wetland application, a wetland permit shall be issued upon determination that all other requirements of this Code, township ordinances and law have been met, including site plan, plat or land use approval, as applicable, and including issuance of a permit by the state department of environmental quality, if required under part 303 of Public Act No. 451 of 1994 (MCL 324.30301 et seq.). In cases where a state department of environmental quality permit allows activities not permitted under this article, the restrictions of approval granted under this article shall govern.

d.

The court order shall not be recorded unless a legal description of the property is incorporated in or attached to the court order. 
a.  The lien is effective immediately upon recording of the court order with the register of deeds.

c.  The lien may be enforced and discharged by the township in the manner prescribed by its Charter, by the General Property Tax Act, Act No. 206 of the Public Acts of 1893, being MCL 211.1 et seq., or by an ordinance duly passed by the township.

4.  The other lien is recorded before the lien under this section is recorded. 
e.  The township may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for the collection of the fines and costs imposed by a court order for a violation of this section. However, an attempt by the township to collect the fines or costs does not invalidate or waive the lien upon the land, building, or structure. 
f.  A lien provided for by this subsection shall not continue for a period longer than five years after a copy of the court order imposing a fine or cost is recorded unless within that time an action to enforce the lien is commenced.

(Ord. No. 46, § 46.7, 8-19-1978)  
Sec. 30-317. - Range rules. 
The following range rules shall be posted and enforced by the range supervisor. Violation of any of these rules may, in the township board's discretion, result in rescission of the permit.

(3)  Targets must be hung only in frames provided. 
(4)  The only targets which may be used are those for which the range is designed. 
(5)  All firing must be done from specified firing lines or stations. 
(6)  Do not touch the trigger until the sights are on target, and you are ready to fire. 
(7)  All shooters must become thoroughly familiar with NRA official rules, range operation and range commands. While the main objective of rules is to govern competitive shooting, safety is a major consideration when a rule or range command is written. The official NRA rule book is a great help in maintaining a smooth operation and a well-disciplined range. 
(8)  Discipline: The safety of shooters, range personnel, and spectators requires self-discipline on the part of all. Where such self-discipline is lacking it is the duty of the range personnel to enforce discipline and the duty of the shooter to assist in such enforcement. 
(9)  All unsafe actions on a range must be corrected immediately. 
(10)  Treat all firearms as if they were loaded, at all times. 
(11)  All barrels should be checked for obstruction before firing. 
(12)  Keep the muzzle of the firearm under control, and pointed in a safe direction, at all times. 
(13)  Never use a firearm which is malfunctioning or in need of repair. 
(14)  Actions of uncased firearms should be kept open except when on the firing line, ready to fire. 
(15)  All firearms will be unloaded immediately upon the command "cease firing," regardless of when this command is given. Action will remain open until further commands are given. 
(16)  Dry firing should be permitted on the firing line or in designated dry fire areas only. 
(17)  Be sure you have only ammunition of the proper size for the firearm being used. 
(18)  All inexperienced shooters should be accompanied by an experienced shooter. 
(19)  On ranges where shooters must go down-range to change targets and score, movement must be controlled by a range official. 
(20)  Loud or abusive language will not be permitted. Shooters and range personnel will limit their conversation directly behind the firing line to official business. 
(21)  All shooters should police their firing point when they have completed their firing. Do not disturb shooters on adjacent points. 
(22)  No alcoholic beverages shall be on the range property at any time.

(Ord. No. 109, § 1.3, 9-13-2000) ;rn0;2; Definitions generally, § 1-2.  
Sec. 42-32. - Purpose of article; findings. 
(a)  Pursuant to section 29 of article 7 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, use of the highways, streets, alleys and other public places for operation of a public utility requires the consent of the township and the transaction of local business in the township by a public utility requires that a franchise first be obtained. This article is adopted for the purpose of conforming and providing the process, terms and conditions for suppliers of electricity and natural gas to obtain the required consents and franchises and to fully exercise the township's constitutional authority, which includes the reasonable control of its highways, streets, alleys and public places. 
(b)  As a result of regulator changes that have or may occur, and interpretations of existing laws, at the state and federal levels, specifically including the Michigan public service commission (referred to in this section as "deregulation"), the persons that may be authorized to supply electricity and natural gas to customers in the township are no longer limited to the public utility that owns and operates the facilities used to deliver electricity and natural gas to customers. This article is adopted in recognition of the deregulation which has and may continue to occur, with the intent and purpose of confirming that all persons supplying electricity or natural gas to customers in the township are required to have a franchise as provided in this article, regardless of whether it is required as a condition of state or federal regulatory permits, approvals or certificates. 
(c)  The township will incur costs and expenses in reviewing and acting on franchise requests, and, upon granting a franchise, monitoring and enforcing its terms and conditions. Such costs and expenses should be paid by franchise applicants and holders as provided in this article.

Being a supplier of electricity or natural gas to customers in the township is the transaction of local business of a public utility, which shall not be done without a franchise.

If the application meets the requirements of this article, the proposed ordinance will be accepted for introduction and scheduled for possible adoption at the first meeting thereafter that allows time to satisfy any publication and legal requirements for adoption of a valid franchise ordinance. 
(c)  After all publication and other legal requirements for adoption of a valid franchise ordinance have been satisfied, at a regular or special meeting, the township board may adopt, reject or table adoption of a proposed franchise ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 109, § 2.2, 9-13-2000)

If the required signed and notarized acceptance is not delivered to the clerk within 30 days of the delivery or mailing of the franchise ordinance and agreement to the grantee, the effectiveness of the ordinance will be automatically terminated. Upon the approved grantee's timely acceptance of the franchise ordinance, it shall constitute a contract between the township and the grantee. 
(Ord. No. 109, § 2.3, 9-13-2000)  
Sec. 42-37. - Provisions of article to be incorporated in franchise ordinance. 
Unless amended by the individual franchise ordinance, all of the definitions in section 42-31, the terms and conditions in division 2 of this article and section 42-38 and the penalties and relief in section 42-41 shall apply and be incorporated by reference as part of every supplier's individual franchise ordinance.

(Ord. No. 109, §§ 4.1, 4.2, 9-13-2000)  
Sec. 42-39. - Provisions of article do not constitute waiver of rights by township. 
Nothing in this article shall be construed as a waiver of any of the rights, remedies and/or authority of the township pursuant to any laws, ordinances, codes or regulations of the township, and the township reserves the right to exercise all authority and take any and all action granted to it by any constitution, law, township ordinance, code and/or regulation. Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit and/or preclude the township from exercising its right of eminent domain. 
(Ord. No. 109, § 6.1, 9-13-2000)  
Sec. 42-40. - Notices. 
Any notices required to be sent to the grantee by this article may be delivered, or may be sent by first class mail to the grantee, at the address listed in the franchise application or such other address as the grantee has provided to the clerk in writing.

(b)  Restoration of damaged right-of-way. Any person in violation of the franchise requirement of this article or a franchise issued under it who damages a right-of-way shall be responsible for restoration of the right-of-way to the condition that existed prior to the violation. If such person fails or refuses to restore the right-of-way after 30 days' notice from the township, and if the township determines that the civil infraction remedy is inadequate under the circumstances, the township may initiate proceedings in the appropriate court to recover the cost estimated to accomplish the restoration, or recover such costs as have been actually expended by the township in achieving the restoration, as the case may be. Such costs shall include finance and reasonable administrative costs estimated or incurred. 
(c)  Separate offenses. Each occurrence of a violation, and each day a violation exists, shall constitute a separate offense. 
(d)  Nuisances . Violations of this article or a franchise issued under it are considered to be a nuisance per se with such violations and correction of any conditions resulting from violations subject to abatement by injunctive or other appropriate order by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(e)  Election of remedies. Violations of this article and franchises issued under it subject the violator to franchise revocation, if applicable, and township enforcement through one or more of the remedies provided herein, and the election by the township to pursue one form of remedy does not waive or restrict the township's option to pursue other remedies at the same or later time.

Sidewalk and safety path shall be synonymous in terms of their basic substantive meaning, being a constructed surface located in a public right-of-way, but separate from any improved portion of a roadway or highway, dedicated primarily for use by pedestrians and persons operating nonmotorized vehicles. For purposes of regulation under this article only, sidewalks and safety paths shall be broken into two sub-classifications, as follows: 
(1)  A "safety path" shall mean a certain type of sidewalk constructed for the benefit of the general public in the township, as shown on the official safety path map maintained by the township. The use of the term "safety path" itself does not mean, and shall not be construed or relied upon in any way as meaning, that such safety paths are inherently safe or in a safe condition. Instead, the reference to "safety" in the labeling of such paths is nothing other than a reference to the fact that such pathways are typically considered to be safer for pedestrians to use than the improved portions of road on which motor vehicles travel. 
(2)  "Sidewalk" shall mean and refer to all other constructed surfaces located in the public right-of-way dedicated primarily for pedestrian usage, not including those sidewalks being referenced above as "safety paths," and constructed primarily as dedicated pedestrian paths within subdivisions or adjacent to street lots. 
Street lots means one or more lots which are not part of a formally created subdivision, but which are part of a neighborhood where a sidewalk has been constructed to serve the lots within such neighborhood. 
Subdivision means the lots, units, and other areas which are part of a development platted under the Michigan Land Division Act (or predecessor Act) or created under the Condominium Act. 
Vegetation means trees, shrubs, bushes, flowers, weeds, or any other type of plant growth. 
(b)  Terms not expressly defined above shall have their customary dictionary meanings, taking into consideration the context and intent of this article. 
(Ord. No. 117, § 3, 2-11-2004)  
Sec. 42-104. - Safety path development. 
The township's safety path plan, as incorporated into the open space and greenway plan, shall guide the development of a system of planned safety paths in the township and shall be updated from time to time as an amendment to, or in conjunction with, the master plan, in accordance with MCL 125.321 et seq. 
(Ord. No. 117, § 4, 2-11-2004)  
Sec. 42-105. - Safety path plan implementation/developer's responsibilities. 
(a)  All developers of property along either side of a public roadway shall, upon development of their property, construct a pathway that is located within the public road right-of-way and extends the full width of their property, in accordance with the design and construction standards adopted under article IV of this chapter. 
(b)  In lieu of constructing the pathway, and only with the recommendation of the planning commission and safety path committee and approval of the township board, a developer may be allowed to pay to the township a sum of money equivalent to the actual cost of construction of the path, including permit, engineering, and inspection fees. Except as otherwise provided below, the actual cost of construction, including fees, shall be determined by the township engineer, and shall be based on recent bids received by the township for similar types of path construction, except that, in those cases where the construction of a safety path as otherwise required herein would be impracticable due to the physical nature and/or layout of the road and/or the property, the township board may waive or reduce the required payment accordingly. All funds collected under this subsection shall be deposited into the safety path fund and used for the construction of the safety path system. 
In all cases in which payment for required safety paths is allowed in lieu of construction, a written contract, drafted by the township and indicating the sum of money to be paid to the township and associated provisions, shall be executed by both the developer and the township as a condition of either final site plan or final preliminary plat approval. All provisions of said contract, including the financial contribution to the township safety path fund, shall be satisfied prior to issuance of any building permits by the township building department. 
(c)  Unless the township board has allowed a developer to pay a sum of money to the township in lieu of constructing a pathway under subsection (b), construction of the safety path shall be completed for each phase (if applicable) prior to the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy for any building structure located on the parcel adjacent to which the safety path is to be located. The developer shall be responsible for securing all necessary permits, paying all necessary fees, and obtaining necessary inspections from the township, the road commission for the county, and/or the state department of transportation. 
In order to ensure completion of the path, the developer shall deposit cash to be placed into the township's trust and agency fund, in the amount of the estimated cost of the safety path plus ten percent to guarantee the completion of such path. The cost estimate shall be approved by the township engineer. The escrow amount shall be returned to the developer upon completion of the safety pathway and approval by the township engineer and building official. 
(d)  Anyone constructing a safety path in the township shall first obtain a permit from the township building department, using forms provided by the same. A permit shall be granted by the building department only upon determining that the provisions of this article and all other applicable codes and ordinances of the township have been met. A township review escrow shall be established in accordance with the schedule of fees and escrow charges, for applicable portions of site plan review, and shall be deposited with the township, along with plan submittal. The permit fee shall be one-half of one percent of the construction cost as agreed upon by the township engineer and the developer, but not fewer than [$]100.00. Also $500.00 shall be placed in escrow, per 1,000 feet of pathway ($500.00 minimum), toward the anticipated cost of three inspections by the township. Any unused portion of such escrows shall be returned to the developer. 
(e)  In addition to the above construction, permit, and inspection fees, the developer shall place, with the township, a cash performance bond in the amount of 25 percent of the estimated cost of the safety path construction, as agreed upon by the township engineer and the developer, to be placed in the township's trust and agency fund and to be held for one year following the final inspection of such path by the township engineer. At the expiration of the one year period, the bond will be reimbursed to the developer, provided that no damage has been done to the safety path by construction activities and that the path is in essentially the same condition as it was at the time of find inspection by the township engineer.

The objective is to achieve a functional and aesthetically pleasing development that minimizes the use of extensive enclosed storm drains and large obtrusive stormwater detention or retention basins while providing for the proper management of stormwater runoff. 
Development plans must present a unified design that, as a minimum, provides the following protections: 
(1)  The design must show that the development will not cause any impact to downstream properties or upstream properties. Both the rate of stormwater discharge, and the volume of stormwater discharge must be considered. 
(2)  The development plan shall be fitted to the topography and soil to create the least erosion potential and to effectively accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. 
(3)  The design must demonstrate the use of best management practices for minimizing erosion and controlling sedimentation and other pollutants through all phases of construction. 
(4)  The design must demonstrate that proposed buildings or other permanent structures on and adjacent to, a proposed development are and will remain safe from flooding.

a.  Sediment basins for construction purposes shall be separated from permanent stormwater detention or retention basins. 
b.  Basins shall be designed in accordance with the current county drain commissioner's standards for sedimentation basin design. 
c.  Construction runoff shall be directed to the basin in a controlled manner through mass grading techniques, diversion berms/swales, enclosed storm sewers or any combination thereof that would limit runoff velocities and provide for the least potential for erosion of the site. 
(8)  Areas set aside on the site for equipment storage, laydown, fuel, lubricants, chemical compounds and material stockpiles shall be contained in such a manner as to prevent any leakage or spillage from contaminating the surrounding soils and groundwater, and from entering any stormwater management system or existing surface waters. 
(9)  Filters shall be provided at catch basins and culvert inlet points to prevent the accumulation of sedimentation into storm sewers for both new and existing systems. 
(10)  Adequate dust control shall be maintained at all times. Surface streets adjacent to the site must be cleaned of any deposits on a daily basis. 
(11)  On larger projects or when phasing is involved, the developer may be required to provide alternate construction drives to the site to avoid damage to newly constructed streets. All construction drives shall be approved by the township.

(Ord. No. 106A, § 6.2, 12-12-2007)  
Sec. 42-213. - Stormwater management basins and pretreatment systems. 
On-site stormwater detention or retention is necessary for all developments in the township (including private roads) whenever runoff is increased. Waiver of this requirement may be considered by the planning commission upon submittal of a request for waiver, and report stating the reasons why detention or retention should not be necessary. Such report shall include maps, charts, and calculations prepared by a professional engineer registered in the state. The report and the request shall be subject to review and recommendation by the township engineer. 
Generally speaking, detention basins temporarily store storm runoff for a period of time in which the runoff is released through a positive outlet, at a controlled rate. Retention basins do not have a positive outlet, so that the stored runoff will percolate into the existing soils. 
Infiltration (recharge) systems that store and release runoff through permeable soils to the groundwater may be allowed under specific circumstances and with the review and approval of the township engineer. 
In cases where the requirements for detention/retention basins have been waived, stormwater pretreatment (in the form of permanent debris and sedimentation control systems) will be required. 
(1)  Detention basins. 
a.  Detention basins may only be used when the design shows that there is an adequate positive outlet for the stormwater, and where the increased volume of stormwater will not damage downstream property owners. Construction drawings must include sufficient off-site information to demonstrate the existence of an adequate outlet. 
b.  Water originating from off-site is not required to be detained in the on-site detention basin. Stormwater originating from off-site should be diverted around the detention basin whenever practical, and where the diversion will not increase the erosion of soils. 
c.  Detention basins shall be designed so that the resulting stormwater discharge from the developed site does not exceed the agricultural rate of discharge from the site. The township has defined an agricultural rate of stormwater runoff as 0.20 cubic feet per second per acre; or the capacity of the existing storm drainage facilities downstream of the detention basin outlet, whichever is less. 
d.  The volume of detention provided must be equal to or in excess of that calculated by the county drain commissioner's Simplified Detention Basin Design Procedure for a 100-year frequency storm. The volume of sediment storage is in addition to the volume required for detention. 
e.  The maximum water level shall be controlled by gravity outlets. The use of pumps for dewatering is not allowed. 
f.  Detention basin volumes shall not include volumes below the invert of outlet pipe(s). An additional one foot of volume below the outlet pipe invert is required to be incorporated into the design for sediment storage. 
g.  Detention basins shall be provided with an overflow spillway or storm sewer structure set at the high water levels capable of passing a 100-year frequency storm. The overflow spillway shall be located so not to cause potential damage to adjacent properties. To protect the surface from eroding overflow spillways shall be constructed with natural materials such as mesh or other approved materials. The edges of the surface shall have headers of the same or similar materials to prevent undercutting by the stormwater overflow. 
h.  A minimum of one foot of freeboard around the entire basin shall be provided above the design high water elevation. 
i.  All open detention basis having side slopes steeper than one foot vertical on four feet horizontal shall be fenced, except where their design is an integral part of the landscape, and where the township determines that depth and location are not hazardous. Fences shall be four feet high ornamental, vinyl coated chain link or approved equal fencing. Gates shall be 12 feet wide with double opening. The maximum side slopes of the basins shall be one foot vertical on four feet horizontal, with a four-foot minimum shoulder inside the fence. Refer to subsection q. for wet pond slope requirements. 
j.  Detention basins specifically designed for a location within yard setback areas shall be approved as to their concept and location by the planning commission. 
k.  The bottom of detention basins shall have a minimum slope of one percent (1.0%) to the outlet for dewatering purposes unless designed as a wet basin. 
l.  Detention basins are prohibited within a floodplain, defined as the area of land adjoining a river, stream, watercourse, lake or other body of water which will be inundated by a 100-year frequency flood event and where evidence exists that such flood has occurred, or would have occurred in the past given the land configuration. 
m.  Stormwater detention in paved parking lots is strictly prohibited. 
n.  Underground detention will be considered on a case-by-case basis with the following conditions: 
1.  Provisions must be made in the design for the collection and removal of sediment and debris accumulated in the system. All applicable health and safety requirements shall also be incorporated in the design of systems that require access by inspection or maintenance personnel. 
2.  Detailed shop drawings are required for underground detention systems, including pertinent engineering calculations and soils information. 
o.  Detention in wetland areas will be considered with the following conditions: 
1.  If in a regulated wetland, an MDEQ permit is required. 
2.  A permanent pretreatment system for the removal of sediment is required prior to outletting to the wetland. 
3.  Calculations indicating what the water elevation will rise to during the design storm event will be required. The design must show that properties adjacent to the wetland area will not be negatively impacted by the increase in stormwater runoff. Consideration must be given to future developments in the immediate area that could also use the wetland for stormwater management purposes. 
p.  The entire detention basin must be seeded or sodded. 
q.  Detention basins designed as a wet pond: 
1.  Shall have lowest overflow outlet elevation a minimum of eight feet above the pond bottom.

If a gravity outlet cannot be provided, then the stormwater holding facility shall be designed as a retention basin with a volume equal to or in excess of the volume of stormwater runoff from two consecutive 100-year frequency storms including the volume of sediment storage. The stormwater storage volume shall be calculated by: 
Volume = 16,500 × 2 × total tributary acres × weighted runoff coefficient. 
b.  Off-site tributary areas: Retention basins must be sized for stormwater that originates off-site and which cannot be bypassed around the proposed retention basin to a site where the stormwater originally flowed to. In such cases, the retention basin must be sized using the following design parameters: 
Tributary acres: On-site area plus the off-site area. 
Runoff coefficient: Weighted C factor of the entire tributary area that considers the existing off-site conditions, and the proposed on-site improvements. 
c.  One foot of freeboard shall be provided around the entire basin above the design high water elevation. 
d.  All open retention basins having side slopes steeper than one foot vertical on four feet horizontal shall be fenced, except where their design is an integral part of the landscape, and where the township determines that depth and location are not hazardous. Fences shall be six feet high ornamental, plastic coated chain link or approved equal fencing. Gates shall be 12 feet wide with double opening. The maximum side slopes of the basins shall be one foot vertical on four feet horizontal, with a four-foot minimum shoulder inside the fence. 
e.  Retention basins are prohibited within a floodplain. 
f.  Retention of stormwater in parking lots is strictly prohibited. 
g.  The retention basin volume shall not include volumes below existing groundwater table or permanent water elevation. The retention basin design must demonstrate that the soils are capable of providing necessary infiltration. A soils report shall be submitted. 
(3)  Infiltration (recharge) systems. 
a.  An infiltration system will be considered if the design engineer can demonstrate that all of the following conditions exist: 
1.  An adequate positive outlet is not available or it is not possible to construct an off-site drainage system to convey basin discharge to the nearest outlet, and the installation of a retention basin is not feasible or practical. 
2.  The natural underlying soils are well-drained (hydrologic groups A or B) and the ground is suitable for percolation. 
3.  The underlying soils and ground water table have the ability to move water away from the site for the area and volume being drained. 
4.  Permanent pretreatment system upstream of inlet point to prevent any material from potentially clogging the infiltration medium (both surface and subsurface). 
5.  An overflow for a 100-year storm must be provided. 
6.  Infiltration system can be easily accessed for maintenance and replacement if necessary. The use of perforated storm pipe under pavements is discouraged. 
7.  There must be a method for determining a failure in the infiltration system. The system cannot be designed such that a failure in the infiltration system results in short circuit to the emergency overflow without on-site ponding. 
b.  The following information shall be supplied and/or incorporated in the design of infiltration systems: 
1.  Soil boring logs/sieve analysis/geotechnical report indicating type and properties of both surface and subsurface soils, suitability of surface soils for infiltration, capability of subsurface soils to conduct seepage to the underlying groundwater table, and flow from the system under mounding conditions at the maximum infiltration rate. Conditions greater than six inches/hour percolation rate will not be allowed. 
2.  Computed percolation rate and infiltration/exfiltration calculations. 
3.  Drainage area map, including any off-site contributing areas and emergency overflow route in the event of system failure. 
4.  Construction methods to prevent compacting the surface soils which may reduce the infiltration capacity of the soils. 
(4)  Permanent pretreatment systems. 
a.  Permanent pretreatment systems shall be sized for a "first flush" depth of 0.5 inches of runoff from the entire drainage basin area of the project. Permanent systems are required when discharging to an existing lake, stream, waterway or wetland. 
b.  Pretreatment can be in the form of open basins or engineered treatment systems. 
1.  Open basins shall be designed with minimum side slopes of one vertical to four horizontal, one foot of freeboard above design stormwater elevation, emergency sodded overflow, and outlet control devices. 
2.  Design calculations, plans and shop drawings for pre-fabricated engineered treatment systems shall be certified by a professional engineer licensed in the state. 
3.  Horizontal velocities through the system shall be minimized to prevent turbid flows and allow particles to settle in the pretreatment system. 
c.  Permanent pretreatment facilities will not be allowed within a floodplain. 
(5)  Maintenance of stormwater management basins and pretreatment facilities commercial, industrial and office sites. The proprietor shall maintain the stormwater management basins and permanent pretreatment facilities in proper working order at all times.

Sec. 42-214. - Grading and surface drainage. 
For all new subdivisions, site plans, private roads, and other development proposals within the township, a grading plan shall be submitted for review and approval. This standard establishes the minimum requirements for the design of grading and surface drainage in the township. 
(1)  Design considerations. 
a.  The grading plan shall be designed to insure that if a failure occurs in any storm drainage system, stormwaters will drain to an approved outlet thru overland swales without flooding buildings or adjacent properties. 
b.  Positive drainage of all yard areas is required for all residential developments. In special cases involving extreme vertical relief and wooded areas, isolated undrained potholes will be considered. These undrained areas must be provided with an easement for surface drainage and retention which will encompass the stormwater storage level for two 100-year frequency storms plus one foot of freeboard. 
c.  Generally, residential lot drainage shall be split at the building; drainage from the front of the building shall drain to the road and drainage from the rear of the building shall drain to the rear lot line. Rear to front surface drainage shall be avoided and will only be permitted under extreme topographic conditions. If rear to front drainage is permitted, only the drainage from the rear of the specific lot is allowed. 
d.  Rear to front lot drainage shall have protective drainage swales around the building. The high point of the swale shall generally be located a minimum distance of 20 feet off the rear of the building and one foot below the building brick ledge grade. 
e.  Side yard swales shall be a minimum of 0.5 feet below the building brick ledge grade of the building and located a minimum of ten feet away from the building. 
f.  Rear-yards shall be drained with swales and shallow ditches unless topographic features prevent surface drainage. 
g.  Meet existing ground at the exterior property boundaries. Construct an intercepting swale to prevent drainage onto adjacent property or lots. 
h.  All building footing drains and sump pumps shall discharge into enclosed storm systems outside of the road right-of-way if available. When footing drains or sump pumps are discharged onto the ground surface, the point of discharge shall generally be directed away from side lot lines and road right-of-way and not intensify stormwater to adjacent property. 
i.  In residential development with poor draining soils or high groundwater table, an enclosed drainage system for footing drains/sump pumps discharge is required. (See underdrain/sump pump collection systems). 
(2)  Slope requirements. 
a.  Protective perimeter slope: A minimum slope of five percent is required for areas within ten feet of building perimeter. 
b.  Minimum ground slope for any portion of the site shall be two percent.

I = average rainfall intensity in inches per hour for a given time of concentration 
b.  The formula for rainfall intensity (I) shall be determined by using the formula: 
I = 175/(T + 25), where T is the time of concentration in minutes. For residential areas, the initial T shall usually be 20 minutes; for commercial and office areas, the initial T shall be 15 minutes or less. 
c.  Runoff coefficients shall be determined for each individual drainage area. Drainage area coefficient determination shall generally be based on the following:

BY USE 	Residential 	0.35 
	Multiple housing 	0.55 
	Commercial/industrial 	0.75 
 
The above runoff coefficients are minimum. Actual site design may require an increase in runoff coefficient. A weighted runoff coefficient can be used (provide calculations). Coefficients proposed for a project are subject to review and approval by the township engineer.

Sec. 46-32. - Intent of article. 
This article is intended to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the residents and the property owners of the township by regulating the division and parceling of land within the township which is not otherwise subject to the platting procedures or requirements of article III of this chapter or other ordinances. It is apparent that adequate public or private roads are essential to ensure adequate access to individual parcels of real property by both the purchasers of those parcels and by emergency service vehicles. Requiring the construction of adequate private roads as part of the acreage division process is essential to the public health, safety, and welfare. The purpose of this article is to ensure adequate provision for ingress and egress to individual parcels of real property and structures thereon for vehicular traffic and utilities, to provide adequate access for emergency services and emergency service vehicles, and to provide rules and regulations for the orderly development of land as provided for in the Land Division Act (MCL 560.101 et seq.). This article is further intended to ensure that parcels resulting from a division of land have sufficient area to conform with public health requirements for septic or other on-site waste treatment systems where the parcels are not served by a public sanitary sewer system. Further, this article is intended to ensure that parcels resulting from a division of land have sufficient area to accommodate a residential structure of a size conforming with the setback and minimum floor area requirements of the zoning ordinance for the zoning district where the parcel resulting from a division is located.

Sec. 50-1. - Tax exemption and fee in lieu of taxes for certain housing projects. 
(a)  Findings. 
(1)  It is acknowledged that it is a proper public purpose of the state and its political subdivisions to provide housing for its elderly persons of low and moderate income and to encourage the development of such housing by providing for a service charge in lieu of property taxes in accordance with the State Housing Development Authority Act of 1966 (MCL 125.1401 et seq.). The township is authorized by such act to establish or change the service charge to be paid in lieu of taxes by any or all classes of housing exempt from taxation under the act at any amount it chooses not to exceed the taxes that would be paid but for such act. 
(2)  It is further acknowledged that such housing for elderly persons of low or moderate income is a public necessity, and as the township will be benefitted and improved by such housing, the encouragement of such housing by providing certain real estate tax exemptions therefor is a valid public purpose. 
(3)  The township acknowledges that Hope Seniors Non-Profit Housing Corporation, a Michigan nonprofit corporation (referred to in this section as the "sponsor"), has offered, subject to receipt of a federally aided or authority-aided mortgage or advance, to erect, own and operate a housing development identified as Oxford Seniors Apartments (referred to in this section as the "development"), MSHDA Development No. 883, on certain property located in the township, to serve elderly persons of low and moderate income. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Authority means the state housing development authority. 
Contract rents means the rent payable to the owner of a qualified housing project under the owner's contract for the project, including the portion of the rent payable by the tenant as well as that payable under any governmental subsidy. 
Elderly means those persons 62 years of age or older or who otherwise qualify pursuant to the rules and regulations or practices of HUD or the authority for residency in an elderly housing project. 
Elderly housing project means a specific parcel of property, or divisible portion thereof, improved for rental to a low or moderate income individual which qualifies as an elderly housing project under the rules and regulations or standard practices of HUD or the authority to the extent it is occupied by the elderly or held for rental exclusively to the elderly. 
HUD means the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
Mortgage loan means a loan made by the authority or insured by HUD to the sponsor for the construction and permanent financing of an elderly housing project. 
Utilities means fuel, public water, public sanitary sewer service and/or electrical service. 
(c)  Class of housing projects. It is determined that the class of housing projects to which the tax exemption shall apply and for which a service charge shall be paid in lieu of such taxes shall be elderly housing projects which are financed or assisted pursuant to Public Act No. 346 of 1966 (MCL 125.1401 et seq.). It is further determined that Oxford Senior Apartments is of this class. 
(d)  Exemption granted; payment in lieu of taxes. 
(1)  That portion of an elderly housing project exclusively and especially designated for and occupied by elderly persons of low and moderate income developed and constructed upon a parcel of land within the township sufficient for the operation of such project (but no larger) shall be exempt from all property taxation upon commencement of construction and continuing as long as the mortgaged loan insured by HUD or assisted or financed by the authority remains outstanding and unpaid and as long as HUD or the authority has any interest in such property, and shall be subject to a service charge in lieu of such property taxes in an amount equal to zero percent of contract rents of the preceding calendar year, exclusive of utility charges paid by tenants or the project. 
(2)  Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this subsection, in no event shall the service charge, at any time, be less than the property taxes upon the subject property for the tax year prior to the date when construction was commenced. 
(e)  Collection procedures. The service charge in lieu of taxes as determined under this section shall be payable in the same manner as general property taxes are payable in the township, except that the annual payment shall be paid on or before July 1 of each year. The entire tax collection procedure provided by the General Property Tax Act (MCL 211.1 et seq.) shall be effective with respect to such payment, including, but not by way of limitation, the provisions providing for interest and penalties on late payments, return of delinquent taxes and the sale of lands for delinquent taxes. 
(f)  Contractual effect of provisions. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 15a(5) of Public Act No. 346 of 1966 (MCL 125.1415a(5)) to the contrary, a contract between the township and the sponsor naming HUD or the authority as a third-party beneficiary thereunder to provide tax exemption and accept payments in lieu thereof pursuant to the provisions of this section is effectuated by this section.

(b)  Upon the filing of such an application and the payment of the fee as prescribed, the commission shall consider the application and may request such additional information as it may deem necessary to establish the legal, financial technical and other qualifications of the applicant to provide a cable communications service in Oxford. After considering all applicants, the commission shall, by resolution, select two applicants, for final review and public hearing prior to final decision on issuing a franchise, if two or more applications have been submitted. If only one qualified applicant has filed an application, the commission shall conduct final review and a public hearing on such application prior to a final decision on issuing a franchise. The commission reserves the right to reject any and all applications. Each applicant selected for final review shall pay actual costs of the final review, including legal, technical, engineering, consultant and commission expenses. 
(c)  If the commission determines that the applicant possesses the necessary qualifications, legal, financial, technical and otherwise, to reasonably assure applicant's ability to satisfactorily install, construct, maintain or operate a cable communications system or to furnish a cable communications service to the public in Oxford, the commission may issue applicant a nonexclusive franchise therefor in Oxford, provided, that no franchise shall be issued (1) until such franchise application has been on file and available for public inspection in the office of the township clerk for at least 30 days, and (2) until the commission has, thereafter, held a public hearing on such application after due notice of the time and place of such hearing has been given the public.

(f)  No franchise granted under this article may be sold, transferred or assigned, nor may more than 25 percent of the right of control of the franchisee be transferred to a person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom already own or control 25 percent or more of such right of control, singly or collectively, until such sale, transfer or assignment of the franchise or transfer of right of control shall first have been offered to the commission or to a person approved by the commission. Such offer shall be made at a price not greater than, and on terms equivalent to, that made to the offeror by a bona fide bidder for such franchise or right of control. The commission or the person approved by the commission shall accept or reject the offer within 90 days.

Sec. 54-53. - Franchise nonexclusive; term; form. 
Any franchise issued pursuant to this article shall be a nonexclusive franchise for a term of years, not to exceed 15 years, as the commission may approve, and shall be issued in such form as shall be determined by the commission. 
(Ord. No. 55, § 6, 3-23-1981)  
Sec. 54-54. - Franchise fee; reporting; records. 
(a)  During the term of any franchise granted pursuant to this article, the person granted such franchise shall pay to the commission an annual franchise fee in an amount equal to five percent of the annual local gross subscriber revenues. Local gross subscriber revenues are those gross revenues of the franchisee from subscribers within the township. Local gross subscriber revenues include installation fees, disconnect and reconnect fees, and fees for regular cable benefits, including the transmission of broadcast signals and access and origination channels. Local gross subscriber revenues include local gross revenues from pay television in excess of the fair market value royalty paid by the franchisee therefor, and local leased channel revenues. To the extent that the franchisee's books of account do not reflect the source of any gross subscriber revenue, that portion of gross subscriber revenue allocable to the township shall be based on the ratio of the subscribers outside the township. Sales tax or other taxes levied directly on a per-subscription basis and collected by franchisee shall be deducted from the local gross revenues before computation of the fee due the commission is made. The commission shall be furnished a statement with each payment, certified as correct by the franchisee, and an annual statement for the entire year, prepared by a certified public accountant. All statements shall reflect the total amount of local gross subscriber revenues and the charges mentioned in this subsection, deductions and computations for the period covered by the statement. 
(b)  Of said five percent annual franchise fee, the commission shall distribute to the township and the Village of Oxford, for use in their respective general funds, three percent, or the maximum amount allowable by law and Federal Communications Commission regulations, whichever is greater. Such distribution shall be made on a pro-rata basis according to the number of subscribers in each jurisdiction on a year-by-year basis. Any amounts remaining after such distribution shall be used by the commission for the purpose of regulation and review of the system, maintenance and enhancement of access channel programming, and any other purposes allowable under Federal Communications Commission regulations. 
(c)  Such franchise fee shall be paid semi-annually on the 31st day of December and the 30th day of June of each year during the term of the franchise at the office of the treasurer of the township during his/her regular business hours. If the township treasurer's office is closed on said payment day, then payment may be made during his/her regular business hours on the next following day on which his/her office is open for business. 
(d)  The commission shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times the customer records of any person granted a franchise under this article from which its franchise fee payments are computed and shall have the right of audit and recomputation of any and all franchise fees paid. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the commission may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this article or for the performance of any other obligation under this article. 
(Ord. No. 55, § 7, 3-23-1981; Ord. No. 55C, 12-14-1983)  
Sec. 54-55. - Construction of facilities; conditions for use of streets. 
(a)  A franchise granted pursuant to this article shall confer upon the grantee named therein the nonexclusive right to erect, install, construct, reconstruct, replace, remove, repair, maintain and operate in or upon, under, above and across the streets, avenues, highways, sidewalks, bridges and other public ways, easements, and rights-of-way, as existing as of the date of the franchise, and all subsequent extensions thereof and additions thereto, in and belonging to the township, all necessary towers, poles, wires, cables, coaxial cables, transformers, amplifiers, underground conduits, manholes, and other television and/or radio conductors, equipment and fixtures for the installation, construction, maintenance and operation of a cable communications system (including audio, video and radio signals) or the furnishing of a cable communications service. 
(b)  Prior to the erection or installation of any towers, poles, guys, anchors, underground conduits, manholes, or fixtures for use in connection with the installation, construction, maintenance or operation of a cable communications system under a franchise granted pursuant to this article, the grantee of a franchise under this article desiring to erect or install such facilities for use in connection with its cable communications system shall first submit to the township engineer for his review and approval a concise description of the facilities proposed to be erected or installed, including engineering drawings, if requested or required, together with a map indicating the proposed location of such facilities. No erection or installation of any tower, pole, guy, anchor, underground conduit, manhole, or fixture for use in a cable communications system shall be commenced by any person until approval therefor has been received from the commission; provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(c)  Any person accepting a franchise pursuant to this article and erecting or installing towers or poles shall, upon written request by the commission or the township, grant the commission or the township reasonable attachment space upon such towers or poles without a rental charge for the attachment of wire or cable owned and used by the commission or the township; provided, however, that the commission or the township shall pay any costs incurred by such person in providing attachment space to the commission or the township, including all necessary costs of rearrangement of such person's wires, cables, or equipment and tower or pole replacement cost for a larger tower or pole, if required. 
(d)  Upon the expiration, termination or revocation of any franchise granted pursuant to this article, or should any person wish otherwise to dispose of any tower or pole erected or installed for use in connection with a cable communications system or any portion of the system, the commission retains the first right and option to purchase in place such towers or poles as it may require or such portion of the system for the fair market value thereof. The commission shall be under no obligation to purchase all or any part of the system upon expiration, termination or revocation for cause of any franchise granted pursuant to this article. Further, upon the expiration, termination or revocation for cause of any franchise granted pursuant to this article, should the commission determine that it does not desire to purchase the system or any part thereof, the franchisee shall have a period of six months from the date of expiration, termination or revocation to remove its towers, poles, wires, cables, fixtures or other facilities from the streets, alleys, public rights-of-way or public places; provided, however, that the franchisee shall not disturb any underground conduit, manholes or other facilities constructed underground. At the expiration of such six-month period, any property not removed by the franchisee shall become the property of the commission to do with as it may choose. Any cost to the commission in removing such property from the streets, alleys, public rights-of-way or public places shall be claimed against the franchisee under the performance bond required under section 54-57(a). 
(e)  In areas or portions of the township where transmission or distribution facilities of public utilities providing telephone service and electric service are underground, or may be placed underground when installed, any person granted a franchise pursuant to this article shall likewise install, construct, maintain and operate its transmission and distribution facilities in like manner underground to the maximum extent feasible and permitted by existing technology and conditions, subject to the approval of the commission as provided in subsection (b) of this section. 
(f)  All construction, installation, maintenance, and operation of any cable communications system or of any facilities employed in connection therewith shall be in compliance with the provisions of the National Electrical Safety Code as prepared by the National Bureau of Standards, the National Electrical Code of the National Board of Fire Underwriters, the Bell Telephone System's Code of Pole Line Construction, any standards issued by the Federal Communications Commission or other federal or state regulatory agencies in relation thereto, and applicable regulations of public utilities operating in the township. Every cable communications system installed, constructed, maintained or operated in the township shall be so designed, constructed, installed, maintained and operated as not to endanger or interfere with safety of persons or property in the township. 
(g)  Any opening or obstruction in, disturbance of or damage to the streets, alleys, public rights-of-way or public places by any person in the exercise of any right granted pursuant to this article shall be properly guarded by adequate barriers, lights, signals and warnings so as to prevent danger to any person or vehicle using such streets, alleys, public rights-of-way or public places and shall be properly and promptly repaired, all in a manner specified and approved by the township engineer, at such person's expense. 
(h)  Any person owning or maintaining a cable communications system or facilities therefor in or on the streets, alleys, public rights-of-way or public places in the township shall, at his expense and without reimbursement from the township, upon request of the township, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, or remove from the street, alley, public right-of-way or public place any property of such person when required by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street vacation, freeway or street construction, change or establishment of street grade, or installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal distribution facilities of any telephone or electric public utility or other public improvements. Any such person shall also, at the request of any private party holding an appropriate permit issued by the township, temporarily raise or lower its cable communications transmission or distribution wires or cable to permit the moving of any building or other structure, provided that the actual expense of such temporary raising or lowering shall be paid in full by the party requesting such work. 
(i)  If any person shall fail to commence, pursue or complete any work required by law or by the provisions of this article as set forth in this section to be done in any street, alley, public right-of-way or public place as designated by the township engineer, the commission may cause such work to be done and such person shall pay to the commission the cost thereof within 30 days of the receipt of an itemized statement of such cost. 
(Ord. No. 55, § 8, 3-23-1981)  
Sec. 54-56. - Priority of use of streets. 
Any right or privilege granted to any person under this article to use or occupy any street, alley, public right-of-way or public place shall be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy of such property. Nothing in this article shall be construed as limiting in any way the township in the lawful exercise of the police power, and the grant of a franchise to any person as provided in this article shall confer no right, privilege, or exemption not specifically presented in this article. 
(Ord. No. 55, § 16, 3-23-1981)  
Sec. 54-57. - Indemnification and insurance requirements; effective date of franchise. 
(a)  Every cable communications company shall, within 30 days of the grant of a franchise to it pursuant to this article, file with the commission, and at all times thereafter maintain in full force and effect for the term of the franchise, at its expense, a corporate surety bond, or such other surety arrangement as the commission may approve, in the amount of $25,000.00, conditioned upon the faithful performance by such cable communications company of its obligations under its franchise as set forth in this article, and upon the further condition that, if such cable communications company shall fail to comply with any one or more provisions of this article, there shall be recoverable jointly and severally from the principal and surety of such bond any damages or loss suffered by the township or the commission as a result thereof, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal of any property of such cable communications company as provided in this article plus attorneys' fees and costs, up to the full amount of the bond, such condition to be a continuing obligation for the duration of any franchise granted under this article and any renewal thereof and thereafter until such cable communications company has liquidated all of its obligations with the township and the commission which may have arisen under the franchise or from the exercise of any privilege or right granted thereby. Any bond provided under this section shall provide that at least 30 days' prior notice of any intention not to renew, to cancel or to make a material change therein shall be filed with the commission. Nothing in this section shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by any cable communications company or in any way to limit its liability for damages or otherwise. The bond required under this section may be reduced in face amount to $10,000.00 at such time as the franchisee is actively providing cable communications service to 1,000 or more subscribers within the township. Such reduction shall be deemed a "material change" in the bond. 
(b)  Any cable communications company, within 30 days of the grant of a franchise pursuant to this article, shall file with the commission, in addition to the bond as set forth in subsection (a) of this section: 
(1)  An indemnity agreement to indemnify, defend and save the township and the commission harmless from and against any or all claims, suits, actions or liability for damages which may arise in any way from the grant of a franchise to such cable communications company, or its operation thereunder in the township, including all expenses incurred by the township and the commission in defending itself against any claim, action or suit; 
(2)  Proof of a general comprehensive liability insurance policy and an automobile liability insurance policy issued by companies licensed to do business in the state, protecting the township and the commission and their officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees against liability for loss or damage for personal injury, death and property damage occasioned by the installation, construction, maintenance or operation of a cable communications system in the township, with minimum liability limits of $500,000.00 for personal injury or death of any one person and $1,000,000.00 for personal injury or death of two or more persons in any one occurrence, and $500,000.00 for damages to property resulting from any one occurrence, and such policy shall contain a provision that a written notice of cancellation or material change or reduction in coverage shall be given the commission at least 30 days in advance of the effective date thereof; and 
(3)  Proof of adequate insurance as required by the Worker's Disability Compensation Act of 1969 (MCL 418.101 et seq.) applicable to it. 
(c)  No franchise under this article shall be effective until the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section have been fully complied with, and failure to file with the commission, within 30 days after grant of a franchise, the bond, indemnity agreement, proof of general comprehensive liability insurance policy, proof of automobile liability insurance policy and proof of adequate worker's compensation insurance, or any of them, as required by subsections (a) and (b) of this section, shall render the franchise null and void without notice or further proceedings. 
(Ord. No. 55, § 12, 3-23-1981)  
Sec. 54-58. - Rights of township. 
Any franchise granted under this article is made subject to all applicable provisions of law relating to the township and ordinances thereof, and specifically subject to the rights and powers of the township and limitations upon the cable communications company holding such franchise as are set forth in the statutes of the state pertaining to general law townships and villages, which are incorporated in this article by reference, and such cable communications company shall abide by and be bound by such rights, powers and limitations, and any franchise granted under this article constitutes and shall be considered as a public utility franchise and a cable communications company shall be deemed to be a public utility.

(c)  Any franchise granted pursuant to this article shall be terminated and cancelled without further proceedings 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of a cable communications company, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceedings, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of such period; provided, however, that such receiver or trustee may apply for a transfer or assignment of such franchise, as provided in section 54-52(e), within 60 days of the appointment of such receiver or trustee, if duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises; and provided further, in case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the plant, with or without the appointment of a receiver or trustee, including or excluding the franchise granted under this article, such franchise as granted will be terminated and cancelled without further proceedings upon 30 days' written notice of termination served upon the cable communications company and the purchaser thereof, unless within such 30-day period, the purchaser shall apply to the commission for a transfer or assignment to it of the franchise as provided in section 54-52(e).

If the electors shall not confirm the franchise, the franchise shall be deemed to be void as of the date granted. Any franchise granted pursuant to this article is revocable for cause by the commission prior to its expiration where the cable communications company has failed substantially to comply with any provision or requirement of this article or the provisions of its franchise agreement. The commission may give a written notice containing full particulars as to the provision or requirement with which compliance is claimed deficient and allow such cable communications company 60 days to comply. At the expiration of such 60 days, such franchise shall be deemed terminated and revoked, without further commission action, unless such cable communications company shall request a hearing before the commission upon its alleged failure to substantially comply with any provision or requirement of this article or of its franchise agreement. The hearing shall be public, with the cable communications company being permitted to fully participate therein, including the right to introduce testimony and exhibits and to examine and cross examine witnesses.

Any cost to the township or the commission in removing such property from the streets, alleys, public rights-of-way or public places shall be claimed against such person under the performance bond required under section 54-57(a). 
(f)  For failure to complete system construction in accordance with the agreed upon timetable in the franchise agreement, unless the commission specifically approves the delay by motion or resolution due to the occurrence of conditions beyond the grantee's control, for each year's delay in construction, the township will take two years off the initial 15-year term of the franchise agreement.

The township board may refuse to grant the petition, or may grant the petition, and may prescribe the terms and conditions upon which the petition will be granted and may require the written acceptance of such terms and conditions by the petitioners. The work will be done at the expense of the property owners unless otherwise stipulated by the township board, and any and all extensions shall be subject to the provisions of this article. Plans submitted by a petitioning property owner shall be sufficiently detailed to determine whether the extension of the water system is compatible with the water system master plan as defined by the township's hydraulic model. The plans shall conform with the engineering standards ordinance (chapter 42, article IV of the Oxford Charter Township Code of Ordinances). 
(b)  The water system and all water lines, including the supply line and associated appurtenances from the curb cock box upstream in the system, are under the exclusive control of the township board, and all persons other than authorized agents and employees of the township are forbidden to disturb, tap, change, obstruct access to or interfere with them in any way. 
(c)  Any person installing water mains and associated appurtenances at his own expense shall first submit complete plans and specifications, prepared, signed and sealed by a registered civil engineer, for such work, to the township engineer for review and approval, and upon installation such shall be inspected and approved by the township engineer and required county and state agencies before such water mains and appurtenances are put in operation. All construction and extensions of any water main and appurtenances shall conform to the construction standards and guidelines as set forth in the engineering standards ordinance (chapter 42, article IV of the Oxford Charter Township Code of Ordinances). Any extension of the water main shall conform with the master plan for the water system as prepared by the township engineer, and any extension shall be constructed in a manner that will facilitate practicable extension of the water system as determined by the township engineer. Unless already paid and deposited under the requirements of the township zoning ordinance or other township ordinances, a person installing a water main shall deposit into an escrow account an amount sufficient to cover the projected cost of reviewing plans and specifications. The escrow amount shall be set forth in appendix A. 
(d)  Any person whose property lies outside of an unincorporated portion of the township desiring to connect to the water system will be subject to one (1) times the normal connection fees and one (1) times the normal quarterly billing rate. Such parties outside the unincorporated township interested in connecting to the water system shall prior to connection obtain a written franchise agreement as required by the state constitution from the governmental body in which the property is located permitting the township to provide water services to the property. The proposed connection shall be submitted to the township board for review and a decision within the sole discretion of the township board. The owner of the property shall pay into escrow an amount to cover the township's costs for negotiating and reviewing the terms of the franchise agreement with the governmental body in which the property is located. 
(e)  If any new structure occurs within an area for which connection to the water supply system is practicable, such structure shall be required to connect to the water supply system. The determination of practicability will take into consideration the application of associated costs of connection, and location of the structure with respect to the defined water district, and this determination shall be the responsibility of the township board; provided, however that all new subdivision developments within the water district where such subdivisions, including successive phases thereof, consist of 15 lots or more, as defined by section 46-163(c), shall, where capacity exists, connect to the water supply system. 
(f)  No premises shall be granted a certificate of occupancy or be allowed to connect to the water system until the township has received and has approved (pursuant to review by the township engineer) as-built construction drawings for that specific portion of the water system that was constructed for the purpose of providing water service to that premises.

Sec. 62-36. - Service pipes, supply pipes and connections. 
(a)  Before any connection shall be made to any water main, application for such connection shall be made in writing to the township by the owner of the premises to be served, with payment made as established by the township board at appendix A and a connection permit secured. Such applications shall be made on forms provided by the township. By application, the owner, user and/or applicant for a water connection permit by such application agrees to abide by all provisions of this article, water system related rules and regulations of the township board, and county standards and specifications in all respects. The application must be accompanied by the fees specified by township board resolution, which will be returned and the application shall not be granted. The township board, by resolution, may establish rules and regulations related to applications for water service, fees related to installation of such service (including but not limited to engineering review fees, administrative fees, inspection fees, and tapping fees), and the requirements relating to supply pipes, service pipes, gate valves, meter connections, water supply pipes, and the connection thereof. 
(b)  Except as may otherwise be required or allowed by the county, all new meter installations shall have a remote reading register. The cost of this shall be included in the charge for installation of supply pipe and meters, referred to as the "county water connection charge." 
(c)  Except for fire hydrants, water shall be taken and used only through metered water service pipes under the supervision of the township where township water service is available, and no connection through which water may pass from one property to another shall be permitted even though the ownership of both properties shall be the same. 
(d)  Excessive or unnecessary use or waste of water, whether caused by carelessness or by defective or leaky plumbing or fixtures, is strictly prohibited. For disregard of or repeated violation of this requirement, after five days' written notice from the township, the water may be turned off by the township; provided, however, if in the sole judgment of the township the excessive use of water is so substantial that five days' notice would result in a significant loss of water, no prior notice is required. 
(e)  No unauthorized person shall interfere in any way with the supply pipe installed by the township. No unauthorized person is permitted to turn water on or off at the curb cock. 
(f)  All township water used on any premises where a meter is installed must pass through the meter. No bypassing of the meter will be permitted. 
(g)  The refusal or neglect of the owner to equip the premises with the service pipe connections, utilities and/or fixtures as approved by the township shall be sufficient grounds for discontinuance of township water supply to the premises or structure. 
(h)  Those structures connected to private water wells, which wells have developed contamination by any contaminant above the acceptable safe drinking water levels adopted and/or established by the state department of environmental quality, shall, where practicable, connect to the water supply system at such time as the township board determines the water supply system is available to such structure and the existing well shall be deemed abandoned at such time as the connection to the water system occurs. Upon connection to the water supply system, each private and public water well servicing such premises or structures shall be disconnected and abandoned in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations of the state, county and township to prevent contamination of the water supply system. 
(i)  All premises or structures which are on a private or public well shall connect to the water supply system, where available, at such time as the private or public well is abandoned for that premises of structure. The private or public well shall be abandoned in accordance with the standards of the county drain commissioner and/or county health division. Findings: the presence of arsenic contaminants in drinking water constitutes a health hazard requiring the filtration and treatment of all such water in order for it to be potable. By reason of private water wells sampled in the township in 2006 showing arsenic levels above the maximum concentration levels (MCL), through the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the county, the township constructed a water treatment plant, the purpose of which was the removal of arsenic contaminants from the water provided by the water system. 
As a matter of public health the owner of a structure requiring potable water shall be required to connect such structure to and obtain water from the water system if the connection is practicable when a new structure is constructed which is not connected to an existing structure which has a potable water supply and, in the case of existing structures requiring potable water, upon the private well servicing that structure becoming abandoned. 
(j)  Upon connection to the water system, the water well on the premises used or previously used for obtaining potable water shall be abandoned in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations of the state, county and township to prevent contamination of the water supply system.

(6)  Debt service charge. A charge as determined by the township board by resolution from time to time to assist in bond debt reduction, the proceeds of which may be applied as provided for in subsection 62-34(c). 
(b)  Payment of charges for water supply services. 
(1)  The use of water from the water supply system at any new construction shall only be permitted upon the payment of required charges identified in subsection (a) of this section to the township. The use of water from the water supply system shall not be permitted and the township shall not accept payment on a connection charge until the basement and/or foundation of a new construction has been inspected and approved by the township. At such time as the basement and/or foundation of a new construction has been inspected and approved, the township will accept payment for a connection fee and allow the use of water from the water supply system at the new construction. 
(2)  At the time a person or entity obtains final approval of a site plan pursuant to Zoning Ordinance No. 67A for any new construction, requiring a site plan the township will conditionally reserve the required number REUs of capacity in the water supply system for that new construction for as long as the site plan for the new construction remains valid and capacity is available. For all other construction that does not require a site plan under Zoning Ordinance No. 67A, at the time a person or entity pays for and obtains a building permit for any new construction, the township will conditionally reserve the required number REUs of capacity in the water supply system for that new construction. To continue this reservation, the person or entity must obtain inspection and approval of the completed basement and/or foundation of the construction by the township within 90 days of the date the building permit was issued. If the person or entity does not obtain said inspection and approval within 90 days, the township will have no further obligation to reserve the number of REUs of capacity for the construction. The person or entity shall pay for such reserved capacity at the water rates at the time of payment as established by the township board. 
(3)  Change in premise use. Where a structure consists of multiple premises and there is a change in the use of a premises within a structure, which new use will have a greater number of residential equivalency units assigned to it under the unit factor chart as adopted by the township board, where there is a separate meter for the premises a new connection charge shall be paid for that premise equal to the base connection charge for the new use of the premise less the cumulative base connection charges previously paid for that premises and where there is not a separate meter for the premises and the premises receives its water supply through a common meter to the structure, which structure has multiple premises, a new base connection charge shall be paid for the premises equal to the sum of all base connection charges for all the premises serviced by a common meter given the new use less the cumulation of base connection charges previously paid for all premises within the structure served by a common meter. 
(4)  Inspection and approval fees. Those fees as provided for in appendix A. 
(c)  Usage charges. Usage charges shall be billed and collected quarterly or more often as determined by resolution of the township board.

(b)  Any water user desiring to participate in the sprinkling meter program shall make written application to the township for the installation of the sprinkling meter. If the department determines that the applicant is eligible, then the applicant shall purchase a sprinkling meter from the OCWRC office. The applicant shall also install any other appurtenances, such as a cross connection/backflow preventer, that are required by the OCWRC office. If the township board determines that the administration of the sprinkling meter program imposes costs upon the township, then the township is authorized to set a fee for processing applications by resolution of the township board to defray such costs. The function of such sprinkling meter shall be to measure the quantity of water used that is not discharged into the township sewer system. All such meters shall be installed inside the premises. 
All sprinkling meters shall be permanently plumbed into the water system of the premises as mandated by the OCWR commissioner. No sprinkling meters shall be hooked to spigots or faucets. In the event that sewer usage is billed or allocated according to usage (as opposed to capacity), then no premises shall have its sewer usage adjusted unless any sprinkling meter upon such premises is in compliance with this article. The applicant shall contact the department in advance of the placement of a sprinkling meter to verify its location and compliance with these provisions. 
(c)  No water user participating in the sprinkling meter program shall cause or allow any water measured by the sprinkling meter to be discharged into the township sewer system. Any violation of this provision shall be a violation of this section; in addition to any other penalties set forth in this section or by law, such violation shall subject the water user to any sewer usage charge for the entire water measured by the sprinkling meter since its initial installation and, in addition, a penalty of ten percent shall apply. 
(d)  Meter(s) and remote reader(s) shall remain the property of the township or its designated agent and will at all times remain under its control, and subject to the rules and regulations established from time-to-time by the township water system ordinance. 
(e)  The owner of any premises where a meter is installed shall be held responsible for its care and protection from freezing or damage or interference by any person. 
(f)  All persons are forbidden to interfere with or move a water meter from any service connection without first receiving permission from the township. No person shall remove or break any seal on meters or bypass valves. 
(g)  In the event a meter should fail, it shall be the responsibility of the premises owner to have the meter repaired or replaced within 90 days. In the event a meter has failed to operate, the premises shall be billed at a rate equal to the greatest water use measurement of that meter taken over the preceding four quarterly billing periods. 
(h)  No determination of water usage made under the sprinkling meter program shall apply retroactively or entitle a water supply system user to a determination of usage prior to the connection of the sprinkling meter.

The owner of premises from which sanitary sewerage no longer emanates for the reason that the premises is not occupied because of the damaged condition of the premises caused by fire, windstorm or some other disaster, may apply to the township to terminate, prospectively from the date of verification by the licensed contractor as provided in subsection (b)(2) below, the required payment of the sewer usage charge, which sewer usage charge will be terminated by the township ("termination") provided: 
(1)  The owner or the owner's representative has obtained from the township a demolition permit for the demolition of all or a part of the premises, and there has been a revocation by the township of the certificate of occupancy for the premises. 
(2)  The sewer lead from the premises has been capped and sealed by a licensed contractor so that no sanitary sewerage discharges from the sewer lead and such capping and sealing is verified by the licensed contractor. 
(3)  All requests for termination of any required amount of a sewer usage charge shall only be considered after the effective date of the ordinance amendment from which this section is derived and after the conditions set forth in this section have been met. Any requests for reimbursement due to fire, windstorm or some other disaster prior to the effective date of the ordinance amendment shall not be considered. 
(c)  Resumption of sewer service. At the request of the owner of the premises (subject to the additional condition that may be required in subsection (d) below in the event a request for resumption is made more than 360 days after termination), sewer service and sewer usage charges will be resumed provided that the following conditions have been met: 
(1)  The sewer lead is uncapped and connected to the sanitary sewer system and such work has been inspected, approved and verified by a licensed contractor to be in compliance with the applicable codes, and any applicable permit and inspection fees are paid. 
(2)  A certificate of occupancy for the premises has been obtained. 
(d)  Request for resumption of sewer service more than 360 days after termination. In addition to meeting the conditions set forth in subsection (c) above, any request for resumption of sewer service on a date later than 360 days after the date of termination will also be referred to the water and sewer committee, which shall determine whether the premises was abandoned during the time period of the termination. If such a finding is made, the owner shall be required to pay a base connection charge in addition to the charges described in subsection (c) above as a condition for resumption of sewer service. 
Any person, persons, firms, or corporation who violates any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, may be punished by a fine not exceeding $500.00 or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed 90 days, or both such fine and imprisonment at the discretion of the court. Each day that a violation is permitted to exist shall constitute a separate violation.

DIVISION 2. - RATES, CHARGES AND FEES 
 
Sec. 62-111. - Establishment and determination of charges. 
(a)  Connection charges. In order to finance and meet the bond obligation of the township for the construction of the township sanitary sewer system, including that portion of the system servicing any premises, and in order to pay for sewer system construction and operating expenses, there shall be a charge for any premises connected to the sewer system, as provided in this division whether directly connected or indirectly connected through a privately owned sewer ("connection charge") based upon the unit or fraction thereof, by type of premises ("unit factor"), times the base connection charge, which unit factor and base connection charge shall be established from time to time by resolution of the township board as set forth in appendix A of this article. For a single-family residential premises connected to the sewer system where the lateral adjacent to the premises has been constructed and paid for solely by private sources on behalf of such premises, the sewer connection charge shall equal the amount established by resolution of the township board as set forth in appendix A of this article. The township shall also adopt by resolution a unit factor schedule which is set forth in appendix A of this article. 
(b)  Usage charges. There shall be a charge for the use of the sanitary sewer system for sewage disposal services which shall be an amount each quarter times the unit factor or fraction thereof assigned the premises, which amount and unit factor shall be determined from time to time by resolution of the township board, as is set forth in appendix A of this article. 
(c)  Use of single meter for nonresidential premises. Nonresidential premises which are connected to a public water system may have sewer usage charges determined by the same water meter utilized to determine water usage charges relating to the public water system. Residential premises include single-family homes, multiple-family housing units and mobile homes. The rate for metered sewer usage shall be in an amount as set forth in appendix A of this article. 
(d)  Payment of sewer connection charges. 
(1)  New construction. All new construction shall pay the sewer connection charge prior to obtaining the township building permit; provided, however, in order to facilitate the financing of new construction, payment of the sewer connection charge may be made by paying not less than 50 percent of the charge as a condition to issuing the building permit, not less than 25 percent of the charge as a condition to a rough plumbing inspection, and the balance of 25 percent as a condition to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(2)  Existing premises. Existing premises have the option of paying the sewer connection charge in cash or by making installment payments of all or part of the sewer connection charge over a period of five years, together with interest upon any unpaid balance at an annual rate as determined by resolution of the township board from time to time for installment sewer connection charges, as set forth in appendix A of this article. All payments will be first applied against interest and the balance of the payments applied against principal. The sewer connection installment charges will be set forth as part of the quarterly sewer bill. All or part of the sewer connection charge may be paid off without penalty. This provision is intended to allow existing premises to extend their payments for a maximum period of five years in order to provide sanitary sewers to all regardless of economic status. 
(e)  Deferred payment of connection charge for elderly, and disabled. An owner of any premises against which a sewer connection charge has been levied who is 65 years of age or older or who is totally and permanently disabled, a citizen of the U.S., a resident of this state for five or more years, and the sole owner of such premises for five or more years is eligible for the deferment of payment of the lateral benefit charge, under state law. Application for this deferred payment is to be made in accordance with state law, being Public Act No. 225 of 1976 (MCL 211.761 et seq.). This provision shall not be more restrictive than is allowed by state law as it may be amended from time to time. 
(f)  Determination of unit factor for new construction. For premises to be newly constructed, the township building inspector shall assign the appropriate unit factor to determine the amount of the new premises' connection charge and usage charge. 
(1)  Written notice from building inspector. For premises other than single-family homes, the building inspector shall provide the premises owner or other responsible person a written notice of the unit factor assignment identifying the type or use of the premises and the corresponding unit factor assignment. The notice shall also inform the owner or responsible party that the party has 30 days following the date of the notice to review the unit factor determination with the building inspector, and further notice that should the determination remain unchanged following the meeting with the building inspector, the owner or responsible party has an additional ten days after the date of the written confirmation of the determination to file with the township clerk a request for review of this determination by the township's water and sewer committee. 
(2)  Meeting. The building inspector shall, if requested, provide an opportunity for the owner or responsible party to be heard on objections to the determination within 30 days of the date of the notice. After review with the owner or responsible party, the building inspector shall forthwith provide a written confirmation of the unit factor determination to the owner. 
(3)  Township water and sewer committee review. The owner, if aggrieved by such determination, may, within ten days of the building inspector's written confirmation, file with the township clerk a written request for review by township water and sewer committee. If no request is made to the township clerk within the ten-day period, the building inspector's determination shall become final. The township water and sewer committee shall thereafter review a timely request to review the building inspector's determination within 45 days of the filing of the request to review and shall have the authority to modify in whole or in part the determination made by the building inspector. The decision of the township water and sewer committee shall be final and shall be furnished to the premises owner or other responsible person in writing by the township clerk. 
(g)  Change in premises use. If the use of a premises is changed after the time the premises' initial connection charge and/or usage charges are determined and assessed, the township shall adjust the connection charge and/or usage charge pursuant to the unit factor schedule to reflect the amended use of the premises. 
(1)  For usage charges, the amended unit factor rate shall be adjusted for the quarterly billing date one full quarterly billing period after the township has been alerted of the change. 
(2)  For a connection charge, if the unit factor is adjusted higher than the original unit factor utilized to determine the initial connection charge, and the premises has paid the initial connection charge in full, the premises shall pay the difference between the initial connection charge and the adjusted connection charge based on the change in unit factor. In addition, if the unit factor is increased above the amount of the adjusted connection charge, the premises shall likewise pay the difference between a prior adjusted connection charge and the new higher adjusted connection charge. 
(3)  If a structure that has a single connection to the sewer system contains multiple premises, a change in a unit factor triggering an adjustment in a usage charge and/or connection charge under this section shall be determined based upon a change to the aggregate unit factor of the whole structure. 
(h)  Notice of increase in unit factor. In the event of a determination by the township that an increase in the unit factor for any given premises, as set forth above, required due to an increased use capacity, the township building inspector shall prepare and forward by mail to the owner or responsible party of the premises a notice of the increased unit factor. The notice shall contain the following: 
(1)  The present unit factor assignment based on existing or previous usage. 
(2)  A statement setting forth the nature of the increased use capacity necessitating a unit factor adjustment. 
(3)  A statement of the proposed increased unit factor assignment for the premises based upon the increased use capacity and a description as to how the unit factor increase will result in an adjustment of connection charges and usage charges. 
(4)  A statement that the increased unit factor assignment shall become effective with resulting changes to connection charges and usage charges prior to the time a new certificate of occupancy will be granted for the change in use and that the new certificate of occupancy will not be granted until the additional connection charges are paid. 
(5)  Notice to the owner or responsible party that if the amounts due are delinquent for more than six months, the amount shall be added to the tax rolls and collected pursuant to the general property tax laws. 
(6)  Notice to the owner or responsible party that the party has 30 days following the date of the notice to review the increased unit factor determination with the building inspector and further notice that should the determination remain unchanged following the meeting with the building inspector, whereby the building inspector confirms the determination in writing, the owner or responsible party has an additional ten days after the date of the written confirmation of the determination to file with the township clerk a request for review of this determination by the township's water and sewer committee. 
(i)  Building inspector to hear objections to determinations. The building inspector shall, if requested, provide an opportunity for the owner or responsible party to be heard on objections to the determination within 30 days of the date of the notice. After review with the owner or responsible party, the building inspector shall forthwith provide a written confirmation of the determination of increase to the owner and to the township water and sewer committee. The owner, if aggrieved by such determination, shall have an additional ten days thereafter to file with the township clerk a written request for review by the township water and sewer committee. If no request is filed within the time allowed, the building inspector's determination shall become final. 
(j)  Township water and sewer committee review. From the time of filing of a request for review with the clerk, the township water and sewer committee shall thereafter within 45 days review the building inspector's determination and shall have the authority to modify in whole or in part the determination. The decision of the township water and sewer committee shall be final and shall be furnished to the building inspector and premises owner or other responsible party in writing by the township clerk. 
(k)  Delinquent charges. All delinquent connection charges and usage charges as established in this section shall be made a lien on the premises and on September 1 of each year, the person charged with the management of the sewage disposal system shall certify any such charges which have been delinquent six months or more to the township supervisor, who shall enter such delinquency upon the next tax roll against the premises for which such services have been furnished, and such charges shall be collected and such lien shall be enforced in the same manner as provided in respect to taxes assessed upon such roll.

Sec. 62-113. - Utilization of revenues. 
The rates established for connection and usage charges are estimated to be sufficient to provide for the payment of the expenses of administration and operation of the system and such expenses for the maintenance and rental thereof as may be necessary to preserve the system in good repair and working order, and to provide for such other expenditures and funds for the system as are required by this article. Rates shall be fixed and revised from time to time by resolution of the township board so as to produce the foregoing provisions. 
(1)  Revenues received from connection and usage charges shall be directed to the sewer fund, where such revenues shall be collected. These revenues shall be utilized for the following purposes: ;ol2; a. ..... Out of such revenues, there shall first be designated quarter-annually into a separate account an amount sufficient to pay the regular operational, maintenance, administrative and other related costs of the sewer system, and out of such account amounts shall be paid as necessary to the county drain commissioner pursuant to the terms and requirements of the operating agreement entered into between the drain commissioner and the township. ;ol2; b. 
(2)  All revenues in the sewer fund shall be deposited with a bank designated by the township board and shall be kept in a separate depository account distinct from the township's general fund. 
(3)  No free sewage disposal facilities or services shall be furnished to the township, or to any person, firm or corporation, public or private, or to any public agency or instrumentality. 
(Ord. No. 107A, art. VII, 1-12-2005)  
Sec. 62-114. - Prospective and retroactive reduction in service fees. 
(a)  Prospective reduction. 
(1)  Any premises utilized for a purpose other than a single-family home, using the sewer system and paying quarterly service fees based on a unit factor greater than one, pursuant to section 62-111(b), shall be entitled, upon a timely and proper request, to a reduction in sewer usage charges to a unit factor of one, provided the premises shall be unoccupied and the sewer system unused for a period of at least 90 days. 
(2)  If any premises will be unoccupied and the sewer system unused for a period of 90 days or more and the premises owner desires a reduction in sewer fees, it is the responsibility of the premises owner or person responsible for the payment of the usage charges to inform the township of the prospective period when the premises will be unoccupied and the sewer system unused. 
(3)  Once the township is informed the premises will be unoccupied and the sewer system unused for a period of at least 90 days, beginning on the due date of the next quarterly sewer service payment, the usage charge for that quarter, and for any prospective quarter or quarters when the premises remains unoccupied and the sewer system unused, shall be reduced to a unit factor of one. 
(4)  If the premises should become occupied during such a quarter or should the sewer system be used, it is the responsibility of the premises owner or person responsible for payment of the sewer usage charge to inform the township immediately of the change. The sewer usage rate charged before the reduction shall then resume from the date when the property is reoccupied or the sewer system used. The quarterly usage charge will be reinstated on a prorata basis for the portion of the quarter that the property is reoccupied and the sewer system is used. 
(5)  Failure to inform the township of reoccupancy of the premises shall be considered a violation of this article. The township shall have the authority to recover the amount of sewer usage charges and all costs and actual professional fees incurred, including attorney fees, expended in order to determine compliance with and to enforce the requirements of this article. The township shall also have the authority to execute a lien against the property upon which the premises are located equal to the amount of unrecovered sewer usage charges and all enforcement costs and fees. 
(b)  Retroactive reduction. 
(1)  Any premises utilized for a purpose other than a single-family home, using the sewer system and paying quarterly usage charges based on a unit factor greater than one, pursuant to section 62-111(b), shall be entitled, upon a timely and property request, to a credit, to be applied against future sewer usage charges, in an amount equal to the difference between a unit factor of one and the unit factor assessed to the sewer service user, provided the premises were unoccupied, and the sewer system unused, for a period of at least 90 days within one year of the request. 
(2)  In order to qualify for such a credit, the premises owner, or person responsible for payment of the sewer usage fee, shall provide sufficient substantial evidence corroborating the claim the premises were unoccupied and the sewer system unused. 
(3)  After the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, any premises owner or person responsible for payment of the sewer service fee, seeking a credit against future sewer usage charges for any 90-day period when the premises have been unoccupied and the sewer system unused (after the enactment of the ordinance from which this article is derived), must apply for the credit within one year of the date when the premises were last unoccupied and the sewer system unused. In order to qualify for a credit, the owner or other person must show sufficient good cause why he failed to provide the township with advance notice pursuant to this subsection (b) of this section and must provide sufficient evidence to corroborate a claim the premises were unoccupied and the sewer system unused. 
(4)  In no event, however, shall the amount of any credit exceed an amount credited to the township by the county or any other entity administering the sewer system. 
(5)  In addition to violations of other requirements of this article, any misrepresentation about a past period of vacancy in order to obtain a credit shall be considered a violation of this article. The township shall possess all of the legal remedies cited in section 62-87 if such a violation should occur. 
(Ord. No. 107A, art. VIII, 1-12-2005)  
Sec. 62-115. - Hardship deferments of lateral benefit charges and capital charges. 
(a)  Eligibility. 
(1)  A property owner shall not be considered to have a hardship under the provisions of this section if he owns tangible or intangible property having a market value in excess of $1,500.00, or if married and not separated from spouse, his or her property together with the tangible or intangible property of spouse exceeds the value of $2,000.00. The value of the homestead, occupied by the property owner as a home, shall not be included in determining the value of property under this section. The value of life insurance shall be computed at the cash surrender value available and payable upon demand and only that portion of the value thereof which is in excess of $1,000.00 shall be included in determining of the value of the property. If the health of the insured is such as to make continuance of the insurance desirable, the entire cash surrender value of life insurance is to be excluded from consideration. Household goods and wearing appeal shall not be considered, nor shall farm stock or implements, including but not limited to horses, cattle, poultry, power machinery and motor powered vehicles having a fair market value of less than $750.00, be considered. The interest of the property owners in an estate or trust as heir, devisee, legatee, or otherwise shall not be considered the property owner under the provisions of this section unless and until it has been distributed to him or is available to him or is available to him for disposition or expenditure by him. 
(2)  If the property owner has an income from all sources of more than the amount necessary to provide such person, or married couple, with a minimum subsistence which shall be determined, as near as possible, by the use of recognized current standards of the department of agriculture and the department of labor and industry of the federal government, such property owner shall not be considered to have a hardship under the provisions of this section. The premiums paid in any type of life insurance on the life of the property owner, or on the life of his or her spouse, which have been in force and effect for five years or more, by any beneficiary thereof therein provided, shall not be construed as income of the property owner. 
(b)  Application for deferred payments. Any owner of property who by reason of hardship as defined in subsection (a) of this section is unable to comply with the provisions of section 12753 of the Public Health Code (MCL 333.12753) and the provisions of section 62-113(a) may apply to the township supervisor for the deferral of all lateral benefit charges and capital charges. 
(c)  Determination of values. The township supervisor, upon the receipt of an application from a property owner who has a hardship as referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall ascertain the cash value of the premises and determine the nature and amount of all prior encumbrances of record and shall certify to the township board the difference between the cash value and the value of the encumbrances of record upon the premises. The term "cash value," as used in this subsection, shall be as defined in section 27 of the General Property Tax Act (MCL 211.27). If the difference between cash value and all of the encumbrances of record is greater than the amount of the payment method, including debt service charges, and the township's costs as denoted in subsection (e) of this section, then the property owner shall be determined to be qualified for deferred payment of the lateral benefit charges and capital charges. 
(d)  Execution of mortgage. The owner of record of the premises shall, as a condition precedent to being permitted to defer the payment of the lateral benefit charges and capital charges, execute a mortgage in recordable form upon the premises denoting the interest that township, as mortgagee, has in the premises, and that the mortgage will be payable on or before death, or in any event, upon the sale or transfer of the property owner's interest in the property. 
(e)  Township's cost. The property owner shall also be responsible for the direct costs of the township in connection with processing the property owner's application for deferred payments, such as, by way of illustration and not by way of limitation, costs of recording the mortgage, costs of title insurance insuring the mortgage interest of the township and any direct legal fees in connection with review of the foregoing and preparation of the mortgage to be recorded. Such costs shall be added to the amount due and owing upon the mortgage to be executed by the property owners.

Sec. 62-116. - Quarterly charges on delinquent payment. 
Not withstanding any ordinances to the contrary prior to the adoption of this section amendment, all charges for sewerage disposal services prior to January 1, 2005, if not paid when due, shall have added to the amount thereof a penalty of ten percent, and in the event any charges for sewerage disposal services shall not be paid within 30 days after the same becomes due, then the charges for said sewerage disposal service plus the ten percent penalty thereon shall earn interest at the rate of .005 percent per month until finally paid; from January 1, 2005 until September 15, 2007, all charges for sewerage disposal service, if not paid when due, shall have added to the amount thereon, a penalty of five percent, and in the event any charges for sewerage disposal services shall not be paid within 30 days after the same becomes due, then the charges for said sewerage disposal service plus the penalty amount thereon shall earn interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month, cumulated monthly, until finally paid; after September 15, 2007, all charges for sewerage disposal service, if not paid when due, shall have added to the amount thereon, upon the delinquency and then each quarter of a year that such charges and any penalty thereon remain unpaid, a penalty of $3.20; all delinquent charges, including interest and penalty, which are required of the township to be placed upon the tax role shall have an additional penalty added to the delinquent amount to be placed upon the tax rolls of five percent of the total amount due as provided in section 6.3.

Or see Appendix B. 
All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance with 40 C.F.R. part 136. 
(3)  The limitation for total PCB is non-detect. Total PCB shall not be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 608, and the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/l, unless a higher level is appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one or more samples indicate detectable levels of total PCB, the user shall be required to demonstrate compliance. For purposes of this section, this demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the total PCB concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a bmp in accordance with section 62-214. 
(4)  The limitation of mercury (Hg) is non-detect. Mercury (Hg) shall not be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 245.1, and the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/l, unless a higher level is appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one or more samples indicate detectable levels of mercury, the user shall be required to demonstrate compliance. For the purposes of this section, this demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the mercury concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with section 62-214. 
All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance 40 CFR Part 136. 
(5)  Compliance period. Within 30 days of the effective date of this article, the department shall notify all industrial user's operating under an effective wastewater discharge permit of the requirement to submit a compliance report within 180 days after the effective date of this article. The compliance report shall demonstrate the user's compliance or non-compliance with these limitations, and, in the event of non-compliance, include the submission of a plan and schedule for achieving compliance with the stated limitation. In no event shall a compliance schedule exceed 18 months from the effective date of this article. An industrial user who does not demonstrate compliance may petition the department for a second extension as part of an administrative consent order. The department shall include appropriate monitoring, reporting, and penalties into an administrative consent order that relates to a second extension, and shall enter into such an agreement only upon a good-faith showing by the industrial user of the actions taken to achieve compliance with this provision. 
(Ord. No. 74.002, § 5.2, 2-28-2007)  
Sec. 62-163. - National categorical pretreatment standards. 
All users shall comply with the applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards and requirements promulgated pursuant to the act as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Subchapter N, Effluent Guidelines and Standards, which are hereby incorporated by reference and with all other applicable standards and requirements, provided, that where a more stringent standard or requirement is applicable pursuant to State law or regulation, or to this article, then the more stringent standard or requirement shall be controlling. Affected dischargers shall comply with applicable reporting requirements under 40 C.F.R. part 403 and as established by the department. The national categorical pretreatment standards which have been promulgated as of the effective date of this section are delineated in Appendix A. 
(1)  Intake water adjustment. Industrial users seeking adjustment of National Categorical Pretreatment Standards to reflect the presence of pollutants in their intake water must comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 403.15. Upon notification of approval by the department, the adjustment shall be applied by modifying the permit accordingly. Intake water adjustments are not effective until incorporated into an industrial user's permit. 
(2)  Modification of national categorical pretreatment standards. The department may apply to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, whichever is appropriate, for authorization to grant removal credits in accordance with the requirements and procedures in 40 C.F.R. § 403.7. Such authorization may be granted only when the POTW treatment plant can achieve consistent removal for each pollutant for which a removal credit is being sought, provided, that any limitation of such pollutant(s) in the NPDES permit neither are being exceeded nor pose the prospect of being exceeded as a result of the removal credit being granted. Where such authorization is given to the department, any industrial user desiring to obtain such credit shall make an application to the department, consistent with the provisions of 40 C.F.R. § 403.7 and of this article. Any credits which may be granted under this section may be subject to modification or revocation as specified in 40 C.F.R. § 403.7, or as determined by the department. A requisite to the granting of any removal credit may be that the industrial user pay a surcharge based upon the amounts of such pollutants removed by the POTW, such surcharge being based upon fees or rates which the board may establish and, when appropriate, revise from time to time. Permits shall reflect, or be modified to reflect, any credit granted pursuant to this section. 
(3)  New sources. Industrial users who meet the new sources criteria shall install, maintain in operating condition, and 'start-up' all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time and not to exceed 90 days, new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards. 
(4)  Concentration and mass limits. When limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the department may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. Equivalent limitations shall be calculated in accordance with Sections 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c)(3) and/or 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c)(4) and shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of 33 U.S.C. §1317(d) and of this article. Industrial users will be required to comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
(5)  Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of categorical pretreatment standards-baseline report. Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under Section 40 C.F.R. § 403.6 (a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging into or scheduled to discharge into the Detroit POTW shall submit to the department a report containing the information listed in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(1-7). Where reports containing this information have already been submitted to the director or regional administrator in compliance with the requirement of 40 C.F.R. § 128.140(b), the industrial user will not be required to resubmit this information. At least 90 days before commencement of any discharge, each new source and any existing sources that become industrial users after the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall submit to the department a report which contains the information listed in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(1-5). In such report, new sources shall include information concerning the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall provide estimates of the information requested in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(4) and (5). 
(Ord. No. 74.002, § 5.3, 2-28-2007)  
Sec. 62-164. - Dilution prohibited. 
Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no user shall increase the use of process water, or in any way dilute or attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant specific limitation or requirement imposed by the township, the City of Detroit or by the State of Michigan.

ARTICLE 1
TITLE, PURPOSE, ENABLING AUTHORITY AND CONDITIONS OF ENACTMENT
1.1 Title. This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as The Charter Township of Oxford Zoning Ordinance.
1.2 Purpose. The purpose of this Ordinance is to provide in Oxford Charter Township for the establishment of districts which regulate the use of land and structures:
A. To meet the needs of the state's citizens for food, fiber, energy, and other natural resources, places of residence, recreation, industry, trade, service, and other uses of land;
B. To insure that use of the land shall be situated in appropriate locations and relationships;
C. To limit the inappropriate overcrowding of land and congestion of population, transportation systems, and other public facilities;
D. To facilitate adequate and efficient provision for transportation systems, sewage disposal, water, energy, education, recreation, and other public service and facility requirements;
E. And to promote public health, safety, and welfare.
For these purposes, the Board by this Ordinance divides the township into districts of such number, shape, and area as it considers best suited to carry out the act by which this Ordinance is authorized, and to achieve specific land management objectives and avert or solve specific land use problems, including the regulation of growth and development and the establishment of districts in areas subject to damage from flooding or erosion. This Ordinance regulating land development is also adopted for designating or limiting the location, height, number of stories, and size of dwellings, buildings, and structures that may be erected or altered, and the specific uses of such dwellings, buildings and structures; and the maximum number of families which may be housed in buildings, dwellings, and structures, erected or altered. The provisions of this Ordinance are intended to be uniform for each class of land or buildings, dwellings, and structure, throughout each district, but the provisions in one district may differ from those in other districts. The Board does not regulate nor control the drilling, completion, or operation of oil or gas wells, or other wells drilled for oil or gas exploration purposes and shall not have jurisdiction with reference to the issuance of permits for the location, drilling, completion, operation, or abandonment of those wells.
Charter Township of Oxford 1-2 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
1.3 Enabling Authority. This Ordinance is adopted pursuant to the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act (Act 110 of 2006, as amended) Township Planning Act (Act 168 of 1959, as amended), the Natural Resources and Environmental Policy Act (Act 451 of 1994, as amended), and the Mobile Home Commission Act (Act 96 of 1987 as amended). The Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, Public Act 110 of 2006, MCL 125.3101 et seq., as amended at this time or as may be amended in the future, is hereby adopted by reference and is made a part of this Zoning Ordinance just as if said Act, as amended at this time or may be amended in the future, were repeated word-for-word herein.
1.4 Scope and Construction of Regulations.
A. This Ordinance shall be liberally construed in such manner as to best implement its purpose. In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Ordinance, the requirements shall be held to be the minimum for the promotion of the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare.
B. No building or structure, or part thereof, shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed or altered, and no new use or change shall be made of any building, structure or land, or part thereof, except as permitted by the provisions of this Ordinance.
C. Where a condition imposed by a provision of this Ordinance upon the use of any lot, building, or structure is conflicting with a condition imposed by any other provision of this Ordinance, or by the provision of an ordinance adopted under any other law, the provision which is more restrictive shall govern.
D. Nothing within this Ordinance shall be construed to prevent compliance with an order by the appropriate authority to correct, improve, strengthen, or restore to a safe or healthy condition any part of a building or premises declared unsafe or unhealthy.
1.5 Relationship to Other Ordinances, Regulations or Agreements. This Ordinance is not intended to abrogate or annul any ordinance, rule, regulation, permit, easement, covenant or other private agreement previously adopted, issued or entered into and not in conflict with the provisions of this Ordinance.
However, where the regulations of this Ordinance are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements that other such ordinances, rules, regulations, permits, easements, covenants or other private agreements, the requirements of this Ordinance shall govern.
1.6 Vested Right. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be interpreted or construed to give rise to any permanent vested right in the continuation of any particular use, district, zoning classification or permissible activity therein. Any such use, district, zoning classification or activity is hereby declared to be subject to subsequent
Charter Township of Oxford 1-3 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
amendment, change or modification as may be necessary to the preservation or protection of the public health, safety and welfare.
1.7 Validity and Severability. This Ordinance and the various parts, sentences, paragraphs, sections and clauses it contains are hereby declared to be severable. Should any part, sentence, paragraph, section or clause be declared unconstitutional or invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, such judgment shall not affect the validity of the Ordinance as a whole or any part thereof, other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
Furthermore, should the application of any provision of this Ordinance to a particular property, building or structure be adjudged invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect the application of said provision to any other property, building or structure in the Township, unless otherwise stated in the judgment.
1.8 Repealer. The Zoning Ordinance text and map adopted by Oxford Charter Township on November 2, 1988, and all amendments thereto, shall be repealed on the effective date of this Ordinance. The repeal of the above Ordinance and its amendments does not affect or impair any act done, offense committed or right accruing, accrued or acquired, or any liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred prior to the time enforced, prosecuted or inflicted.
1.9 Effective Date. The effective date of this Ordinance shall depend on whether the Ordinance is requested to be submitted to the Township electors for approval.

3.4 Intent of Districts. The intent and purpose of each district is set forth as follows:
A. AG, Agriculture. The Agricultural Districts are intended to provide areas where farming, dairying, raising of animals, forestry, raising of nursery stock, and similar rural activities can coexist with rural residential development on acreage homesites. These areas are not expected to be serviced by public utilities, such as sanitary sewers, and their preservation will enhance the Township's overall character and prevent premature, scattered development.
B. SF-1, 2 and 3, Suburban Farms. The Suburban Farms districts are intended to have a low population and development density in order to protect areas that have significant topography, scenic beauty or other unique natural resources that should be preserved and enhanced. It is further the intent of the Suburban Farms districts to foster a residential environment for individuals and families that is more open and rural, and at a lower density than the Single-Family Residential districts. Sanitary sewer service is not anticipated to be available within the Suburban Farms districts.
Charter Township of Oxford 3-5 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
C. R-1A, 1, 2 and 3, Single-Family Residential. The intent of the Single-Family Residential districts is to provide districts in which the principal land use is single-family residential, along with those uses which are compatible with a single-family residential environment and are customarily accessory to or supportive of such uses. A reasonable range of lot sizes is envisioned which will provide a variety of desirable and economically feasible housing opportunities for all members of the general public. Certain other private and public uses are also intended for these districts, subject to conditions which will insure their compatibility with the main use and character of these districts.
D. RM, Multiple-Family Residential. The intent of the Multiple-Family Residential district is to provide sites for two-family and multiple-family residential land use, along with those uses which are compatible with a multiple-family residential environment and are customarily accessory to or supportive of such uses. These districts are intended to serve the Townships limited needs for higher density residential land use. Such districts shall serve as zones of transition between non-residential districts and lower density single-family districts, and shall have access to major thoroughfares and centralized sewer and water facilities. Certain other private and public uses are also intended for these districts, subject to conditions which will insure their compatibility with the main use and character of these districts.
E. MHC, Manufactured Housing Community. The intent of the Manufactured Housing Community district is to provide districts of such size and location as will encourage the development of quality manufactured housing communities, in areas of the Township having access to major thoroughfares and centralized sewer and water facilities, and otherwise protecting the health, safety and welfare of manufactured housing community residents in the Charter Township Oxford.
F. C-1, Local Commercial. The Local Commercial districts are intended to provide a limited number of locations for clusters of retail stores and personal service establishments for the everyday convenience of the nearby residential neighborhoods. In order to protect nearby residential areas, all C-1 uses must be conducted within a completely enclosed building.
G. C-2, General Commercial. The General Commercial districts are intended to provide sites for more intensive and more diversified business types that would typically serve community and regional trade areas and might have a negative impact on adjoining residential areas because of intensity or outdoor activities.
H. O, Office. The intent of the Office districts is to provide locations in the Township for professional offices and related uses of a lower-intensity
Charter Township of Oxford 3-6 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
nature than those found in the Townships commercial and industrial districts, developed in a fashion that is compatible with neighboring land uses. Such districts shall serve as zones of transition between commercial/industrial districts and residential areas. It is intended that such uses have access to major thoroughfares and centralized sewer and water facilities.
I. RO, Research-Office. The Research-Office districts are intended to provide sites for uses which combine research, office, manufacturing, and/or educational activities within the same building or group of buildings in a campus or planned development atmosphere. All activities within the Research-Office Districts are intended to occur within completely enclosed buildings to that there will be no external physical effects on adjoining properties in other districts.
J. I-1, Light Industrial. The Light Industrial districts are intended to accommodate certain industrial, research and warehousing activities whose external physical effects are minimal, plus wholesale and intensive service activities of a nature that does not justify their inclusion in any commercial use district. It is also the intent of this Article to encourage the development of planned industrial parks characterized by principal uses which are located in a building on a landscaped site, served by adequate off-street parking, loading, and screening of adjacent districts.
K. I-2, General Industrial. The General Industrial districts are intended to accommodate large scale assembly and fabrication activities, including specialized industrial operations whose external physical effects could adversely affect surrounding uses and districts in the absence of special review and discretionary approval by The Planning Commission. The General Industrial districts are also intended to permit manufacturing, compounding, and processing of products from raw materials only by special approval.
L. R, Recreation. The Recreation districts are intended to allow, with regulation, public and private recreational use of lands with such amenities as lakes, streams, pronounced topography, woodlands, wetlands, flood plains and similar natural features.

ARTICLE 4
SPECIAL LAND USES
4.1 Intent. In addition to permitted uses specified in each zoning district, there are certain other uses which may be necessary or desirable to allow in certain locations in certain districts. However, due to their impacts on neighboring uses or public facilities, there is a need to carefully regulate them with respect to their location for the protection of the community. These uses may have to be established in a district where they cannot be reasonably allowed as a permitted use without meeting certain specified conditions. It is the intent of this Section to provide the necessary regulations to address such uses, to be referred to as "special land uses." It is further the intent to provide the Planning Commission with a set of standards upon which to make decisions with respect to special land uses.
4.2 Authority. The Planning Commission shall have the power to approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove, all special land uses.
4.3 Application. A request for special land use approval shall be made to the Planning Commission upon an application form provided by the Building Department. Said application for the approval of a special land use shall be made by an owner, lessee or other person with a legal interest in the property and who has the owner's consent, in writing, to file the application.
4.4 Procedures. An application for a special land use shall be processed as follows:
A. The applicant may request a pre-application conference with Township staff.
B. The applicant submits completed application form and a site plan prepared in accordance with Article 12.

H. The Planning Commission shall review the special land use request in consideration of the general standards listed in Section 4.5.
I. The Planning Commission, in its sole discretion, shall take one of the following actions:
1. Approve the special land use.
2. Approve the special land use with conditions. Such conditions shall be reasonable and related to the impacts of the proposed use, considered necessary to insure compliance with the standards of this Zoning Ordinance and the criteria for findings of fact listed under Section 4.5, and are hereby determined to be a valid exercise of the police power to protect the health, safety and welfare of adjacent property owners and the Township overall.
3. Table the request and direct the applicant to provide any additional information necessary to make a decision, or direct Township staff to conduct any additional analysis.
4. Deny the special land use request if the Planning Commission determines that the special land use request does not meet the standards of this Zoning Ordinance or the criteria for findings of fact listed under Section 4.5, or will tend to be injurious to the public health, safety and welfare or to the orderly development of the Township.
5. The decision of the Planning Commission shall be incorporated in a statement of conclusions, or findings of fact, relative to the special land use under consideration. The statement of conclusions, or findings of fact, shall be incorporated in the Planning Commissions motion, and recorded in the official meeting minutes. Any decision which denies a request or imposes conditions upon its approval shall specify the basis for the denial or the conditions imposed.
4.5 Findings of Fact. The Planning Commission shall review each case individually and make findings of fact relative to the following criteria and, as applicable, the standards contained in Article 5.
A. The proposed special land use must be compatible with adjacent uses of land in terms of location, size and character and will have no negative impact on adjacent property or the surrounding neighborhood; and,
1. Will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended character of the general vicinity and will not change the
Charter Township of Oxford 4-3 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
essential character of the area.
2. Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing uses or uses reasonably anticipated in the future.
3. Will be an improvement in relation to property in the immediate vicinity and to the Township as a whole.
B. The proposed special land use must be consistent with and promote the intent and purpose of this Zoning Ordinance and other applicable codes.

Charter Township of Oxford 5-1 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
ARTICLE 5
USE REGULATIONS
5.1 Adult Regulated Uses.
A. Findings and Purpose. The Planning Commission and Township Board of the Township find that adult regulated uses, as defined under Section 2.2 of this ordinance, pose the risk of imposing adverse secondary effects upon the Township and its residents, including but not limited to: increased crime within and in the vicinity of such uses, and the spread of communicable diseases. The Planning Commission and Township Board base this determination upon a review and consideration of the issues concerning adult regulated uses, including, but not limited to, the review and consideration of the experience of the City of Seattle as described in Northend Cinema v. Seattle, 585 P.,2d 1153 (Wash. 1978). Special control of these uses is necessary to insure that the adverse secondary effects of these uses will not interfere with the stable growth and development of the surrounding areas because of their potential disruptive and deleterious effect on adjacent properties, especially when constructed near residential uses and zones. These special controls are itemized in this section. The primary control or regulation is for the purpose of preventing a concentration of these uses in any one (1) area (i.e., not more than two (2) such uses within one thousand (1,000) feet of each other), due to the finding that the concentration of such uses can exacerbate the negative secondary effects of such uses and impair the health, safety, and welfare of surrounding communities and the uses therein.
B. Uses Constituting an Adult Regulated Use. Applicable uses considered under this section are as defined in Section 2.2 of this Ordinance.
C. Special Land Use Approval. All adult regulated uses shall be subject to special land use approval, pursuant to Article 4 of this Ordinance, and as modified by subsection 5.1(G).
D. Required Spacing. Adult regulated uses shall meet all of the following space requirements, measured horizontally between the nearest point of each property line:
1. At least one-thousand (1000) feet from any other adult regulated use;
2. At least five-hundred (500) feet from all churches, convents, temples and similar religious institutions;
Charter Township of Oxford 5-2 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
3. At least five-hundred (500) feet from all public, private or parochial nurseries, primary or secondary schools, playgrounds, licensed child care facilities, and hospitals;
4. At least five-hundred (500) feet from any one-family or multiple-family residential district or use; and
5. At least five-hundred (500) feet from any pool or billiard hall, coin-operated amusement center, indoor and outdoor recreation, dance club catering primarily to teenagers, movie theaters, and similar uses frequented by children and teenagers.
E. Special Site Design Standards.
1. Maximum size of the building shall be three thousand (3,000) square feet.
2. The building and site shall be designed, constructed and maintained so material such as a display, decoration, or sign depicting, describing, or relating to activities or merchandise within the structure cannot be observed by pedestrians, motorists on a public right-of-way or from an adjacent land use.
3. Adult regulated uses shall be located within a free-standing building. A shared or common wall structure or shopping center is not considered to be a free-standing building.
4. The style, shape and color of the building materials shall be subject to approval by the Planning Commission and Township Board in consideration of the similarity and compatibility of said structure with other structures within a reasonable proximity.
5. Either a landscape screen or a four and one-half (4-1/2) foot high brick or masonry wall shall be constructed to screen the parking lot from the adjacent public rights-of-way.
6. No person shall reside in or permit any person to reside in the premises of an adult regulated use.
7. No person operating an adult regulated use shall permit any person under the age of eighteen (18) to be on the premises of said use either as an employee or customer.
8. Adult regulated uses shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local licensing regulations. Initial and annual proof of such compliance shall be a condition of special use approval and the continuance thereof.
Charter Township of Oxford 5-3 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
F. Conditions. Prior to the granting of approval for the establishment of any adult use, the Planning Commission and Township Board may impose any such conditions or limitations upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, or operation of the controlled use as in its judgment may be reasonably necessary for the protection of the public interest. A performance guarantee may be required, to ensure that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith will be fulfilled.
G. Review Procedures.
1. Except as modified in this Subsection 5.1(G), the review and approval of proposed adult regulated uses shall be governed by the provisions set forth in this ordinance for the review and approval of any other special land use.
2. Standards for Approval. An application for the approval of an adult regulated use shall be governed by a consideration of the following factors, none of which shall be in isolation determinative except as provided herein:
a. The standards for the approval of a special land use under Article 4.
b. Whether the requirements of Subsections 5.1(D) and (E) are met. These requirements must be met in order for an adult regulated use to be approved and are, accordingly, determinative in isolation.
c. Whether the presence of an adult regulated use at the proposed location would alter the fundamental nature of the neighborhood.
d. Whether the proposed location of the proposed adult regulated use would make the proposed adult regulated use uniquely prone to present negative secondary effects, based on factors including but not necessarily limited to:
1. Whether the physical nature of the surrounding area renders it vulnerable to criminal activity based upon dense vegetation, broken sightlines, erratic lighting, or other factors.
2. Whether the proposed location is situated within or near an area of documented inordinate criminal activity.
Charter Township of Oxford 5-4 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
3. Whether the proposed location is served by pedestrian access systems that present a risk of spillover effects from inside the proposed adult regulated use, without providing enough consistent foot traffic to counteract any such effects.
e. Whether the proposed layout or configuration of the proposed adult regulated use would make the proposed adult regulated use uniquely prone to present negative secondary effects, based on factors including but not necessarily limited to:
1. Whether the proposed configuration would facilitate the movement of individuals in and out of the proposed use without detection, so as to enable discretely-performed criminal activity.
2. Whether the proposed configuration would tend to facilitate the interaction of persons within the proposed adult regulated use with persons outside the proposed adult regulated use.
f. Whether the proposed adult regulated use would present an undue burden on public services and/or infrastructure, and in particular whether the proposed adult regulated use, in the proposed location, would be prone to create undue traffic congestion after events which are likely to feed traffic to an adult regulated use, such as concerts and sporting events. The Planning Commission may require a traffic study as provided in this ordinance.
3. The Township shall review all applications under this Subsection within 30 days of the Townships receipt of a complete application for approval.
4. Any appeal of a Planning Commission decision under this Subsection to the Zoning Board of Appeals, and any request for a variance, shall be heard by the Zoning Board of Appeals within 30 days of the Townships receipt of a complete appeal and/or application.
5. The Township shall take all reasonable efforts to ensure the prompt judicial review of any Zoning Board of Appeals decision regarding an application made under this subsection.
5.2 Agribusiness. Agribusiness uses, such as but not limited to, cider mills, farmers markets (not including roadside stands for products grown on the same property),

farm dairies, pick-your-own farms, commercial greenhouses, private hunting clubs and game shooting preserves shall be subject to the following standards:
A. All such uses shall be located on a paved, major or secondary thoroughfare unless the use is seasonal in nature and has no permanent buildings for use by the public.
B. All buildings, any equipment, materials or produce being stored or for sale shall be set back from all property lines in accordance with the Schedule of Regulations of Section 3.7 for the district in which the use is located.
C. One (1) non-illuminated sign, not exceeding a total of thirty-two (32) square feet and eight (8) feet in height, is permitted per parcel in single ownership and for all agribusiness uses on that same parcel.
D. Adequate off-street parking shall be provided to serve the expected number of patrons and shall have at least a gravel surface properly graded and dust-free at all times. In determining the adequacy of the number of spaces being proposed, the Planning Commission shall compare the proposed use to similar uses.
E. Whenever the proposed use is adjacent to a district which permits residential uses, a ten (10) foot wide landscaped greenbelt shall be provided along the entire property line between the residential zoning district and the agribusiness use.
5.3 Automobile Service Stations, Convenience Marts, and Repair Establishments. It is the intent of this section to establish standards for automobile service stations, convenience marts and repair establishments to insure that access is managed adequately and to minimize negative impacts on neighboring properties. Such facilities shall not include service or repair of semis and other heavy trucks, RVs, farm equipment, construction equipment, and the like (See Section 5.18). Automobile service stations, convenience marts, and repair establishments are subject to the following conditions:
A. Such facilities shall not be located within five hundred (500) feet of any school.
B. The minimum lot area for such facilities shall be one (1) acre, with a minimum frontage along the principal street of one hundred-fifty (150) feet. The property shall be so arranged that ample space is available for motor vehicles which are required to wait for services.

The cost of that work shall be estimated by the Township Engineer and approved by the Township Board after recommendation of the Gravel Committee as established under Section 5.25(E)(1), below; provided further that the Township Board is authorized to waive or reduce all or any part of the amount of such performance guarantee to the extent that the Township Board determines the same unnecessary to insure the completion of the work set forth in said plan. The Township Engineer's estimate will be based upon a review of that work as provided in the Reclamation Plan and shall be in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of reclamation by another at that point in time when reclamation is scheduled to commence. If the Township Engineer determines that the amount of the current surety is insufficient to reclaim the site, the amount of the performance guarantee shall be increased accordingly. The Township Engineer shall also consider inflation and other reclamation cost increases during the annual performance guarantee review (Section 5.25(D)(3)).
Charter Township of Oxford 5-40 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
2. The performance guarantee shall be valid for a one-year period and shall contain the expiration date. The performance guarantee shall include a cancellation / expiration clause which shall provide that the surety company shall notify the Township in writing a minimum of 30 days prior to cancellation and/or expiration of the performance guarantee (Section 5.25(D)(5)). The Township Clerk shall be provided one original bond certificate for the Township's records. The performance guarantee shall include the parcel identification number and legal description of the area covered by the performance guarantee.
3. The conditions of said performance guarantee shall be that it cover the entire area already disturbed and the entire area that will be disturbed by the operator within the current calendar year (January 1 - December 31). The performance guarantee shall reference all parcels covered by the performance guarantee by parcel identification number. The minimum area covered by the performance guarantee shall be 20 acres. The performance guarantee shall be kept in full force and effect until the area covered by the performance guarantee has been reclaimed according to the operator's approved rehabilitation plan. The Permittee shall comply with all provisions of this ordinance and terms and conditions of the permit, and complete all work set forth in the rehabilitation plan. The performance guarantee shall be reviewed annually by the Township Engineer to ensure that the performance guarantee amount is adequate, after adjustment for inflation and other reclamation cost increases, to cover completion of all work set forth in the rehabilitation plan.
4. For good cause shown, the Township Board is authorized to grant the Permittee an extension of the time to complete the work shown on the plan of Reclamation upon the Permittee's application therefor prior to the expiration of the date for completion.
5. Upon the Permittee complying with the provisions of this Ordinance, and the terms and conditions of the permit, the Clerk shall issue to the Permittee a Certificate of Completion and the performance guarantee shall be canceled, and in the case of a deposit of cash, certified check or irrevocable letter of credit, the same shall be returned to the Permittee.
E. Periodic Inspections & Reports

5.32 Wireless Communication Facilities.
A. Purpose and Intent.
It is the general purpose and intent of the Township to carry out the will of the United States Congress by authorizing communication facilities needed to operate wireless communication systems. However, it is the further purpose and intent of the Township to provide for such authorization in a manner which will protect the health, safety and welfare and retain the integrity of neighborhoods and the character, property values and aesthetic quality of the community at large. In fashioning and administering the provisions of this section, attempt has been made to balance these potentially competing interests.
Recognizing the number of providers authorized to establish and operate wireless communication services and coverage, and changes in State and Federal legislation, it is the further purpose and intent of this section to:
1. Facilitate adequate and efficient provision of sites for wireless communication facilities and ensure that wireless communication facilities are situated in appropriate locations and relationships to other land uses, structures and buildings.
2. Establish predetermined districts in the location considered best for the establishment of wireless communication facilities, subject to applicable standards and conditions.
3. Recognize that operation of a wireless communication system may require the establishment of facilities in locations not within the predetermined districts. In such cases, it has been determined that it is likely that there will be greater adverse impact upon neighborhoods and areas within the community. Consequently, more stringent standards and conditions should apply to the review, approval, and use of such facilities.
4. Limit inappropriate physical and aesthetic overcrowding of land use activities and avoid adverse impact upon existing population, transportation systems, and other public services and facility needs.
Charter Township of Oxford 5-47 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
5. Provide for adequate information about plans for wireless communication facilities in order to permit the community to effectively plan for the location of such facilities.
6. Minimize the adverse impacts of technological obsolescence of such facilities, including a requirement to remove unused and/or unnecessary facilities in a timely manner.
7. Minimize the negative visual impact of wireless communication facilities on neighborhoods, community land marks, historic sites and buildings, natural beauty areas and public rights-of-way. This contemplates the establishment of as few structures as reasonably feasible, the use of structures which are designed for compatibility, and the use of existing structures.
8. Implement and provide for compliance with State and Federal legislation through new and amended application, review, and decision standards, requirements and procedures for wireless communication facilities requests.
B. Authorization.
1. As a Permitted Use Subject to Site Plan Approval. In all Zoning Districts, a wireless communication facility described in this subsection (B)(1) shall be a permitted use subject to the standards and conditions in subsection (C), the application requirements in subsection (D), the collocation requirements in subsection (E), the procedures in subsection (G), and any prior Special Land Use or site plan approval conditions.
a. Wireless communications equipment attached to an existing structure not previously approved and used as a wireless communications support structure and located within a nonresidential zoning district, where there will be no substantial change in physical dimensions of the existing structure.

E. Collocation.
1. Statement of Policy. It is the policy of the Township to minimize the overall number of newly established locations for wireless communication facilities and Wireless Communication Support Structures within the community, and encourage the use of existing structures for Attached Wireless Communication Facility purposes, consistent with the statement of purpose and intent, set forth in Subsection (A), Purpose and Intent, above. Each licensed provider of a wireless communication facility must, by law, be permitted to locate sufficient facilities in order to achieve the objectives promulgated by the United States Congress. However, particularly in light of the dramatic increase in the number of wireless
Charter Township of Oxford 5-56 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
communication facilities reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the change of federal law and policy in and relating to the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is the policy of the Township that all users should collocate on Attached Wireless Communication Facilities and Wireless Communication Support Structures in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this section, as stated above, and as stated in Subsection (A), Purpose and Intent. If a provider fails or refuses to permit collocation on a facility owned or otherwise controlled by it, where collocation is feasible, the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be compelled, in direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic policy, intent and purpose of the Township. The provisions of this subsection are designed to carry out and encourage conformity with the policy of the Township.
2. Feasibility of collocation. Collocation shall be deemed to be "feasible" for purposes of this section where all of the following are met:
a. The wireless communication provider entity under consideration for collocation will undertake to pay market rent or other market compensation for collocation.
b. The site on which collocation is being considered, taking into consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility, is able to provide structural support.
c. The collocation being considered is technologically reasonable, e.g., the collocation will not result in unreasonable interference, given appropriate physical and other adjustment in relation to the structure, antennas, and the like.
d. The height of the structure necessary for collocation will not be increased beyond a point deemed to be permissible by the Township, taking into consideration the several standards contained in Subsections (b) and (c), above.
3. Requirements for Collocation.
1. The construction and use of a new wireless communication facility shall not be granted unless and until the applicant demonstrates that collocation is not feasible.
2. All new and modified wireless communications facilities shall be designed and constructed so as to accommodate collocation.
Charter Township of Oxford 5-57 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
3. The policy of the community is for collocation. Thus, if a party who owns or otherwise controls a facility shall fail or refuse to alter a structure so as to accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible collocation, such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a non-conforming structure and use, and shall not be altered, expanded or extended in any respect.
4. If a party who owns or otherwise controls a facility shall fail or refuse to permit a feasible collocation, and this requires the construction and/or use of a new facility, the party failing or refusing to permit a feasible collocation shall be deemed to be in direct violation and contradiction of the policy, intent and purpose of the Township, and, consequently such party shall take responsibility for the violation, and shall be prohibited from receiving approval for a new wireless communication support structure within the Township for a period of five (5) years from the date of the failure or refusal to permit the collocation. Such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief which, in this context, shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of the five (5) year prohibition would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent wireless communication services, or that such enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless communication services.
F. Removal.
1. A wireless communication facility must furnish reasonable evidence of ongoing operation at any time after construction.
2. A condition of every approval of a wireless communication facility shall be adequate provision for removal of all or part of the facility by users and owners when the facility has not been used for 180 days or more. For purposes of this section, the removal of antenna or other equipment from the facility, or the cessation of operations (transmission and/or reception of radio signals) shall be considered as the beginning of a period of nonuse.
3. The situations in which removal of a facility is required, as set forth in paragraph 1 above, may be applied and limited to portions of a facility.
3. Upon the occurrence of one or more of the events requiring removal, the property owner or persons who had used the facility shall
Charter Township of Oxford 5-58 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
immediately apply for any required demolition or removal permits, proceed with, and complete the demolition/removal.
4. If the required removal of a facility or a portion thereof has not been lawfully completed within sixty (60) days of the applicable deadline, and after at least thirty (30) days written notice, the Township may remove or secure the removal of the facility or required portions thereof, with its actual cost and reasonable administrative charge to be drawn, collected and/or enforced from or under the security posted at the time of application.
G. Procedures.
1. Review and administrative actions on Special Land Use and site plan approval applications.

7.2 Intent and Scope of Requirements.
A. Intent. Landscaping enhances the visual image of the Charter Township of Oxford, preserves natural features, improves property values, and alleviates the impact of noise, traffic, and visual distraction associated with certain uses. Screening is important to protect less intensive uses from the noise, light, traffic, litter and other impacts of more intensive, nonresidential uses. These provisions are intended to set minimum standards for the design and use of landscaping, greenbelts, and screening, and for the
Charter Township of Oxford 7-2 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
protection and enhancement of the Township's environment. More specifically, the intent of these provisions is to:
1. Improve the appearance of off-street parking areas, vehicular use areas, and property abutting public rights-of-way,
2. Protect and preserve the appearance, character, and value of the neighborhoods that abut non-residential areas, parking areas, and other intensive use areas, thereby protecting the public health, safety and welfare,
3. Reduce soil erosion and sedimentation, and
4. Increase stormwater infiltration, thereby helping to prevent flooding.
5. It is also the intent of this section to encourage the use of desirable native plant species for all landscaping, including but not limited to, foundation plantings, lawn areas, screening and greenbelt areas, and surface stormwater conveyance features. Encouraging the use of native plants in this Ordinance is based on the following:
a. Native plants are a necessary part of the proper functioning of natural ecosystems within the Charter Township of Oxford and perform tasks including, but not limited to, stormwater attenuation, uptake and purification, air purification, wildlife food and habitat, and community character and aesthetics; and
b. Landscaping with native plants encourages environmentally-sound maintenance practices by requiring little or no pesticide or fertilizer use, and minimal watering once plants are established, which, in turn, reduces the threat of environmental degradation; and
c. The Township has stated in its Master Plan the goal to preserve the natural features and character of Township lands and protect the quality of vital Township air, land and water resources; and to encourage the uses of desirable native species of vegetation.
B. Scope of Application. No site plan shall be approved unless it shows landscaping and screening consistent with the requirements of this Section. A building permit shall not be issued until the required landscape plan is submitted and approved, and a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued unless provisions set forth in this Section have been met or a performance guarantee has been posted. The requirements in this Article shall not apply to single family detached homes, unless otherwise specifically noted.
Charter Township of Oxford 7-3 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
C. Minimum Requirements. The requirements in this Section are minimum requirements, and under no circumstances shall they preclude the developer and the Township from agreeing to more extensive landscaping.
D. Design Creativity. Creativity in landscape design is encouraged. Accordingly, required trees and shrubs may be planted at uniform intervals, irregular intervals, or in groupings, depending on the designer's desired visual effect and, equally important, the intent of the Township to coordinate landscaping on adjoining properties.
E. Summary of Regulations. The following table summarizes the landscaping regulations contained in this Section:

C. Seeding or Sodding. Lots or parcels shall be seeded or sodded within ninety (90) days after occupancy.
D. Protection from Vehicles. Landscaping shall be protected from vehicles through use of curbing in parking, loading and vehicular circulation areas. Landscape areas shall be elevated above the pavement to a height that is adequate to protect the plants from snow removal, salt, and other hazards.
E. Timing of installation.
1. Landscaping provided for nonresidential and multiple family residential projects shall be installed prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. Where phased projects are proposed, all landscaping associated with each phase shall be installed prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. However, if the development (or phase of a development) is being completed during the off-season when
Charter Township of Oxford 7-20 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
plants can not be installed, the Planning Commission or Zoning Official shall have the ability establish an alternative schedule for the installation of required landscaping. If landscaping is to be installed after the Certificate of Occupancy is granted, the developer shall provide a performance guarantee to ensure installation of required landscaping in an amount equal the estimated value of the proposed landscape improvements.
2. Landscaping of all common areas associated with single-family residential developments shall be installed prior to the occupancy of the first lot or unit of the development, or of a particular phase in the case of a phased development. However, if the development is being completed during the off-season when plants can not be installed, the Planning Commission or Zoning Official shall have the ability establish an alternative schedule for the installation of required landscaping. If landscaping is to be installed after the Certificate of Occupancy is granted, the developer shall provide a performance guarantee to ensure installation of required landscaping, in an amount equal the estimated value of the proposed landscape improvements. Notwithstanding, required street trees shall be installed within 90 days of occupancy of each lot or unit, or by June 1 for residences occupied in winter months.
F. Maintenance. Landscaping required by this Ordinance shall be maintained in a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris. All unhealthy and dead plant material shall be replaced immediately upon notice from the Zoning Official, unless the season is not appropriate for planting, in which case such plant material shall be replaced at the beginning of the next planting season.
All constructed or manufactured landscape elements, such as but not limited to benches, retaining walls, edging, and so forth, shall be maintained in good condition and neat appearance. Rotted, deteriorated, or damaged landscape elements shall be repaired, replaced, or removed.
G. Irrigation. All cultivated landscaped areas shall be irrigated with a permanent, automatic irrigation system designed to provide efficient irrigation coverage with minimal overspray onto non-landscaped areas. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to lessen or waive this requirement if it is demonstrated to their satisfaction that such irrigation is not necessary to maintain proposed landscaping in a healthy condition. Irrigation shall not be required for existing vegetation maintained in a natural state. The landscape plan shall indicate the nature, location, and specifications of the irrigation system which shall be used. The landscape plan shall have sufficient detail to show that adequate irrigation will be provided to all required landscape areas and plant materials.

7.7 Treatment of Existing Plant Material and Landscape Improvements.
A. Consideration of Existing Vegetation in the Landscape Design. In instances where healthy plant material exists on a site prior to its development, the Planning Commission may permit substitution of such plant material in place of the requirements set forth previously in this Article, provided such substitution is in keeping with the spirit and intent of this Article and the Ordinance in general.
B. Use of Existing Landscape Improvements. Existing hedges, berms, walls, or other landscape elements may be used to satisfy the requirements set forth previously, provided that such landscaping is in conformance with the requirements of this Section.
7.8 Modifications to Landscape Requirements. In consideration of the overall design and impact of a specific landscape plan, and in consideration of the amount of existing plant material to be retained on the site, the Planning Commission may modify the specific requirements outlined herein, provided that any such adjustment is in keeping with the intent of this Article and Ordinance in general. In determining whether a modification is appropriate, the Planning Commission shall consider whether the following conditions exist:
A. Topographic features or other unique features of the site create conditions such that strict application of the landscape regulations would result in a less effective screen than an alternative landscape design.
B. Parking, vehicular circulation, or land use are such that required landscaping would not enhance the site or result in the desired effect.
C. The public benefit intended by the landscape regulations could be better-achieved with a plan that varies from the strict requirements of the Ordinance.
7.9 Landscape Plan Submission Requirements. All development proposals for which landscaping is required pursuant to this Article shall submit a landscape plan demonstrating compliance with the standards herein. The required landscape plan shall include the following:
A. Location of all proposed plant material.
B. Schedule of all proposed plant materials, indicating the botanical and common name, number, size, and root type, as well as which landscaping or tree replacement requirement, if any, the plant material is intended to satisfy.
C. Calculations used for determining required number of trees and shrubs.

ARTICLE 8
ACCESS, CIRCULATION, PARKING AND LOADING
8.1 Required Road Frontage and Access.
A. Subject to the terms and exceptions set forth in Section 16.3 of this Ordinance with regard to zoning compliance permits, every use, building or structure established after the effective date of this Ordinance, shall be located on a lot or parcel which fronts upon, and is accessed by, a public road, or an approved private road which meets all requirements of Article 11. Such required frontage shall be provided for a distance equal to or greater than the minimum lot width required in that particular zoning district, as measured along the right of way line, except as follows:
1. Minimum road frontage for lots or parcels which abut, wholly or in part, a public or private road cul-de-sac or other curved portion of a public or private road, may be reduced to eighty five (85) percent of the required minimum lot width for the district in which the lot is located.
B. Common Driveways. Two (2) lots having contiguous road frontage may be accessed from that road via a common driveway. Should a common driveway be established, easement and maintenance agreements shall be required, meeting the minimum standards set forth in Section 11.5(A), (B) and (C), as well as Section 11.6, and shall be subject to Township review.
8.2 Visibility at Intersections. On any corner lot in any district, no fence, wall, screen, hedge, sign, or other structure or planting shall obstruct the visibility of vehicular traffic between the heights of three (3) feet and ten (10) feet in an area measuring twenty-five (25) feet from the point of intersection of the street right-of-way lines and the tangent connecting the twenty-five (25) foot extremities of the intersecting right-of-way lines.
Charter Township of Oxford 8-2 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
8.3 Access Management Standards.
A. Applicability. All development that is subject to site plan, site condominium, planned unit development, plat or private road review shall meet the requirements set forth in this Section. Access to public roads shall be controlled in the interest of public safety.
B. Access Barrier. Each building or group of buildings, parking and/or service areas, shall be physically separated from public roads by a curb, or other suitable barrier against unchanneled motor vehicle access or egress, except for driveway access authorized herein.
C. Driveway Access Standards. Driveways shall conform to the following performance standards or to standards adopted by the Road Commission for Oakland County, whichever is more stringent:
1. The design and placement of driveways must relate to internal circulation and parking areas such that the entrance can absorb the maximum rate of inbound traffic during a normal peak traffic period.
2. There must be sufficient on-site storage to accommodate at least three queued vehicles waiting to park or exit without using a portion

of the public right-of-way, obstructing existing vehicle sight distance, or otherwise interfering with street traffic.
3. Provisions for circulation between adjacent parcels are encouraged through coordinated or joint parking systems.
4. Driveways shall be designed to accommodate all vehicle types having occasion to enter and exit the site, including delivery vehicles. There shall be clear delineation and/or separation, where appropriate, of entry and exit lanes within driveways.
5. Loading and unloading activities shall not hinder vehicle ingress or egress.
6. Driveways placement must be such that an exiting vehicle has an unobstructed sight distance according to the minimum adopted by the Road Commission for Oakland County or MDOT, as applicable.
D. Driveway Spacing. Required spacing of driveways, whether within a single lot or on adjacent lots, shall be determined as provided herein. These standards shall not preclude access to a lot or parcel by a single driveway where such driveway would be otherwise permitted by the appropriate road agency.
1. Driveway spacing will be determined as a function of operating speeds of the adjacent public road. These spaces are based on average vehicle acceleration and deceleration rates and are considered necessary to maintain safe traffic operation. Spacing will be measured from the midpoint of each driveway. Spacing will be determined according to the following minimum standards or to standards adopted by the Road Commission for Oakland County or MDOT, as applicable, whichever is more stringent.
Speed Limit (mph) Minimum Spacing (feet)
25 105
30 125
35 150
40 185
45 230
50 275
2. In the event that a particular parcel or parcels lack sufficient road frontage to maintain adequate spacing, the applicant shall have one of two options:
a. A waiver can be sought from the Planning Commission from the minimum spacing requirements provided herein, but in no case can the waiver be greater than the minimum required to
Charter Township of Oxford 8-4 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
provide safe access to a site while still meeting the intent of this Section. In determining whether such a waiver is acceptable, the Planning Commission shall consider the following criteria, in addition to the recommendation of the Township Engineer:
i Traffic volumes on adjacent roadways;
ii Intensity of use anticipated for proposed drives;
iii Availability of acceptable sight distances;
iv Distance from adjacent intersections;
v The presence of physical separation or barriers between existing and/or proposed driveways;
vi Input from the Road Commission or MDOT, as applicable; and,
vii The importance of the additional curb cuts to the function of the site.
b. The adjacent landowners may agree to establish a common driveway. Should a common driveway be established, easement and maintenance agreements shall be required, meeting the minimum standards set forth in Section 11.5(A), (B) and (C), as well as Section 11.6.
3. Number of Driveways per Parcel.
a. A maximum of one (1) two-way driveway opening or a pair of one (1) way driveway openings shall be permitted to a particular lot from each adjacent road.
b. Based on the recommendation of the County Road Commission and/or Township Engineer that an additional driveway is in the interests of safe traffic operation, the Planning Commission may permit one (1) additional driveway entrance along a continuous site with frontage in excess of three hundred (300) feet or two (2) additional driveway entrances along a continuous site with frontage in excess of six hundred (600) feet.
4. Driveway Approaches.
a. At a minimum, all uses or proposed uses which are subject to site plan review requirements shall provide paved driveway
Charter Township of Oxford 8-5 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
tapers to provide access to and from paved or gravel roadways.
b. Acceleration, deceleration, and passing lanes for driveway approaches entering on a public roadway may be required, as determined by the Township, based upon the following considerations:
i Traffic volumes, accident data, horizontal and vertical alignment, and sight distance conditions of the public roadway upon which a driveway is entering.
ii Other unique site conditions such as land use, topography, or other natural conditions.
iii Traffic generated by the proposed use.
c. Driveway tapers and acceleration, deceleration, and passing lanes shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the standards of the Road Commission for Oakland County for roadways under their jurisdiction and the Michigan Department of Transportation for roadways under their jurisdiction.
8.4 Traffic Impact Studies.
A. Intent. The Township requires traffic impact studies in certain cases to identify the anticipated traffic impacts and to assist in decision making. The intent of this section is to provide specific direction for the preparation of traffic impact studies where such studies are required by this Zoning Ordinance. The requirements of this section are also intended to help Township staff and officials determine the appropriateness of certain uses at proposed locations in terms of traffic impacts and the adequacy of proposed access design. Traffic impact studies may also be used by the applicant to justify additional access points, as outlined in Section 8.3(D)(2).
B. Applicability. A traffic impact study may be required by the Planning Commission for any use which, in the Township Engineers preliminary analysis, is expected to potentially generate over one hundred (100) directional trips in any peak hour or over seven hundred fifty (750) directional trips in an average day, or for projects at locations that currently experience traffic operational problems.
C. Submittal Procedures. The traffic impact study shall be submitted with the site plan or other material required to be submitted.
D. Qualifications of Preparer. The person responsible for the preparation of the study shall have a degree or specific professional training in the
Charter Township of Oxford 8-6 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
preparation of traffic impact studies. The preparer shall have at least three (3) years of recent experience in the preparation of traffic impact studies, shall provide evidence of ongoing experience and familiarity with the Highway Capacity Manual and other traffic operation evaluation techniques, shall be an associate (or higher) member of one or more professional transportation-related organizations and shall be either a registered engineer (PE) or a planner with AICP or PCP certification. Any study involving roadway or traffic signal design work shall be prepared by or under the supervision of a registered engineer (PE) with specific training in traffic engineering.
E. Contents. The extent of information to be provided depends upon the expected trip generation of the proposed project. The information provided in the traffic impact study shall include:
1. A description of the site, surroundings and study area. Illustrations and a narrative should describe the characteristics of the site and adjacent roadway system (functional classification, lanes, speed limits, etc.). This description should include surrounding land uses, expected development in the vicinity which could influence future traffic conditions, special site features and a description of any committed roadway improvements. The study should define and justify the study area selected for analysis.
2. A description of the requested use which relates to traffic generation, such as the number and types of dwellings units, the gross and usable floor area, the number of employees and shift change factors. Intended phasing or future expansion should also be noted.
3. A description of existing peak-hour traffic volumes (and daily volumes if applicable) at intersections and on street(s) adjacent to the site. The existing level of service analysis shall be provided for intersections in the vicinity which are expected to experience an increase in traffic of at least five percent due to the proposed project. Existing traffic counts shall not be over two years old from the date of submittal of the report.
4. Roadway characteristics, described and illustrated, as appropriate. Features to be addressed include existing rights-of-way, lane configurations, geometrics, signal timing, traffic control devices, posted speed limits, average running speeds, sight distance information, existing driveways and potential turning movement conflicts in the vicinity of the site.
5. For projects that will be completed and occupied within one year of a traffic impact statement submittal, an analysis of background traffic (i.e. the expected increase in traffic volumes related to approved
Charter Township of Oxford 8-7 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
projects and historic annual percentage increases).
6. Forecasted trip generation of the proposed use for the a.m. (if applicable), the p.m. peak hour and an average weekday. For commercial uses that are expected to generate significant weekend traffic, a weekend forecast shall also be required. The forecasts shall be based on one standard deviation above the average rate, outlined in the most recent edition of Trip Generation, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). For rezoning requests, the study shall contrast the traffic impacts of typical uses permitted in the requested zoning district with uses permitted in the current zoning district. The determination of typical uses shall be made by the Building Department or Planning Commission. Any trip reduction for pass-by trips, transit, ride-sharing, other modes, internal capture rates, etc., shall be based both on ITE findings and documented survey results acceptable to the agency reviewers. The community may accept in whole or in part the trip reduction rates used. For projects intended to be developed in phases, the trip generation by phase shall be described.
F. Distribution of Traffic. The projected traffic generated shall be distributed (inbound vs. outbound; left turn vs. right turn) onto the existing street network to project turning movements at site access points and nearby intersections where required. Projected peak hour turning movement volumes shall be illustrated in the report. A description of the application of standard engineering procedures for determining the distribution should also be attached.
G. Capacity Analysis. A before and after level of service or "capacity" analysis at the proposed access points and nearby intersections shall be completed using the procedures outlined in the most recent edition of the Highway Capacity Manual, published by the Transportation Research Board.
H. Mitigation Alternatives. The study shall outline mitigation measures and demonstrate any changes to the level of service achieved by these measures. Any alternatives or suggested phasing of improvements should be described. The mitigation measures may include items such as roadway widening, need for bypass lanes or deceleration tapers/lanes, changes to signalization, use of access management techniques or a reduction in the proposed intensity of use.
I. Waiver of Study Requirements. The requirement for a traffic impact study or the study elements listed herein may be waived or modified by the Planning Commission. Reasons for the waiver or modification shall be documented, and the following factors may be considered:
1. Roadway improvements are already scheduled which are expected
Charter Township of Oxford 8-8 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
to mitigate any impacts associated with the proposed project.
2. The existing level of service is not expected to be significantly impacted by the proposed project due to specific conditions at this location.
3. A similar traffic study was previously prepared for the site and is still considered applicable.
8.5 General Off-Street Parking Requirements. In all zoning districts, off-street parking facilities for the storage and parking of self-propelled motor vehicles for the use of occupants, employees, and patrons of the buildings hereafter erected, altered, or extended after the effective date of this Ordinance, shall be provided as herein prescribed. Such space shall be maintained in a safe, passable condition, and shall not be encroached upon so long as said main building or structure remains, unless an equivalent number of such spaces are provided elsewhere in conformance with this Ordinance.
A. Location of Parking for One- and Two-Family Dwellings. The off-street parking facilities required for one- and two-family dwellings shall be located on the same lot as the building they are intended to serve, but shall not be considered a parking lot under the provisions of Section 8.7 of this Article.
B. Location of Parking for Multiple-Family Residential. The off-street parking facilities for multiple-family dwellings shall be located on the same lot as the dwellings they are intended to serve, and shall consist of a parking lot as set forth in Section 8.7. In no event shall any uncovered parking space be located nearer than ten (10) feet to any main building.
C. Location of Parking for Other Land Uses. The off-street parking facilities required for all other uses shall be located on the lot or within five hundred (500) feet of the permitted uses requiring such off-street parking, such distance to be measured along lines of public access to the property between the nearest point of the parking facility to the building to be served. A fully executed parking easement agreement for all off-site parking shall be signed by all parties involved and recorded with the Oakland County Register of Deeds for all off-street parking intended to service the main facility. Such parking easement agreement shall be subject to Township review and approval.
D. Seating Capacity of Seats. As used in this Article to determine parking requirements, seats shall mean that each twenty-four (24) inches of seating facilities shall be counted as one (1) seat, except that where specifications and plans filed with the Zoning Administrator specify a certain seating capacity for a particular building, such specified seating capacity shall be used as the basis for determining required parking spaces.
Charter Township of Oxford 8-9 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
E. Similar Uses and Requirements. In the case of a use not specifically mentioned, and which is similar to another use listed, the requirements for off-street parking facilities for the similar use shall apply.
F. Floor Area. For the purpose of this Article, the floor area used to determine the required number of parking spaces shall be as defined in Section 2.2.
G. Fractional Requirements. When units or measurements determining number of required parking spaces result in requirement of a fractional space, any fraction up to, and including one-half may be disregarded and fractions over one-half shall require one (1) parking space.
H. Existing Off-Street Parking at Effective Date of Ordinance. Off-street parking existing at the effective date of this Ordinance which serves an existing building or use, shall not be modified in quantity, arrangement or construction to other than that required under the terms of this Ordinance.
I. Collective Provisions. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent collective provisions of off-street parking facilities for two or more buildings or uses, subject to the Planning Commissions finding that such an arrangement is practical and satisfactory to each of the uses intended to be served, and when all requirements for location, design, and construction are met.
1. Computing Collective Parking Requirements. In computing requirements for any collective parking arrangement, the total space requirement is the sum of the individual requirements that will occur at the same time. If parking requirements for individual uses occur at distinctly different times, the total of such off-street parking facilities required for collective use may be reduced below the sum total of the individual parking requirements.
2. Record of Agreement. A copy of the agreement between the joint users of the collective parking shall be recorded with the Oakland County Register of Deeds. The agreement shall include a guarantee for continued use of the parking facility by each party. Such collective parking agreement shall be subject to Township review and approval.
J. Parking Duration. Except when land is used as storage space in connection with the business of a repair or service garage, a twenty-four (24) hour time limit for parking in non-residential off-street parking areas shall prevail, it being the purpose and intention of the foregoing that the requirement of maintaining vehicle storage or parking space is to provide for the public safety in keeping parked cars off the streets. Such requirement is not designed to or intended to provide, and shall not permit, the storage or
Charter Township of Oxford 8-10 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
prolonged parking of wrecked or junked cars on any such parking area in any such district, or for creating a junk yard or a nuisance in such areas.
K. Restriction of Parking on Private Property. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to park any motor vehicle on any private property, or use said private property for vehicle storage, or use any portion of any private property as a parking space, without the express or implied consent, authorization, or ratification of the owner, holder, occupant, lessee, agent, or trustee of such property. Complaint for the violation of this Section shall be made by the owner, holder, occupant, lessee, agent, or trustee of such property.
L. Flexibility in Application. The Township recognizes that, due to the specific requirements of any given development, inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in Section 8.6 may result in development with inadequate or excessive amounts of parking in relation to that which is needed. The former situation may lead to traffic congestion or unauthorized parking on adjacent streets or neighboring sites. The latter situation may result in excess paving and stormwater runoff and the inefficient use of land which could otherwise be left as open space.
1. The Planning Commission may permit deviations from the requirements of Section 8.6 and may require more or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to provide a sufficient number of parking spaces to accommodate the specific characteristics of the use in question. In making such a determination, the Planning Commission shall consider the following criteria:
a. The anticipated number of employees, customers, residents or other users of the facility at any one time;
b. Demonstration of need by petitioner based on comparable uses at similar locations;
c. Proximity to existing parking areas where shared or collective parking agreements are possible; and,
d. Availability of non-motorized, transit, or other alternatives to vehicular transportation.
2. The Planning Commission may attach conditions to the approval of a deviation from the requirements of Section 8.6 that bind such approval to the specific use in question. Where a deviation results in a reduction in parking, the Planning Commission may further impose conditions which ensure that adequate reserve area is set aside for future parking, if needed. Where an area is set aside for reserve parking, it shall be easily developed, not devoted to a use
Charter Township of Oxford 8-11 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
other than open space, and shall be designed to accommodate attendant facilities such as maneuver lanes and drainage.
M. Electric Vehicle Charging Stations. Parking spaces dedicated for electric vehicle charging stations can be counted toward meeting the requirement of off-street parking. These stations shall be signed and reserved for electric vehicle charging only. The stations shall comply with State of Michigan Electrical Code. Where allowed by the Road Commission for Oakland County, on-street electric vehicle charging stations shall also be permitted.
8.6 Off-Street Parking Requirements by Use. The amount of required off-street parking space for new uses or buildings, additions thereto, and additions to existing buildings as specified above shall be determined in accordance with the following table, no more or less parking may be approved except under the flexibility provisions found in Section 8.5(L). The space so required shall be stated in the application for a building and land use permit and shall be irrevocably reserved for such use and/or shall comply with the initial part of this Section.

5. The probable impact on recognized historic, cultural, scenic, ecological, or recreational values, and on fish, wildlife and the public health.
6. The size and quantity of the wetland or watercourse setback being considered.
7. The amount and quantity of the remaining wetland or watercourse setback.
8. Proximity of the proposed construction and/or operation in relation to the wetland or watercourse, taking into consideration the degree of slope, soil type and the nature of the wetland or watercourse to be protected.
9. Economic value, both public and private, of the proposed construction and/or operation, and economic value, both public and private, if the proposed construction and/or operation were not permitted.
10. The necessity for the proposed construction and/or operation.

Charter Township of Oxford 12-12 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
G. The proposed development will not cause soil erosion or sedimentation. The drainage plan is adequate to handle anticipated stormwater runoff.
H. A stormwater management system and facility will preserve the natural drainage characteristics and enhance the aesthetics of the site to the maximum extent possible, and will not substantially reduce or increase the natural retention or storage capacity of any wetland, water body or water course, or cause alterations which could increase flooding or water pollution on or off site.
I. Wastewater treatment systems, including on-site septic systems, will be located to minimize any potential degradation of surface water or ground water quality.
J. Sites which include storage of hazardous materials waste, fuels, salt, or chemicals shall be designed to prevent spills and discharges of polluting materials to the surface of the air or to the ground, groundwater or nearby water bodies, with a specific plan to achieve such objectives being incorporated as part of the site plan.
K. The location of buildings, parking, drives, landscaping and other improvements on the site shall not be injurious to users of the property or adjacent properties given the lot size, shape and general location.
L. Landscaping, including grass, trees, shrubs and other vegetation is provided to maintain and improve the aesthetic quality of the site and area.
M. The means of ingress and egress to and from the site shall be planned with the objective of achieving recognized planning, engineering and safety standards, and shall not result in an unreasonable risk of danger to persons and/or property on the site and/or off the site. In general, this standard shall be met based upon the design of ingress and egress in terms of the number, location and design of access(es), and utilization of acceleration, deceleration and passing lanes and approaches. The Planning Commission shall review the ingress and egress proposed for the purpose of promoting and protecting traffic safety.
N. The site plan complies with all federal, state and county laws and regulations, and all Township Ordinances and other regulations, including but not limited to the Zoning Ordinance and the Sidewalk and Safety Path Ordinance (Ordinance No. 117).
O. Feedback on the proposed site plan from external agencies having authority over the project, including but not limited to the Road Commission for Oakland County, Oakland County Drain Commissioner, Oakland County Department of Health and Human Services, Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the Michigan Department of Transportation, is
Charter Township of Oxford 12-13 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
sufficient to suggest that the site plan will be able to meet their requirements and be approved substantially as presented.
12.6 Amendment of Approved Site Plans. Except as provided for in Section 12.4, a site plan may be amended upon application and in accordance with provisions and the procedures provided in Section 12.3(C) for a Final Site Plan. Site plans amended in order to be brought into compliance with the requirements of governmental agencies of authority, other than the Charter Township of Oxford, are subject to the provisions of this ordinance. The Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to determine if a proposed change is substantive and therefore requires an amendment to the approved site plan.
12.7 Modifications During Construction. All improvements shall conform to the approved Final Site Plan. If the applicant chooses to make any changes in the development in relation to the approved Final Site Plan, he shall do so at his own risk, without any assurance that the Township will approve the changes. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to notify the Zoning Administrator of any such changes. The Zoning Administrator may require the applicant to correct the changes so as to conform to the approved Final Site Plan.
12.8 Phasing of Development. An applicant may divide a proposed development into two (2) or more phases with the approval of the Planning Commission. Where such phasing is proposed, each phase shall conform with Section 12.3(C)(5). Future phases of development beyond those for which site plan approval is requested shall not be depicted on the submitted Final Site Plan.
12.9 Performance Guarantees. Pursuant to Section 16.8, the Planning Commission may require that a performance guarantee be deposited with the Township to insure faithful completion of improvements depicted on a proposed site plan

Charter Township of Oxford 14-1 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
ARTICLE 14
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD)
14.1 Intent. A Planned Unit Development (PUD) may be applied for in any zoning district. The granting of PUD approval (pursuant to Section 14.6) shall constitute both site plan and rezoning approval, in which the resultant zoning is tied to the details contained in the accompanying site plan in addition to any other conditions attached to the PUD approval by the Township.
It is the intent of this Article to authorize the use of Planned Unit Development (PUD) regulations as an alternative to traditional development for the purposes of encouraging the use of land in accordance with its character and adaptability; conserving natural resources, natural features and energy; encouraging innovation and greater flexibility in land use planning and design; providing enhanced housing, employment, shopping, traffic circulation, farmland preservation, and recreational opportunities for the people of this Township; encouraging a less sprawling form of development; and ensuring compatibility of design and use between neighboring properties. The PUD is designed to give the Township and applicant more flexibility than would be allowed under the existing zoning, encouraging development of the property according to its unique characteristics.
The provisions of this Article are not intended as a device for ignoring the Zoning Ordinance and specific standards set forth therein, or the planning upon which it has been based. To that end, provisions of this Article are intended to result in land use development substantially consistent with the existing zoning and existing Charter Township of Oxford Master Plan, with modifications and departures from generally applicable requirements made in accordance with standards provided in this Article to ensure appropriate, fair, and consistent decision-making. Requirements stated in this Article are development guidelines that the Planning Commission, Township Board and Township staff will use to determine the merits of a particular application. The Planning Commission may recommend variations from these guidelines when an applicant has demonstrated that doing so will result in a corresponding benefit to the community.
14.2 Eligibility Criteria. To be eligible for Planned Unit Development (PUD) approval, the applicant shall demonstrate that the following criteria will be met:
A. Recognizable Benefit. The PUD will result in a recognizable and substantial benefit, both to the end users of the development and the overall quality of life in the Township. These benefits can be provided through site design elements in excess of the requirements of this Ordinance, such as one or more of the following:
Charter Township of Oxford 14-2 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
1. Preservation of natural features, specifically, but not limited to, woodlands, specimen trees, riparian systems, wetlands, open spaces and the connectivity thereof.
2. Improvements in traffic patterns, such as the provision of unified access or improvement of the adjacent road system.
3. Mitigation, remediation or restoration of disturbed areas or contaminated sites.
4. Improvements in the aesthetic qualities of the development itself, such as unique site design features and extensive landscaping.
5. Provision of pedestrian connectivity, via internal sidewalks, perimeter safety paths and other greenway corridors.
6. Improvements in public safety or welfare through better water supply, sewage disposal, stormwater management, or control of air and water pollution.
7. High quality architectural and landscape design.
8. Public amenities, such as plazas, parks, courtyards, water features, streetscape improvements, outdoor sculpture, clock towers, etc.
9. Provision of transitional areas between adjacent residential land uses.
10. Preservation of farmland.
11. Preservation of historic buildings.
Economic benefit to the community shall not, by itself, be deemed sufficient to allow eligibility, but may be considered in conjunction with the benefits listed above.
B. Density Impact. The proposed type, intensity or density of use shall not result in an unreasonable increase in the need for or impact to public services, facilities, roads, and utilities in relation to the use or uses otherwise permitted by this Ordinance, and shall not pose an unreasonable impact to the subject site; surrounding land, property owners and occupants; and/or the natural environment. The Planning Commission may require that the applicant prepare an impact statement documenting the significance of any environmental, traffic or socio-economic impacts resulting from the PUD. The potential impact of the proposed PUD project shall be evaluated in relation to the impacts associated with conventional development. To this end, the Planning Commission may require that the applicant prepare a quantitative comparison of the impacts of a conventional development and
Charter Township of Oxford 14-3 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
the PUD plan to assist in making this determination (such as an overlay of the conceptual development plans on a natural features map, illustrating other site development options to demonstrate that the impacts have been minimized to the extent practical). If the cumulative impact creates or contributes to a significant problem relative to the provision of public services or environmental degradation, mitigation shall be provided to alleviate the impacts associated with the PUD.
C. Master Plan. The proposed development shall be consistent with the intent and spirit of the Charter Township of Oxford Master Plan, and further its implementation. If the proposed development is not consistent with the Master Plan but there has been a change in conditions in the area that will explain why the proposed PUD is a reasonable use of land, the Planning Commission can consider a deviation from the Master Plan concurrent with the review and approval of the proposed PUD, pursuant to the standards provided in Section 14.5(F).
D. Guaranteed Open Space. The proposed PUD shall include the perpetual preservation of usable open space in accordance with the provisions of Section 14.3(I).
E. Economic Impact. In relation to the existing zoning, the proposed development shall not result in an unreasonable material negative economic impact upon surrounding properties, as determined by the Planning Commission.
F. Unified Control. The proposed development shall be under single ownership and/or control, such that there is a single person or entity having proprietary responsibility for the full completion of the project. The applicant shall provide sufficient documentation of ownership or control in the form of agreements, contracts, covenants, and/or deed restrictions that indicate that the development will be completed in its entirety as proposed.
14.3 Project Design Standards.
A. Location. A PUD may be applied for within any zoning district.
B. Permitted Uses or Combination of Uses. A PUD is permitted for the following types of uses: single-family detached, attached residential dwellings, commercial uses, office uses, industrial uses and mixed-use projects containing some combination of the above stated land uses.
C. Special Uses. For all special uses, regulations applicable to each respective use shall apply. The Township Board, in its discretion, shall resolve all ambiguities as to applicable special land use regulations. Deviations with respect to regulations applicable to such special land uses may be granted as part of the overall approval of the PUD, provided there are features or elements deemed adequate by the Township Board
Charter Township of Oxford 14-4 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
designed into the project plan for the purpose of achieving the objectives of this Article.
D. Base Zoning Regulations. Unless specifically waived or modified by the Planning Commission and Township Board, all Zoning Ordinance requirements for the underlying zoning district in existence upon application for PUD consideration, and other Township regulations, shall remain in full force.
E. Regulatory Flexibility. To encourage flexibility and creativity consistent with the PUD concept, the Planning Commission may recommend, and the Township Board may grant, specific departures from the dimensional, design or procedural requirements of the Zoning Ordinance as a part of the PUD approval process.
Any regulatory modifications shall be approved through findings by the Planning Commission and Township Board that the deviations shall result in a higher quality of development than would be possible using conventional zoning standards. Regulatory modifications are not subject to variance approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals. No part of a PUD plan may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals. This provision shall not preclude the owner of an individual lot within a PUD from seeking a dimensional variance following final approval of the PUD, provided such variance does not involve alterations to the common elements as shown on the approved PUD site plan.
A table shall be provided on the site plan which specifically details all deviations from the established zoning area, height, and setback regulations, off-street parking regulations, general provisions, or subdivision regulations that would otherwise be applicable to the uses and development proposed in the absence of this PUD Article. This specification should include ordinance provisions from which deviations are sought, and the reason and mechanisms to be utilized for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare, in lieu of the regulations from which deviations are sought. Only those deviations consistent with the intent of this Ordinance shall be considered.
F. Minimum Lot Size without Centralized Sewer. The minimum single-family residential lot size of any PUD that is not served by centralized sanitary sewer and water is one (1) acre, or as permitted by the Oakland County Department of Health and Human Services.
G. Density. Any application for a PUD shall be accompanied by three (3) plans: (1) a plan based on the propertys existing zoning at the time of application, (2) a density plan prepared in accordance with this sub-section, and (3) a PUD plan. The density allowable within a PUD shall be
Charter Township of Oxford 14-5 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
determined through preparation of the density plan, which shall have the following requirements:
1. The applicant shall prepare, and present to the Planning Commission for review, a density plan for the project that is consistent with State, County, and Township requirements and design criteria for a tentative preliminary plat or site condominium, whichever is appropriate. The density plan shall meet all standards for lot size, lot width and setbacks as normally required for the underlying zoning district, as applicable, public roadway improvements and private parks, and contain an area which conceptually would provide sufficient area for stormwater management. Lots in the density plan shall provide sufficient building envelope size without impacting floodplains and wetlands regulated by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.
The density plan shall be drawn at a scale not greater than 1"=100' and contain the following elements:
a. Layout of roads and rights-of-way.
b. Lot lines.
c. Wetland boundaries, submerged lands.
d. Floodplains.
e. Lot numbers and a schedule of lot areas.
f. Areas proposed for stormwater management.
2. The Planning Commission shall review the design and determine the number of lots that could be feasibly constructed under the density plan. This number, as determined by the Planning Commission, shall provide a guideline for the maximum number of dwelling units allowable for the PUD project. The Planning Commission may, however, recommend approval for a density credit for exemplary projects that meet the conditions outlined in Section 14.4.
3. The overall density of the project shall be determined by use of the density plan using the existing zoning designation of the property. The applicant may propose other underlying zoning categories as part of the PUD proposal for the consideration of density, subject to the Planning Commissions acceptance. In considering whether an alternate underlying zoning category proposed by an applicant is acceptable, the Planning Commission shall take into consideration the following factors:
Charter Township of Oxford 14-6 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
a. Consistency with the Townships adopted Master Plan;
b. Changes in the condition of the adjacent road network;
c. Changes in the condition and extent of the Townships utility system;
d. Preservation of significant open space, farmland or natural features.
e. Overall benefit to the Township.
The ultimate density shall be recommended by the Planning Commission and determined by the Township Board and shall be based upon the existing zoning category of the subject property, or the alternate zoning category as accepted by the Planning Commission, as well as any density credit (if applicable, per Section 14.4).
4. If open space is proposed to be preserved on property that is not contiguous to the remainder of the development, pursuant to Section 14.3(I)(15), such property may be included in the density plan for purposes of calculating maximum allowable density for the overall project. Density contributed by such non-contiguous open space shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Sections 14.3(G)(1), (2) and (3), above.
H. Natural Features. To the maximum extent feasible, the development shall be designed so as to preserve natural resources and natural features. In the interpretation of this provision, natural resources and natural features may be impaired or destroyed only if it is clearly in the public interest to do so. In determining whether an action is in the public interest, the benefit, which would reasonably be expected to accrue from the proposal, shall be balanced against the reasonably foreseeable detriments of the activity, taking into consideration the local, state, and national concern for the protection and preservation of the natural resources or features. To accomplish the desired balance, the following criteria shall be applied:
1. The availability of feasible and prudent alternative methods of completing the development;
2. The extent and permanence of the beneficial or detrimental effects of the proposed activity; and
3. The size, quality, and rarity of the natural resources or natural features that would be impaired or destroyed.
Charter Township of Oxford 14-7 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
The Planning Commission and Township Board may require the submittal of a tree inventory (showing the location, size and species of all trees measured six (6) inches DHB or greater), where significant woodlands or landmark trees are expected to be significantly impacted by the development. Further, if animal or plant habitats of significant value exist on the site, the Planning Commission and Township Board may require that the PUD plan preserve these areas in a natural state and adequately protect them within conservation easements having limited access. The Planning Commission and Township Board shall require a minimum twenty-five (25) foot wide undisturbed setback from the edge of any lake, pond, river, stream or wetland, as provided in Section 10.3; provided, however, that the Planning Commission and Township Board may permit trails, boardwalks, observation platforms, or other similar structures than enhance the passive enjoyment of the sites natural amenities, within the setback.
I. Open Space. Open space shall be preserved within PUD projects as follows:
1. Residential Planned Unit Developments, or portions thereof, shall maintain at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the Gross Buildable Area of the subject property (prior to development) as permanently protected, usable open space.
2. Non-residential Planned Unit Developments, or portions thereof, shall maintain at least ten percent (10%) of the Gross Buildable Area of the subject property (prior to development) as permanently protected, usable open space.
3. Usable open space preserved pursuant to this Section shall include both active and passive areas, and may consist of natural features, recreational areas, landscaped greenbelts or farmland. However, the following are not considered usable open space:
a. The area of all roads, public or private, and accompanying right-of-way or easement.
b. The area of any lot or site condominium unit proposed within the development.
c. Wetlands regulated by either the MDEQ or under the Townships Ordinance No. 80B, lakes or other submerged lands.
d. The required setbacks surrounding any structure, residential or otherwise, that is not located on an individual lot or site condominium unit.
Charter Township of Oxford 14-8 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
e. Stormwater management facility, including detention, retention and sedimentation basins.
f. The area of any utility easements, unless such easements could be used for building.
4. Open space shall be centrally located, located along the road frontage of the development, located to preserve significant natural features, or located to connect open spaces throughout the development.
5. Open space must be left in its natural condition, provided with recreational amenities, provided for active farming, or landscaped. Preserved open space shall not be left primarily as lawn.
6. Open space provided along exterior public roads shall generally have a depth of at least one hundred (100) feet, measured from the road right-of-way, and be either landscaped or left in a natural, wooded condition. In either case, open space along exterior public roads shall be provided with a minimum of one (1) evergreen or canopy tree for each twenty (20) feet of road frontage. Such plantings shall be planted in staggered rows or clustered into natural groupings to provide a natural appearance. Preservation of existing trees may be credited towards meeting this frontage landscaping requirement. Where the Planning Commission determines that a significant natural viewshed exists on the subject property, they may, in their discretion, require the preservation of such viewshed and prohibit the removal or disturbance of the natural landscape along the adjacent roadway where the viewshed is observed.
7. Open space must be accessible. Access can be provided via sidewalks and pathways throughout the development or where open space abuts road rights-of-way within the development.
8. Connections with adjacent open space, public land or existing or planned pedestrian/bike paths may be required by the Planning Commission.
9. Views of open spaces from lots (or units) and roads within the development are encouraged.
10. Where lakes, ponds or streams are located within or abut a development, the Planning Commission may require open space to provide waterfront access.
11. Preservation of Open Space. Open space shall be set aside by the developer through an irrevocable recorded document that is found
Charter Township of Oxford 14-9 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
acceptable to the Planning Commission and Township Board, such as:
a. Recorded deed restrictions;
b. Covenants that run perpetually with the land;
c. Dedication to a land conservancy approved by the Planning Commission; or,
d. A conservation easement established per the State of Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, Public Act 451 of 1994 , as amended (MCL 324.2140).
12. Preservation of open space as described above under 14.3(I)(11) shall assure that open space will be protected from all forms of development, except as shown on an approved site plan, and shall never be changed to another use. The recorded document utilized shall:
a. Indicate the proposed allowable use(s) of the preserved open space. The Planning Commission and Township Board may require the inclusion of open space restrictions that prohibit the following:
i. Dumping or storing of any material or refuse;
ii. Activity that may cause risk of soil erosion or threaten any living plant material;
iii. Cutting or removal of live plant material except for removal of dying or diseased vegetation;
iv. Use of motorized off-road vehicles;
v. Cutting, filling or removal of vegetation from wetland areas;
vi. Use of pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers within or adjacent to wetlands.
b. Require that the preserved open space be maintained by parties who have an ownership interest in the open space.
c. Provide standards for scheduled maintenance of the open space.
Charter Township of Oxford 14-10 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
d. Provide for maintenance to be undertaken by the Charter Township of Oxford, at the Townships option, in the event that the preserved open space is inadequately maintained, or is determined by the Township to be a public nuisance, with the assessment of costs upon the property owners.
13. Continuing Obligation. The preserved open space shall forever remain open space, subject only to uses approved by the Township on the approved site plan or plat. Further subdivision of open space land or its use for other than recreation, conservation or agricultural purposes, except for easements for utilities and septic systems, shall be strictly prohibited.
14. Allowable Structures. Any structure(s) or building(s) accessory to a recreation, conservation or agriculture use may be erected within the preserved open space, subject to the approved site plan. Accessory structures may include:
a. Recreation structures (gazebos, boardwalks, docks, etc.);
b. Maintenance buildings;
c. Clubhouses;
d. Other structures as approved by the Planning Commission.
These accessory structures or buildings, together with their associated parking lots and access roads, shall not exceed, in aggregate, one (1) percent of the required open space area.
15. Off-Site Provision of Required Open Space. At the option of the applicant, and subject to the acceptance of the Planning Commission and Township Board, open space required pursuant to this Section may be satisfied through the acquisition and permanent preservation of open space or agricultural lands that are not contiguous to the proposed project area. Such non-contiguous open space must still adhere to the standards of Section 14.3(I)(3), (4) and (5), and should further the objectives of preserving natural features, preserving agriculture, or providing recreational opportunities addressed in the Charter Township of Oxford Master Plan and Parks and Recreation Plan.
In the event that a proposal entails the preservation of such non-contiguous open space, the property upon which the non-contiguous open space is proposed shall be included in the calculation of required open space described above under Sections 14.3(I)(1) and (2). For example, if a property to be developed consisted of 80 acres of gross buildable area, and a property proposed to be preserved as
Charter Township of Oxford 14-11 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
non-contiguous open space consisted of 20 acres of gross buildable area, the percentage of open space required under Sections 14.3(I)(1) and (2) would be based upon 100 acres of gross buildable areas (i.e. the aggregate of all property involved in the proposal). Thus, for a residential PUD, a minimum of 25 acres of buildable land would be required, while a non-residential PUD would require a minimum of 10 acres.
The preservation of non-contiguous open space as part of a residential PUD shall not result in neighborhood(s) devoid of recreational facilities. At minimum, access to a park designed for active recreation of at least one (1) acre in size shall be provided within one-quarter (¼) of a mile from all proposed residences.
J. Agricultural or Equestrian Activities. Where a proposed PUD is located adjacent or in proximity to areas of the Township that where agricultural or equestrian activities are predominant land uses, measures shall be taken to minimize conflict between such uses and promote the continued use of adjacent lands for such purposes. Such measures could include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:
1. Preservation of open space in proximity of existing agricultural or equestrian operations;
2. Maintenance of lower density and intensity of land use in proximity to existing agricultural or equestrian operations;
3. Continued use of preserved open space having proximity to existing agricultural or equestrian operations for such purposes;
4. Design of traffic circulation systems so as not to conflict with existing agricultural or operations;
5. Use of design elements, such as split rail fencing and other features drawing from the agricultural and/or equestrian vernacular of the Oxford area.
K. Infrastructure and Public Services. The proposed PUD shall not exceed the capacity of existing and available public services, including utilities, public roads, police and fire protection services, unless the project proposal contains an acceptable plan for providing necessary services or evidence that such services will be available by the time the PUD is completed. Thoroughfare, drainage, and utility design shall meet or exceed the standards otherwise applicable in connection with each of the respective types of uses served. There shall be underground installation of utilities, including electricity, telephone and cable, unless determined unfeasible to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission and Township Board.
Charter Township of Oxford 14-12 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
L. Traffic Impact. The PUD shall be designed to minimize the impact of traffic generated by the proposed development on surrounding uses. In determining whether this requirement has been met, a traffic study shall be submitted as part of the PUD, and consideration shall be given to:
1. Access to, and capacity of, adjacent roads and thoroughfares.
2. Proximity and relation to intersections.
3. Estimated traffic to be generated by the proposed development.
4. Existing and projected levels of service on the adjacent road network.
5. Adequacy of driver sight distances.
6. Capacity of gravel roadways.
7. Need for current or future improvement to the adjacent road network.
8. Location of and access to off-street parking.
9. Required vehicular turning movements.
10. Provisions for pedestrian traffic.
M. Roads Master Plan. Evidence shall be provided that the proposed PUD is consistent with the proposed roads and road improvements included in the Charter Township of Oxford Roads Master Plan.
N. Access. Direct access onto a public road right-of-way shall be required of a PUD. The nearest edge of any entrance or exit drive shall be located no closer than two hundred (200) feet from any existing street or road intersection (as measured from the nearest intersection right-of-way line).
O. Internal Roads. Internal roads within a PUD may be public or private.
1. Public roadways within a PUD shall meet the design requirements of the Road Commission for Oakland County.
2. Private roadways within a PUD shall meet the requirements of Article 11.
3. It shall be indicated on the plans whether on-street parking is proposed for internal road within the PUD. Road widths shall be coordinated to insure that adequate road width is provided to allow safe and efficient circulation of vehicles through the development.
4. Both sides of all internal roads shall be landscaped with street trees. For road frontages of individual lots or condominium sites, a
Charter Township of Oxford 14-13 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
minimum of two (2) canopy trees shall be provided per residential dwelling. For sections of road that do not abut lots or condominium sites, a minimum of one (1) canopy tree shall be provided per side for every fifty (50) feet of road frontage. Existing trees to be preserved within five (5) feet of the road right-of-way or easement may be credited towards meeting this requirement, at the discretion of the Planning Commission, when a tree survey has been provided in accordance with Section 14.3(H).
P. Parking. Parking shall be so designed as to minimize imperviousness, minimize visual impacts onto neighboring property and the public right-of-way, and promote safety and accessibility. In accomplishing these objectives, a PUD shall incorporate one (1) or more of the following:
1. Reduce parking and impervious areas to the minimum necessary to serve the proposed use(s).
2. Bank parking where it is not foreseen to be needed in the immediate future.
3. Design parking so it may be shared between two (2) or more uses or buildings where it can be shown that all uses or buildings will have sufficient parking at the times of day when such parking is needed.
4. Concentrate parking to the sides and/or rear of the development, as opposed to the front of the building(s) adjacent to the road right-of-way.
5. Provide perimeter or arterial collector drives that are free from parking spaces and provide direct, safe, and efficient circulation of vehicles in and out of proposed parking areas.
Q. Pedestrian Circulation. The PUD plan shall provide pedestrian access to all open space areas from all residential/development areas, connections between open space areas, public thoroughfares and connections between appropriate on-site and off-site uses, subject to the following:
1. Trails within the PUD may be constructed of gravel, wood chips or other similar materials, but the Planning Commission and Township Board may require construction of an eight (8) foot wide asphalt safety path through portions of the development.
2. Safety paths shall be provided along all perimeter roads, pursuant to the Safety Paths and Sidewalks Ordinance (Article III of Chapter 42 of the Code of Ordinances) as well as along new collector and arterial roads.
Charter Township of Oxford 14-14 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
3. Sidewalks at least five (5) feet in width shall be provided on both sides of public and private streets internal to the development and shall be installed and maintained in accordance with the Safety Paths and Sidewalks Ordinance (Article III of Chapter 42 of the Code of Ordinances). Sidewalk maintenance provisions shall be provided within associated development agreements and condominium documents.
In instances where new sidewalks will not promote adequate pedestrian linkages/circulation, the Township Board may waive or modify this requirement after review and recommendation by the Planning Commission.
4. In all cases, where separation can be accomplished without significantly reducing the kind and density of uses, the pedestrian circulation system, and its related walkways and safety paths, shall be separated from vehicular thoroughfares and roadways.
5. Pedestrian and other non-motorized transportation routes identified in the Townships Master Plan shall be incorporated into the pedestrian circulation system, as applicable.
R. Compatibility with Adjacent Uses. The proposed PUD shall set forth specifications with respect to height, setbacks, density, parking, circulation, landscaping, views, and other design and layout features which demonstrate due regard for the relationship of the development to surrounding properties and the uses thereon, as well as the relationship between residential and non-residential uses within the PUD project itself. In determining whether this requirement has been met, consideration shall be given to:
1. The bulk, placement, and materials of construction of proposed structures.
2. The location and screening of vehicular circulation and parking areas in relation to surrounding development.
3. The location and screening of outdoor storage, outdoor activity or work areas, loading areas, and mechanical equipment in relation to surrounding development.
4. The hours of operation of the proposed uses.
5. The provision of landscaping and other site amenities.
S. Buffering and Transition Areas. Where the PUD abuts land zoned or used for residential purposes, the Planning Commission and Township Board may require a transition area. The Planning Commission may review the
Charter Township of Oxford 14-15 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
proposed transition area to ensure compatibility, with consideration of the particular scale of the proposed project, magnitude of disparity between the proposed PUD and the existing residential land, and other relevant factors. The Planning Commission and Township Board may require that the transition area consist of one (1) or more of the following:
1. One or more rows or clusters of single-family residential lots or units similar to the adjacent single-family developments in terms of density, lot area, lot width, setbacks and building spacing.
2. Woodlands, natural features and/or a landscaped greenbelt sufficient to provide an obscuring effect.
3. Open or recreational space.
4. Berming or other significant changes in topography, which provide an effective buffer.
5. If the PUD project includes non-residential uses adjacent to a district authorizing residential uses, a perimeter setback shall be established with a dimension from the property line of up to one hundred (100) feet, at the discretion of the Planning Commission and Township Board, taking into consideration the use or uses in and adjacent to the development. The setback distance need not be uniform at all points on the perimeter of the development.
In order to evaluate whether the proposed transition area is suitable, the Planning Commission and Township Board may require the submission of cross-section illustrations at points along the property line(s) in question, illustrating existing and proposed buildings, grades, lighting, landscaping, parking and loading, mechanical units, and the like. Perspective renderings from adjacent residential units are encouraged.
In all cases where non-residential uses abut residentially-zoned or used property, noise reduction and visual screening mechanisms such as earthen berms, landscape screens and/or decorative walls shall be employed. The Planning Commission and Township Board, at their discretion, shall review and approve the design and location of such mechanisms in an effort to maximize, to a reasonable extent, the screening and buffering of existing or proposed residential property.
T. Architectural and Site Element Design.
1. Residential facades shall not be dominated by garages; a portion of proposed residential units shall have side-entry garages, rear-entry garages, or recessed garages where the front of the garage is at least five (5) feet behind the front line of the living portion of the principal dwelling. The intent of encouraging recessed or side-entry
Charter Township of Oxford 14-16 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
garages is to enhance the aesthetic appearance of the development and minimize the visual impact resulting from the close clustering of units allowed under these regulations.
2. Building elevations shall be required for all structures other than custom-built single-family dwellings.
3. Signage, lighting, entryway features, landscaping, building materials for the exterior of all structures, and other features of the project, shall be designed and completed with the objective of achieving an integrated and cohesive development, consistent with the character of the community, surrounding development, and natural features of the area. The Planning Commission and Township Board may require street or site lighting where appropriate.
U. Traditional Design Concept. Where a PUD is proposed adjacent or in proximity to areas where historic, traditional settlement patterns persist, the Planning Commission may require a proposed PUD, or portion thereof, to extend such settlement patterns. Traditional settlement patterns can include, but are not limited to, rectilinear street grids broken into blocks of reasonable size, pedestrian amenities and orientation, traditional architecture, etc.
V. Existing Structures. When a tract or parcel of land proposed for PUD consideration contains structures or buildings deemed to be of historic, cultural, agricultural, or architectural significance, as determined by the Planning Commission and Township Board, and are suitable for rehabilitation, the structures shall be retained. Adaptive reuse of existing structures for residential or non-residential use or permitted accessory uses shall be encouraged.
W. Impervious Surface Reduction/Infiltration Enhancement. The Township recognizes that, due to the specific requirements of any given development, inflexible application of the design standards may result in development with excessive paving and stormwater runoff and a waste of space which could be left as open space.
Through procedures prescribed by these PUD regulations, the Township may permit deviations from requirements allowing for reduction in impervious surfaces whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to meet the intent and standards of this Ordinance and accommodate the specific characteristics of the use in question. Measures that reduce impervious surface and increase infiltration may include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. Streets and Access.
Charter Township of Oxford 14-17 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
a. Design residential streets with the minimum required pavement width needed to support travel lanes, on-street parking, and emergency, maintenance, and service vehicle access and function based on traffic volumes.
b. Decrease the total length of residential streets by examining alternative street layouts to determine the best option for increasing the number of homes per unit length.
c. Minimize the number of street cul-de-sacs and where cul-de-sacs do exist, provide landscape center islands.
d. Use vegetated open channels in the street right-of-way/private road easements to convey and treat stormwater runoff.
e. Use alternative driveway surfaces and shared driveways that connect two or more sites.
2. Parking.
a. Base parking requirements on the specific characteristics of the use, land-banking in open space parking required to satisfy Ordinance requirements.
b. Reduce the overall imperviousness associated with parking lots by providing compact car spaces, minimizing stall dimensions, incorporating efficient parking lanes, and using pervious materials in the spillover parking areas where possible.
c. Encourage shared parking between compatible users.
3. Site Design.
a. Direct rooftop runoff to pervious areas such as yards, open channels, or vegetated areas and avoid routing rooftop runoff to the roadway and the stormwater conveyance system.
b. Create a naturally vegetated buffer system which may vary in width as determined by the Township along all drainage ways. Critical environmental features such as the one hundred (100) year floodplain, steep slopes, and wetlands shall be considered.
Charter Township of Oxford 14-18 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
c. Minimize clearing and grading of woodlands and native vegetation to the minimum amount needed to build lots, allow access, and provide fire protection.
d. Conserve trees and other vegetation at each site by planting additional vegetation, clustering tree areas, and promoting the use of native plants.
X. Additional Considerations. The Planning Commission shall take into account, in considering approval or denial of a particular project, the following considerations, as the same may be relevant to a particular project: drainage and utility design; underground installation of utilities; achievement of an integrated development with respect to signage, lighting, landscaping and building materials; and noise reduction and visual screening of mechanical equipment.
14.4 Density Credit for Exemplary Projects.
A. The Planning Commission and Township Board may allow an exemplary Planned Unit Development (PUD) to include a variable density credit of up to fifteen (15) percent pursuant to this Section. In order to qualify for such increase in density, the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission and Township Board that the proposed project exhibits design excellence and exceeds the minimum standards for PUD eligibility under Section 14.2.
B. In order to qualify for development under the optional provisions of this Section, architectural standards shall be subject to review by the Planning Commission and Township Board. Buildings shall be harmonious with adjacent uses in terms of texture, materials, roof lines and mass, but there shall be a variation of front facade depth and roof lines to avoid monotony. Building elevations shall be required for all structures, including single-family homes.
C. Projects qualifying for a density credit shall provide elements such as the following:
1. A high level of clustered development, where at least forty (40) percent of the gross buildable area of the site is preserved as common open space.
2. Providing perimeter transition areas or greenbelts around all sides of the development that are at least one hundred (100) feet in depth.
3. The proposed plan is designed to enhance surface water quality and ground water quality.
4. Provisions and design that preserve and enhance natural features.
Charter Township of Oxford 14-19 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
5. Donation or contribution of land or amenities that represent significant community benefit.
6. Other similar elements as determined by the Planning Commission and Township Board.
14.5 Project Approval Criteria. In considering any application for approval of a Planned Unit Development (PUD) plan, the Planning Commission and Township Board shall make their determinations on the Criteria for Site Plan Approval set forth in Section 12.5, as well as the following standards and requirements:
A. Consistency with PUD Concept and Design Standards. The overall design and land uses proposed in connection with a PUD plan shall be consistent with the intent of the PUD concept, as well as with specific design standards set forth herein.
B. Compatibility with Adjacent Uses. The proposed PUD plan shall set forth in detail, all specifications with respect to height, setbacks, density, parking, circulation, landscaping, views, and other design features that exhibit due regard for the relationship of the development to surrounding properties, the character of the site, and the land uses. In determining whether this requirement has been met, consideration shall be given to:
1. The bulk, placement, and materials of construction for the proposed structures.
2. Pedestrian and vehicular circulation.
3. The location and screening of vehicular use or parking areas.
4. The provision of landscaping and other site amenities.
C. Impact of Traffic. The proposed PUD shall be designed to minimize the impact of traffic generated by the PUD on surrounding uses.
D. Protection of Natural Environment. The proposed PUD shall be protective of the natural environment. It shall comply with all applicable environmental protection laws and regulations.
E. Compliance with Applicable Regulations. The proposed PUD shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.
F. Township Master Plan. The proposed PUD shall be consistent with, and further the implementation of, the Township Master Plan. If the proposed PUD is not consistent with the Master Plan, the Planning Commission and Township Board may consider reasons for deviating from the Master Plan.

Charter Township of Oxford 14-24 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
4. Planning Commission Action. Following the public hearing, or at a subsequent Planning Commission meeting, the Planning Commission shall review the Preliminary PUD Plan and shall take one of the following actions:
a. Approval. Upon finding that the Preliminary PUD Plan meets the criteria set forth in the intent and this Section, the Planning Commission shall recommend approval of the Preliminary PUD Plan to the Township Board.
Approval by the Township Board shall constitute approval of the uses, density, and design concept as shown on the Preliminary PUD Plan but shall only confer upon the applicant the right to proceed to preparation of the Final PUD Plan. However, such Preliminary PUD approval shall not constitute final approval of the rezoning of the property to the PUD zoning designation. In no case shall a recommendation regarding the Preliminary PUD Plan by the Planning Commission bind the Township Board to approve or deny the Preliminary PUD Plan submittal.
b. Approval with Changes or Conditions. The Planning Commission may recommend conditional approval to the Township Board, subject to modifications as performed by the applicant.
c. Postponement. Upon finding that the Preliminary PUD Plan does not meet the criteria set forth in the intent of this Section, but could meet such criteria if revised, the Planning Commission may recommend that action on the proposal be postponed until a revised Preliminary PUD Plan is submitted.
d. Denial. Upon finding that the Preliminary PUD Plan does not meet the criteria set forth in the intent of this Section, the Planning Commission shall recommend denial of the Preliminary PUD Plan to the Township Board. Such recommendation shall be accompanied by findings of fact articulating those eligibility criteria, design standards and/or approval criteria that the Planning Commission believes are contradicted by the PUD proposal.
5. Township Board Action. Upon finding that the Planning Commission has issued a recommendation on the Preliminary PUD Plan, the Township Board may approve, approve with conditions, postpone or deny said Preliminary PUD Plan. Once the Township Board approves, approves with conditions, or denies the Preliminary PUD,
Charter Township of Oxford 14-25 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
the Clerk shall notify both the applicant and Planning Commission, in writing, of the Township Boards action.
C. Final PUD Plan. Following Township Board action on the Preliminary PUD Plan, the applicant shall submit a Final PUD Plan and application for the proposed PUD. If a Final PUD Plan is not submitted by the applicant for final approval within twelve (12) months of Preliminary PUD Plan approval by the Township Board, the Preliminary PUD Plan approval becomes null and void. In the case of multi-phase projects, such application for final approval shall be submitted for at least one (1) phase in the project. The Planning Commission may, however, issue a waiver for greater periods of time if it is determined to be appropriate, as a condition of Preliminary PUD Plan approval. Such extension and request of waiver shall be made prior to the expiration date.
1. Submittal. The Final PUD Plan, application form, and supplementary materials shall be submitted to the Building Department and shall be put on the next available Planning Commission agenda for consideration.
2. Information Required.

Charter Township of Oxford 14-29 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
not occur, however, until all exhibits (such as the final version of the Final PUD plans and building elevations; conservation, road and utility easement documents; recorded Master deeds or similar restrictions, etc.) are properly prepared and made available to the Township. The PUD (and corresponding zoning change) shall not be considered finalized until the executed PUD Agreement has been recorded with the County.

In the event that a planned unit development involves the partitioning of land into separate parcels, lots or condominium units, as enabled by Ordinance 104A, Ordinance 103, or Article 13 of this Ordinance, respectively, such review procedures may occur concurrent with PUD consideration. With respect to the platting process, tentative preliminary and final preliminary plat approval may be pursued concurrent with preliminary and final PUD approval, respectively, as provided for in this Section. Land division or condominium approval may be pursued concurrent with either preliminary or final PUD approval.
E. PUD Conditions.
1. Reasonable conditions may be required by the Township Board before the approval of a PUD, to the extent authorized by law, for the purpose of ensuring that public services and facilities affected by a proposed land use or activity will be capable of accommodating increased service and facility loads caused by the land use or activity, protecting the natural environment and conserving natural resources and energy, ensuring compatibility with adjacent uses of land, and promoting the use of land in a socially and economically desirable manner. The conditions of approval shall be drafted in writing, specifying conditions of approval and use, and incorporated in the PUD Agreement executed upon Final PUD approval.
2. Conditions may stipulate that the PUD may only be used for selective land uses, provided the restraints advance, rather than injure, the interests of adjacent landowners; are a means of harmonizing private interests in land, thus benefiting the public interest; are for the purposes of ensuring that the PUD fulfills the purposes and intent of this Section and thus, benefits the public interest; and/or possess a reasonable relationship to the promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare.
Charter Township of Oxford 14-30 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
3. Conditions imposed shall be designed to protect natural resources and the public health, safety, and welfare of individuals in the project and those immediately adjacent, and the community as a whole; reasonably related to the purposes affected by the PUD; and, necessary to meet the intent and purpose of this Ordinance, and be related to the objective of ensuring compliance with the standards of this Ordinance. All conditions imposed shall be made a part of the written record of the Final PUD Plan that shall include a site plan and written development agreement signed by the Township Supervisor, the Township Clerk and the applicant.
4. In the event that conditions set forth herein are not complied with, then the Zoning Enforcement Official shall have the right to compel a show cause hearing by the Planning Commission or issue a violation pursuant to Article 16 of this Ordinance. At the show cause hearing, additional conditions may be imposed by the Township and/or a new PUD application required.
14.7 Phasing and Commencement of Construction.
A. Phasing. Where a project is proposed for construction in phases, the planning and designing shall be such that, upon completion, each phase shall be capable of standing on its own in terms of the presence of services, facilities, and open space, and shall contain the necessary components to ensure protection of natural resources and the health, safety, and welfare of the users of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) and the residents of the surrounding area. In addition, in developments which include residential and non-residential uses, the relative mix of uses and the scheduled completion of construction for each phase shall be disclosed and determined to be reasonable in the discretion of the Township Board, after recommendation from the Planning Commission. Similarly, the schedule upon which any and all community benefits proposed in association with the development will be installed or otherwise become available shall be disclosed and determined to be reasonable at the discretion of the Township Board.
B. Commencement and Completion of Construction. Construction shall be commenced within one (1) year following the date of Final PUD Plan approval and shall proceed substantially in conformance with the schedule set forth by the applicant and in accordance with this Ordinance. If construction is not commenced within such time, any previous PUD plan approval shall expire and become null and void unless an extension is granted. An extension for up to one (1) year may be granted by the Planning Commission, upon good cause shown, if such request is made to the Planning Commission prior to the expiration of the initial period. Moreover, in the event the PUD plan approval has expired, a new application shall be
Charter Township of Oxford 14-31 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
required, and shall be reviewed according to existing and applicable law and ordinance provisions at the time of any subsequent submission.
14.8 Effect of Approval.
A. If and when approved, the Final PUD Plan for the Planned Unit Development (PUD), with any conditions imposed, shall constitute the land use authorization for the property, and all improvements and uses shall be in conformity with the approved plan. Subsequent to approval of the Final PUD Plan, the Zoning Official shall not issue building permits or Certificates of Occupancy unless the Zoning Official determines that all subsequent working drawings and plans comply with the approved Final PUD Plan and the Planning Commission's resolution of approval. However, once a PUD receives final approval, the Township shall not refuse to issue the necessary permits if the development proceeds in conformance with the approved plan, even though the PUD regulations and procedures may be changed or amended.
B. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to obtain all other applicable Township, County, and State permits for all phases of the project prior to commencing any clearing, earthwork, or other site development related work.
C. Since eligibility for a PUD rests entirely upon proof of specific substantial benefits to the community, as well as to the applicant, these benefits shall be considered part of the contract between the Township and the applicant. The benefits agreed upon by the Township and the applicant shall be listed on the plans and incorporated into the PUD Agreement.
Any breach, such as modification, disturbance, or destruction of natural features designated to remain untouched, shall cause approval of the PUD to be held null and void and shall result in suspension of all permits issued until the breach has been remediated to a condition as close as possible to that designated in the PUD plan.
Alternatively, the applicant may, at his discretion, commence the approval process again from the beginning. In this event, however, the Township shall be under no obligation whatsoever to approve the new project. Approval shall be entirely at the discretion of the Township, which may impose additional conditions on the applicant.
14.9 Modifications to Approved Final PUD Plans.
A. Deviations shall be reviewed by a Planned Unit Development Committee comprised of the Township Supervisor and one additional representative of the Township Board, the Planning Commission Chairperson and one additional representative of the Planning Commission, and the Township
Charter Township of Oxford 14-32 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
Zoning Official. Meetings of the PUD Committee shall be noticed and conducted in accordance with the Open Meetings Act, P.A. 267 or 1976.
B. An applicant or property owner who has been granted Final PUD approval shall notify the Planned Unit Development Committee of any proposed amendment to such approved site plan or Planned Unit Development conditions.
C. Minor Modifications. Minor modifications may be approved by the Planned Unit Development Committee upon certification in writing to the Planning Commission and Township Board that the proposed revision does not alter the basic design nor any conditions of the plan imposed upon the original approval by the Planning Commission and Township Board. In considering such a determination, the Planned Unit Development Committee shall consider the following to be a minor change:
1. Such changes will not adversely or substantially affect the initial basis for granting approval.
2. Such minor changes will not adversely or substantially affect the overall PUD, in light of intent and purpose of such development as set forth in Section 14.1.
3. For residential buildings, the size of structures may be decreased, or increased by up to ten (10) percent provided that the overall density of units does not increase.
4. Square footage of non-residential buildings may be decreased, or increased by up to ten (10) percent or 10,000 square feet, whichever is smaller.
5. Horizontal and/or vertical elevations may be altered by up to five (5) percent.
6. Movement of a building or buildings by no more than ten (10) feet.
7. Areas of disturbance may be decreased.
8. Plantings approved in the final PUD landscape plan may be replaced by similar types of landscaping on a one-to-one or greater basis.
9. Improvements to site access or circulation, such as inclusion of deceleration lanes, boulevards, curbing, pedestrian/bicycle paths, etc.
10. Changes of building materials to another of higher quality.
11. Changes in floor plans which do not alter the character of the use.
Charter Township of Oxford 14-33 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
12. Slight modification of sign placement or reduction of size.
13. Relocation of sidewalks and/or refuse storage stations.
14. Internal rearrangement of parking lots that does not affect the number of parking spaces or alter access locations or design.
15. Changes required or requested by the Township for safety reasons shall be considered a minor change, provided that they do not result in substantive changes in the approved PUD design.
D. Major Modifications. Modifications other than those noted above are considered major changes and shall be treated as a rezoning, requiring resubmittal to the Township and a new public hearing held pursuant to Section 14.6(B)(3). The procedures outlined in this Article shall apply in all such cases, however the Township may allow concurrent Preliminary and Final PUD review for major modifications to previously-approved PUD projects.
14.10 Recording of Planning Commission and Township Board Actions.
A. Each action taken with reference to a Planned Unit Development (PUD) shall be duly recorded in the minutes of the Planning Commission and Township Board. The reasons for the action taken shall also be recorded in the minutes.
B. A notice of adoption of the PUD shall be filed with the Oakland County Register of Deeds.
14.11 Costs Associated with PUD Review. Costs incurred by the Township associated with the processing of PUD proposals and the preparation of PUD Agreements (including review by the Townships consultants) shall be covered in full through the collection of appropriate fees and escrows by the Township. The Township Board may from time to time establish an appropriate fee schedule for PUD Review and PUD Agreement drafting by Resolution.

ARTICLE 15
NONCONFORMITIES
15.1 Intent. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit nonconforming lots, structures, or uses to continue until they are removed but not to encourage their survival.
It is recognized that there exists within the districts established by this Ordinance and subsequent amendments, uses which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or future amendments. Such uses are declared by this Ordinance to be incompatible permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this Ordinance by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction material in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved.
15.2 Nonconforming Lots.
A. In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record legally existing at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area, or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district; provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Yard requirement variances may be obtained through approval of the Board of Appeals.
Charter Township of Oxford 15-2 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
B. Where multiple lots of record in an existing subdivision plat have been combined, they may be redivided to match the same lot boundaries shown on the original plat, without prior approval of variances from the ZBA for minimum lot width or area requirements.
15.3 Nonconforming Uses of Land. Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this Ordinance as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as it remains lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance.
B. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance.
C. If such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than one hundred eighty (180) days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this Ordinance for the district in which such land is located.
15.4 Nonconforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity; for example, existing residences on lots of a width less than required herein may add a rear porch provided that other requirements relative to yard space and land coverage are met.
B. Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its replacement cost, exclusive of the foundation at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
C. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after it is moved.
15.5 Nonconforming Uses of Structures and Land. If a lawful use of a structure, or of structures and land in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, that would not be allowed in the district under the
Charter Township of Oxford 15-3 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
terms of this Ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
B. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and which existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
C. In any district, if no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or a more restricted classification provided that the Zoning Board of Appeals, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Zoning Board of Appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the purpose and intent of this Ordinance. Where a nonconforming use of a structure, land, or a structure and land in combination is hereafter changed to a more restrictive classification, it shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted classification.
D. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
E. When a nonconforming use of a structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or ceases to exist for six (6) consecutive months, or for eighteen (18) months during any three year period, the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located. Structures occupied by seasonal uses shall be excepted from this provision.
F. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
15.6 Repairs and Maintenance. On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of this Ordinance shall not be
Charter Township of Oxford 15-4 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
increased. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting public safety, upon order of such official.
15.7 Uses Allowed as Special Land Uses Not Nonconforming Uses. Any use which is permitted as a special land use as provided in this Ordinance shall not be deemed a nonconforming use but shall without further action be deemed as a conforming use in such district.
15.8 Change of Tenancy or Ownership. There may be a change of tenancy, ownership or management of any existing nonconforming uses of land, structures and premises provided there is no change in the nature or character of such nonconforming uses.

C. Where repairs to a single-family dwelling and/or residential accessory building are exclusive of structural, mechanical or electrical modifications, the Zoning Administrator shall not require a Certificate of Zoning Compliance.
D. Where the review of construction engineering drawings by the Township Engineer, and calling of a pre-construction meeting, is required pursuant to the Charter Township of Oxford Land Improvement Ordinance (No. 108A), no building permit shall be issued until these steps have been taken.
16.5 Certificates of Occupancy. No building, structure or use for which a Zoning Compliance Permit has been issued shall be used or occupied until the Zoning Administrator has, after final inspection, issued a Certificate of Occupancy indicating his/her opinion that all provisions of this Ordinance are being complied with at the time of issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. The issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy shall in no case be construed as waiving any provisions of this ordinance.
A. Certificates of Occupancy shall not be issued for any building, structure, or use unless and until:
1. A Zoning Compliance Permit has been issued which certifies that the building, structure, and/or use proposed conform to the requirements of this Ordinance and the Building Code at the time of issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.
2. The developer of a residential, commercial or industrial multi-unit development has submitted record drawings of all applicable improvements (including landscaping and that portion of the completed water system or sewer system servicing the development at issue), and the required record drawings have been approved and accepted by the Township Engineer. The record drawings shall conform to the requirements of the Sewer Operational Ordinance and Water Supply Ordinance, respectively.
Charter Township of Oxford 16-6 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)

B. Temporary Certificates of Occupancy.
1. Temporary Certificates of Occupancy may be considered for issuance by the administrative official where all of the following conditions are met:

d. Submittal of a performance guarantee, in conformance with Section 16.8, which is equal to the full cost of all incomplete site work as estimated by the Township, utilizing standard construction cost estimating publications.
2. Temporary Certificates of Occupancy are not intended to permit occupancy of a building or use of a site during fair weather seasons if site improvements are not complete. The owner/applicants scheduling of an opening date prior to completion of site work does not constitute grounds for issuance of a Temporary Certificates of Occupancy.
3. Temporary Certificates of Occupancy shall be granted for a period not to exceed six (6) months. Said period shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the time necessary to accommodate fair
Charter Township of Oxford 16-7 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
weather installation of all remaining improvements. No extensions of Temporary Certificates of Occupancy shall be granted.
4. Failure to complete all required site improvements will result in further action by the Township to ensure compliance with approved plans and the provisions of any temporary certificate of occupancy.
16.6 Compliance with Plans. Building permits and Certificates of Occupancy issued by the Building Department on the basis of plans and applications approved by the Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission and/or Township Board authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications, and no other use, arrangement, or construction.

The Township may draw upon the trust and agency account in order to defray the costs to the Township of such professional reviews, and the Zoning Administrator shall require additional deposits into the trust and agency account in order to ensure that sufficient funds will be available to defray anticipated professional review costs.
Charter Township of Oxford 16-8 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
b. All approvals under this ordinance shall be conditioned upon the applicants or petitioners compliance with Section 16.7(B)(1), either through the use of the trust and agency account or through payments to the Township other than deposits into the trust and agency account.

16.8 Performance Guarantees.
A. Intent and Scope of Requirements. To insure compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance or any conditions imposed thereunder, the Planning Commission or Township Board may require that a performance guarantee be deposited with the Township to insure faithful completion of improvements, in accordance with Section 505 of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, P.A. 110 of 2006, as amended, when one or more of the following conditions apply:
1. Failure to complete the improvements would be detrimental to future users of the property, adjacent properties, or the community as a whole;
2. The improvements are integral to community benefits associated with a proposal.
3. The improvements are likely to be phased or staged over a significant period of time.
B. Improvements for which the Township may require a performance guarantee include, but are not limited to, landscaping, berms, walls, lighting, driveways and parking, acceleration/deceleration lanes, traffic control devices, sidewalks, and land reclamation activities.
C. General Requirements. The performance guarantee shall meet the following requirements:
Charter Township of Oxford 16-9 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
1. The performance guarantee shall be in the form of an irrevocable bank letter of credit or cash escrow. If the applicant posts a letter of credit, the credit shall require only that the Township present the credit with a sight draft and an affidavit signed by the Township Supervisor attesting to the Townships right to draw funds under the credit. If the applicant posts a cash escrow, the escrow instructions shall provide that the escrow agent shall have a legal duty to deliver the funds to the Township whenever the Township Supervisor presents an affidavit to the agent attesting to the Townships right to received funds whether or not the applicant protests that right. If the applicant cannot produce a letter of credit with terms suitable to the Township, then a cash escrow shall be provided.
2. The performance guarantee shall be submitted at the time of issuance of the permit authorizing the activity or project. If appropriate based on the type of performance guarantee submitted, the Township shall deposit the funds in an interest-bearing account in a financial institution with which the Township regularly conducts business.
3. The amount of the performance guarantee shall be sufficient to cover the estimated cost of the improvements for which the performance guarantee is required, as well as the cost to prepare all required record drawings. The applicant shall provide an itemized schedule of estimated costs to complete all such improvements. The exact amount of the performance guarantee shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator.
4. The entire performance guarantee shall be returned to the applicant following inspection by the Zoning Administrator and a determination that the required improvements have been completed satisfactorily. The performance guarantee may be released to the applicant in proportion to the work completed on various elements, provided that a minimum of ten percent (10%) shall be held back on each element until satisfactory completion of the entire project.
5. An amount not less than ten percent (10%) of the total performance guarantee may be retained for a period of at least one (1) year after installation of landscape materials to insure proper maintenance and replacement, if necessary. This amount shall be released to the applicant upon certification by the Zoning Administrator that all landscape materials are being maintained in good condition.
D. Unsatisfactory Completion of Improvements. Whenever required improvements are not installed or maintained within the time stipulated or in accordance with the standards set forth in this Ordinance, the Township may complete the necessary improvements itself or by contract to an
Charter Township of Oxford 16-10 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
independent developer, and assess all costs of completing said improvements against the performance guarantee. Prior to completing said improvements, the Township shall notify the owner, site plan review applicant, or other firm or individual responsible for completion of the required improvements.
E. Trust and Agency Accounts. If an applicant fails to comply with the requirement of Section 16.7(B)(1), and its Trust and Agency account as provided for in Section 16.7(B)(2) has insufficient funds for the Township to draw upon in order to defray the costs of reviewing the applicants application, then the Township may assess such costs against the performance guarantee.
16.9 Notice of Public Hearing. All applications requiring notice of a public hearing (including zoning ordinance text and map amendments, planned unit developments, special land use permits and ZBA hearings) shall comply with the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act (P.A. 110 of 2006), and the provisions of this Section with regard to public notification.

The chairperson or, in his or her absence, the acting chairperson may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. The ZBA shall not conduct business unless a majority of its regular members are present.
17.4 Voting. The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the ZBA is necessary to reverse an order, requirement, decision, or determination of the administrative official or body, to decide in favor of the applicant on a matter upon which the ZBA is required to pass under the Zoning Ordinance, or to grant a variance of Zoning Ordinance requirements.
17.5 Minutes. The ZBA shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be a public record and be immediately filed in the office of the Township Clerk.
17.6 Jurisdiction. The ZBA shall hear and decide questions that arise in the administration of the Zoning Ordinance, including the interpretation of the Official Zoning Map, and may adopt rules to govern its procedures.

17.7 Appeals. The ZBA shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official or body in the enforcement of this Ordinance.

Charter Township of Oxford 17-3 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
B. Stay of Proceedings. An appeal to the ZBA stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the body or officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the ZBA after the notice of appeal is filed that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in the opinion of the body or officer cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings may be stayed by a restraining order issued by the ZBA or a circuit court.
C. Hearing. Upon receipt of a written request for an appeal of an administrative decision, the ZBA shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the request, not to exceed 30 days from the filing of the notice of appeal, and give notice as provided in Section 16.9. At the hearing, a party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.
D. The ZBA shall overturn, wholly or in part, an order, requirement, decision or determination only if it finds that the appealed action was inconsistent with this Ordinance. To implement such action, the ZBA shall make such order, decision, or determination as ought to be made, consistent with the terms of this Ordinance, and to that end shall have the powers of the administrative body or official from whom the appeal is taken under appellate jurisdiction.
17.8 Variances. The ZBA may, on a case-by-case basis, authorize such nonuse variances from the terms of this Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance would result in practical difficulties.
A. Variances Permitted. The ZBA shall have the authority to grant nonuse variances relating to the construction, structural changes, or alteration of buildings or structures related to dimensional requirements of the Zoning Ordinance or to any other nonuse-related standard in this Ordinance. Under no circumstances shall the ZBA grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this Ordinance in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this Ordinance in said district.
B. Procedures. A variance from the terms of this Ordinance shall not be granted by the ZBA except in accordance with the following procedures:
1. Submittal of Application. A written application for a variance shall be submitted, demonstrating conformance with the standards outlined in Section 17.8(C).
2. Hearing. Upon receipt of the written application for a variance, the ZBA shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the request, not to exceed 30 days from the filing of the application, and give notice as
Charter Township of Oxford 17-4 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
provided in Section 16.9. At the hearing, a party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.
3. ZBA Findings.
a. The ZBA shall make findings of fact based upon competent evidence that practical difficulty has been demonstrated in accordance with the standards of Section 17.8(C) .
b. The ZBA shall further make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of a variance, and that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
c. The ZBA shall further make a finding that the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Ordinance, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
C. Standards. Neither the nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district, nor either the permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures, or buildings in any other district(s) shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. In reviewing a request for variance, the following standards for determining practical difficulty shall be considered, with no single factor being determinative:
1. Strict compliance with restrictions governing area, setback, frontage, height, bulk, density or other non-use matters, will unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or will render ordinance conformity unnecessarily burdensome.
2. The variance will do substantial justice to the applicant, as well as to other property owners.
3. A lesser variance than requested will not give substantial relief to the applicant and will not be more consistent with justice to other property owners.
4. The need for the variance is due to the unique circumstances peculiar to the property and not generally applicable in the area or to other properties in the same zoning district.
5. The problem and resulting need for the variance has not been self-created by the applicant and/or the applicant's predecessors.
D. Conditions and Safeguards. In granting any variance, the ZBA may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part
Charter Township of Oxford 17-5 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance and punishable under Article 16 of this Ordinance. Conditions imposed shall meet all of the following requirements:
1. Be designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety and welfare, and the social and economic well being of those who will use the building, land or activity under consideration, residents and landowners immediately adjacent to the proposed building, land use or activity, and the community as a whole.
2. Be related to the valid exercise of the police power, and purposes which are affected by the proposed building, use or activity.
3. Be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance, be related to the standards established in the Ordinance for the building, land use or activity under consideration, and be necessary to insure compliance with those standards.
E. Expiration. Each variance approved shall become null and void unless a building permit has been issued for the construction authorized by the variance within 365 calendar days after the date of approval and construction has been pursued diligently to completion; or the occupancy of land or buildings authorized by the variance has commenced within 365 calendar days after the date of approval.
1. Where a building permit has been issued for construction authorized by a variance, the variance shall become null and void upon expiration of the building permit.
2. Where a variance has been approved for a project subject to site plan approval per Article 12 (Site Plan Review), the variance shall become null and void only upon expiration of an approved final site plan for the project.
3. The Board of Appeals may, upon written request by the petitioner with a showing of good cause, grant one (1) extension of variance approval for up to an additional 180 calendar days.
17.9 Appeals from the Zoning Board of Appeals. The decision of the ZBA shall be final. Any person or persons, or any taxpayer, department, board, or bureau of the municipality aggrieved by any decision of the ZBA may seek review by a court of record of such decision, in the manner provided by the laws of the State of Michigan.

18.5 Conditional Rezoning.
A. Intent. It is recognized that there are certain instances where it would be in the best interests of the Township, as well as advantageous to property owners seeking a change in zoning classification, that certain conditions could be proposed by property owners as part of a request for rezoning. This is especially true since the Township must consider all potential uses which may be made of property when considering a traditional rezoning request, some of which may be inappropriate for a particular piece of property considering such items as, but not limited to, the surrounding land uses, the Township Master Plan, available infrastructure and utilities, and natural features. It is the intent of this Section to provide a process consistent with the provisions of Section 405 of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, Public Act 110 of 2006 as amended, MCL 125.3101 et. seq., by which the owner seeking a rezoning may voluntarily propose conditions regarding the use and/or development of land as part of the rezoning request.
B. Application and Offer of Conditions. An owner of land may voluntarily offer in writing conditions relating to the use and/or development of land for which a conditional rezoning is requested. This offer may be made either at the time the application for conditional rezoning is filed, or additional conditions may be offered at a later time during the conditional rezoning process as set forth below:
1. General Procedure. A request for conditional rezoning shall be commenced by filing an application with the Township Zoning Administrator or designee, on the required forms, accompanied by the specified fees. The application and process for considering a conditional rezoning request will be the same as that for considering a rezoning request without any conditions, except as modified by this Section. The application shall explicitly describe the proposed conditional rezoning and shall be signed by the owner of the property. Applications for conditional rezoning of a specific site shall be accompanied by a plot plan or survey which contains all the information required in Section 18.3 of this Ordinance. The applicant shall also present a preliminary plan showing the specific proposed use of the property and containing all the information outlined in Section 12.3(B) of this Ordinance.
2. Pre-Application Conference. Prior to filing a formal request for a conditional rezoning, and prior to a public hearing, the applicant shall informally meet with the Township Zoning Administrator or designee,
Charter Township of Oxford 18-4 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
and other representatives as deemed necessary by the Township, to discuss the proposed development. The Pre-Application Conference is intended to be informative and advisory in nature, and affords the applicant the opportunity to discuss the land use and planning policies of the Charter Township of Oxford. The applicant shall present a preliminary plan for the contemplated conditional rezoning at or before the Pre-Application Conference. Any and all statements made by the Charter Township of Oxford Board of Trustees, Zoning Administrator or designee, Planning Commissioners, Township employees, attorneys, agents, or representatives at the Pre-Application Conference have no legal force and are not legal and binding promises, commitments, or contracts.
C. Review Procedures. The offer of conditions may not purport to authorize uses or developments not permitted in the requested Zoning District. The owners offer of conditions shall bear a reasonable and rational relationship to the property for which the conditional rezoning is requested. Further, the Planning Commission and Township Board shall, at a minimum, consider all the review considerations contained in Section 18.2(C) of this Ordinance in rendering a decision on a request for conditional rezoning.
1. Other Required Approvals.
a. Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that would require a Special Land Use Permit under the terms of this Ordinance may only be commenced if a Special Land Use Permit for such use or development is ultimately granted in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
b. Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that would require a variance under the terms of this Ordinance may only be commenced if a variance for such use or development is ultimately granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with this Ordinance.
c. Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that would require site plan approval under the terms of this Ordinance may only be commenced if site plan approval for such use or development is ultimately granted in accordance with the terms of this Ordinance.
2. Amendment of Conditions. The offer of conditions may be amended during the process of conditional rezoning consideration, provided that any amended or additional conditions are entered voluntarily by the owner, and confirmed in writing. An owner may withdraw in
Charter Township of Oxford 18-5 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
writing all or part of its offer of conditions any time prior to final rezoning action of the Township Board provided that, if such withdrawal occurs subsequent to the Planning Commissions Public Hearing on the original rezoning request, then the rezoning application shall be referred back to the Planning Commission for a new Public Hearing with appropriate notice and a new recommendation.
D. Planning Commission Review. The Planning Commission, after a public hearing and consideration of the factors for rezoning set forth in Section 18.2(C) of this Ordinance, may recommend approval, approval with recommended changes, or denial of the rezoning; provided however, that any recommended changes to the offer of conditions are acceptable to and thereafter offered to the owner in writing. In the event that any recommended changes to the offer of conditions are not subsequently offered by the owner in writing, the recommendation of the Planning Commission shall be considered by the Township Board to be a recommendation of denial of the proposed conditional rezoning.
E. Township Board Review. After receipt of the Planning Commissions recommendation, the Township Board shall review the Planning Commissions recommendation and deliberate upon the requested conditional rezoning, considering the factors for rezoning set forth in Section 18.2(C), and may approve or deny the conditional rezoning request. If the applicant initiates additional or different conditions not considered by the Planning Commission subsequent to the recommendation of the Planning Commission, then the Township Board shall refer such proposed additional or different conditions to the Planning Commission for report within a time specified by the Township Board, and the Township Board shall thereafter proceed to deny or approve the conditional rezoning.
F. Approval. If the Township Board finds the conditional rezoning request and offer of conditions acceptable, the offer of conditions shall be incorporated into a formal written Statement of Conditions acceptable to the owner and conforming in form to the provisions of this Section. The Statement of Conditions shall be incorporated by attachment or otherwise as an inseparable part of the Ordinance adopted by the Township Board to accomplish the requested conditional rezoning. The Statement of Conditions shall:
1. Be prepared in a form recordable with the Oakland County Register of Deeds;
2. Contain a legal description of the land to which it pertains;
3. Contain a statement acknowledging that the Statement of Conditions runs with the land, and is binding upon successor owners of the land;
Charter Township of Oxford 18-6 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
4. Incorporate by attachment the preliminary plan which formed the basis of the conditional rezoning;
5. Contain the notarized signatures of all the owners of the property, and that they voluntarily offer and consent to the provisions contained with the Statement of Conditions;
6. The Statement of Conditions may be reviewed and approved by the Township Attorney, with the applicant to pay all costs associated with such review and approval.
The approved Statement of Conditions shall be filed by the owner with the Oakland County Register of Deeds within thirty (30) days after approval of the conditional rezoning. The owner shall provide the Township with a recorded copy of the Statement of Conditions within thirty (30) days of receipt.
Upon the conditional rezoning taking effect, the Zoning Map shall be amended to reflect the new zoning classification, together with a designation that the land was a Conditional Rezoning with a Statement of Conditions. Upon the conditional rezoning taking effect, and after the required recording of the Statement of Conditions, unless waived, use of the land so rezoned shall conform thereafter to all the requirements regulating use and development within the new Zoning District as modified by any more restrictive provisions contained in the Statement of Conditions.
G. Compliance with Conditions. Any person who establishes development or commences a use upon land that has been conditionally rezoned shall continuously operate and maintain the development or use in full compliance with all the conditions set forth in the Statement of Conditions. Any failure to comply fully with the conditions contained within the Statement of Conditions shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance and be punishable accordingly. Additionally, any such violation shall be deemed a nuisance per se and subject to judicial abatement by law.
H. Time Period for Establishing Development or Use. The approved development and/or use of the land pursuant to building and other required permits must be commenced upon the land within twelve (12) months after the effective date by publication of the conditional rezoning action, and must thereafter proceed diligently to completion. This time limitation, may upon written request, be extended by the Township Board if:
1. It is demonstrated to the Township Boards sole satisfaction that there is a strong likelihood that the development and/or use will commence within the period of extension and proceed diligently thereafter to completion, and
Charter Township of Oxford 18-7 Zoning Ordinance (Effective 3/29/07)
2. The Township Board finds that there has been change in circumstances that would render the conditional rezoning with Statement of Conditions incompatible with other Zoning Districts and uses in the surrounding area or otherwise inconsistent with sound zoning policy.
I. Reversion of Zoning. If an approved development and/or use of the rezoned land does not occur within the time frame specified in Subsection H above, then the land shall revert to its former zoning classification as set forth in MCL 125.3405(2). The reversion process shall be initiated by the Township Board, and proceed pursuant to Section 18.2.
J. Subsequent Rezoning of Land. When land that is conditionally rezoned with the Statement of Conditions is thereafter rezoned to a different zoning classification, or to the same zoning classification but with a different or no Statement of Conditions, whether as a result of a reversion of zoning pursuant to Subsection I above, or upon application of the landowner, or otherwise, the Statement of Conditions imposed under the former zoning classification shall cease to be in effect. Upon the owners written request, the Township Clerk shall record with the Oakland County Register of Deeds a notice that the Statement of Conditions is no longer in effect.
K. Amendment of Conditions. During the time period for commencement of an approved development or use specified pursuant to Subsection H above, or during any extension thereof granted by the Township Board, the Township shall not add to or alter the conditions in the Statement of Conditions. The Statement of Conditions may be amended thereafter in the same manner as was prescribed for the original conditional rezoning and Statement of Conditions.
L. Township Right to Rezone. Nothing in the Statement of Conditions nor in the provisions of this Section shall be deemed to prohibit the Township from rezoning all or any portion of land that is subject to a Statement of Conditions to another zoning classification. Any rezoning shall be conducted in compliance with this Ordinance and the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, Public Act 110 of 2006 as amended, MCL 125.3101 et seq.
M. Failure to Offer Conditions. The Township shall not require an owner to offer conditions as a requirement for rezoning. The lack of an offer of conditions shall not affect an owners rights under this Ordinance.
