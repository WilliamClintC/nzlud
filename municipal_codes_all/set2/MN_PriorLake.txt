301.1703. The occurrence of multiple violations is grounds for deviation from the
presumed penalties in the Council’s discretion.
Business Regulations
City of Prior Lake
301/p18
301.1707 Subsequent Violations. Violations occurring after the notice of hearing has been
mailed, but prior to the hearing, shall be treated as a separate violation and dealt

301.1708 Computation of Appearances. After the first appearance, a subsequent
appearance by the same license holder will be determined as follows:

and the current violation occurred within five (5) years of the first appearance, the
current violation will be treated as a third appearance.
3) If a license holder has appeared before the Council on three (3) previous occasions,
and the current violation occurred within seven (7) years of the first appearance, the

period and upon payment of all fines by the license holder. No license shall be
reinstated, and no sales of alcohol-related products may be made until all fines have

suspension shall constitute a violation of subsection 301.1705 and result in the
automatic revocation of the license.
301.1711 Other Enforcement of Action. A civil penalty, suspension or revocation or
combination thereof under this Section does not preclude any private civil action or
any criminal prosecution under this Section or any other federal, state or local law,
statute, ordinance or regulation.

identification misrepresenting the minor’s age, and all minors lawfully engaged in a
compliance check shall answer all questions about the minor’s age asked by the
license holder or his or her employee and shall produce any identification for which
he or she is asked.

308.100: PURPOSE: The City Council finds that substantial scientific evidence exists that the use
of tobacco-related products causes cancer, heart disease, and various other medical
disorders. It is further finding of the City Council that the present legislative scheme of
prohibiting sales of tobacco-related products to persons under the age of twenty-one (21)
has proven ineffective in preventing such persons from using tobacco-related products.
The City Council has concluded that persons under the age of twenty-one (21) have
ready access to self-service merchandising, including vending machines, which sell
tobacco-related products. The City Council has also concluded that the prohibition of the
sale or dispensing of tobacco-related products through vending machines and the
regulation of sales through self-service merchandising will thereby promote the health,
safety and welfare of the residents of the City, particularly those residents under twentyone
(21) years of age.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this Section is to regulate the conditions under which
a merchant in the C-3 ( town center) business district may request and receive a
permit to sell or display merchandise for sale in a designated area on a public
sidewalk. The City Council is aware that the public sidewalk is intended for the
orderly passage of pedestrians in the downtown and that any conflict between
users of the sidewalk and sidewalk sales is undesirable.
PERMIT REQUIRED: A retail establishment in the C- 3 ( town center) business
district may apply to the City for a special permit, heretofore known as a Sidewalk
Sales Permit (" Permit") to conduct a portion of such business on a sidewalk. A
permit shall be valid for one year from the date of issuance.
RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS:
a) A permit issued pursuant to this Section shall designate the area where
merchandise display and sales will be offered (" designated area.") No sale or
service shall be permitted on any portion of the sidewalk not designated in
the Permit or on any portion of the street designated for vehicular travel.
b) A Permit shall not be construed as authorizing the permanent installation of
any articles in the designated area of the sidewalk.
c) No merchandise, tables, chairs, furnishings or other equipment shall be
permitted in the designated area at any time during which the merchant' s
business is not open and operating.
d) No Permit shall be valid in any location where the same is prohibited, now or
in the future, by state law or this Section. .
e) Sidewalks adjacent to the merchant' s establishment ( building to street) shall
be swept and washed daily by the Permit holder. Trash shall be disposed of
and electricity provided from within the establishment.
f) Permits will define the designated area which will limit the merchandise
display and sales to placement immediately adjacent to the establishment,
provided that a five ( 5) foot width of sidewalk remains for pedestrians.
g) The Permit for the use of a designated area of a public sidewalk for sidewalk
sales shall not be an exclusive use. All public improvements including but not

Business Regulations
limited to trees, light poles, planters, traffic signals, refuse containers,
benches or any other public- initiated maintenance procedure shall take
precedence of the sidewalk sales area use at all times. A Permittee may not (
use the designated area during any City- sponsored events without
permission of the City Manager. The City Manager shall determine whether
the encumbrance of the designated area of the public sidewalk designated by
the Permit interferes with the City-sponsored function and, if so, the
designated area shall not be used by the Permittee during said period.
PERMIT PROCEDURE:
a) An applicant for a Permit under this Section shall file an application on forms
provided by the City.
b) The Permit application shall include a scaled diagram including, but not

tables, fixtures or anything else to be placed upon the sidewalks including the
width of the sidewalk remaining for pedestrian movement to access, egress
and walk by the designated area on each public sidewalk face of the building.
c) The application and diagram will be referred to the planning building,
engineering, police and fire departments for evaluation, recommendation and
any conditions to be included in the Permit to protect the public health, safety
and welfare.
d) The recommendations of the departments specified above, along with
consideration of public health and safety issues, egress, ingress and
unobstructed sidewalk width will be considered in determining whether a
Permit will be issued.
e) The City Manager may impose conditions upon the Permit which, in the
judgment of the City Manager, protect and promote the health, safety and
welfare of the public or prevent a nuisance from occurring. Such conditions
may include, but are not limited to:
1. Restrictions on hours, days and months of operation.
2. Special sanitation and clean- up procedures.
3. Types of furnishings or fixtures to be used.
4. Restrictions upon audio, video or communication equipment.
5. Lighting, plantings or adornments.
6. Signage.
f) Within thirty ( 30) days receipt of a completed application, the City Manager
shall inform the applicant in writing as to the approval or denial of the Permit
request.
INSURANCE: No Permit issued pursuant to this Section shall be effective until the
applicant therefore has filed with the City evidence of insurance insuring the
proposed permittee against liabilities imposed by law arising out of ownership,
maintenance or operation of such sidewalk sales area in the amount of at least
two- hundred thousand dollars ($ 200, 000) for the injury or death of one person;
five- hundred thousand dollars ($ 500, 000) for the injury or death of two persons,
and ten- thousand dollars ($ 10,000) for damage to property. The City shall be

policy shall further provide that it may not be canceled except upon thirty ( 30)
days written notice to the City. No Permit issued pursuant to this Section sehalll;>

applicant who has previously been granted such a Permit.

measures to prevent the Electric Facilities from causing damage to persons or
property. The Company must take protective measures when the City performs

liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid damaging
Electric Facilities while performing any activity.

FACILITIES RELOCATION
Relocation in Public Wavs. The Company shall comply with Minnesota Rules,
part 7819. 3100 and applicable City ordinances consistent with law. If a relocation
is ordered within five years of a prior relocation of the same Electric Facilities,
which was made at Company expense, the City shall reimburse Company for nonbetterment
costs on a time and material basis, provided that if a subsequent
relocation is required because of the extension of a City Utility System to a
previously unserved area, Company may be required to make the subsequent
relocation at its expense. Nothing in this Ordinance requires Company to relocate,
remove, replace or reconstruct at its own expense its Electric Facilities where such
relocation, removal, replacement or reconstruction is solely for the convenience of
the City and is not reasonably necessary for the construction or reconstruction of a
Public Way or City Utility System or other City improvement.
Relocation in Public Grounds. City may require Company at Company' s
expense to relocate or remove its Electric Facilities from Public Ground upon a
finding by City that the Electric Facilities have become or will become a substantial
impairment to the existing or proposed public use of the Public Ground.
Proiects with Federal Fundinq. Relocation, removal, or rearrangement of any
Company Electric Facilities made necessary solely because of the extension into
or through City of a federally- aided highway project shall be governed by the
provisions of Minnesota Statutes, Section 161.46, as supplemented or amended.
It is understood that the right herein granted to Company is a valuable right. City
shall not order Company to remove or relocate its Electric Facilities when a Public
Way is vacated, improved or realigned because of a renewal or a redevelopment
plan which is financially subsidized in whole or in part by the Federal Govemment
or any agency thereof, unless the reasonable non- betterment costs of such
relocation and the loss and expense resulting therefrom are first paid to Company,
but the City need not pay those portions of such for which reimbursement to it is
not available. .
No Waiver. The provisions of this franchise apply only to facilities constructed in
reliance on a franchise from the City and shall not be construed to waive or modify
any rights obtained by Company for installations within a Company right- of-way
acquired by easement or prescriptive right before the applicable Public Way or
Public Ground was established, or Company's rights under state or county permit.
This provision is unrelated to the collection of any franchise fee imposed by the
City.
FRANCHISE FEE
Form. During the term of the franchise hereby granted, and in lieu of any other
permit fees being imposed or that the City has a right to impose, the City may
charge the Company a franchise fee. The Company shall collect the amounts
indicated in a Fee Schedule set forth in a separate ordinance from each
customer in the designated Company Customer Class. " Customer Class" shall
refer to the classes listed on the Fee Schedule and as defined or determined in

Business Regulations
Company' s electric tariffs on file with the Commission. " Fee Schedule" refers to
the schedule below setting forth the various customer classes from which a
franchise fee would be collected if a separate ordinance were implemented
immediately after the effective date of this franchise agreement. The Fee
Schedule in the separate ordinance may include new Customer Classes added
by Company to its electric tariffs after the effective date of this franchise
agreement.
SeDarate Ordinance. The franchise fee shall be imposed by separate
ordinance duly adopted by the City Council and served upon Company by
certified mail. The fee shall not become effective until the beginning of a
Company billing month at least 60 days after written notice enclosing such
adopted ordinance had been served upon Company by certified mail.
Condition of Fee. The separate ordinance imposing the fee shall not be
effective against the Company unless it lawfully imposes a fee of the same or
substantially similar amount on the sale of energy within the City by any other
energy supplier, provided that, as to such supplier, the City has the authority to
require a franchise fee.
Collection of Fee. The franchise fee shall be payable quarterly and shall be
based on the amount collected by Company during complete billing months
during the period for which payment is to be made by imposing a surcharge
equal to the designated franchise fee for the applicable customer classification in
all customer billings for electric service in each class. The payment shall be due
the last business day of the month following the period for which the payment is
made. The franchise fee may be changed by ordinance from time to time;
however, each change shall meet the same notice requirements to the' Company
and not occur more often than annually and no change shall require a collection
from any customer for electric service in excess of the amounts specifically
permitted by the franchise fee ordinance. The time and manner of collecting the
franchise fee is subject to the approval of the Commission. No franchise fee shall
be payable by Company, if Company is legally unable to first collect an amount
equal to the franchise fee from its customers in each applicable class of
customers by imposing a surcharge in Company' s applicable rates for electric
service, Company may pay the City the fee based upon the surcharge billed
subject to subsequent reductions to accounts for uncollectibles, refunds and
correction of erroneous billings. Company agrees to make its records available
for inspection by the City at reasonable times provided that the City and its
designated representative agree in writing not to disclose any information which
would indicate the amount paid by any identifiable customer or customers or any
other information regarding identified customers.
Eauivalent Fee Reauiremenl The separate ordinance imposing the fee shall
not be effective against Company unless it lawfully imposes and the City monthly
or more often collects a fee or tax of the same or greater equivalent amount on
the receipts from sales of energy within the City by any other energy supplier,
provided that, as to such a supplier, the City has the authority to require a
franchise fee or to impose a tax. The " same or greater equivalent amount" shall
be measured, if practicable, by comparing amounts collected as a franchise fee

from each similar customer, or by comparing, as to similar customers the
percentage of the annual bill represented by the amount collected for franchise
fee purposes. The franchise fee or tax shall be applicable to energy sales for
any energy use related to heating, cooling or lighting, or to run machinery and
appliances, but shall not apply to energy sales for the purpose of providing fuel
for vehicles. If the Company specifically consents in writing to a franchise or
separate ordinance collecting or failing to collect a fee from another energy
supplier in contravention of this Section, the forgoing conditions will be waived to
the extent of such written consent.
Continuation of Franchise Fee. If this franchise expires and the City and the
Company are unable to agree upon terms of a new franchise, the franchise fee, if
any being imposed by the City at the time this franchise expires, will remain in
effect for a period not to exceed one year.
TREE TRIMMING
Unless otherwise provided in any permit or other reasonable regulation required by
the City under separate ordinance, Company may trim all trees and shrubs in the
Public Ways and Public Grounds of City to the extent Company finds necessary to
avoid interference with the proper construction, operation, repair and maintenance
of any Electric Facilities installed hereunder, provided that Company shall hold the
City harmless from any liability arising therefrom.
INDEMNIFICATION
Indemnitv of City. Company shall indemnify and hold the city harmless from any
and all liability, on account of injury to persons or damage to property occasioned
by the construction, maintenance, repair, inspection, the issuance of permits, or
the operation of the Electric Facilities located in the Public Ways and Public
Grounds. The City shall not be indemnified for losses or claims occasioned
through its own negligence except for losses or claims arising out of or alleging the
City' s negligence as to the issuance of permits for, or inspection of, Company's
plans or work. The City shall not be indemnified if the injury or damage results
from the performance in a proper manner of acts reasonable deemed hazardous
by Company, and such performance is nevertheless ordered or directed by City
after notice of Company's determination.
Defense of City. In the event a suit is brought against the City under
circumstances where this agreement to indemnify applies, Company at its sole
cost and expense shall defend the City in such suit if written notice thereof is
promptly given to Company within a period wherein Company is not prejudiced by
lack of such notice. If Company is required to indemnify and defend, it will
thereafter have control of such litigation, but Company may not settle such
litigation without the consent of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonable
withheld. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or
immunity otherwise available to the City; and Company, in defending any action on
behalf of the City shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity
that the City could assert in its own behalf.

vacation of a Public Way. The City and the Company shall comply with Minnesota
Rules, 7819. 3200 and applicable ordinances consistent with law. Except where

installation of Electric Facilities, shall not operate to deprive Company of its rights
to operate and maintain such Electric Facilities, until the reasonable cost of
relocating the same and the loss and expense resulting from such relocation are
first paid to Company. In no case, however, shall City be liable to Company for
failure to specifically preserve a right- of-way under Minnesota Statutes, Section
160. 29.
ABANDONED FACILITIES
Company may abandon underground electric Facilities in place, provided at the
city' s request, Company will remove abandoned metal or concrete encased

separate from every other section, provision, or part; and if any section,
provision, or part shall be held invalid, it shall not affect any other section,
provision, or part; provided, however, that if the City is unable to enforce its
franchise fee provisions for any reason the City will be allowed to amend the
franchise agreement to impose a franchise fee pursuant to statute. Where a
provision of any other City ordinance conflicts with the provisions of this
Ordinance, the provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail.
Limitation on ADDlicabilitv. This Ordinance constitutes a franchise agreement
between the City and Company as the only parties and no provision of this
franchise shall in any way inure to the benefit of any third person ( including the
public at large) so as to constitute any such person as a third party beneficiary of
the agreement or of anyone or more of the terms hereof, or otherwise give rise
to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto.
AMENDMENT PROCEDURE
Either party to this franchise agreement may at any time propose that the
agreement be amended. If an amendment is agreed upon by the parties, this
Ordinance may be amended at any time by the City passing a subsequent
ordinance declaring the provisions of the amendment, which amendatory
ordinance shall become effective upon the filing of Company' s written consent
thereto with the City Manager within 90 days after the effective date of the
amendatory ordinance.

EFFECTIVE DATE OF FRANCHISE FEE
PURPOSE
The Prior Lake City Council has determined that it is in the best interest of the City to
impose a franchise fee on those public utility companies that provide natural gas and
electric services within the City of Prior Lake.
a) Pursuant to City Ordinance Sections 312 and 313, and the City's Standard
Franchise Agreements for Gas Franchise and for Electric Franchise, the City has the
right to impose a franchise fee in an amount and fee design as authorized therein and in
the fee schedule incorporated in 314. 500 and 314. 600 herein.
FRANCHISE FEE STATEMENT
A franchise fee is hereby imposed under City Code Section 312 and 313 in accordance
with the schedule incorporated under Section 314. 500 and 314. 600 herein.
PAYMENT AND FEE DESIGN
Franchise fees shall be paid to the City quarterly, based upon a calendar year, with
payment due by the 30th day of the month after the end of each quarter. The franchise fees
shall be payable to the City in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 313 of the
Franchise Ordinance. This fee is a monthly account- based fee on each premise and not a
meter-based fee. In the event that an entity covered by this ordinance has more than one
meter at a single premise, but only one account, only one fee shall be assessed to that
account. If a premise has two or more meters being billed at different rates, the Company
may have an account for each rate classification, which will result in more than one
franchise fee assessment for service to that premise. If the Company combines the rate
classifications into a single account, the franchise fee assessed to the account will be the
largest franchise fee applicable to a single rate classification for energy delivered to that
premise. In the event any entities covered by this ordinance have more than one premise,
each premise ( address) shall be subject to the appropriate fee. In the event a question
arises as to the proper fee amount for any premise, the Company' s manner of billing for
energy used at all similar premises in the city will control.
SURCHARGE
The City recognizes that the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission allows the utility
company to add a surcharge to customer rates to reimburse such utility company for the
cost of the fee and that the Gas and/ or Electric Utilities Company will surcharge its
customers in the City the amount of the fee.

requested by the City, shall provide at the time of each payment a statement
summarizing how the franchise fee payment was determined, including information
showing any adjustments to the total surcharge billed in the period for which the
payment is being made to account for any uncollectibles, refunds or error corrections.
ENFORCEMENT
Any dispute, including enforcement of a default regarding this ordinance will be resolved
in accordance with Section 3. 5 the Standard Franchise Agreement.
EFFECTIVE DATE OF FRANCHISE FEE
The effective date of this ordinance shall be after its publication and sixty ( 60) days after
the sending of written notice enclosing a copy of this adopted Ordinance to the Gas

605.1000: NOISE: The purpose of this Section is to restrict noise by establishing maximum
allowable levels of noise that may occur in the outdoor atmosphere; and to restrict
or prevent certain activities that constitute a public nuisance because they emit
noise which unreasonably annoys, disturbs, injures or endangers health, peace,
safety, order or the general welfare, or which interferes with the enjoyment of public
or private property.
To accomplish the purpose of this Section, the City hereby adopts and incorporates
herein Minnesota Statute Section 116.07, Minnesota Rules Parts 7030.0010 to
7030.0080, and Minnesota Statute Section 412.221, Subdivisions 23, 24 and 32, as
they may be amended from time to time. These statutes and rules deal with the
regulation of sound and the public welfare.
605.1001 City Responsibility for Noise Control.
1) The City is responsible, pursuant to Minnesota Statute Section 116.07,
Subdivisions 2 and 4 and Minnesota Rules Part 7030.0030, for taking “reasonable
measures” to prevent the establishment of land use activities listed in Noise Area
Classifications (NAC) 1, 2, or 3 in any location where the standards established in
Part 7030.0040 will be “violated immediately” upon establishment of the land use.
2) The City may not establish noise standards which are more stringent than those set
out in Minnesota Rule Part 7030.0040.
605.1002 City Authority to Define Nuisances. In addition to the responsibility of the City

605.1004 Noise Level Standards and Measurement Procedures.
Health and Sanitation
City of Prior Lake
605/p8
1) Noise Levels. The noise level standards established in Minnesota Rule Part
7030.40 consider the types of noises, the frequency with which noises recur, the
time period for which noises continue, the times of day during which noises occur,
and such other factors as could affect the extent to which noises may be injurious
to human health and welfare, animal or plant life, or property, or could interfere
unreasonably with the enjoyment of life or property.
The standards are objective rather than subjective.
2) The Measurement Procedures. The City will use the noise measurement
procedure described in Minnesota Rule Part 7030.0060 when it conducts a noise
test. The procedure sets out criteria for conducting sound measurement tests;
including:
Measurement location;
Equipment specifications;
Calibration;
Measurement procedures; and

measured at any lot line of the property on which the noise originates
as “lot line” and “property” are defined in City Code Section 1101.400),
disturbing to others, unless the noise is reasonably necessary to the
preservation of life, health, safety or property. (Ord. Amd. 116-26, publ.
12/17/2016)
b) No person may use operate, or permit the use or operation of, any radio,
television, musical instrument, musical device, sound-amplifying
equipment, or other device for producing or reproducing sound when it
creates noise so loud and unnatural in its time, place, use or operation
as to annoy, injure, or endanger the safety, health, comfort, or repose of
a reasonable person, including but not limited to a noise which exceeds
Health and Sanitation
City of Prior Lake
605/p9
65 decibels as measured at any lot line of the property on which the
noise originates ( as “lot line” and “property” are defined in City Code

source that unreasonably disturbs the peace, quiet, repose or enjoyment
of property. An assembly at which noise exceeds 65 decibels as measured
at any lot line of the property on which the noise originates (as “lot line”
and “property” are defined in City Code Section 1101.400) shall be
deemed a noisy assembly. (Ord. Amd. 116-26, publ. 12/17/2016)
b) Prohibition: It is unlawful for a person to:
1) Participate in, visit, or remain at a gathering knowing or having reason
to know that the gathering is a noisy assembly, except persons who
have come to the gathering-for the sole purpose of abating the
disturbance.
2) Knowingly permit real estate under their care or control to be used for
a noisy assembly.
3) Excessive Vehicle Noise:
a) For purposes of this subsection, the term “vehicle” shall mean any motor

or City. The application shall include, together with other information requested by
the City: a work plan outline, a narrative explaining why an earlier start time is
needed to adhere to an accelerated or established project schedule, an assurance
that an early start time permit is not being requested for the mere convenience of
the contractor, and an explanation of the types of activities that will occur before 7
a.m.
3) Exemptions. The following activities are specifically exempted from the prohibitions
under this Subsection 605.1007:

Health and Sanitation
City of Prior Lake
605/p11
Saturdays, and between the hours of 8 a.m. and 7 pm. on Sundays and legal
holidays.
605.1009 Emergency Exceptions. Emergency situations are exempt from the operational
limits of this ordinance when immediate work is necessary to restore property to a
safe condition or when immediate work is required to protect persons or property from
imminent exposure to danger are exempt from operational limits.
605.1010 Complaints and Violations.
1) Investigation of noise complaints. The City will investigate noise complaints as follows:
a) The Prior Lake Code Enforcement Officer will have the primary responsibility
for investigating complaints pertaining to noise from land uses and stationary
sources.
b) The Prior Lake Police Department will have the primary responsibility for
investigating complainants pertaining to nuisance noise.
2) Exception. The Chief of Police, or designee, shall determine if the Police Department
has available resources to investigate a noise complaint at a given time. The City
may not be able to investigate all noise complaints.
605.1011. Noise Testing:
1) The following criteria will be used to determine if and under what circumstances the
City will conduct a noise study:
a) The source of the noise, the number of times the noise has occurred, the
day of the week and time of day the noise occurs, the duration of the
noise, the number of times the City has received a complaint concerning
the noise, the number of individuals that have complained about the noise,
whether the City has investigated or conducted a test for the same noise at
the same location within the preceding twelve (12) months, whether the
City can obtain written permission to enter the property of the complainant,
and such other factors as the City Manager determines are prudent.
b) Based on an analysis of the criteria set out above, the City may elect to
conduct a noise test to determine whether the land use activity at the
location of the receiver is within the noise standards allowed by Minnesota
Rules §7030.40 based on the applicable Noise Area Classification.
c) Noise tests will comply with the Measurement Methodology set out in
Minnesota Rules §7030.0060.
d) To the extent that it is possible, and insofar as it is consistent with the
above provisions, including the methodology set out in Minnesota Rules §
7030.0060, the City will conduct noise tests at the same location and at the
same time of day as the complained-of noise, the City will seek to secure
Health and Sanitation
City of Prior Lake
605/p12
the complainants confirmation that the test is being performed at the same
location and time of day as the complained- of noise.
The results of the City’s noise test shall be deemed accurate. If the complainant or
the owner or operator of the property emitting the noise disputes the results of the
City’s noise test, the burden shall be on the complainant, owner or operator to provide
the City with a noise test, conducted at their sole cost and expense, by an individual
who has the requisite credentials to conduct the test as determined by the City, using
the measurement methodology set out in Minnesota Rule Part 7030.0060. If the City
is provided with the results of a noise test that shows that a violation of the noise
standards has occurred when the City’s test showed that one had not, or if the City is
provided with the results of a noise test that shows that a violation of the noise
standards has not occurred when the City’s noise showed that one had, the City may
cause a third noise test to be performed, at City expense, by an independent third
party, which may be a consultant, an official from another city or county in the Greater
Twin Cities metropolitan area or the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. The results
of the third test shall be conclusive. The City will reimburse a complainant, owner, or
operator who provides a test, but only if one of the following circumstances applies:
a) the finding of the provided test—that a violation of the noise standards
has or has not occurred—is confirmed by the third test; or
b) as a result of the provided test, the City reverses its initial determination
that a violation of the noise standards has or has not occurred.
The City will not offer reimbursement where the findings of the provided test confirm
the City’s determination; nor will it offer reimbursement where the findings of the
third test confirm the City’s initial determination. In addition, the City will not offer
reimbursement to a complainant, owner, or operator for more than one test. The
amount of reimbursement offered shall not exceed the actual cost to the
complainant, owner, or operator of the provided test; nor shall it exceed the amount
that the City would generally pay for such a test and in any case shall not exceed
1500.
2) The owner or operator of the property where the land use activity is exceeding the
NAC noise standards must, within thirty (30) days written notice of the noise standard
violation, submit an abatement plan and schedule to the City identifying the remedial
actions the property owner or operator will take to bring the noise level of the land use
activity into compliance with the applicable noise standard.
a) If the property owner fails to submit an abatement plan and schedule
acceptable to the City, the City may proceed with enforcement of this
Subsection as provided for in Subsection 605.1100.
3) The City will not investigate subsequent complaints concerning the same source of a
noise at the same location within twelve (12) months of a previous investigation unless
the facts and circumstances relating to the subsequent noise complaint demonstrate a
significant change in circumstances.

606.100 PURPOSE: The Council finds that Junk and Junk Vehicles are an increasing
problem in the City. The Council finds that quick removal of Junk and Junk vehicles
may assist in preventing encouragement of the deterioration of property and
neighborhoods. The Council further finds that Junk and Junk Vehicles create a
condition of blight which can result in the deterioration of property values and is
inconsistent with the City’s property maintenance goals and aesthetic standards. In
addition, unless Junk and Junk Vehicles are removed, other properties soon
become the places for the storage of Junk and Junk Vehicles. The Council hereby
declares its intention to minimize and to quickly remove Junk and Junk Vehicles to
limit the adverse impact on City properties and neighborhoods. Junk and Junk
Vehicles are hereby declared to be public nuisances and public health and safety
hazards for purposes of Minnesota Statutes, Section 429.101, Subd. 1(c) and
Section 429.021, Subd. 1(8).
606.200 DEFINITIONS: For purposes of this Section, the terms defined in this subsection
shall have the following meaning ascribed to them.
Junk shall mean any old, used, or second-had material of any kind, including used
motor vehicle parts of any kind, machinery of any kind, and/or parts thereof,
household furnishings or appliances, cloth, rugs, clothing, paper, rubbish, bottles,
rubber, iron or metals, or articles from its worn condition render it practically useless
for the purpose for which it was made and which is commonly classed as junk.
Junk Vehicles shall mean any unlicensed, unregistered or inoperable motor vehicle
including automobiles, motorcycles, ATV's, snowmobiles, go-carts or any
components or parts thereof.
606.300: UNLAWFUL CONDUCT REGARDING STORAGE OF JUNK AND JUNK VEHICLES. It shall be
unlawful for any person to place or maintain for keeping, storing, or piling, whether
temporarily, irregularly, or continually any junk or junk vehicles on private property
unless the same is housed within a lawfully erected building. This Section shall not
Health and Sanitation

606/p2
apply to materials or vehicles stored on private property as part of a junk yard or
salvage business permitted by City zoning regulations.
606.400: REMOVAL OF JUNK AND JUNK VEHICLES. A property owner may ask the City to
remove Junk or Junk Vehicles from the owner's property before being ordered to do
so following the abatement procedure set forth in subsections 606.400 through
606.1000. If the City agrees to remove the Junk or Junk Vehicles, the City shall
have the property owner or its designated agent sign a release of liability form and
a consent form authorizing the City or its agents to enter onto the property. The
property owner shall be liable for any costs which the City incurs in removing the
Junk or Junk Vehicles. The City may collect the costs as a special assessment
pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, Section 429.101, Subd. 1(c) if the property owner
fails to reimburse the City upon request.
If an owner does not remove Junk or Junk Vehicles and does not ask the City to

1) Findings: The uncontrolled placement and maintenance of news racks in public right-ofway
presents an inconvenience and danger to the safety and welfare of persons using
such rights-of-way including pedestrians, person entering and leaving vehicles and
buildings, and persons performing essential utility, traffic control and emergency services.
News racks so located as to cause an inconvenience or danger to persons using public
rights-of-way, and unsightly news racks located therein, constitute public nuisances.
These factors constitute an unreasonable interference with and obstruction of the use of
public rights-of-way, constitute an unwarranted invasion of individual privacy, are injurious
to health, offense to the senses, and constitute such an obstruction of the free use of
property as to interfere in the comfortable enjoyment of life and property by the entire
community.
The City Council recognizes, however, that the use of such rights-of-way is so historically
associated with the sale and distribution of newspapers and publications that access to
those areas for such purposes should not be absolutely denied. The City Council further
finds that these strong and competing interests require a reasonable accommodation that
can only be satisfactorily achieved through the means of this ordinance that is designated
to accommodate such interests regulating the time, place and manner of using such news
racks.
2) Purpose: The provisions and prohibitions hereinafter contained and enacted are in
Public Ways & Property
City of Prior Lake
701/p5
pursuance of and for the purpose of securing and promoting the public health, morals and
general welfare of persons in the City of Prior Lake in their use of public rights-of-way
through the regulations of placement, appearance, number, size and servicing of news
racks on the public rights-of-way so as to:
provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience;
ensure no unreasonable interference with the flow of pedestrian or vehicular
traffic, including ingress to or egress from any place of business or from the
street to the sidewalk;
provide reasonable access for the use and maintenance of sidewalks, poles,
posts, traffic signs and signals, hydrants, mailboxes and similar
appurtenances and access to locations used for public transportation
purposes;
reduce visual blight on the public rights-of-way, protect the quiet of residential
areas;
reduce exposure of the City to personal injury or property damage claims and
litigation; and
protect the right to distribute information protected by the United States and
Minnesota Constitutions through use of news racks.
3) Preservation of Constitutional Rights. It is not the intent of this ordinance to in any way
discriminate against, regulate or interfere with the publication, circulation, distribution or
dissemination of any printed material that is constitutionally protected.

707.800 REGISTRATION OF TELECOMMUNICATION USERS:
707.801 Findings, Purpose and Intent: The City desires high quality wireless
telecommunication services to accommodate the needs of residents and businesses. At
the same time, the City strives to minimize the negative impacts that telecommunication
facilities can have on aesthetics and public safety. Due to the many services that must
be delivered within its limited area, the City also strives to avoid unnecessary
encumbrances within the right- of-way. The purpose of this Subsection 707. 800 is to
regulate the installation of telecommunication facilities within the right-of-way in a
manner that balances desire for service with aesthetic, public safety, and right- of-way
flexibility concerns.
Rights-of-way are appropriate locations for telecommunication facilities that present
minimal impacts. The City recognizes that, as wireless technology advances, some areas
of the City may be hard to serve with wireless technology due to the lack of siting
alternatives in the immediate vicinity.

limited to the requirement to obtain a right-of-way permit pursuant to Subsection
707.700 and the requirements relating to siting of structures in Subsection 707.900, a
telecommunications user who desires to place telecommunication facilities in the rightof-
way shall register each facility with the City.
707. 803 Application for Registration: A written application for registration shall be submitted
to the Engineering and Inspections Department at least two weeks prior to installation
of the facility. The application shall be made on a form provided by the City and shall
include all required information and attachments. All such applications shall be
consistent with the provisions of this Section and good engineering, safety, and
maintenance practices shall be followed.
707.804 Registration Fee: The City shall establish a registration fee in an amount sufficient to
recover City costs. The fee shall be imposed on each registered facility both at the time

has satisfied the requirements of this Section, the Director shall confirm the registration
subject to the terms and conditions of this Section. The Director may impose reasonable
conditions upon the registration to protect the health, safety, and welfare or to protect
the right- of-way and its current use. In addition, a registrant shall comply with all local,
state and federal laws, including but not limited to Minnesota Statutes Chapter 216D
and Minnesota Rules Chapter 7560 ( Gopher One Call Excavation Notice System).
707. 807 Denial of Registration: The Director may deny a registration for failure to meet the
requirements and conditions of this Section or if the Director determines that the denial
is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public or the right- of-way
and its current use.
707.808 Update of Registration: The registrant shall inform the City of any change in the
registration information within fifteen ( 15) days of the change.
707. 809 Inspection and Authority of Director.

breach in writing and demand that the registrant remedy the violation. The
notice and demand shall inform the registrant that continued violations may
result in revocation of the registration. In the notice and demand, the Director
may also impose additional or revised conditions on the registration to mitigate
and remedy the breach.
3) Response to Notice of Breach. Within two (2) business days of receiving the
written notice and demand, the registrant shall provide the City with its plan to

803.1201 Declaration of Policy. The Prior Lake City Council intends to discourage underage

regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol.

difficult to prove, and an ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage
consumption.

hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs.

notify the subdivider within 15 business days of submittal whether or not the
application is complete. The preliminary plat application shall not be officially
submitted and considered complete until all the information requirements are
complied with.
1002.203 Hearing. The Community Development Department, upon receipt of a complete
application, shall set a public hearing date before the Planning Commission for
public review of the preliminary plat. Notice of the hearing shall consist of the date,
time and place of the hearing, a legal description of the property, a description of
the property reasonably calculated to inform a person of the location, and
description of the preliminary plat request and where and when information
pertaining to the preliminary plat may be obtained. The hearing notice shall be
published in the official newspaper at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing.
Notice of the proposed subdivision shall also be posted on the City’s website at
least 10 days prior to the scheduled public hearing date. Written notification of the

proceedings on the proposed application. In addition, the City may install
development signage at the property stating that there is a proposed subdivision
and providing a phone number to call for additional information. Failure to provide
development signage on the site does not invalidate a public hearing notice.
1002.204 Review By Other Commissions Or Jurisdictions. The Community
Development Staff shall refer copies of the preliminary plat to County,
Metropolitan, State or other public entities for their review and comment, where
appropriate.
1002.205 Planning Commission Action. The Planning Commission shall conduct the
Subdivision Code
City of Prior Lake
1002/p3
public hearing in accordance with Subsection 1109.200 of the Zoning Code. The
Planning Commission may continue the public hearing as appropriate. The
Planning Commission shall report its findings and make a recommendation to the
City Council within ninety ( 90) days of the date a complete application was
received by the City. If the Planning Commission has not acted upon the
preliminary plat within ninety (90) days following delivery of a complete application,
the Council may act on the preliminary plat without the Planning Commission' s
recommendation.
1002.206 City Council Action.
1) Pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 15.99, the City Council shall approve, approve with
conditions, or deny the preliminary plat within one hundred twenty ( 120) days
following delivery of a complete application unless the subdivider has agreed, in
writing, to an extension of the statutory review period.
2) In considering a preliminary plat application, the City Council may impose
reasonable conditions and restrictions as part of the preliminary plat approval that
are deemed necessary and appropriate to protect the public health, safety, and
general welfare of the City.
3) If the preliminary plat is not approved by the City Council, the City Council shall
adopt written findings regarding the basis and rationale for denying the application.
The reasons for such action shall be recorded in the minutes of the City Council
proceedings.
4) If the preliminary plat is approved, such approval shall not constitute final
acceptance of the plat. Final plat approval will be required for the engineering
proposals and other features and requirements as specified by the Subdivision
Code. The City Council may require such revisions in the preliminary plat and final
plat as it deems necessary for the health, safety, and general welfare of the City.
5) Once a preliminary plat is approved by the City Council, the subdivider must submit
a complete application for a final plat within twelve (12) months after approval of
the preliminary plat. If a subdivider fails to submit a complete application for a final
plat within the specified 12-month period, the preliminary plat shall be considered
void, unless a request for time extension is submitted in writing at least 30 days
prior to the expiration of the existing time period and the request is approved by
the City Council. Each such extension of time shall not exceed six (6) months.
1002.300 FINAL PLAT
1002.301 Filing. After the preliminary plat has been approved, the final plat shall be
submitted for review as set forth in the subsections which follow. A final plat
application, signed by the subdivider and the property owner, shall be submitted
to the Community Development Department accompanied by the following
information.

Subdivision Code
City of Prior Lake
1002/p4
All information required in Subsection 1003.300 of the Subdivision Code.
The required filing fee(s) as established by the City Council.
1002.302 In accordance with Minnesota Statutes § 15.99, the City shall review the
application and notify the subdivider within 15 business days of submittal whether
or not the application is complete. The final plat application shall not be officially
submitted and considered complete until all the information requirements are
complied with.
1002.303 City Council Action. The final plat and a signed Development Agreement shall
be submitted to the City Council for review. If the City Council approves the final
plat, the City Council shall adopt a resolution approving the final plat and
Development Agreement. The resolution shall provide for the acceptance of all
agreements for basic improvements, public dedication, payment of fees and other
requirements as indicated by the City Council. If the City Council denies the final
plat, the City Council shall adopt a resolution with written findings supporting the
basis for the denial. The findings for any denial of a plat shall be set forth in the
minutes of the City Council proceedings and reported in writing to the subdivider.
1002.304 Special Assessments. When there are any existing special assessments which
have been levied against property described in the final plat the special
assessments shall either be paid in full before the final plat is released or shall be
divided and allocated to the respective lots in the final plat. If the subdivider elects
to divide the special assessments, the City Finance Director shall distribute the
remaining assessment balance on a per unit basis, prepare a revised assessment
roll and file the same with the County Auditor. If the per unit assessment is less
than $1,000.00, the entire assessment balance shall be paid before the final plat
is released.
1002.305 Recording Final Plat And Development Agreement. If the final plat and
Development Agreement are approved by the City Council, the subdivider shall
record both documents with the County Recorder or Registrar within ninety (90)
days after said approval. The subdivider shall, immediately upon recording, furnish
the City with a print and reproducible tracing of the final plat showing evidence of
the recording. The subdivider shall also furnish a copy of the recorded final plat in
an electronic format as prescribed by the City. No building permits shall be
approved for construction of any structure on any lot in said plat until the City has
received evidence the final plat and Development Agreement have been recorded
with the County.
The final plat shall be considered void if not recorded within the ninety (90) days
provided for herein unless a request for a time extension is submitted in writing
prior to the expiration of the ninety ( 90) day period and approved by the City
Council.
1002.306 Recording Final Plats Of Multi-Phased Plats. If a subdivider plans to develop a
subdivision in stages over a period of time, the City Council must approve a staging
plan for the development of the subdivision. The staging plan must be submitted
as part of the final plat application. The approved staging plan will be incorporated
into the Development Agreement. Future phases of the subdivision must be
Subdivision Code
City of Prior Lake
1002/p5
platted as outlots on the final plat. If a subdivision is final platted in stages, all
stages must be final platted into lots and blocks, not outlots, within two (2) years
after the approval of the preliminary plat unless otherwise provided in the
Development Agreement. Failure to obtain final plat approval for all phases of the
subdivision within the two (2) year period or within the timelines of the approved
staging plan shall render the remaining stages of the preliminary plat void.
1002.400 COMBINATION OF PRELIMINARY AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL. In some
instances, due to the simplicity of the proposed subdivision, the City staff may
agree to combine the preliminary and final plat process. The process may be
combined only when a proposed subdivision meets all of the following
requirements:
The resulting subdivision contains no more than 5 lots.
The proposed subdivision is located in an area where streets and utilities are
in place and capable of serving the subdivision.
The proposed subdivision does not require the dedication or construction of
future streets and will not interfere with the development of adjacent
properties.
The resulting lots shall conform with all provisions of the Zoning Code unless
a variance has been granted.
1002.401 Filing. An application for a combined preliminary and final plat, signed by the
subdivider and the property owner, shall be submitted to the Community
Development Department. This application shall be accompanied by the following:

pertaining to the plat may be obtained. The hearing notice shall be published in
the official newspaper at least ten ( 10) days prior to the hearing. Notice of the
proposed subdivision shall also be posted on the City’s website at least 10 days
prior to the scheduled public hearing date. Written notification of the hearing shall
be mailed to all owners of land within five hundred feet (500') of the boundary of
the property in question at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Any omission
or defect, which has not impaired the ability of a surrounding property owner to
participate in the proceedings, shall in no way impair the validity of the proceedings
on the proposed application. In addition, the City may install development signage
at the property stating that there is a proposed subdivision and providing a phone
number to call for additional information. Failure to provide development signage
on the site does not invalidate a public hearing notice.
1002.404 Review By Other Commissions Or Jurisdictions. The Community
Development Staff shall refer copies of the combined preliminary and final plat to
County, Metropolitan, State or other public entities for their review and comment,
where appropriate.
1002.405 Planning Commission Action. The Planning Commission shall conduct the
public hearing in accordance with Subsection 1109.200 of the Zoning Code. The
Planning Commission may continue the public hearing as appropriate. The
Planning Commission shall report its findings and make a recommendation to the
City Council within ninety ( 90) days of the date a complete application was
received by the City. If the Planning Commission has not acted upon the combined
preliminary and final plat within ninety ( 90) days following delivery of a complete
application, the Council may act on the preliminary plat without the Planning
Commission's recommendation.
1002.406 City Council Action. The combined preliminary and final plat and a signed
Development Agreement shall be submitted to the City Council for review. If the
City Council approves the plat, the City Council shall adopt a resolution approving
the plat and Development Agreement within 120 days following delivery of a
complete application unless the subdivider has agreed, in writing, to an extension
of the statutory review period. The resolution shall provide for the acceptance of
all agreements for basic improvements, public dedication, payment of fees and
other requirements as indicated by the City Council. If the City Council denies the
plat, the City Council shall adopt a resolution with written findings supporting the
basis for the denial. The findings for any denial of a plat shall be set forth in the
minutes of the City Council proceedings and reported in writing to the subdivider.
1002.407 Special Assessments. When any existing special assessments which have been
levied against property described in the plat, the special assessments shall either
be paid in full before the plat is released or shall be divided and allocated to the
respective lots in the plat. If the subdivider elects to divide the special
assessments, the City Finance Director shall distribute the remaining assessment
balance on a per unit basis, prepare a revised assessment roll, and file the same
with the County Auditor. If the per unit assessment is less than $ 1,000.00, the
entire assessment balance shall be paid before the final plat is released.
1002.408 Recording Plat And Development Agreement. If the plat and Development
Agreement are approved by the City Council, the subdivider shall record both
Subdivision Code
City of Prior Lake
1002/p7
documents with the County Recorder or Registrar within ninety (90) days after said
approval. The subdivider shall, immediately upon recording, furnish the City with
a print and reproducible tracing of the plat showing evidence of the recording. The
subdivider shall also furnish a copy of the recorded plat in an electronic format as
prescribed by the City. No building permits shall be approved for construction of
any structure on any lot in said plat until the City has received evidence the plat
and Development Agreement have been recorded with the County.

provided for herein unless a request for time extension is submitted in writing prior
to the expiration of the ninety (90) period and approved by the City Council.
1002.500 CIC PLATS. CIC Plats shall be considered a final plat and shall be processed
according to the procedures listed in Subsection 1002.300 of the Subdivision
Code.
1002.600 EFFECT OF SUBDIVISION APPROVAL. For one (1) year following preliminary plat
approval and for two (2) years following final plat approval, unless the subdivider
and the City agree otherwise, no amendment to the City of Prior Lake's
Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Code or Subdivision Code shall apply to or affect the
use, development density, lot size, lot layout, or dedication required or permitted
by the approved plat. Thereafter, upon resolution of the City Council, the City may
extend the period by agreement with the subdivider, or it may require submission
of a new plat unless substantial physical activity and investment has occurred in
reasonable reliance on the approved plat and the subdivider will suffer substantial
financial damage as a consequence of a requirement to submit a new plat.
1002.700 PREMATURE SUBDIVISIONS. Any preliminary plat/final plat and/or subdivision
may be determined to be premature should any of the provisions which follow exist:
1) Lack Of Adequate Drainage. A condition of inadequate drainage exists if any of
the following provisions exist:
Surface or subsurface water retention and runoff is such that it constitutes a
danger to the structural integrity of the proposed structures.
The proposed site grading and subdivision will cause pollution of water
sources or damage from erosion and siltation on downhill or downstream
land.
Storm trunk facilities and/or regional ponding facilities that will serve the
proposed plat have not yet been constructed.
Factors to be considered in making the determinations regarding a, b and c
above may include, but are not limited to: average rainfall for the area; the
relation of the land to flood plains; and the nature of soils and subsoils and
their ability to adequately support surface water runoff.
2) Lack Of Adequate Water Supply. A proposed subdivision lacks an adequate
water supply if the proposed subdivision does not have adequate sources of water
to serve the proposed subdivision when developed to its maximum permissible
density without causing an unreasonable depletion of existing water supplies for
Subdivision Code
City of Prior Lake
1002/p8
surrounding areas.
3) Lack Of Adequate Roads Or Highways To Serve The Subdivision. A proposed
subdivision lacks adequate roads or highways to serve the subdivision when any
of the following provisions exist:
Roads which serve the proposed subdivision are of such a width, grade,
stability, vertical and horizontal alignment, site distance and surface
condition that the increase in traffic volume generated by the proposed
subdivision would be detrimental to the City’s interest in promoting and
protecting the public safety and general welfare, or seriously aggravate an
already dangerous or hazardous condition, or when, with due regard to the
advice of Scott County and/or the Minnesota Department of Transportation,
said roads are inadequate for the intended increased use.
The traffic volume generated by the proposed subdivision would decrease
the level of service on highways existing at the time of the application or
proposed for completion within the next two (2) years. Level of service is a
description of traffic conditions along a given roadway or at a particular
intersection. The level of service ranges from " A" ( free flow of traffic with
minimum intersection delays) to "F" (forced flow, jammed intersections, long
delays). It generally reflects factors such as speed, travel time, freedom to
maneuver, traffic interruptions and delays.
4) Lack Of Adequate Waste Disposal Systems. A proposed subdivision lacks
adequate waste disposal systems if, in subdivisions for which sewer lines are
proposed, there is inadequate sewer capacity in the existing system to support the
subdivision if developed to its maximum permissible density after reasonable
sewer capacity is reserved for schools, planned public facilities, and commercial
and industrial development projected for the next five (5) years.
5) Inconsistency With Comprehensive Plan. A proposed subdivision is
inconsistent with the City's Comprehensive Plan when the subdivision is
inconsistent with the purposes, objectives and recommendations of the adopted
Comprehensive Plan of Prior Lake. Subdivisions that are not proposed in areas
consistent with the criteria for allocation of MUSA reserve shall be deemed
inconsistent.
6) Public Service Capacity. A proposed subdivision lacks necessary public service
capacity when services such as recreational facilities, schools, police and fire
protection and other public facilities, which must be provided at public expense,
cannot reasonably be provided for within the next two (2) years.
7) Inconsistency With Capital Improvement Plans. A proposed subdivision is
inconsistent with capital improvement plans when improvements and/or services
necessary to accommodate the proposed subdivision have not been programmed
in the Prior Lake, Scott County or other regional Capital Improvement Plans. The
City Council may waive these criteria when it can be demonstrated that a revision
to the City capital improvement plan can be accommodated.
1002.701Burden of Establishing. The burden shall be upon the subdivider to show that the
proposed subdivision is not premature.
Subdivision Code
City of Prior Lake
1002/p9
1002.702 Process Used to Define a Premature Subdivision.
1) Application. Upon receipt of an application for a preliminary plat or a final plat,
the City staff will review the application based on the criteria listed in Subsection
1002.601 of the Subdivision Code to determine if the proposed subdivision is
premature.
2) Notification. If the staff finds a subdivision premature under the criteria listed in
Subsection 1002.700 of the Subdivision Code, the subdivider will be notified of the
staff’s findings in writing within 15 business days of receipt of a complete
application. This notification shall constitute denial of the application.
3) Appeal. Any owner of affected property or any subdivider may appeal the staff
finding of a premature subdivision to the City Council. The appeal must be in
writing and must be filed with the Community Development Department within 5
calendar days after the date of the written notification of the decision. The required
fee, as set by the City Council in the City Fee Schedule, shall be paid when the
appeal request is filed. The Community Development Department shall set a date
for a public hearing. Notice of such hearing shall be published in the official
newspaper at least ten ( 10) days prior to said hearing, and individual property
notices shall be mailed not less than ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days
prior to the hearing to all owners of property within five hundred feet (500') of the
property included in the request. Failure of a property owner to receive said notice
shall not invalidate any such proceedings. The City Council shall hear the appeal
within 30 days of the filing of the appeal unless that period is extended with consent
of the appellant. The City Council shall render a decision within 30 days of the
conclusion of the appeal hearing.
1002.800 REGIONAL SYSTEM SERVICE INADEQUACIES
1002.801 Existing Conditions. An approved preliminary plat or building permit within an
approved final plat may be deemed as premature development if any of the
following conditions set forth are found to exist:
The regionally controlled metropolitan sanitary sewer interceptors or waste
water treatment facilities are classified as having inadequate capacity to
provide service within the standards of recognized public health and safety.
Responsible metropolitan units of government prohibit the City from issuing
building permits.
Regional transportation systems are deemed as inadequate to provide
service levels within standards of recognized public safety.
Storm drainage systems under the jurisdiction of regional watershed
districts, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources, or other such responsible jurisdictions are inadequate to provide
service levels within standards of recognized public health and safety.
Subdivision Code
City of Prior Lake
1002/p10
1002.802 City Liability Exemption. All preliminary and final plat approvals and related
formal Development Agreements shall stipulate and shall exempt the City from any
liability associated with platting or building permit denial based upon factors and
conditions related to regional governmental agency and unit jurisdictions and
related service inadequacies.

1004.100 PUBLIC WORKS DESIGN MANUAL. The design standards and requirements
set forth in the City Public Works Design Manual (“PWDM”) are hereby adopted
and incorporated into this Subdivision Code by reference as if fully set forth. If
there is a conflict between the Subdivision Code and the PWDM the Subdivision
Code shall govern; provided that two provisions addressing the same matter that
are more or less restrictive are not a conflict and the more restrictive provision
shall apply.
1004.200 BLOCKS.
1004.201 Block Length. In general, intersecting streets, determining block lengths, shall
be provided at such intervals so as to serve cross-traffic adequately and to meet
existing streets. Where no existing plats control, the blocks in residential
subdivisions should not exceed one thousand three hundred twenty-five feet
1,325') nor be less than four hundred feet (400') in length, except where
topography or other conditions justify a departure from these dimensions. In
blocks longer than eight hundred feet (800'), the City may require pedestrian
ways and/or easements through the block near the center of the block.
1004.202 Block Width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two (2)
tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or industrial use
shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for their respective use,
including adequate space for off-street parking and deliveries.
1004.300 LOTS.
Subdivision Code

established by the Zoning Code in effect at the time.
1004.302 Corner Lots. Corner lots for residential use shall exceed the minimum width and
area requirements in the zoning district by twenty percent (20%) to permit
appropriate building setback from both streets as required in the Zoning Code.
1004.303 Side Lot Lines. Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles to street
lines or radial to curved street lines.
1004.304 Frontage. Every lot must have frontage on an approved street (not an alley),
unless an alternative access easement is approved by the City with the
subdivision application in the sole discretion of the City. All lots, with the
exception of townhouse lots, must meet the minimum lot width requirements of
the Use District as required in the City Zoning Code.
1004.305 Setback Lines. Setback or building lines shall be shown on all lots intended for
residential use and shall not be less than the setback required by the City Zoning
Code.
1004.306 Features. In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be shown for allnatural
features, such as tree growth, watercourses, historic spots or similar
conditions which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and stability to the
proposed subdivision.
1004.307 Lot Remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum lot size left over after
subdividing of a larger property must be added to adjacent lots, rather than
allowed to remain as unusable property unless a plan is provided showing the
future use of the lot remnant.
1004.308 Political Boundaries. No singular plat shall extend over a political boundary or
school district line without written notification to and approval by the affected
units of government.
1004.309 Frontage On Two Streets. Double frontage, or lots with frontage on two (2)
parallel streets shall not be permitted except where lots back on collector or
arterial streets, County or State highways, or where topographic or other
conditions render subdividing otherwise unreasonable. Such double frontage lots
shall adhere to, the following requirements:
1) Lot Depth. Double frontage lots shall have an additional depth of at least
twenty feet (20') in order to allow space for screen plantings and/or buffering
along the back lot line. To ensure adequate depth for such buffering, the
following minimum depth requirements shall be required for double frontage
lots:
District Minimum Lot Depth
R-1 160 feet
R-2 120 feet
Subdivision Code
City of Prior Lake
1004/p3
2) Buffering/Screening. All bufferyard requirements as regulated by the Zoning
Code must be satisfactorily met.
1004.310 Turn-Around Access. Where proposed residential lots access off of a collector
or arterial street, they shall be platted in such a manner as to provide turn-around
access and egress on each lot. This access and egress must be identified on the
grading plan for the subdivision.
1004.311 Buffer Side Yards. In the case of side yards involving single-family residential
lots abutting arterial streets, lot widths shall be increased at least ten feet (10')
above the minimum lot width for the purpose of establishing buffers along the lot
line bordering such streets.
Buffering or side yards bordering major collector or arterial streets shall comply
with the requirements as established by the Zoning Code.
1004.312 Irregularly Shaped Lots. On single-family residential lots determined to be
irregular in shape (e.g., triangular), the developer shall demonstrate to the City

already dedicated in adjoining or adjacent subdivisions, or provide for future
connections to adjoining unsubdivided land, or shall be a reasonable projection
of streets in the nearest subdivided land. The arrangement of thoroughfares and
collector streets shall be provided in a manner consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan. Dedicated streets shall be constructed to the property
boundary of the subdivision.
1004.402 Local Streets. Local streets should be designed so as to discourage their use by
nonlocal traffic.
1004.403 Street Plans For Future Subdivisions. Where the plat to be submitted includes
only part of the property owned or intended for subdivision by the subdivider a
tentative plan of a proposed future street system for the unsubdivided portion
shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider.
1004.404 Temporary Cul-De-Sac. In those instances where a street is terminated pending
future extension in conjunction with a future subdivision and there is more than
two hundred feet (200') between the dead end and the nearest intersection, a
temporary turn around facility shall be provided at the closed end. This temporary
cul-de-sac must be designed as approved by the City Engineer and must be
placed inside a temporary roadway easement if located outside a street right of
way. The subdivider shall be required to provide an irrevocable letter of credit in
a form acceptable to the City Attorney for removal or restoration of the temporary
cul-de-sac as determined by the City. The subdivider shall install a sign at the

end of the temporary cul-de-sac stating that the cul-de-sac is a “future through
street”.
1004.405 Provisions For Resubdivision Of Large Lots. When a property is subdivided
into larger than normal building lots, such lots shall be so arranged as to permit
the logical location and openings of future streets and appropriate resubdivision,
with provision for adequate utility connections for such resubdivision.
1004.406 Street Intersections. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles, except where topography or other conditions justify
variations. The minimum angle of intersection of streets shall be eighty (80)
degrees. Local street intersections must have a centerline offset of at least 280
feet. Local streets intersecting with a collector or higher order street must have a
centerline offset of at least 660 feet unless topographic or other conditions render
the requirements of this provision unreasonable.

subdivision contains or is adjacent to the right-of-way of a State highway or
thoroughfare, provision may be made for a marginal access street (ie frontage
road) approximately parallel and adjacent to the boundary of such right-of-way,
provided that appropriate consideration is given to circulation design, or provision
may be made for a street at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land
between such street and right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined by the
City with due consideration of the minimum distance required for approach
connections to future grade separations, or for lot depths.
1004.408 Half-Streets. Dedication of half-streets shall not be allowed unless they are
essential to the reasonable subdivision of the property or where it is found that it
will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided. The construction of half-streets shall conform with the
requirements of these regulations
1004.409 Reserve Strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets are prohibited.

accordance with their functional classification as designated within the City's
Subdivision Code
City of Prior Lake
1004/p6
Comprehensive Plan.
1004.500 SIDEWALKS AND TRAILS.
1004.501 Required Sidewalks/Trails. Sidewalks or trails shall be required for all new
subdivisions where a means of pedestrian access from the subdivision to
schools, parks, churches, business or industrial developments, adjacent
neighborhoods, transportation facilities, or for unusually long blocks is necessary
in order to meet the purpose and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan and of
this Subsection 1004 . Subsection 1004.503 of the Subdivision Code contains
the guidelines for the location, installation and maintenance of sidewalks and
trails within the City. The City Council shall make the final determination of the
type and location of sidewalks and trails to be installed.
Paved or concrete sidewalks or trails that may not strictly follow the street may
be permitted by the City Council.
Sidewalks or trails in common areas or other locations away from streets which
are typically found in Planned Unit Developments or cluster developments
generally should be integrated into the detailed area plan or layout permitting
visual surveillance of the path from the street or nearby houses.
1004.502 Standards.
1) Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete, five feet (5') wide. An eight foot
8') concrete sidewalk will be required in high density areas where safety is a
concern, including but not limited to, commercial and industrial areas, multifamily
areas and school zones.
2) Sidewalks shall be located at least one foot (1’) inside a public right-of-way,
public easement, or common area. A border area or grass strip located
between the street edge of the sidewalk and curb face shall be installed to
provide a visual break between the paved surface of the street and sidewalk,
a suitable location for snow storage, and to provide pedestrian safety by
further moving the sidewalk from the road surface in accordance with the
PWDM.
3) A continuous sidewalk, without a grass strip will be required where the City
determines that turf maintenance will likely be a problem and pedestrian
traffic is considerable.
4) Sidewalk street crossings shall be located at a point along the road that offers
adequate sight distance as determined by the City.
5) Barrier curbs (vertical curbs) six inches (6") high shall be provided along
collector streets or streets located in commercial or industrial areas adjacent
to sidewalks to help prevent vehicles from leaving the roadway, control
drainage, protect pavements edges and protect sidewalks, lawns, utilities
signs and street trees from encroachment by vehicles, unless otherwise
Subdivision Code
City of Prior Lake
1004/p7
required by Federal, State or County guidelines.
6) Curb cuts and ramps shall be installed in accordance with the PWDM.
7) When sidewalks cross streets, a treatment such as striping, landscaping
medians, colored or stamped concrete or signs to identify the crosswalk as
approved by the City, shall be installed by the subdivider.
8) In subdivisions that contain hills or steep topography, the sidewalk pattern
shall conform as closely as possible to the standards found herein and to
connecting sidewalks and trails.
9) Where possible, new sidewalks shall be a logical extension of the existing
sidewalks in adjacent subdivisions.

1004.504 Additional Guidelines. If a public improvement is not listed in the City's CIP, the
subdivider will be responsible for cost and installation of sidewalk system. The
City may require that sidewalks be installed on local streets or on one side of a
minor collector when a trail also serves the street or where topographical or
traffic conditions warrant.
1004.600 EASEMENTS.
1004.601 Width And Location. An easement for utilities at least ten feet (10') wide shall
be provided along all front and rear lot lines and an easement for utilities at least
five feet (5’) wide shall be provided along all side lot lines. If necessary for the
extension of watermain, sewer lines, stormwater sewer lines, drainage, and other
utilities, easements of greater width may be required along lot lines or across
lots.
1004.602 Continuous Utility Easement Locations. The design and location of utility
easements shall connect with easements established in adjoining properties.
These easements, when approved, shall not thereafter be changed without the
written approval of the City Council after a public hearing.
Subdivision Code
City of Prior Lake
1004/p8
1004.603 Exclusion From Minimum Lot Area. Easements established over major
drainage ways, wetlands, water bodies, road rights-of-way, and regional
utility/pipeline easements shall be excluded from the calculation of minimum lot
areas as defined by the Subdivision Code and by the provisions of the Zoning
Code.
1004.604 Outlot Alternative. The City may require outlots rather than easements for
wetlands, watermain, sewer lines, storm sewer lines, drainage areas, temporary
cul-de-sacs and other features, when these features will be owned and
maintained by the City. The subdivider is responsible for providing the City with a
recorded warranty deed, in a form approved by the City Attorney, for the outlot
and for payment of all taxes on the outlot. A recorded copy of this deed shall be
delivered to the City immediately upon recording of the final plat.
1004.700 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL. The design of erosion and sediment
control structures and procedures shall be in conformance with the provisions of
the PWDM and in accordance with other State regulations.
1004.800 STORM DRAINAGE. All subdivision design shall incorporate provisions for storm
water runoff consistent with the PWDM and the City’s Comprehensive
Stormwater Management Plan.
1004.900 PROTECTED AREAS. Where land proposed for subdivision is deemed
environmentally sensitive by the City due to the existence of features including,
but not limited to, wetlands, drainageways, watercourses, areas subject to
flooding, significant trees, steep slopes or wooded areas, the design of said
subdivision shall clearly reflect all necessary measures of protection to ensure
against adverse environmental impacts.
1004.901 Based upon the necessity to control and maintain certain sensitive areas, the
City shall determine whether said protection will be accomplished through lot
enlargement and redesign or dedication to the City of those sensitive areas in the
form of outlots.
1004.902 Measures intended to protect the areas designated as environmentally sensitive
shall include design solutions, which allow for construction and grading involving
a minimum of alteration to sensitive areas. Such measures, when deemed
appropriate by the City, may include, but shall not be limited to, the following.
The establishment of easements and/or outlots over wetlands, drainageways
and watercourses.
The implementation of flood control measures.
The enlargement of lots or redesign of the subdivision.
Subdivision Code
City of Prior Lake
1004/p9
The utilization of appropriate erosion control measures subject to approval by
the City.
Soil testing to determine the ability of the proposed subdivision to support
development.
The limitation of development on slopes steeper than thirty (30) percent.
Structures that conform to the natural limitations presented by the topography
and soil so as to minimize to the greatest extent feasible the potential for soil
erosion.
The implementation of slope stabilization measures.
The establishment of a buffer zone around wetlands as outlined in
Subsection 1004.903 of the Subdivision Code.
1004.903 Buffer Strip Requirement. For any lot created on or after the January 1, 2000, a
buffer strip shall be maintained around the perimeter of all wetlands. The buffer
strips shall meet the following requirements:
Buffer strips shall be sized as set forth in the PWDM.
Buffer strips shall be required whether or not the wetland is on the same
property as the proposed subdivision or on an adjacent property.
Where acceptable natural vegetation exists in buffer strip areas, the retention
of such vegetation in an undisturbed state is required unless the subdivider
receives approval to replace such vegetation.
In the event the buffer strip area is graded, it shall be seeded or planted with
native wetland vegetation where possible or in accordance with the standards
for buffer strip vegetation in the PWDM.
Monumentation. A monument shall be required at each property line where

to ten percent (10%) of the net area of a subdivision. Net area is defined as the
gross area of land within the proposed subdivision less any storm water ponding
or wetland easements conveyed to the City. For the purpose of parkland
calculation, local street right-of-way is included in net area, but road right-of-way
necessary for County or State highways or excess collector street right-of- way
shall be excluded from net area. The amount of credit given for land to be
dedicated shall be based upon the land characteristics and in accordance with
the following schedule:
amd. Ord. 03-09, pub. 6/28/03)
DEDICATION SCHEDULE
Land Characteristic Dedication Credit

and other lands, which are not usable for public
recreation purposes
0%
At the City Council's discretion, the City may accept other property for public use,

contiguous to acceptable park, trail and open space land. No credit for the nonqualifying
land will be given toward the satisfaction of park dedication
requirements.
1004.1001 Land Preparation. Dedicated land shall be made suitable by the subdivider for
its intended use as parks and playgrounds, trails, or public open space. The City
shall determine the final condition of the land that is to be dedicated and the
subdivider shall be responsible for grading, topsoil, turf establishment, and
construction of any trails unless otherwise directed by the City.
The City further reserves the right not to accept land that in its discretion is not
useable for the above-described purposes, does not provide park facilities in the
locations set forth in the City's Comprehensive Plan, or land that would require
Subdivision Code
City of Prior Lake
1004/p12
extensive expenditures on the part of the City to make them useable.
1004.1002 At the City's option, the subdivider shall contribute an equivalent amount in cash,

such owner to dedicate pursuant to Subsection 1004.1000 above. The cash
amount shall be based on an amount determined annually by the City Council as
part of the adoption of the City Fee Schedule.
1004.1003 Whenever the term "dedicate" is used in this Subsection 1004, it shall mean a
dedication to the City of land or cash, or some combination thereof, whichever
the City, at its option, shall require. The dedication shall be made prior to the
City's release of the final plat for filing.
1004.1004 In instances where cash is required in lieu of land, payments as required by this
subsection shall be made prior to the release of the final plat to the subdivider.
1004.1005 Unless otherwise provided by the City, all land to be dedicated for park purposes
shall be conveyed to the City by warranty deed.
1004.1006 Prior to the dedication of such land for public use, the subdivider shall deliver to
the City a title opinion addressed to the City, and in a form acceptable to the City
Attorney, as to the condition of the title of such property, or in lieu of a title
opinion, a title insurance policy from a title company acceptable to the City
insuring the required public interest in the dedication therein.
1004.1007 In those cases where the City has agreed to allow the conveyance of parkland by
a deed rather than dedication on the plat, the subdivider shall, immediately upon
filing of the final plat or other appropriate subdivision documents, file for
recording all easements, deeds or other conveyances of property required as a
condition to the subdivision plat approval, and provide evidence to the City. No
building permits shall be issued to any lot in said plat until all such documents
have been executed and filed.
1004.1100 MINIMUM DESIGN FEATURES. The design features set forth in the Subdivision
Code are minimum requirements. The City may impose additional or more
stringent requirements concerning lot size, streets and overall design as deemed
appropriate considering the property being subdivided.
1004.1200 ZONING CODE CONSISTENCY. Preliminary and final plats shall only be
approved if they are consistent with the Zoning Code. Preliminary plats shall not
be approved prior to adoption of any pending rezoning application, any pending
rezoning initiated by the City or any other Zoning Code changes necessary for
final plat approval.

1006.200 EXCEPTIONS, PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS, STANDARDS.
1006.201 Findinqs. The Planning Commission may recommend an exception to the
minimum standards of the Subdivision Code (not the procedural provisions)
when, in its opinion, undue hardship may result from strict compliance. In
recommending any exception, the Planning Commission shall prescribe any
conditions that it deems necessary or desirable to protect and preserve the
health, welfare and safety of the public and property values. In making its
recommendations, the Planning Commission shall take into account the nature of
the proposed use of land and the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number
of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable effect
of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. An exception
shall only be recommended when the Planning Commission finds:
1. That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the property such
that the strict application of the provisions of the Subdivision Code would
deprive the subdivider of the reasonable use of his/her land;
2. That the granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the public health,
safety and welfare or injurious to other property in the territory in which the
property is situated; and
3. That the exception is to correct inequities resulting from a physical hardship
such as topography.
After considerations of the Planning Commission recommendations, the City
Council may grant exceptions, subject to provisions (1), (2), and (3) of this
Subsection.
1006.202 The provisions of Subsection 1006.201 of the Subdivision Code apply only to

1101.103To implement these findings, the City Council, through this Ordinance, establishes
minimum requirements to protect the public health, safety, morals, comfort,
convenience and general welfare of the people. This Ordinance shall divide the City
into use districts and establish regulations which control the location, erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration and use of structures and land.
1101.200: OVERVIEW OF THIS ZONING ORDINANCE: This Ordinance provides for the
classification and regulation of uses and structures within the City. The classifications
and regulations are intended to effectuate the goals and policies of the City's
Comprehensive Plan, to assure for the orderly and efficient growth within the City and
promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community and its residents.
Every person owning property, living in, or involved in a business in the City is
presumed to know the provisions of this Ordinance.
1101.201This Ordinance is divided into various subsections many of which interrelate with other
subsections of the Ordinance. The Ordinance provides for rules governing how the
various provisions are to be interpreted and how to reconcile what may appear to be
conflicts between Sections.
1101.202This Ordinance divides the City into 12 Use Districts. Within each Use District certain uses
of land are permitted, permitted with conditions, permitted by conditional use permit
or permitted by an interim use permit.

particular uses. Performance standards are such things as lighting, bufferyard and
landscaping standards and restrictions on noise and hours of operation. Dimensional
standards are such things as setbacks, minimum lot size and height restrictions.
1101.204The Ordinance provides for procedures and processes that must be followed in connection
with obtaining a Conditional Use Permit, variance, building permit, ordinance

1101.303Timing. Where the performance or doing of any act, duty, matter, payment or thing is
ordered or directed and the period of time or duration for the performance or doing
thereof is described and fixed by this Ordinance, the time shall be computed so as to
exclude the first and include the last day of the prescribed or fixed period or duration
of time. When the last day of the period falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday,
that day shall be omitted from the computation. The period shall be based on total
calendar days.
When an application, payment, drawing, contract or other document is to be delivered
to or filed with any department of the City or other unit of government on or before a
prescribed date and the prescribed date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday,
it is timely delivered or filed if it is delivered or filed on the next succeeding day which

calendar days.
1101.304Effect. This Ordinance shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all provisions in this
Ordinance. When the words of this Ordinance in their application to an existing
situation are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of this Ordinance shall not be

1101.305Grammar. Grammatical errors shall not destroy the application of this Ordinance. A
transposition of words and clauses may be resorted to when a sentence, as it stands,
is without meaning. Words and phrases which may be necessary to the proper
interpretation of this Ordinance and which do not conflict with its obvious purpose and
intent nor in any way affect its scope in operation, may be added in the construction
thereof.
1101.306Provisos. Provisos shall be construed to limit rather than to extend the operation of the
clauses to which they refer. Exceptions expressed in this Ordinance shall be
construed to exclude all others.
1101.307Penalties. When a penalty or forfeiture is provided for the violation of this Ordinance, each
day that a violation exists shall constitute a separate violation.
1101.308Conflicts. When a general provision of this Ordinance conflicts with a special provision in
this Ordinance, the two shall be construed if possible so that effect shall be given to
both. If the conflict between the two provisions is irreconcilable, the special provisions
shall prevail and shall be construed as an exception to the general provision unless
the general provision was enacted subsequent to the special provision.
When several clauses are irreconcilable, the Ordinance clause last in order of date
or position shall prevail. When the provisions of two or more amendments to this
Ordinance passed at different dates are irreconcilable, the amendment latest in date
of final enactment shall prevail.
1101.309Reference. Whenever any specific Section is referenced in this Ordinance, the reference
shall include and incorporate any changes, revisions or amendments as may from
time to time be enacted. When a section or part of this Ordinance is amended, the
amendment shall be construed as merging into the original Ordinance, becoming a
part thereof, and replacing the part amended, and the remainder of the original
Ordinance and the amendment shall be read together and viewed as one Ordinance
passed at one time. The portions of the Ordinance which were not altered by the
amendment shall be construed as effective from the date of the first enactment, and
the new provision shall be construed as effective only from the date when the
amendment became effective.
When this Ordinance adopts the provisions of State Statute by reference, it also
adopts by reference any subsequent amendments of that statute. If two or more
amendments to the same provision of this Ordinance are enacted at the same or at
different times, one amendment overlooking and making no reference to the other or
others, the amendments shall be construed together if possible and effect be given
to each. If the amendments are irreconcilable, the amendment latest in date of final
enactment shall prevail.
1101.310Diagrams. Diagrams, where provided, are intended to aid written text and may not be
drawn to scale. Where a conflict exists between a diagram and text, the text shall
prevail.

Conditional Use Permit not specifically included in such judgment nor shall it
invalidate the application of the same condition in any other Conditional Use Permit.
1101.312Jurisdiction and Authority. This Ordinance is enacted under the authority granted to the

statute which is most restrictive or which imposes the higher or more restrictive
standards or requirements shall control.
1101.314Mixed Use. All regulations applicable to each use in a mixed use development shall be

the shortest distance from the location of the use to the property line of the adjacent
street, district, or lot or other boundary line.
For lots of record existing on the effective date of this Ordinance, if the parcel
dimensions shown on the recorded plat are smaller than the dimensions shown on a
current survey, the dimensions shown on the plat shall be accepted as correct for the
purpose of determining lot width, lot depth, lot area and setbacks, provided that the

Improve the predictability of the review and approval process for
residents, developers and staff
Set standards for development and redevelopment that enhance and
maintain a traditional small downtown character.
Introduce sustainable and “ green” building practices to provide
guidelines and criteria.
2) Applicability. The design standards and the design review process apply to all
new construction; any renovation, expansion or other exterior changes to existing
non-residential and/or multi-family buildings, including re-painting; any
development or expansion of parking areas; and any other exterior alteration that
requires a building permit.

developed or altered. That is, changes to a building shall comply with those
standards that pertain to buildings, while changes to a parking area shall comply
with standards for parking areas, but not for buildings. The Community
Development Director will make the initial determination as to which standards
are applicable.
There are many ways to achieve the same design objective. The Community
Development Director may permit alternative approaches that, in its
determination, meet the objective(s) of the design standard(s) equally well.

overall color.
New masonry work should match the color and materials or the original
façade.
Wherever practical, façade renovations should not destroy or cover

openings, and compatible building materials and colors. Where such original
buildings are missing or have been extensively altered, the other design
standards in the Section shall be applied.
4) Mechanical Equipment Screening. Utility service structures such as utility

the residential or commercial planned unit development density evaluation
steps to arrive at an allowable number of dwelling units or sites.
1104.804 Residential And Commercial PUD Density Evaluation: The procedures for
determining the "base" density of a PUD and density increase multipliers are
outlined as follows. Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to
any other tier further from the waterbody, but must not be transferred to any
other tier closer to the waterbody.
1) Residential PUD " Base" Density Evaluation: The suitable area within each
tier is divided by the single residential lot size standard for lakes or, for rivers,
the single residential lot width standard multiplied by the tier depth, unless the
local unit of government has specified an alternative minimum lot size for
rivers which shall then be used to yield a base density of dwelling units or
sites for each tier. Proposed locations and the number of dwelling units or
sites for the residential planned unit developments are then compared with the
tier, density, and suitability analysis herein and the design criteria in
Subsection 1104.805.
2) Commercial PUD "Base" Density Evaluation:
a. Determine the average inside living area size of dwelling units or sites
within each tier, including both existing and proposed units and sites.
Computation of inside living area sizes need not include decks, patios,
stoops, steps, garages, porches or basements, unless they are
habitable space.
b. Select the appropriate floor area ratio from the following table.

For average unit floor areas less than shown, use the floor area ratios listed
for 200 square feet. For areas greater than shown, use the ratios listed for
1,500 square feet. For recreational camping areas, use the ratios listed at 400
square feet. For manufactured home sites in recreational camping areas use
a ratio equal to the size of the manufactured home, or if unknown, the ratio
listed for 1,000 square feet.
c. Multiply the suitable area within each tier by the floor area ratio to yield
total floor area for each tier allowed to be used for dwelling units or
sites.
d. Divide the total floor area by tier computed in subsection (c) above by
the average inside living area size determined in subsection ( a) above.
This yields a base number of dwelling units and sites for each tier.
e. Proposed locations and number of dwelling units or sites for the
commercial planned unit development are then compared with the tier,
density and suitability analysis herein and the design criteria in
Subsection 1104.805.

visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by
vegetation, topography, increased setbacks, color, or other means
acceptable to the local unit of government, assuming summer, leaf-on
conditions. Vegetative and topographic screening shall be preserved,
if existing, or may be required to be provided;
e. Accessory structures and facilities, except water-oriented accessory
structures, shall meet the required principal structure setback and shall
be centralized; and
f. Water-oriented accessory structures and facilities may be allowed if
they meet and exceed design standards contained in Subsection
1104.308(4).
1104.806 Conversions: Local governments may allow existing resorts or other land
uses and facilities to be converted to residential planned unit developments if
all the following standards are met:
1) Proposed conversions shall be initially evaluated using the same procedures
for residential planned unit developments involving all new construction.
Inconsistencies between existing features of the development and these
standards must be identified.
2) Deficiencies involving water supply and sewage treatment, structure color,
impervious coverage, open space, and shore recreation facilities shall be
corrected as part of the conversion or as specified in the conditional use
permits.
3) Shore and bluff zone deficiencies shall be evaluated and reasonable
improvements made as part of the conversion. These improvements shall
include, where applicable, the following:
a. Removal of extraneous buildings, docks, or other facilities that no
longer need to be located in shore or bluff impact zones;
b. Remedial measures to correct erosion sites and improve vegetative
cover and screening of buildings and other facilities as viewed from the
water; and
c. If existing dwelling units are located in shore or bluff impact zones,
conditions are attached to approvals of conversions that preclude
exterior expansions in any dimension or substantial alterations. The
conditions shall also provide for future relocation of dwelling units,
where feasible, to other locations, meeting all setback and elevation
requirements when they are rebuilt or replaced.
4) Existing dwelling unit or dwelling site densities that exceed standards in
Subsection 1104.804 may be allowed to continue but shall not be allowed to
be increased, either at the time of conversion or in the future. Efforts shall be
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1104/p32
made during the conversion to limit impacts of high densities by requiring
seasonal use, improving vegetative screening, centralizing shore recreation
facilities, installing new sewage treatment systems, or other means.
1104.900: DEVELOPMENT ON NONCONFORMING LOTS:
1104.901 Purpose: The purpose of regulating development on substandard lots of
record is to coordinate development on substandard lots to ensure
environmentally sensitive development, ensure compatibility with surrounding
existing development and to allow for combination of lots to the extent
possible.
1104.902 Nonconforming Lot: Development of a nonconforming lot of record requires
sensitivity and careful attention to issues of drainage, setbacks, flood plain
elevation, grading, lot coverage, existing vegetation cover, and relationship to
adjacent structures. New construction upon nonconforming lots should be
carefully designed to integrate with the existing neighborhood development. It
is the intent of this Section to provide flexibility to develop nonconforming lots.
However, the requirements outlined herein are intended to define the
conditions under which the City will allow a nonconforming lot to be developed
for single-family detached dwelling purposes without a variance.
Development on nonconforming lots of record which do not comply with these
criteria may only be considered after application for, and approval of,
appropriate variances as provided for in Subsection 1108.400.
1) Sewered Areas: A legal lot of record existing upon the effective date of this
Section in a residential district, located adjacent to a General Development or
Recreational Development Lake, which does not meet the requirements of this
Section as to area or width may be utilized for single- family detached dwelling
purposes, provided that all of the conditions of this subsection apply:
a. The minimum lot size with public sewer shall be a minimum of 50 feet
in width measured at the front yard setback line and shall have a
minimum lot area equal to or greater than 7,500 square feet.
b. The lot has been assessed a sewer and water assessment and will not
require an on-site septic system for development.
c. The lot was created compliant with official controls in effect at the time.
d. The development plans shall be in conformance with the policies for
residential development as outlined in the Comprehensive Plan.
e. The development plan shall not exceed thirty percent ( 30%)
impervious surface coverage.
f. Development shall be planned and conducted in such a manner that
the control of disturbed areas and erosion is demonstrated during and
after construction.
g. A complete grading and drainage plan shall be submitted to the City
Engineer for review. Such plans should be prepared in accordance
with the Storm Water Management Plan.
h. The lot and proposed structure shall meet all other performance
standards of the zoning and building codes.
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1104/p33
2) All Areas: Development of all nonconforming legal lots of record existing upon
the effective date of this Section shall comply with the following:
a. In a group of two or more contiguous lots of record under a common
ownership, an individual lot must be considered as a separate parcel
of land for the purpose of sale or development, if it meets the following
requirements:
1) The lot must be at least 66 percent of the dimensional standard for
lot width and lot size;
2) The lot must be connected to a public sewer, if available, or must
be suitable for the installation of a Type 1 sewage treatment system;
3) Impervious surface coverage must not exceed 30 percent of each
lot; and
4) Development of the lot must be consistent with an adopted
comprehensive plan.
b. A lot subject to paragraph (a) not meeting the requirements of
paragraph (a) must be combined with the one or more contiguous lots
so they equal one or more conforming lots as much as possible.
c. Notwithstanding paragraph (a), contiguous nonconforming lots of
record in shoreland areas under a common ownership must be able to
be sold or purchased individually if each lot contained a habitable
residential dwelling at the time the lots came under common ownership
and the lots are suitable for, or served by, a sewage treatment system,
or connected to a public sewer.
d. In evaluating all variances, zoning and building permit applications, or
conditional use requests, the zoning authority shall require the property
owner to address, when appropriate, storm water runoff management,
reducing impervious surfaces, increasing setback, restoration of
wetlands, vegetative buffers, sewage treatment and water supply
capabilities, and other conservation- designed actions.
e. A portion of a conforming lot may be separated from an existing parcel
as long as the remainder of the existing parcel meets the lot size and
sewage system requirements of the zoning district for a new lot and
the newly created parcel is combined with an adjacent parcel.

1105.100: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATIONS, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE:
1105.101 Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in
Minnesota Statutes Chapter 103F and 462 ( Zoning Enabling Statute) delegated
the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses.
1105.102 Findings of Fact: The flood hazard areas of Prior Lake, Minnesota, are subject
to periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment
of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and
general welfare.
This Section is based upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards
which is consistent with the standards established by the Minnesota Department
of Natural Resources.
1105.103 Statement of Purpose: It is the purpose of this Section to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in
Subsection 1105.102 herein by provisions contained herein.
1105.200: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
1105.201 Lands to Which Section Applies: This Section shall apply to all lands within
the jurisdiction of Prior Lake, Minnesota, shown on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map and the attachments and amendments thereto, as being located within the
boundaries of the area as Zone AE or Zone A.
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1105/p2
1105.202 Establishment of Official Map: The Flood Insurance Study and Flood
Insurance Rate Map for Prior Lake, Minnesota, both dated November 19, 1997,
and any amendments thereto, are hereby adopted, by reference and declared to
be part of this Section. The Official Map shall be on file in the office of the City of
Prior Lake Planning Department.
1105.203 Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation: The Regulatory Flood Protection
Elevation shall be an elevation at least one foot above the Regional Flood (to the
nearest one-tenth foot as indicated in the Flood Insurance Study Text) plus any
increase in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain
authorized by this Ordinance. For structures constructed prior to November 19,
1997, the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation does not have to include the
one foot of freeboard noted in this paragraph unless the existing structure has
been removed as part of the site redevelopment.
1105.204 Interpretation: In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
Section shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the City and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of
any other powers granted by State statutes.
The boundaries of the flood plain district shall be determined by reference to the
Flood Insurance Rate Map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of the boundaries of the flood plain district, for example where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions
and there is a formal appeal of the decision of the Director of Planning, the
Board of Adjustment shall make the necessary interpretation. All decisions will
be based on elevations of the regional ( 100-year) flood profile and other
available technical data.
1105.205 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this Section to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this Section imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this Section shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this
Section are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
1105.206 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: This Section does not imply that areas
outside the flood plain district or land uses permitted within such districts will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This Section shall not create liability on the
part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this Section or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
1105.300: FLOOD PLAIN DISTRICT: The flood plain district shall include those areas
designated as Zone AE and A on the Flood Insurance Rate Map adopted in
subsection 1105.202.
1105.301 Compliance: No new structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this Section and other applicable regulations which
apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this Section. Within the flood plain district,
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1105/p3
all uses not listed as permitted uses or conditional uses in Subsections 1105.401
and 1105.403 that follow, shall be prohibited. In addition, a caution is provided
here that:
1) Modifications, additions, structural alterations or repair after damage to existing
nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses of structures or land are
regulated by the general provisions of this Section and specifically Subsection
1105.900.
2) As-built elevations for elevated or floodproofed structures must be certified by
ground surveys and floodproofing techniques must be designated and certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect as specified in the general
provisions of this Section, and specifically as stated in Subsection 1105.802.
1105.400: PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES:
1105.401 Permitted Uses: The following uses shall be permitted uses within the flood
plain district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance:
Open space, recreation, retaining walls, stairs, platforms and fill approved
in conjunction with a development proposal.
Accessory structures provided they comply with the provision of
Subsection 1105.404(5).
Fill may be a permitted use; provided that it is part of a development
project and is accompanied by an approved building permit and/or
grading and filling permit. Fill shall be protected from erosion by
vegetative cover, mulching, rip rap or any other acceptable method,
approved in advance by the City.
Residence and other structures constructed on fill so that the basement
floor or first floor, if there is no basement, is at or above the regulatory
flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation shall be no lower than
1 foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and shall extend at
such elevation at least 15 feet beyond the limits of any structure or
building erected thereon. Fill shall be compacted and the slopes shall be
protected by rip rap or vegetative covering, approved in advance by the
City.
1105.402 Standards for Permitted Uses:
1) The use shall have low flood damage potential.
2) The use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district.
3) The use shall not adversely affect the regional flood elevation or cause a
measurable increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause a
considerable increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected.
4) Residences that do not have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more
than 2 feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall not be permitted
unless granted a variance by the Board of Adjustment. In granting a variance,
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1105/p4
the Board of Adjustment shall specify limitations on the period of use or
occupancy of the residence.
5) Where the existing streets, utilities and small lot sizes preclude the use of fill,
other methods of elevating the first floor ( including basements) above the
regulatory flood protection elevation may be permitted provided appropriate
variances are granted by the Board of Adjustment and, provided, that the
structure is floodproofed in accordance with the State Building Code.
1105.403 Conditional Uses: The following uses shall be conditional uses within the flood
plain district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance.
1) Marinas, boat rentals, piers, wharves and water control structures. Railroads,
street, bridges, utility transmission lines, and pipelines
2) Flood control structural works such as levees, dikes and floodwalls intended to
protect individual structures and/or agricultural crops against a flood equal to or
less than a 10-year frequency flood event.
1105.404 Standards for Conditional Uses:
1) All Uses: No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and
levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment or other uses
may be allowed as a conditional use that will adversely affect the regional flood
elevation or cause a considerable increase in flood damages in the reach or
reaches affected.
2) All conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and standards contained
herein.
3) The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district.
4) Storage of Materials in Flood Plain District: Dredge spoil, fill and all other
similar materials deposited or stored in the flood plain shall be protected from
erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, rip rap or other acceptable method
approved in advance by the City.
Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be allowed in the
floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted which includes
an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
As an alternative, and consistent with subsection ( 4b) above, dredge spoil
disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, on-site storage of
fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to the stage of the
100-year or regional flood, but only after the Director of Community Development
and Natural Resources has received an appropriate plan which assures the
removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time
available. The conditional use permit must be filed by the property owner with
the office of the Scott County Recorder.
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1105/p5
5) Accessory Structures: Accessory structures shall not be designed for human
habitation. Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed
on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of flood
waters.
Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed in
accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the State
Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be floodproofed to
the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classification in the State Building Code;
provided, the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not
exceed 1000 square feet in size, and for a detached garage, the detached
garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All
floodproofed accessory structures must meet the following additional standards,
as appropriate:
The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse
or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to
or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or, properly
floodproofed.
6) Storage of Materials and Equipment: The storage or processing of materials
that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive or potentially injurious to
human, animal or plant life is prohibited. Storage of other materials or
equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time
available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the
City Council.
7) Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross
section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be subject to the provisions
of Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 103G. Community- wide structural works for
flood control intended to remove areas from the regulatory flood plain shall not
be allowed in the floodway.
8) A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not cause an increase
to the 100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis must assume equal
conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream.
1105.500: SUBDIVISIONS: No land shall be subdivided which is deemed unsuitable by the
City for reason of flooding, inadequate water supply or sewage treatment
facilities. All lots within the flood plain district shall contain a building site at or
above the regulatory flood protection elevation. All subdivisions shall have water
and sewage disposal facilities that comply with the provisions of this Ordinance
and have road access no lower than 2 feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation. In the flood plain district, applicants shall provide the information
required in the Subdivision Ordinance, and the subdivision shall be evaluated in
accordance with procedures in the Subdivision Ordinance.
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1105/p6
1105.600: PUBLIC UTILITIES; PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES:
1105.601 Public Utilities: All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer
and water supply systems to be located in the flood plain shall be floodproofed in
accordance with the State Building Code or elevated to above the regulatory
flood protection elevation.
1105.602 Public Transportation Facilities: Transportation facilities such as roads and
bridges to be located within the flood plain shall comply with subsection
1105.300. Elevation to the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be provided
where failure or interruption of these transportation facilities would result in
danger to the public health or safety or where such facilities are essential to the
orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads may be constructed at a
lower elevation where failure or interruption of transportation services would not
endanger the public health or safety.
1105.700: TRAVEL TRAILERS/VEHICLES AND MANUFACTURED HOMES: New
manufactured home parks shall be subject to the provisions placed on
subdivisions by Subsection 1105.500. The placement of new or replacement of
manufactured homes on individual lots of record that are located in the flood
plain district will be treated as a new structure and may be placed only if elevated
in compliance with Subsection 1105.400.
All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequate foundation
system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State or local
anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. Travel trailers and travel
vehicles that do not meet the exemption criteria specified in Subsection
1105.701 below shall be subject to the provisions of this Section and as
specifically spelled out in Subsection 1105.702 below.
1105.701 Exemptions: Travel trailers and travel vehicles are exempt from the provisions
of this subsection if they are placed in any individual lots or parcels of record,
and further if they meet the following criteria:
Have current licenses required for highway use.
Are highway ready, that is, they are on wheels or on the internal jacking
system, are attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
commonly used in campgrounds and trailer parks and the travel
trailer/travel vehicle has no permanent structural type additions attached
to it.
The travel trailer or travel vehicle and associated use must be permissible
in any pre-existing, underlying zoning district.
Travel trailers and travel vehicles exempted in Subsection 1105.701 above lose
this exemption when development occurs on the parcel exceeding $ 500.00 for a
structural addition to the travel trailer/travel vehicle or an accessory structure
such as a garage or storage building. The travel/trailer vehicle and all additions
and accessory structures will then be treated as a new structure and shall be
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1105/p7
subject to the elevation/ floodproofing requirements and the use of land
restrictions specified in Subsections 1105.300 and 1105.400.
1105.702 New or Expanded Travel Trailer Parks/Campgrounds/ Subdivisions: New
commercial travel trailer or travel vehicle parks or campgrounds and new
residential type subdivisions and condominium associations and the expansion
of any existing similar use or dwelling sites shall be subject to the following:
1) Any new or replacement travel trailer or travel vehicle will be allowed in the flood
plain district provided said trailer or vehicle and its contents are placed on fill
above the regulatory flood protection elevation and proper elevated road access
to the site exists. Any fill placed in the flood plain for the purpose of elevating a
travel trailer shall be subject to the requirements of Subsection 1105.300.
2) All new or replacement travel trailers, or travel vehicles not meeting the criteria of
1) above may, as an alternative, be allowed as a conditional use if in
accordance with the provisions of Subsection 1108.200. The applicant must
submit an emergency plan for the safe evacuation of all vehicles and people
during the 100-year flood.
Said plan shall be prepared by a registered engineer and shall demonstrate that
adequate time and personnel exist to carry out the evacuation. All attendant
sewage and water facilities for new or replacement travel trailers or other
recreational vehicles must be protected or constructed so as to not be impaired
or contaminated during time of flooding.
1105.800: ADMINISTRATION:
1105.801 State and Federal Permit: Prior to granting a permit or processing an
application for a conditional use permit or variance, the applicant shall verify that
all necessary State and Federal permits have been applied for and/or issued.
1105.802 Certification: The applicant shall be required to submit certification by a
registered professional engineer, registered architect or registered land surveyor
that the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in compliance
with the provisions of this Section. Floodproofing measures shall be certified by a
registered professional engineer or registered architect.
1105.803 Record of First Floor Elevation: The Community Development and Natural
Resources Department shall maintain a record of the elevation of the lowest floor
including basement) of all new structures and alterations or additions to existing
structures in the flood plain. The Community Development and Natural
Resources Department shall also maintain a record of the elevation to which
structures and alterations or additions to structures are floodproofed.
1105.804 Flood Insurance Notice and Record Keeping for Variance Requests in the
Flood Plan Districts: The Director of Community Development and Natural
Resources shall notify the applicant for a variance that: 1) the issuance of a
variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1105/p8
100.00 of insurance coverage, and 2) such construction below the 100-year or
regional flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions. No variance shall have the
effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in that district; permit a lower
degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for the
particular area, or permit standards lower than those required by State law. The
City shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their
issuance, and report such variances issued in its annual or biennial report
submitted to the Administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program.
1105.900: NONCONFORMING USES: A structure or the use of a structure or premises
which was lawful before the passage or amendment to this Section but which is
not in conformity with the provisions of this Section may be continued subject to
the following conditions:
1) No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity.
2) Any alteration or addition to a nonconforming structure or nonconforming use
which would result in increasing the flood damage potential of that structure or
use shall be protected to the regulatory flood protection elevation in accordance
with any of the elevation on fill or floodproofing techniques ( i.e., FP-1 through
FP-4 floodproofing classifications) allowable in the State Building Code, except
as further restricted in subsection 3 below.
3) The cost of any structural alterations or additions to any nonconforming structure
over the life of the structure shall not exceed 50% of the market value of the
structure unless the conditions of this Section are satisfied. The cost of all
structural alterations and additions constructed since the adoption of the City's
initial flood plain controls must be calculated into today's current cost which will
include all costs such as construction materials and a reasonable cost placed on
all manpower or labor. If the current cost of all previous and proposed
alterations and additions exceed 50% of the current market value of the
structure, then the structure must meet the standards of Subsection 1105.402 for
new structures.
4) If any nonconforming use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, any future
use of the building premises shall conform to this Section.
5) If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including
floods, to an extent of 50% or more of its market value at the time of destruction,
it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this
Section. The applicable provisions for establishing new uses or new structures in
Subsection 1105.402 will apply.
1105.1000: AMENDMENTS: The flood plain designation on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
shall not be changed unless it can be shown that the designation is in error or
that the area has been filled to or above the elevation of the regional flood and is
contiguous to lands outside the flood plain. Special exceptions to this rule may
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1105/p9
be permitted by the Commissioner of Natural Resources if he/she determines
that, through other measures, lands are adequately protected for the intended
use.
All amendments to this Section, including amendments to the Flood Insurance
Rate Map, must be submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of Natural
Resources prior to adoption. Changes in the Flood Insurance Rate Map must
meet the Federal Emergency Management Agency's ( FEMA) technical
conditions and criteria and must receive prior FEMA approval before adoption.
The Commissioner of Natural Resources must be given 10 day's written notice of
all hearings to consider an amendment to this Section and said notice shall
include a draft of the ordinance amendment or technical study under
consideration.

1106: MIXED USE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS
1106.100 PURPOSE: The purpose of the Planned Unit Development District (PUD) is to
offer an alternative to development as outlined in the residential, commercial, and
industrial use districts of this Ordinance. The PUD District will and to provide for
greater flexibility in the development and redevelopment process as compared to
development under the definitive and precise requirements of the conventional
use districts. The PUD District must demonstrate that the particular areas to be
developed can offer greater value to the community and can better meet the
community’ s health, welfare, and safety requirements than if those same areas
were to be developed in a single purpose zone. The PUD process provides for a
joint planning/design effort by developers and City officials. Development in a
single purpose Use District establishes maximum limits within which developers
must perform. The Planned Unit Development may be multi-purpose in nature
so that not only may it be residential, commercial, or industrial, but also it may
contain a combination of these uses. It is not the intent of this Section to allow
for reductions or waivers to the standard Use District requirements solely for the
purpose of increasing overall density, allowing the use of private streets or
allowing development that otherwise could not be approved.
1106.200 FINDINGS: The City Council finds that the City and its residents will benefit by
creating a process which permits Planned Unit Development District which will
allow for greater flexibility in the development of a parcel or property by tailoring
the development to the site and neighborhood. Such benefits include, but are
not limited to:
1) Provides a flexible approach to development which is in harmony with the
purpose and intent of the City's Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Ordinance;
2) More creative, efficient and effective use of land, open space and public facilities
through mixing of land uses;
3) Create a sense of place and provide more interaction among people;
4) Increase economic vitality and expand market opportunities;
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
June 1, 2009 1106/p2
5) Support long-term economic stability by strengthening the tax base, job market
and business opportunities;
6) Increase transportation options, such as walking, biking or bussing;
7) Provide opportunities for life cycle housing to all ages;
8) Provide more efficient and effective use of streets, utilities, and public facilities
that support high quality land use development at a lesser cost;
9) Enhanced incorporation of recreational, public and open space components in
the development which may be made more useable and be more suitably located
than would otherwise be provided under conventional development procedures.
The PUD district also encourages the developer to convey property to the public,
over and above required dedications, by allowing a portion of the density to be
transferred to other parts of the site;
10) Preserves and enhances desirable site characteristics and open space, and
protection of sensitive environmental features including, but not limited to, steep
slopes, wetlands, and trees. Where applicable, the PUD should also encourage
historic preservation, re-use and redevelopment of existing buildings;
11) High quality of design compatible with surrounding land uses, including both
existing and planned.
1106.300 DEFINITION: A planned unit development ( PUD) is a development of land that is
under unified control and is planned and developed as a whole in a single
development operation or in a programmed series of development stages. The
development may include streets, circulation ways, utilities, buildings, open
spaces, and other site features and improvements. A planned unit development
is built according to a detailed final development plan, as approved by the City
Council.
1106.400 AUTHORIZATION: Approval of a Planned Unit Development District may allow:
1) Variety: Within a comprehensive site design concept a mixture of land uses,
housing types and densities.
2) Sensitivity: Through the departure from the strict application of required setbacks,
yard areas, lot sizes, minimum house sizes, minimum requirements, and other
performance standards associated with traditional zoning, planned unit
development can maximize the development potential of land while remaining
sensitive to its unique and valuable natural characteristics.
3) Efficiency: The consolidation of areas for recreation and reductions in street
lengths and other utility-related expenses.
4) Density Transfer: The project density may be clustered, basing density on
number of units per acre versus specific lot dimensions.
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
June 1, 2009 1106/p3
5) District Integration: The combination of uses which are allowed in separate
zoning districts, such as:
a. Mixed residential allows both densities and unit types to be varied within
the project.
b. Mixed residential with increased density acknowledging the greater
sensitivity of PUD projects, regulation provides increased density on the property
if a PUD is utilized.
c. Mixed land uses with the integration of compatible land uses within the
project.
1106. 500 ALLOWED USES: Uses allowed within a PUD District are limited to those uses
allowed in the use district which is consistent with the land use category shown
for the area on the official Comprehensive Plan Land Use Map. Specific allowed
uses and performance standards for each PUD shall be as provided in the City
Code Section for the relevant use district and shall be delineated in the PUD
ordinance and development plan. The PUD development plan shall identify all
the proposed land uses and those uses shall become permitted uses with the
approval of the development plan by the City Council. Any change in the list of
uses presented in the development plan will be considered an amendment to the
PUD and will follow the procedures specified in City Code Section 1106.711.
Ord. Amd. 119-10, publ. 11/09/19)
1106.501 Required Standards. The City shall consider a proposed PUD District from the
point of view of all standards and purposes of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan

surrounding uses, the conservation of woodland and the protection of health,
safety and welfare of the community and residents of the PUD. To these ends,
the City Council shall consider the location of the buildings, compatibility, parking
areas and other features with respect to the topography of the area and existing
natural features such as streams and large trees; the efficiency, adequacy and
safety of the proposed layout of internal streets and driveways; the adequacy and
location of green areas; the adequacy, location and screening of parking areas;
and such other matters as the City Council may find to have a material bearing
upon the stated standards and objectives of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
In reviewing a PUD plan, the City Council must also consider the compatibility of
the development with the Shoreland and Flood Plain district requirements.
1106. 600: MINIMUM PUD ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS: Projects available for PUD
treatment shall have a site which consists of a parcel or contiguous parcels of
land in common ownership 10 acres or more in size. An owner(s) of a tract of

1106B.100: PURPOSE AND INTENT. As part of the Comprehensive Plan, the City of Prior Lake has
adopted a report titled “Natural Resources Inventory and Land Cover Mapping” ( prepared
by Bonestroo Natural Resources, April, 2005). The report classifies and maps the land
cover of natural and semi-natural areas within the City based on the Minnesota Land
Cover Classification System (MLCCS), Version 5.4. For areas identified in the “Natural
Resources Inventory and Land Cover Mapping Report” as High and Moderate Quality
Natural Communities, a developer may request approval of flexible development as part
of the preliminary plat application. The purpose of flexible development is to preserve and
protect the specified High and Moderate Quality Natural Communities. Under this
process, a developer may request modifications to the following Zoning and Subdivision
Ordinance requirements:
Right-of-way and street surface widths
Minimum lot areas
Minimum lot widths
Structure setbacks
In return for the modifications, the developer must prove that the specified High and
Moderate Quality Natural Communities will be undisturbed by the development. As part of
this approval, the City Council may also require enhancement of the existing Natural
Community. The flexible development process may not be used to increase permitted
density or to allow uses or dwelling types that would otherwise not be permitted in the
district.
1106B.200 FINDINGS. The City Council finds that the City and its residents will benefit by creating a
process which will allow for greater flexibility in the development of a parcel or property in
areas with high or moderate quality natural communities. Such benefits include, but are
not limited to:

1107.200: OFF-STREET PARKING AREAS, PAVED AREAS, AND LOADING SPACES
1107.201 Purpose. Regulation of off-street parking and loading spaces in the Zoning
Ordinance is necessary to alleviate or prevent congestion of the public right-ofway
and to promote the safety and general welfare of the public. Regulation is
accomplished by establishing minimum requirements for off-street parking of
vehicles and loading and unloading operations associated with their use for the
uses regulated by this Ordinance by analysis of the intensity, duration, time and
style of utilization of the land or structures in or from which each use is
conducted.
1107.202 Application of Off-Street Parking Regulations. The regulations and
requirements set forth in this Section of the Ordinance shall apply to all Use
Districts except the " TC" Town Center Use District. Applications for all
occupancy permits shall be accompanied by a site plan drawn to a readable
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1107/p2
scale which indicates the location of off-street parking and loading spaces on the
site for which the occupancy permit is requested.
1107.203 General Provisions.
1) Permits Prior to Effective Date. Structures or uses for which a permit has
been issued prior to the effective date of this Ordinance which are not completed
on its effective date shall be exempt from the parking requirements of this
Ordinance if the structure is completed within 6 months after the effective date of
this Ordinance. In such cases, the parking and loading facilities provided for the
structure or use must comply with the Ordinance requirements which were in
effect at the time the permit was issued.
2) Reduction of Existing Off-Street Parking Space. Off-street parking and
loading spaces existing upon the effective date of this Ordinance shall not be
reduced in number unless their number exceeds the requirements imposed for a
similar new use by this Ordinance; however, if the existing parking meets more
than 90% of the requirements of this Section, the number of parking spaces may
be reduced to 90% of the requirement for the purpose of establishing
landscaping where such a reduction is necessary to construct a landscaping or
bufferyard improvement required by this Ordinance. The creation of a required
bufferyard shall not further reduce the number of available parking spaces. In
the event compliance with the bufferyard requirement would reduce existing
nonconforming parking below 90% of the Ordinance requirement, the
requirements of Subsection 1107.204(11) shall apply.
3) Floor Area. Floor area shall mean the total floor area as defined in Subsection
1101.400. Indoor parking and indoor loading spaces shall not be counted as
part of the floor area of a structure for the purpose of computing the number of
parking or loading spaces which are required.
4) Design Capacity. When a building's design capacity is used for purposes of
calculating requirements for off -street parking spaces, that design capacity shall
be determined by Occupancy Loading specified in the Uniform Building Code in
force at the time the determination is made.
5) Benches in Places of Public Assembly. In stadiums, sports arenas, structures
of religious institutions and other places of public assembly in which patrons or
spectators occupy benches, pews, or other similar seating facilities, each 28
inches of such seating shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of
determining the requirements for off-street parking where the parking
requirement is calculated by application of a formula based on the total number
of seats.
6) Calculating Space. When the calculation of the number of off -street parking
spaces results in a fraction, each fraction of 1/2 or more shall require another
space. When a single site contains various uses, the parking requirement
calculation of each use shall be totaled prior to the final rounding of the overall
parking requirement for the site.
7) Assessments. When a lot has been assessed for one or more off-street
parking stalls under applicable State Statutes which may be amended from time
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1107/p3
to time, the number of stalls forming the basis for such assessment shall
constitute an equal number of spaces for purposes of this subsection.
8) Use of Parking Facilities. Required off-street parking facilities in an "R" Use
District may be utilized only for parking passenger automobiles, except that 1
truck not exceeding 1.5-ton capacity may be parked inside a building on the
resident's property by the occupant of each dwelling unit. No required parking
facilities or public right-of-ways in any "R" Use District shall be used for open-air
storage of commercial vehicles, customer' s vehicles, or vehicles belonging to
employees, owners, tenants or customers of business or manufacturing
establishments.
9) Location of Parking Facilities. Required off-street parking in the R-1 and R-2
Use Districts shall be on the same lot as the building housing the principal use,
except in the cases of:
A religious institution where parking is regulated by subsection 1107.303.
Condominium developments where off-street parking is designed on a lot
or within a garage on a separate parcel but within the same condominium
development.
Free-standing parking lots accessory to existing nonresidential or
recreational uses, located within the same Zoning Use District, and
located within 500 feet of the existing use, may be permitted in the R-1,
R-2, and R-3 Use Districts, subject to approval of a Conditional Use
Permit. Such parking lots must meet all the provisions listed in
Subsection 1107.203(11), 1107.203(13) below, and Section 1107.204.
10) Calculating Space for a Compound Use. Should a structure contain 2 or more
types of uses, the total off-street parking spaces required for each use shall be
calculated separately unless requirements for joint parking arrangements can be
applied as regulated by Subsection 1107.203(12).
11) Control of Off-Site Parking Facilities. When required accessory off-street
parking facilities are provided on a lot other than the lot on which the principal
use is located, the following requirements shall be met unless other
requirements apply if parking is provided under Subsection 1107.203(12).
a. A paved pedestrian way from the off-site parking facilities to the use
being served has been provided and is properly maintained.
b. The off-site parking area and the lot on which the principal use is located
must be in the same ownership, or the use of the parking facilities shall
be protected by Covenants that run with the land on both the lot on which
the parking facility is provided and the lot on which the principal use is
located. The manner of execution and content of such Covenants shall
be written in a form that is approved by the City Attorney and the
Covenants must be recorded with the County Recorder or Registrar of
Title for Scott County.
c. The closest point of the off-site parking area shall be located no more
than 500 feet from an entrance to the principal building of the use being
served as measured along an established path of travel between the
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1107/p4
parking lot and such entrance unless shuttle service is provided. If
shuttle service is provided, the location of the parking need not satisfy
any distance requirement.
d. The failure to provide on-site parking shall not result in patrons, visitors or
employees from parking on the public streets, on other private property,
or in private driveways or other areas not expressly set aside for off -street
parking purposes.
e. The off-site parking shall be maintained until on-site parking is provided
or an alternate off-site parking facility which meets the requirements of
this Ordinance has been approved by the Zoning Administrator.
12) Joint Parking Facilities. Off-street parking facilities may be provided
collectively in any Use District for more than one structure or use, if the following
conditions are met:
a. The applicant demonstrates to the Zoning Administrator that, because of
the hours, size and mode of operation of the respective uses, there will
be an adequate amount of parking available to each use during its
primary hours of operation to meet the needs of such use.
b. The joint use of the parking facilities shall be protected by Covenants that
run with the lots housing all the joint users and the lot or lots on which the
parking facility which satisfies the parking requirements of this Ordinance
is provided. Those Covenants shall contain all of the conditions of the
joint agreement and shall grant an easement for parking to the joint
principal use lots. The manner of execution and content of such
Covenants shall be in a form approved by the City Attorney and the
document containing the Covenants shall be recorded with the County
Recorder or the Register of Titles for Scott County. Parties to the
covenant shall reimburse the City for the costs of legal review.
c. Total required parking spaces for the joint use shall be based on the
combined peak requirement and shall not be fewer than the minimum
requirements set forth in this Ordinance for the use which requires the
most parking. Joint parking arrangements shall not qualify for " proof of
parking" reductions.
d. Any change in use or in the conditions of the joint parking agreement
nullifies the joint parking agreement. Any parties to the nullified joint
parking agreement which cannot meet the required parking shall become
illegal uses and shall lose their Certificate of Occupancy.
13) Use of Parking Area. Required off-street parking space and the driveways
providing access to them shall not be utilized for storage, display, sales, rental,
or repair of motor vehicles or any other goods, the storage of inoperable
vehicles, the loading and unloading of vehicles, or the storage of snow.
14) Conversion of Garage Space. No person shall alter a garage to living space in
any " R" Use District, unless other legal provisions are made to provide the
required parking for the lot.
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1107/p5
15) If a single room within a structure contains more than one of the uses listed in

Type B, as defined in Subsection 1107.2005, shall be provided between such
parking lot or paved area and street right-of-way. The width of the driveway at
the property line shall be excluded from the bufferyard requirement.
If there is insufficient space for the required bufferyard between a parking lot or
paved area existing on the effective date of this Ordinance and a public right -ofway,

1107.400: SIGNAGE. FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND INTENT.
Findings. The size, height, location, illumination, distance between, and
proliferation of signs in the City raise constitutional and regulatory challenges for
the City. Signs are one means used to communicate non-commercial and
commercial speech and messages, and therefore are protected under the First
and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. However, the size, height,
location, illumination, and distance between signs creates: hazards by distracting
drivers’ attention from the road; can be an eyesore and impact aesthetics,
property values, and civic pride.
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1107/p18
The City Council finds that it has a legitimate and substantial interest to preserve
and protect the public welfare and safety, and preserve the aesthetic qualities
and characteristics in and of the City. This Ordinance was written to protect the
City and its residents.
The City Council finds it has legitimate and substantial interest in promoting and
protecting the public welfare, and safety of residents and maintaining and
enhancing the aesthetic integrity of the City. While the City believes its interests
in regulating signs are substantial, it also believes the First Amendment is one of
the cornerstones in a vital and relevant democracy and that they have sworn an
oath to defend, protect and preserve the [First Amendment] of the United States.
The provisions of this Ordinance are intended to: (1) Advance the City’s interests
articulated herein, and ( 2) “ Is not more extensive than is necessary to serve
those] interests[s].” The individual provisions are content-neutral and do not
favor commercial speech over non-commercial. During the drafting process,
each provision was evaluated to assure that there are not any restrictions on the
means of speech.
The City Council finds that the regulations in this subsection vary depending on
the Use District where the subject sign will be located. The City Council finds
that the essential characteristics, and activities and character are different
among the “TC”, “C”, “I” and “R” Use Districts. There are substantial differences
between a private residence in the “R” Use District and a manufacturing facility in
the “ I” Use District and these differences support the varying regulations
between Use Districts.
The City Council finds that the regulation of signs imposed in this Sign
Ordinance were evaluated to ensure alternative means, methods and forums of
communication exist to communicate speakers’ message foreclosed by these
sign regulations. These regulations are necessary to achieve the City’s
legitimate and substantial interests. Without these regulations the City will be
unable to protect and preserve the public health, welfare, safety, and aesthetic
qualities in and of the City.
Purpose. The purposes of these sign regulations are to further promote and
protect the following substantial government interests: 1) the effective use of
signs as a means of promotion and communication in Prior Lake; 2) the
aesthetic environment and the City's ability to attract sources of economic
development and growth; 3) pedestrian and traffic safety; 4) potential for the
adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; and 5) fair and
consistent means to enforce these sign restrictions; 6) the number, location,
size, type, illumination and other physical characteristics of signs within the City
in order to promote the public health, safety, general welfare, and property
values; 7) assuring that the public is not endangered, annoyed, or distracted by
the unsafe, disorderly, indiscriminate or unnecessary use of exterior signs.
The City Council finds that these sign regulations do not deny a business or
other entity a reasonable degree of freedom of choice in the design and
placement of signage while at the same time assuring the public is not
endangered, annoyed or distracted by the unsafe, disorderly, indiscriminate or
unnecessary use of exterior signs.

freestanding sign is permitted per street frontage. In the "C -3" Use Districts, the
maximum height shall be six ( 6) feet above the natural grade adjacent to the
sign. In the “ TC”, " C-1", " C-2", and " I-1" Use Districts, the maximum height of
the sign shall be 20 feet and shall be measured perpendicularly from the highest
point of the sign structure to the grade level of the ground directly below that
point or the grade level of the center line of the adjacent street, whichever grade
level is higher. Except in the " C-3" Use Districts, the maximum size of a
freestanding sign shall be 100 square feet per side within a maximum of two (2)
sides. Within the " C-3" Use District, the maximum size of a freestanding sign
shall be 80 square feet per side with a maximum of two ( 2) sides. No
freestanding sign shall extend beyond a property line, or right-of-way line or be
located closer than 40 feet to another freestanding sign. Freestanding signs
must be set back at least 10 feet from the property line, or right -of-way line,
whichever is greater, with the exception of " TC" District where a freestanding
sign may have a zero setback ( setback measurement will be from the part of the
sign closest to the property or right-of-way line.) ( Additional regulations may
apply for specific signs, see Subsection 1107.800)
1107.1000: CALCULATING SIGN AREA: The area of a sign face ( which is also the sign
area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by
drawing a box around the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or
combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing,
representation, emblem or other display, together with any material or color
forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate
the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed. The structural
supports for a sign, whether they be columns, pylons, or a building, or a part
thereof, shall not be included in the calculation of the advertising display area.

1107.1001 Individual Letters: When attached to the surface of a building, canopy, awning,
wall or window, the sign area shall be calculated as that part of the smallest
rectangle or other geometric shape that encompasses all of the letters or
symbols. The sign area shall include all lettering, wording, and accompanying
designs or symbols.
1107.1002 Multi-Faced Signs: The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be
computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one
point. When two (2) identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that neither
face can be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces
are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the
sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
1107.1003 Computation of Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area: The amount of
signage allowed on one property is calculated based on the sum of the sign area
of each individual sign. The allowable sign area for all individual signs on a
property shall be computed by applying the formula contained in Subsections
1107.900 and 1107.1000. Properties fronting on two ( 2) or more streets are
allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage.
1107.1004 Setbacks: Unless noted otherwise in relation to a specific Zoning District or sign
type, all signage shall maintain setback of 10 feet from any property line.

1107.1800: LIGHTING. The purpose of this subsection is to minimize the adverse effect of
light and glare on operators of motor vehicles, pedestrians, and on residential
and other land uses in the vicinity of a light source in order to promote traffic
safety and to prevent the nuisances associated with the intrusion of spillover light
and glare. The requirements of this subsection apply to all exterior lighting
except lighting for signs which is covered under Subsections 1107.400 through
1107.1700, street lighting within public rights- of-way, and one and two family
residential structures. In cases where light spillage to adjacent properties cannot
be determined a photometric plan shall be submitted to the Community
Development & Natural Resources Department for review.
1107.1801 General Provisions.
1) The City shall require submission of a light distribution plan to ensure compliance
with the intent of this Ordinance for all new development, redevelopment and

1107.1900: LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING.
1107.1901 Purpose: The purpose of this subsection is to establish performance standards
and minimum requirements for landscaping, buffering and screening that will
enhance the visual, environmental, and aesthetic character of property and site
development within the City. These standards will be used to review and
evaluate subdivision and site plans and development proposals.
The objectives of these requirements are to establish and maintain forestation of
the City; to provide appropriate ground cover vegetation for controlled soil
erosion; to preserve and enhance, when necessary, the natural environment,
particularly in instances where the natural environment is disturbed during the
course of development; and to establish standards for utilization of natural and
other materials to achieve desired screening, buffering and landscaping.
This subsection sets forth minimum requirements for landscaping and
reforestation and technical limitations to assure that the result is consistent with
reasonable maintenance requirements on a long-term basis and to assure that
the results provide landscape amenities to the urban environment.
This subsection is intended to provide standards that allow flexibility in design
and individual site needs. Designers are encouraged to utilize a variety of site
landscape elements ( i.e., trees, shrubs, ground covers, flowers, berms and
ground form, fences, walls, existing topography and vegetation, art forms and
other similar items), in creative ways that are aesthetically pleasing yet functional
where required.
1107.1902 Plan Review Standard: Plan review by the City will include such items as:
choice of materials, especially plantings, to determine if they are functionally
appropriate for the intended purpose; hardiness; disease-resistance; compatible
choice and mix of materials; whether materials complement and/or provide
pleasing contrast to on-site and off-site conditions to maintain interest; and other
issues as site appropriate. Specific site plans may be required to go beyond the
minimum requirements to meet the purpose and objectives of this subsection
due to unique or exceptional circumstances and conditions which are existing or
proposed.
1107.1903 Application: This subsection applies to all proposed new commercial, industrial,
multi-family residential ( projects of 3 or more dwelling units per building), public
and institutional uses as may be permitted, permitted with conditions or permitted
with conditional use permits within their respective Use Districts. Uses within the
Downtown Redevelopment District as defined in Subsection 1101.400 shall be
exempt from this subsection.
Existing commercial, industrial, multi-family residential ( projects of 3 or more
dwelling units per building), public and institutional uses shall also comply with
this subsection, except as exempted herein, when a building permit is issued for
their expansion. Exceptions include additions in which the ground building
footprints in total are under 10% of the existing structures gross floor area or
4,000 square feet, whichever is less.

1107.2000: BUFFERYARDS
1107.2001 Purpose. This subsection provides the landscaping and width requirements for
bufferyards on lots developed after the effective date of this Ordinance, or for
any use expanded after the effective date of this Ordinance. A bufferyard
combines distance and a visual buffer or barrier to reduce the undesirable
impact of a use on neighboring property. It includes an area, and a combination
of plantings, berms, fences and walls that are required to eliminate or reduce
existing or potential nuisances. These nuisances can occur between adjacent
Use Districts and between different development options within the same Use
District. Such nuisances are dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, signs and
incompatible land uses, buildings or parking areas. Bufferyards will operate to
minimize the negative impact of any use of neighboring property. Plant material
proposed to meet necessary landscaping requirements may also be used toward
meeting the purpose of the bufferyard requirements.
1107.2002 Required Locations For Bufferyards. Bufferyards shall be located along (and
within) the outer perimeter of a lot wherever 2 uses of differing intensity abut one
another. Bufferyards may be located in required yard areas. Bufferyard
plantings or structures shall not be located on any portion of any existing,
dedicated or officially mapped right-of-way. Properties which are located
adjacent to any City boundary are required to provide a bufferyard when the
more intense use is located in Prior Lake.
1107.2003 Determination Of Required Bufferyard. The type of bufferyard required is
determined by first identifying the Use District of the property to be developed,
and then by identifying the Use District of the adjacent property. The table below
specifies the intensity of the required bufferyard.

1107.2004 Additional Bufferyard Requirements. Whenever two uses of differing intensity
are located on either side of an existing public right-of-way, including but not
limited to a railroad right-of-way, the bufferyard requirement shall be 1 letter less
than required by the above table. In such instances, 1/2 the width of the right -ofway
may be counted as contributing to the width requirements for a bufferyard.
Whenever a property is located adjacent to a municipal boundary, a bufferyard is
required if the more intense development is located within Prior Lake.
1107.2005 Identification Of Detailed Bufferyard Requirements. All bufferyards permit a
variety of bufferyard widths, ranging from 10 feet to 30 feet. The number of
plantings required in each bufferyard is specified in the table below.
To calculate the required number of plantings in a bufferyard, determine the type
and width of bufferyard, and apply the following formula:
Number of Canopy Plantings X Linear Distance/100 = Total Canopy Plantings
Number of Ornamental Plantings X Linear Distance/100 = Total Ornamental
Plantings
Number of Shrubs X Linear Distance/100 = Total Shrubs
For example, a Bufferyard C, 15' wide on a 250' lot, will require the following
plantings:
2.0 X 250/100 = 5 Canopy Plantings
4.0 X 250/100 = 10 Ornamental Plantings
6.0 X 250/100 = 15 Shrubs

1107.2007 Party Responsible for Installation of Bufferyard. If a use is proposed which
adjoins or is across the street from an existing use which results in requirements
for a bufferyard that proposed use shall provide said bufferyard.
1107.2008 Exceptions to Bufferyard Requirements. Plant material existing on a parcel
which meets the bufferyard planting requirements for location, size and species
may be counted toward the total bufferyard plant material requirements.
Bufferyard plant materials which are existing on an adjacent developed parcel of
land may be counted toward total plant material requirements if the minimum
bufferyard width is provided and a voluntary agreement with the adjoining
landowner can be negotiated which is consistent with the provisions of this
section.

Ord. Amd. 115-18, publ. 07/04/2015)
1107.2300: NON-CONFORMITIES. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit a
violation of any section of the Prior Lake Code or the continuation of any unsafe
or unsanitary condition.
1107.2301 Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to provide for the elimination of all
nonconforming uses and certain other nonconformities by:
Recognizing certain developments which lawfully existed prior to the
effective date of this Ordinance.
Prohibiting the enlargement, intensification, expansion, rebuilding or
extension of non-conformities.
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1107/p62
Provide criteria which provide for the reconstruction of nonconforming
uses which are damaged by fire or other natural disaster.
Encouraging the elimination of non-conformities or minimize their
impact on adjacent properties.
Requiring certain non-conformities either to comply with the
Ordinance or terminate.
Providing an equitable system for the termination of certain nonconformities.
1107.2302 General Requirements. A legal nonconformity existing at the time of this
Ordinance may be continued except as provided herein:
1) Right to Continue. A legal nonconformity may be continued at the size and the
manner of operation existing at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, except as
provided herein.
2) Expansion Prohibited. A nonconformity shall not be enlarged, extended,
expanded or changed in any manner or dimension except to comply with the
provisions of this Ordinance.
3) Intensification Prohibited. A nonconforming land use shall not be intensified in
character or operation. Intensification shall include, but not be limited to,
increased hours of operation, expansion of the use to a portion of the property
not previously used, expansion of a parking area and increased number of
employees.
4) Damaged or Destroyed Structures. If the cost to repair a non-conformity
involving a damaged structure is more than 50% of the County Assessor’s
market value of the structure at the time of the damage, the structure shall be
removed or made to conform to this Ordinance within 12 months of the
occurrence of the damage.
5) Reduction In Non-Conformity. Any non-conformity which is reduced in size,
intensity or otherwise becomes more conforming may not again expand or
become less conforming. Removal of a structure, relocation, reduction, or
elimination of any site element, such as outdoor storage, is a reduction in
intensity.
6) Conditional Use Permits. The City may not issue a Conditional Use Permit for
any property which contains a non-conformity unless the non-conformity is
removed as a condition of the Conditional Use Permit.
1107.2303 Special Requirements.
1) Non-conforming Land Use.
a. Termination of Rights Through Discontinuation of the Use. If a legal nonconforming
land use terminates operations or use for a period of time
exceeding 6 months or if the land or building is vacant for a period of time
exceeding 6 months, the City may infer an intent to abandon the use and
the non-conforming rights granted by this section are terminated and any
future use of the land must comply fully with this Ordinance.
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1107/p63
As evidence of an intent to discontinue or abandon the operation or use,
the City may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors:
Filing of a petition for tax abatement;
Notice of tax forfeiture;
Disconnection of utilities;
Boarding up and securing of building;
Voluntary destruction of the building or property;
Voluntary change to a conforming land use;
Unpermitted and illegal change from one non-conforming land use to
another;
Change in business practices;
Lease or conveyance of property for a different use, including
sublease of the premises for another non-conforming use or the
same use conducted by another tenant;
Any other factors from which an intent to discontinue or abandon may
be reasonably inferred.
b. Change in Tenant or Ownership. Any change of a tenant or in the
ownership of any land which is classified as a legal non-conforming land
use shall require the new tenant or owner to obtain a Certificate of
Occupancy before the non-conforming use may be continued.
c. Permitted Construction. Construction is permitted on a lot under the
following circumstances:
Where a legal non-conforming land use exists and where the
construction is determined by the Building Official to be necessary to
bring the building into compliance with applicable health and safety
codes.
Where the construction would allow additions and alterations to
buildings containing legal non-conforming residential units provided
they comply with the following:
The construction will not result in an increase in the number of
dwelling units.
The building ( parcel) is not located in an area which the Council
has designated as a high priority for redevelopment according to
an adopted redevelopment strategy or plan. For the purpose of
this section, a redevelopment strategy or plan shall be defined as
a document and/or process which specifically outlines the area to
be redeveloped and may include timeliness and/or action steps to
be taken, or which are being taken, to achieve the redevelopment.
These action steps may include, but are not limited to, solicitation
of developers, the purchase of property, environmental testing or
remediation, demolition of structures and other similar activities.
d. Reduction in Intensity. A non-conforming land use may be changed to a
less intense non-conforming land use subject to approval by the Zoning
Administrator. The property owner or tenant has the burden of providing
evidence that the proposed land use is less intense than the existing nonZoning
Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1107/p64
conforming land use. The Zoning Administrator shall consider the
evidence provided by the property owner or tenant in evaluating relative
intensities, including, but not limited to each of the following factors:
Hours of Operation;
Signage;
Off-street parking and loading;
Nature of business operations;
Type of equipment or machinery;
Outdoor storage;
Number of employees;
Aesthetic impacts on surrounding property;
Property values.
The decision of the Zoning Administrator may be appealed in the manner
set forth in Subsection 1109.300.
2) Nonconforming Structures.
a. Permitted Construction. In the following cases, construction is permitted
on or within a legal non-conforming structure:
Construction which is determined by the Building Official to be
necessary to bring the building into compliance with applicable health
and safety codes.
Construction which does not extend, expand or intensify the nonconformity.
Routine maintenance and non-structural alterations and repairs that
do not extend the useful economic life of the structure.
b. Any single family detached dwelling unit which legally exists on June 1,
2009, the effective date of this Ordinance, on any nonconforming lot
located within the R-1, R-2, or R-3 Use District which is later destroyed by
fire or other natural disaster may be rebuilt if a building permit for
reconstruction is issued within 365 days of its destruction and if it
otherwise conforms with the provisions of this Ordinance. This provision
allows a structure to be rebuilt as long as it meets setback, lot coverage,
impervious surface and other applicable provisions. If the structure does
not meet these standards, a variance will be required.
3) Non-Conformity as a Result of Government Action. If a governmental body
takes land by exercise of its right of eminent domain and by that taking creates a
parcel which does not conform to the width, area, or yard requirements of this
Ordinance, the non-conforming parcel shall become a legal non-conformity and
may be used thereafter only by complying with the provisions of this section,
however, such a legal non-conformity is exempt from the amortization provisions
as contained in this Ordinance. The same non-conforming status of the nonconforming
parcel will result if the governmental body acquired the land by
negotiation rather than by condemnation.
If the owner of a property which becomes a legal non-conformity as the result of
a governmental taking applies for a variance to reinstate the legal status to the
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1107/p65
property, the governmental taking shall constitute a hardship for the purpose of
the variance.
4) Nonconforming Signs. All non-conforming signs must be brought into
compliance with this Ordinance or removed within 1 year from the effective date
of this Ordinance.
5) Nonconforming Parking.
a. Any use on any property which contains a non-conforming parking lot or
paved area shall not be expanded or intensified unless the property is
brought into compliance with the standards contained in Subsection
1107.204. However, all unpaved non-conforming parking lots must be
brought into compliance with Subsection 1107.204 ( 5) within 5 years of
the effective date of this Ordinance. In addition to the other penalties
provided by law the City may withhold a Certificate of Occupancy for any
property not in compliance with this Section.
b. Any land use which does not provide the number of parking spaces
required by Subsection 1107.300 for the amount of parking provided may
remain as a non-conformity; however, the land use may not be expanded
or intensified unless it provides the parking spaces required under this
Ordinance for the expansion or intensification. A use will be considered
to be expanded or intensified if any of the following occur:
The floor area is increased.
The parking requirement is increased.
The building bulk is increased.
c. Land uses with non-conforming parking in terms of numbers of stalls
shall not be required to provide additional parking to bring the use into
compliance if such parking would occupy required yards or buffer yards.
6) Nonconforming Lighting. All site lighting on commercial or industrial properties
which exceeds the maximum allowable light levels at the property line or where
the direct light source is visible from off the site must be modified to comply with
subsection 1107.1800 or be removed from the site within 1 year of the effective
date of this Ordinance.
1107.2304 Appeals. With the exception of Subsection 1107.2303(1d), the provisions of
Subsection 1107.2301 through 1107.2304 inclusive are not subject to appeal to
the City Council.
1107.2305 Nonconforming Use. A Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued for all legal
non-conforming uses of land or uses of buildings created by adoption of this
Ordinance, or in existence at the effective date of this Ordinance. Application for
a Certificate of Occupancy for a non-conforming use shall be filed with the
Zoning Administrator by the owner or lessee of the building or land occupied by
the non-conforming use within 1 year of the effective date of this Ordinance.
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1107/p66
Failure to apply for a Certificate of Occupancy for a non-conforming use or
refusal of the Zoning Administrator to issue a Certificate of Occupancy for a nonconforming
use after an application has been made shall be prima facie
evidence that such use did not lawfully exist at the effective date of this
Ordinance. Issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy shall be subject to any
inspection of the premises the City deems appropriate. The City may impose
conditions consistent with and in furtherance of requirements of the City
Ordinance Code.
Any subsequent change in ownership, lessee, size or manner of operation in a
non-conforming use shall require that a new Certificate of Occupancy for nonconforming
use be issued.

1108.100 STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES GOVERNING CONDITIONAL USE
PERMITS, VARIANCES AND AMENDMENTS. The purpose and intent of this
subsection is to outline the general procedures for the process and review of
applications for Conditional Use Permits, Variances and Amendments to this
Ordinance, the Official Zoning Map and the Comprehensive Plan. This
Section also includes the standards by which these applications should be
reviewed.
1108.200 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
1108.201 Purpose and Intent. This Ordinance identifies certain uses, which because
of their nature, operation and location in relation to other uses require a
Conditional Use Permit. The Conditional Use Permit process regulates the
location, magnitude and design of conditional uses consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan, and the regulations, purposes and procedures of this
Ordinance.
The Conditional Use Permits contain minimum conditions to minimize the
impact of the use on adjacent properties. To achieve this, this Section sets
out the general provisions and criteria applicable to all uses authorized by a
Conditional Use Permit. This subsection also describes the procedures
governing the application and review process. When considering whether to
approve or deny a Conditional Use Permit, the Planning Commission has the
discretion to impose site specific conditions designed to mitigate the potential
impacts on adjacent properties.
1108.202 Standards For Conditional Uses. The Planning Commission shall review all
applications for a Conditional Use Permit and shall make findings with respect
to the following criteria:
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1108/p2
1) The use is consistent with and supportive of the goals and policies of the
Comprehensive Plan.
2) The use will not be detrimental to the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the community as a whole.
3) The use is consistent with the intent and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance
and the Use District in which the Conditional Use is located.
4) The use will not have undue adverse impacts on governmental facilities,
services, or improvements which are either existing or proposed.
5) The use will not have undue adverse impacts on the use and enjoyment of
properties in close proximity to the conditional use.
6) The use is subject to the design and other requirements of site and landscape
plans prepared by or under the direction of a professional landscape architect,
or civil engineer registered in the State of Minnesota, approved by the
Planning Commission and incorporated as part of the conditions imposed on
the use by the Planning Commission.
7) The use is subject to drainage and utility plans prepared by a professional civil
engineer registered in the State of Minnesota which illustrate locations of city
water, city sewer, fire hydrants, manholes, power, telephone and cable lines,
natural gas mains, and other service facilities. The plans shall be included as
part of the conditions set forth in the Conditional Use Permit approved by the
Planning Commission.
8) The use is subject to such other additional conditions which the Planning
Commission may find necessary to protect the general welfare, public safety
and neighborhood character. Such additional conditions may be imposed in
those situations where the other dimensional standards, performance
standards, conditions or requirements in this Ordinance are insufficient to
achieve the objectives contained in Subsection 1108.202. In these
circumstances, the Planning Commission may impose restrictions and
conditions on the Conditional Use Permit which are more stringent than those
set forth in the Ordinance and which are consistent with the general
conditions above. The additional conditions shall be set forth in the
Conditional Use Permit approved by the Planning Commission.
1108.203 Conditional Use Performance Standards in the Shoreland District. In
addition to the standards listed in Subsection 1108.202, the Planning
Commission shall consider the following criteria when evaluating requests for
conditional use permits in the Shoreland District.
1) Evaluation Criteria. A thorough evaluation of the waterbody and the
topographic, vegetation, and solid conditions on the site must be made to
ensure:
The prevention of soil erosion or other possible pollution of public
waters, both during and after construction;
The visibility of structures and other facilities as viewed from public
waters is limited;
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1108/p3
The site is adequate for water supply and on-site sewage treatment;
and
The types, uses, and numbers of watercraft that the project will
generate are compatible in relation to the suitability of public waters to
safely accommodate these watercraft.
2) Conditions Attached To Conditional Use Permits: The Planning
Commission, upon consideration of the criteria listed above and the purposes
of this Section, shall attach such conditions to the issuance of the conditional
use permits as it deems necessary to fulfill the purposes of this Section.
Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Increased setbacks from the ordinary high-water levels;
Limitations on the natural vegetation to be removed or the requirement
that additional vegetation be planted; and
Special provisions for the location, design, and use of structures,
sewage treatment systems, watercraft launching and docking areas,
and vehicle parking areas.
1108.204 Conditional Use Performance Standards in the Flood Plain District. In
addition to the standards listed in Subsections 1108.202 and 1108.203, the
Planning Commission must consider the following criteria when evaluating
requests for conditional use permits in the Flood Plain District.
1) Evaluation Criteria. The Planning Commission shall consider all relevant
factors, including the following:
The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
The danger materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream
to the injury of others, or they may block bridges, culverts or other
hydraulic structures.
The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary
conditions.
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community.
The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location.
The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the
proposed use.
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and
flood plain management program for the area.
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters expected at the site.
Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this Section.
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1108/p4
2) Conditions Attached to Conditional Use Permits: Upon consideration of
the factors listed above and the purpose of this Section, the Planning
Commission shall attach such conditions to the granting of a conditional use
permit as deemed necessary to fulfill the purpose of this Section. Such
conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Modification of waste treatment and water supply facilities.
Limitations on period of use, occupancy and operation.
Imposition of operational controls, sureties and deed restrictions.
Requirements for construction of channel modifications, compensatory
storage, dikes, levees and other protective measures.
Floodproofing measures, in accordance with the State Building Code
and Section 1105. The applicant shall submit a plan or document
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood
protection elevation and associated flood factors for the particular
area.
1108.205 Application for a Conditional Use Permit. An application for a Conditional
Use Permit shall be on a form provided by the City which shall include the
name, address and telephone number of the applicant, the name, address

reasonable conditions on any Conditional Use Permit and may, at any time,
on its own initiative or upon application by the property owner, modify the
conditions of an existing Conditional Use Permit as changing circumstances
warrant. No modification of an existing Conditional Use Permit may be made
until a public hearing has been held by the Planning Commission in the
manner outlined in Subsection 1109.200 except that minor amendments shall
require only notice to the holder of the Conditional Use permit and approval of
the Planning Commission.
1108.208 Minor Amendments. A minor amendment may be granted for proposed
changes or modifications which will not have an effect on required parking,
required yards, floor area ratios, ground floor area ratios, signage, building
height, density, covenants or agreements required by the original Conditional

Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1108/p6
Planning Commission as part of the approval of the Conditional Use Permit.
A certified copy of the resolution shall be filed with the Scott County Recorder
within 60 days of approval of the resolution.
1108.211 Revocation and Cancellation of Conditional Use Permits. A Conditional Use
Permit may be revoked and canceled if the Zoning Administrator determines that
the holder of an existing Conditional Use Permit has violated any of the
conditions or requirements imposed as a condition to approval of the Conditional
Use Permit, or has violated any other applicable laws, ordinances, or
enforceable regulations. The following procedure shall apply to revocations and
cancellations:
1) The Zoning Administrator shall notify the holder in writing of the violation. The

Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1108/p9
1108.303 Certain Conditional Permits Continued. Land uses permitted by Conditional
Use Permits under provisions of the previous Zoning Ordinance are either
permitted, permitted with conditions, conditional uses or non-conforming uses
under the provisions of this Ordinance. This subsection establishes the status
of Conditional Use Permits approved under the previous ordinance based upon
the 4 categories described below and sets forth procedures for the termination
and, in some cases, conversion of Conditional Use Permits.
1) Conditional Use Permit Uses Now Permitted. Conditional Use Permits
issued for land uses which, under the current Ordinance, are now permitted
uses in the Use District in which the property is located are hereby continued in
full force and effect. The owner of property subject to a Continued Conditional
Use Permit may request termination of the Conditional Use Permit by providing
the City with a letter requesting termination. Upon receipt of a letter requesting
termination, the City shall issue a written termination to the applicant which shall
be recorded on the title to the property by the City. The owner of the property
shall sign an assent form provided by the City wherein the owner agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the City for any actions or consequences arising
from termination of the Conditional Use Permit. Upon termination of the
Conditional Use Permit, the land use shall be governed by the regulations of
this Ordinance, and other applicable ordinances. Once a Conditional Use
Permit is declared terminated, it may not be reinstated.
2) Conditional Use Permit Uses Now Permitted With Conditions. Conditional
Use Permits issued for land uses which, under the current Ordinance, are now
uses permitted with conditions in the Use District in which the property is
located are hereby continued in full force and effect. The owner of property
subject to a Continued Conditional Use Permit may request termination of the
Conditional Use Permit by providing the City with a letter requesting termination.
Upon receipt of a letter requesting termination, the City shall issue a written
termination to the applicant which shall be recorded on the title to the property
by the City. The owner of the property shall sign an assent form provided by
the City wherein the owner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the City for
any actions or consequences arising from termination of the Conditional Use
Permit. Upon termination of the Conditional Use Permit, the land use shall be
governed by the regulations of this Ordinance, and other applicable ordinances.
Once a Conditional Use Permit is declared terminated, it may not be reinstated.
3) Conditional Use Permit Uses Now Conditional Uses. Conditional Use
Permits issued for land uses which, under the current Ordinance, also require a
conditional use permit in the Use District in which the property is located, are
hereby continued in full force and effect. The holder of a Continued Conditional
Use Permit may request the City to verify compliance of the property with the
terms and conditions of the Continued Conditional Use Permit. A holder of a
Conditional Use Permit requesting such verification shall submit such plans and
other documentation necessary to demonstrate to the Zoning Administrator that
the property complies with the terms and conditions of the Continued
Conditional Use Permit. Upon a satisfactory demonstration of compliance with
the conditions of the Continued Conditional Use Permit, the Zoning
Administrator shall issue a Certificate of Zoning Compliance stating that the
property complies with the terms and conditions of the Continued Conditional
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1108/p10
Use Permit. The Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall be recorded on the title
of the subject property by the City.
4) Conditional Use Permit Uses Now Non-Conforming Uses. A land use
which was permitted by Conditional Use Permit and which became a nonconforming
land use in the Use District in which it is located when this
Ordinance was adopted shall be a legal non-conforming use subject to the
provision of Section 1107.2300, and the Conditional Use Permit authorizing
the land use is now null and void.
1108.400: Variances To The Provisions Of The Zoning Ordinance. This
Section provides authority for Variances to the literal application of the provisions of
the Zoning Ordinance. Minnesota Statutes 462.357 ( subd. 6, subp. 2) states
variances may be granted when the applicant for the Variance establishes that there
are practical difficulties in complying with the Zoning Ordinance.” When practical
difficulties unique to an individual property would result from strict enforcement of the
literal provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, the owner of the fee title to the property may
apply for a Variance to the provisions of the Ordinance. The Board of Adjustment, or
City Council upon appeal, may approve a Variance if it finds the Variance meets all of
the criteria in Subsection 1108.406, and is not restricted by the limitations in
Subsection 1108.407.
The statutory authority to grant a variance is permissive and not mandatory. Even
when a Variance application meets all of the criteria in Subsection 1108.406 and is not
restricted by the limitations in Subsection 1108.407 the Board of Adjustment, or City
Council, as the case may be, is not required to grant a Variance if doing so would be
inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
Whenever there is reference to a fee anywhere in this Section, the fee refers to the
amount provided for in the Official Fee Schedule adopted annually by the City Council.
1108.401 Applications for Variances. Applications for Variances must be filed with the Zoning
Administrator and must describe the exceptional conditions of the lot and the peculiar
and practical difficulties claimed as a basis for the Variance. The City will not accept a
Variance application if the Zoning Administrator determines the Variance is restricted
by the limitations in Subsection 1108.407.
1108.402 Applications. All Variance applications must be signed by the fee owner(s) of the
property. A complete application consists:
An application on a form provided by the City, signed by the fee owner(s) of
the property as it appears in the records of County Auditor of Scott County.
The application.
A survey of the property showing all property lines, required setbacks,
easements, existing structures, and all proposed structures.
A map or plat showing the lands proposed for Variance and all lands within
350 feet of the boundaries of that property and the names and addresses of
the owners of the lands in the area as they appear on the records of the
County Auditor of Scott County or other appropriate records.
If the Variance application involves a driveway or access to the property, the
property owner(s) and applicant must demonstrate that the Variance, if
granted, will not impair access to other platted lots.
Any other materials required by the City.
Any other materials or information the property owner and applicant believe
support the Variance application and will assist the Board of Adjustment or the
City Council, if there is an appeal, to reach a decision.
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1108/p11
1108.403 Board of Adjustment Decides Variances. All Variance applications are considered
and decided by the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment shall consider the
effect of the strict application of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance on the
applicant’s property and the impact granting the Variance will have Comprehensive
Plan. In addition the Board of Adjustment shall consider the requirements of all other
applicable State Statutes, the information in the application, the information in the Staff
Report and the criteria set out in Subsection 1108.406. The Board of Adjustment shall
make specific findings relating to each of the criteria in Subsection 1108.406 to
support its decision.
1108.404 Notice of Hearing. After receipt of a complete application, the Zoning Administrator
shall set a date and publish notice of a public hearing before the Board of Adjustment.
The public hearing must occur within 30 days after receipt of a complete application.
The public hearing shall be held only after the notice required by subsection 1109.200
has been given.
1108.405 Public Hearings on Variance Applications. The Board of Adjustment shall hold a
public hearing in accordance with Subsection 1109.200 to hear arguments for and
against the proposed Variance. The Board of Adjustment may continue the hearing
from time to time if a continued hearing is reasonably required. Final action on the
proposed Variance must occur within 60 days from the date the complete application
was received by the City, unless the City notifies the applicant in writing that it intends
to extend the decision deadline by an additional 60 days. The written notice must
state the reason the City is extending the decision deadline.
1108.406 Decision on Variance. The Board of Adjustment, or City Council upon appeal, may
grant a Variance from the strict application of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance,
if it finds all of the following criteria are satisfied:
1) There are practical difficulties in complying with the strict terms of the Ordinance.
Practical difficulties,” as used in connection with the granting of a Variance, means
the property owner proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner not permitted
by the Zoning Ordinance. Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical
difficulties.
2) The granting of the Variance is in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the
City Subdivision and Zoning Ordinances and the Comprehensive Plan.
3) The practical difficulty is due to circumstances unique to the property not resulting
from actions of the owners of the property and is not a mere convenience to the
property owner and applicant.
4) The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood
or be detrimental to the health and safety of the public welfare.
5) The granting of the Variance will not result in allowing any use of the property that is
not permitted in the zoning district where the subject property is located.
Ord. Amend. 114-01, publ. 1/18/14)
1108.407 Limitations. No application for a Variance shall be accepted, and no Variance shall
be granted by the City for any of the following:
Land uses not specifically listed within a Use District.
Floor elevations lower than the Flood Protection Elevation, or levels of flood
protection required in the Flood Plain District.
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1108/p12
1108.408 Conditions and Modifications. In granting a variance, the Board of Adjustment may
impose such reasonable and appropriate conditions and safeguards as may be
necessary to accomplish, to the extent possible under the circumstances, the
purposes of the regulations or provisions which are to be varied or modified and to
ensure compliance and protect adjacent properties, the character of the neighborhood,
and the health, safety, or general welfare of the community. Any conditions must be
directly related to and must bear a rough proportionality to the impact created by the
Variance. A Variance and any conditions and safeguards which were made a part of
the terms under which the Variance was granted are binding upon the
applicant/ property owner and any subsequent purchaser, heir, or assign of the
property. Any violation of the Variance or its conditions and safeguards shall be a
violation of this Ordinance, shall nullify the Variance and be subject to prosecution as a
misdemeanor.
1108.409 Appeals to the City Council. Any aggrieved person situated wholly or partly within
350 feet of the affected property, any officer or department representative of the City,
any agency of the State with an interest in the property, or a Watershed District or
Water Management Organization with jurisdiction may appeal the decision of the
Board of Adjustment to the City Council pursuant to subsection 1109.400. A decision
of the Board of Adjustment shall not become effective until the end of the appeal
period has expired. If a timely appeal is filed, the decision of the Board of Adjustment
shall not become effective until the City Council has rendered a decision on the
appeal.
1108.410 Payment of Fees. No application for a Variance, appeal from the decision of the
Board of Adjustment on a Variance decision, or application for an extension of a
Variance will be considered until the applicable fees have been paid.
1108.411 Assent Form. No Variance which is approved subject to conditions is valid until the
property owner and applicant for the Variance have signed an Assent and Consent
form and the approved exhibits agreeing to the terms and conditions applicable to the
Variance.
1108.412 Variance Must be Recorded. The resolution approving a Variance shall include the
legal description of the property and a list of any conditions imposed by the Board of
Adjustment. A certified copy of the resolution shall be filed with the Scott County
Recorder and evidence of recording provided to the Zoning Administrator.
1108.413 Revocation and Cancellation of a Variance. A Variance may be revoked and
canceled if the Zoning Administrator determines the property has been used in a
manner that violates any of the conditions or requirements imposed as a condition to
approval of the Variance, or has violated any other applicable laws, ordinances, or
enforceable regulation. The following procedures shall apply to revocations and
cancellations:
1) The Zoning Administrator shall provide written notice of the violation to the property
owner and person(s) whose name(s) appeared on the original application for the

the passage of time and without any action by the City, if 1 year has elapsed from the
date of the adoption of the resolution granting the Variance if there is no evidence that
substantial use or progress has occurred on the property or premise subject to the
approved Variance.
1108.415 Expiration of Variances. The 1 year period used in this Ordinance to compute time
to determine whether a Variance has been canceled or revoked shall begin with the

following policies:
1) In the case of amendments to the Official Zoning Map filed by formal petition:
The area, as presently zoned, is inconsistent with the policies and
goals of the Comprehensive Plan, or the land was originally zoned

The area for which rezoning is requested has changed or is changing
to such a degree that it is in the public interest to rezone so as to
encourage redevelopment of the area, or

appropriate on the subject property and compatible with adjacent
properties and the neighborhood.
2) In the case of amendments to the formal text of this Ordinance:

City of Prior Lake
1108/p16
There is a public need for the amendment, or
The amendment will accomplish one or more of the purposes of this
Ordinance, the Comprehensive Plan or other adopted plans or policies
of the City, or
The adoption of the amendment is consistent with State and/or federal
requirements.
1108.700: SPECIAL PROCEDURE FOR COMPREHENSIVE REZONING. Whenever
the Planning Commission, in its capacity or acting on referral from the City
Council, recommends a comprehensive rezoning of a substantial part of the
City which consists of not less than 50 lots in a platted area or 5 acres of
unplatted area in order to conform to changing conditions, the City Council
may make all or part of that recommendation effective by amendment to this
Ordinance. In such a case, the provisions of subsection 1108.500 shall not
be applicable; but the procedure for such amendment shall be as provided in
subsection 1108.701 through 1108.705 below.
1108.701 Maps. A map shall be prepared and filed in the Community Development and
Natural Resources Department which shows all streets and lands in the area
proposed to be rezoned in sufficient detail to permit each platted lot and each
parcel of ground to be identified by the Use District classification assigned
and all Zoning regulations which will be applicable to them if the proposed
amendment for rezoning is adopted.
1108.702 Planning Commission Hearing. The Planning Commission shall hold one
public hearing in a manner described in Subsection 1109.200 prior to making
a recommendation for a Comprehensive Rezoning to the City Council.
1108.703 Notice. Notice of the public hearing on the proposed rezoning amendment
shall be published in at least 3 weekly issues of the official newspaper. The
hearing shall be held not less than 9 or more than 24 days after the last
publication.
1108.704 Adoption. The City Council shall act upon the proposed rezoning within 60 days
after the Council has received the Planning Commission recommendation. A
majority vote of all members of the Council shall be required to adopt any
amendments to the Zoning Ordinance. The adoption or amendment of any part
of the Zoning Ordinance that changes all or part of the existing classification of a
Zoning Use District from residential to either commercial or industrial requires a
2/3rds majority vote of all of the members of the City Council. The City Council
may alter the amendment proposed, but if the alteration results in a modification
of the Zoning Map filed at the time of the first publication of notice of the hearing,
it shall not be made until 10 days after notice has been given by registered mail
to the owner of the property to be zoned that an amendment is being considered
and may be adopted which is different from that shown on the original Zoning
Map filed in support of the requested zoning change.
1108.705 Publication. If an ordinance is adopted which provides for comprehensive
rezoning even though less than the entire City is affected, the City Council shall
require that new zoning maps be prepared showing the Use District boundaries
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1108/p17
after adoption of the comprehensive amendment. Those maps shall be
published as part of the publication of the amendment. The adopted ordinance
need not describe the tracts of land included in each Use District in any way
other than by reference to the zoning maps required by this subsection.
1108.800 PROCEDURE FOR COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AMENDMENTS.
1108.801 Purpose and Intent. The Comprehensive Plan is a compilation of policy
statements, goals, standards and maps for guiding the physical, social and
economic development, both private and public, of the City of Prior Lake. The
Comprehensive Plan includes goals, policies and standards, a land use plan, a
community facilities plan, a transportation plan and recommendations for plan
execution, and is an adopted statement of City policy concerning development.
The Zoning Ordinance is adopted for the purpose of carrying out the policies and
goals of the land use plan. However, any amendment to the formal text of the
Zoning Ordinance or the Official Zoning Map which is inconsistent with the
Comprehensive Plan shall not be invalidated as a result of the inconsistency.
The City may, either by its own initiative or by petition of a property owner,
consider amendments to the formal text of the Comprehensive Plan or to the
Comprehensive Plan Land Use Map. This subsection outlines the procedures
for consideration of these amendments.
1108.802 Application. Any person requesting a change in the Comprehensive Plan shall
submit an application in the form prescribed by the City. The application shall
describe the change requested, state the reasons for the requested change, and
attach documentation to support the request. The applicant shall pay a fee
established by the City Council when the application is filed with the Community

1108.1000 INTERIM USE PERMIT.
1108.1001 Purpose and Intent. Certain uses, while generally not suitable in a particular
Zoning District, may, under certain circumstances be acceptable for a
prescribed period of time. An Interim Use is a temporary use of property until
a particular date, until the occurrence of a particular event or until the zoning
regulations no longer permit it. An Interim Use may never become a Use that
is permitted, permitted with conditions or allowed by conditional use permit
unless a Use District in the Zoning Ordinance is amended, following the
procedure set out in Section 1108.500, by a 4/5ths vote of the City Council to
add the Use.
1108.1002 Process. Two steps must occur before an Interim Use can occupy a
property. The first step requires the City Council to designate a particular Use
allowable in a specified Use District as an Interim Use. The second step
requires the application for and approval of an Interim Use Permit.
1) Designation of Interim Use. An Interim Use may be designated by the
City Council in the same manner as a Zoning Ordinance Amendment.
2) Application for Interim Use Permit. The procedures for applying for an
Interim Use Permit, the required exhibits, and the criteria for granting
an Interim Use shall follow the process for Conditional Use Permits, as
set out in Section 1108.200.
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1108/p21
3) Limited Application. Interim Uses shall only be allowed in
extraordinary circumstances and in response to a need that benefits
the overall community. The issuance of an Interim Use Permit does
not confer upon the property owner and vested right.
4) Permit. The City Council may grant an Interim Use Permit for the
interim use of property if:
The use conforms to (is allowed in) the zoning district;
The date or event that will terminate the use can be identified with
certainty;
Permitting the use will not impose additional costs on the city if it is
necessary for the city to take the property in the future; and
The permittee agrees in writing to any conditions that the city
council deems appropriate for permission of the use.
5) Assent Form. An Interim Use Permit requires the applicant to sign an
assent form and any approved exhibits which acknowledge the terms
and conditions under which the Interim Use Permit is granted. The
applicant thereby agrees to observe and be bond by the terms and
conditions set forth.
6) Permit Termination. An Interim Use Permit shall expire or be
terminated by:
A change in zoning regulations, which prohibits the use.
The date of event(s) stated in the permit.
Upon a violation of any condition under which the permit was
issued.
7) Permit Review. An Interim Use Permit must be reviewed annually by
staff, but may be reviewed at any time if the Council is of the opinion
that the terms and conditions of the permit have been violated or if one
1) of the criteria for termination has been met.
8) Permit Extension. The City Council shall have the right to extend the
termination date for such additional periods as are consistent with the
terms and conditions of the original permit, but in no event beyond ten
10) years.

1109.1002 Reimbursement for City Costs. The purpose of this subsection is to provide a
procedure to reimburse the City for its costs of review, analysis, and evaluation of
development proposals, conditional use permits, comprehensive plan
amendments, zoning amendments and enforcement of this Ordinance in cases
where, due to the level of complexity of the application under consideration,
excessive costs beyond those normally incurred by the City as a result of the
administration of this Ordinance are incurred. The excess costs result from
problems presented in review, analysis, and evaluation which necessitate
intensive investigation and research. The intent of this subsection is to insure an
adequate level of review of these cases and to insure that the adverse effects of
development on the City are minimized and that compliance with goals and
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan and this Ordinance are obtained.
1109.1003 Conditions Where Reimbursement is Authorized. The City may, in its sole
discretion, require reimbursement of City costs under the following conditions:
1) When the City Manager finds multiple Planning Commission and City Council
meetings are required to review a particular item and additional staff time is
expended subsequent to the initial meeting.
2) When the City Manager finds it necessary to retain consultants and experts to
review requests and advise its staff of specific impacts of a proposal, including
but not limited to impacts on traffic, utilities, drainage, and aesthetic or
environmental characteristics of the community.
3) When it is necessary for the City Attorney to review a proposal.
4) When the City Manager finds that other extraordinary costs are incurred by the
City as a result of the administration of this Ordinance.
1109.1004 Procedure for Reimbursement. The City shall notify the applicant at the
earliest possible time that the City will incur additional costs and, if possible,
provide the applicant with an estimate of the expected additional cost.
The applicant shall pay the estimated additional cost to the City by certified check
or bank money order. If the amount paid to the City initially is insufficient to cover
all City costs, the additional amounts shall be billed to the applicant. Any money
which has not been used to pay additional costs after the applicant's request has
been processed shall be refunded to the applicant.
No Certificate of Occupancy for any project subject to this subsection shall be
issued until all money owing to the City has been received. All costs billed under
this subsection shall be based on the actual cost to the City of staff time,
overhead, material costs, and actual billings from consultants, experts and
attorneys.
1109.1005 Refund of Fees. If any application for a Conditional Use Permit, Variance,
Appeal or Amendment to the Zoning Ordinance, the Official Map or the
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake

the application is withdrawn prior to the publication of the notice of the public
hearing.

businesses while protecting the public health, safety and general welfare of the
community, the City Council finds these regulations are necessary to:
1) Maximize the use of existing and approved towers and buildings to
accommodate new equipment in order to reduce the number of new
towers necessary to serve the community.

applicable code requirements to avoid potential damage to adjacent
properties from failure of the tower through structural standards and
setback requirements.
3) Require tower equipment to be screened from the view of persons located on
properties contiguous to the site and/or to be camouflaged in a manner
to complement existing structures to minimize adverse visual effects of
towers.
1110.200 DEFINITIONS

1110.400 BUILDING PERMIT REQUIRED. No tower or equipment shall be constructed,
altered or expanded without first obtaining a building permit.

Districts subject to the conditions of this Section:
1110.600 HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS:
1110.601 Height Determination. The height of towers shall be determined by measuring
the vertical distance from the tower's point of contact with the ground or rooftop
to the highest point of the tower, including all equipment. When towers are
mounted upon other structures, the combined height of the structure at the
tower's point of attachment and tower must meet the height restriction of this

70 feet, provided that such height is technically necessary to receive and
broadcast amateur radio signals. Subject to approval of a Conditional Use
Permit, the Planning Commission may permit heights above the 70 foot
height limitation if deemed necessary to permit reasonable use of an FCC
license.
2) Conditional Use Permit. Subject to approval of a Conditional Use Permit,
the Planning Commission may permit heights in excess of those set forth in
subsection 1110.602 upon determining that the proposed height is

within a side yard abutting a local street.
6) Subject to approval of a Conditional Use Permit, the Planning Commission
may permit reduction of a tower's setback or variation of a tower’s location to
allow the integration of a tower into an existing or proposed structure such as
a church steeple, light pole, power line support device, or similar structure.
1110.800 Lighting: Towers shall not be illuminated by artificial means and shall not
display strobe lights unless such lighting is specifically required by the Federal
Aviation Administration or other federal or state authority for a particular tower.
When incorporated into the approved design of the tower for camouflage
purposes, light fixtures used to illuminate parking lots or other similar areas may
be attached to the tower.
1110.900 Signs And Advertising: No sign, advertising or identification of any kind

authorities.
2) Towers shall be of a monopole design. Alternative designs which would
better blend into the surrounding environment may be approved by the
Planning Commission through a Conditional Use Permit.

any property in a Residential Use District.
1110.1100 Accessory Equipment Shelters: Equipment shelters are permitted as an
accessory use to a tower subject to the following regulations:
1) An equipment shelter shall not exceed 336 square feet in area.
Zoning Ordinance

property values, the location and placement of an equipment shelter shall be
subject to site plan review. The site plan must receive approval of the
Community and Economic Development Director, the City Engineer and the
Building Official.
1110.1200 Abandoned Or Unused Towers Or Portions Of Towers: Abandoned or
unused towers or equipment or portions thereof shall be removed as follows:
1) All abandoned or unused towers and equipment shall be removed within 12

to remove the tower and equipment upon cessation of operations at the site
shall be submitted at the time of application for a building permit. In the
event a tower or equipment is not removed within 12 months of the cessation
of operations at the site, the tower and equipment may be removed by the
City and the costs of removal may be assessed to the property owner.
2) After the tower and/or equipment are removed, the site shall be restored to
its original or an improved state.
1110.1300 Co-Location: All towers shall comply with the following requirements:
1) A new tower will not be approved unless the applicant demonstrates that the
equipment cannot be accommodated on an existing tower or that a good
faith effort to co-locate on existing towers was made, but an agreement could
not be reached.
2) All towers shall be designed and constructed to accommodate future colocation
of equipment unless the applicant demonstrates that such design or
construction is impractical. The applicant shall state in its application that it
shall use good faith efforts to permit co-location provided the additional user
agrees to reasonable terms and the additional equipment will not have a
demonstrable negative impact on structural integrity or service.
1110.1400 Exceptions: The regulations in this Section 1110 shall not apply to public safety
towers.

1111.100: Purpose, Intent and Findings
1111.200: Definitions
1111.300: Uses Permitted with Conditions
1111.100 PURPOSE, INTENT AND FINDINGS
1111.101 Purpose and Intent. In order to protect the City's community image, property
values, public health, safety, welfare and business environment, the City has
found it necessary to restrict which businesses may be located within the City,
and to regulate certain businesses. Only those businesses with potential
secondary impacts on neighboring properties and the City are intended to be
regulated. This Section is not intended to restrict or regulate art.
1111.102 Findings.
1) The City of Prior Lake has reviewed a report entitled " Report of the Attorney
General's Working Group on Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses" dated
June 6, 1989, prepared by Hubert H. Humphrey III, Attorney General of the State
of Minnesota; the Olmsted County Planning Department " Adult Entertainment
Report" dated March 2, 1988; and " A 40-acre Study" prepared by the St. Paul
Division of Planning in 1987, all of which reports are hereafter collectively
referred to as " Reports". The Reports considered evidence from studies
conducted in Minneapolis and St. Paul and in other cities throughout the country
relating to sexually-oriented businesses.
2) The Attorney General's Report, based upon the above referenced studies and
the testimony presented to it has concluded " that sexually oriented businesses
are associated with high crime rates and depression of property values." In
addition, the Attorney General's Working Group "... heard testimony that the
character of a neighborhood can dramatically change when there is a
concentration of sexually- oriented businesses adjacent to residential property."
The report concludes that:
a. Adult uses have an impact on the neighborhoods surrounding them which
is distinct from the impact caused by other commercial uses;
b. Residential neighborhoods located within close proximity to adult
theaters, bookstores, and other sexually-oriented businesses experience
increased crime rates (sex-related crimes in particular), lowered property values,
increased transiency, and decreased stability of ownership;
c. The adverse impacts which sexually- oriented businesses have on
surrounding areas diminish as the distance from the sexually- oriented use
increases;
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1111/p2
d. Studies of other cities have shown that among the crimes which tend to
increase either within or in the near vicinity of sexually- oriented uses are rapes,
prostitution, child molestation, indecent exposure, and other lewd and lascivious
behavior;
e. The City of Phoenix, Arizona study confirmed that the sex crime rate was
on the average 500 percent higher in areas with sexually-oriented businesses.
f. Many members of the public perceive areas within which adult uses are
located as less safe than other areas which do not have such uses;
g. Studies of other cities have shown that the values of both commercial
and residential properties either are diminished or fail to appreciate at the rate of
other comparable properties when located in proximity to adult uses; and
h. The Indianapolis, Indiana, study established that professional real estate
appraisers believe that a sexually- oriented business would have a negative effect
on the value of both residential and commercial properties within a 1 to 3 block
area of the use.
3) The Prior Lake City Council finds that characteristics of Prior Lake are similar to
those of the cities cited by the Reports when considering the effects of sexuallyoriented
uses. Based on these Reports, the City Council finds that adult uses
can cause or are associated with adverse secondary effects upon pre-existing
land uses.
In City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 51, 106 S. Ct.
925, 931, 89 L.Ed.2d 29 (1986), the United States Supreme Court found
that a city may rely on the experience of other cities to determine whether
certain businesses have adverse secondary effects.
In ILO Investments, Inc., 25 F3d 1413 ( 8th Cir. 1994), the Court found
that it was permissible for the City of Rochester to rely on studies
conducted in Indianapolis, St. Paul and Phoenix.
4) The Prior Lake City Council finds, based upon the Reports and studies cited
therein, that sexually-oriented businesses may result in secondary effects upon
certain pre-existing land uses within the City.
5) The Prior Lake City Council finds the risk of public health and safety problems
can be significantly reduced by careful regulation of sexually-oriented
businesses.

SECTION 1112
OFFICIAL MAPS
SUBSECTIONS
1112.100: Purpose
1112.200: Official Map Defined
1112.300: Initiation of Proceedings
1112.400: Preparation and Filing of Maps
1112.500: Effect
1112.100 PURPOSE. Land that is needed for future street purposes and as sites for other
necessary public facilities and services is frequently diverted to nonpublic uses
which would have been located on other lands without hardship or inconvenience
to the owners. When this happens, public uses of land may be denied or may be
denied or may be obtained only at prohibitive cost or at the expense of
dislocating the owners and occupants of the land. Identification on an official
map of land needed for future public uses permits both the public and private
property owners to adjust their building plans equitably and conveniently before
investments are made which will make such adjustments difficult to accomplish.
It is the purpose of this article to provide a uniform procedure for the proper use
of official maps as authorized by the Minnesota Municipal Planning Act,
Minnesota Statutes, sections 462.351 to 462.36.
1112.200 OFFICIAL MAP DEFINED. “ Official Map,” as used in this article, means a map
adopted in accordance with this article and with Minnesota Statutes Subd.
462.359 which may show existing and proposed future streets, roads and
highways. An official map may also show the location of existing and future
public land and facilities within the city. An official map my cover the entire city
or any portion of the city.
1112.300 INITIATION OF PROCEEDINGS. Proceedings for adoption, amendment, or
repeal of an official map or any part thereof may be initiated by:
1) A recommendation of the Planning Commission; or
2) Action by the City Council on its own initiative, recommendation of an advisory
commission, or request of an outside governmental body.
1112.301 Sketch Maps and Reports. Every proposal or request for an official map or its
amendment or repeal, however initiated, shall be accompanied by a sketch map
or plat showing the lands proposed to be included and the public purpose to be
served.
1112.302 Reference to Planning Commission. Except when proceedings have been
initiated by recommendation of the Planning Commission, every proposed official
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1112/p2
map or change in a map shall be referred to the Planning Commission for advise
and recommendation thereon, and such recommendation shall be submitted to
the City Council within 45 days after reference to the Planning Commission along
with the report of the Commission on the effect of the proposal on the
comprehensive plan of the city. If no recommendation is received by the Council
or the Planning Commission within 45 days after reference of the proposal to the
Commission by the Council, the Council may take such action as it may deem
proper upon the proposal without further action by the Planning Commission.
1112.303 Notice and Hearing.
1) Notice. Upon receiving the recommendation of the Planning Commission or
after 45 days from the submission of the proposal to the Planning Commission
without a recommendation from the Commission, the Council may call a public
hearing on the proposal. A notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing
and a description of the property to be included in the mapped streets and public
grounds shall be published in the official newspaper at least 10 days prior to the
date of the hearing. At least 10 days prior to the hearing the clerk shall also mail
a copy of the notice to each owner of land situated within or abutting any street
or other public ground shown on the official map. For purposes of this notice,
the owners shall be determined by the records of the county auditor and the
notice shall be addressed to the last known address as shown by the auditor’s
records. Failure to serve any such notice shall not invalidate the proceedings.
2) Hearing. At the time and place specified in the notice, the Council shall hear
evidence and arguments concerning the proposal. The hearing may be
continued, from time to time without further notices. The Council may direct the
Planning Commission to conduct a hearing and following the hearing to report its
recommendation to the Council.
1112.400 PREPARATION AND FILING OF MAPS. The official map or maps shall be
prepared in sufficient detail to permit the establishment of future acquisition lines
on the ground. In unplatted areas a minimum of a centerline survey shall be
made prior to the preparation of the final draft of the official map. After
enactment of any ordinance adopting an official map or amending or repealing a
pervious office map ordinance, a certified copy of the official map or section to
which the ordinance relates together with an attached copy of the ordinance shall
be filed with the county recorder.
1112.500 EFFECT. After an official map has been adopted and filed, the issuance of
building permits by the City shall be subject to the provisions of this article. The
City shall deny every application for a permit to construct a new building or
structure or expand an existing building or structure within an area designated on
the official map for street or other public purposes. Whenever any street or
highway is widened or improved or any new street is opened, or any interest in
lands for other public purposes is acquired by the City, the City is not required in
such proceedings to pay for any building or structure placed without a permit or
in violation of conditions of a permit within the limits of the mapped street or
outside of any building line that may have been established upon the existing
Zoning Ordinance
City of Prior Lake
1112/p3
street or within any area thus identified for public purposes. The adoption of an
official map does not give the City any right, title or interest in areas identified for
public purposes thereon, but the adoption of the map does authorize the City to
acquire such interest without paying compensation for buildings or structures
erected in such areas without a permit or in violation of the conditions of a
permit.
1112.501 Appeals.
1) Whenever a building permit is denied pursuant to this article, the Board of
Appeals and Adjustments shall, upon appeal filed with it by the owner of the
land, grant a permit for building in an area designated on the official map for a
street or other public purpose in any case in which the Board finds, upon the
evidence and the arguments presented to it:
a. That the entire property of the appellant of which the area designated for
public purposes forms a part cannot yield a reasonable return to the
owner unless such a permit is granted, or
b. That, balancing the interest of the City in preserving the integrity of the
official map and the Comprehensive City Plan and the interest of the
property owner in the use of his property and in the benefits of ownership,
the grant of such permit is required by considerations of justice and
equity.
2) The Board of Appeals and Adjustments shall hold a public hearing upon the
appeal after notice of the hearing has been published on the official newspaper
once at least ten (10) days before the hearing. If the Board authorizes issuance
of a permit, it shall specify the exact location, ground area, height and other
details as to the extent and character of the building for which the permit is
granted. If the Board authorizes issuance of a permit, the Council or other board
or commission having jurisdiction shall have six (6) months form the date of the
decision of the board to institute proceedings to acquire such land or interest
therein, and if no such proceedings are started within that time, the city shall
issue the permit if the application otherwise conforms to local ordinances.

additional 6 months and no additional fee shall be collected for the renewal. This
clause does not apply to temporary or conditional sign permits.
