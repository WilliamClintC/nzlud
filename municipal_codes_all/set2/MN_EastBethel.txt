PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of East Bethel, Minnesota. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Beth Tattershall, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Douglas Sell, City Administrator and Wendy Warren, Deputy City Clerk and the other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 1-12. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made by the supplement in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete; and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by their omission from reprinted pages.

The inserted section numbers will indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code; and

Sec. 1-13. - Severability of parts of Code. 
    It is declared to be the intention of the city council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, and phrases of this Code are severable; and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph, or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional, invalid, or unenforceable, such unconstitutionality, invalidity, or unenforceability shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, and sections of this Code. 
Sec. 1-14. - General penalty. 
(a)  Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the city any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful, an offense, or a misdemeanor, or whenever in such Code or ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is provided, the violation of any such provision of this Code or city ordinance shall be punished as a misdemeanor, as defined at the time by state statutes, unless otherwise provided in this Code. The term "misdemeanor" shall be as defined in Minn. Stats. § 609.02. Each day any violation of any provision of this Code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. 
(b)  Whenever an act or omission is declared by this Code to be a petty offense or a petty misdemeanor, any person violating the provision shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine as defined at the time by Minn. Stats. § 609.02. 
(c)  If the city council amends any section of this Code for which a penalty is not provided, the general penalty as provided in subsection (a) of this section shall apply to the section, as amended; or if such amendment contains provisions for which a specified penalty other than the general penalty is provided in another section in the same chapter, the penalty so specified shall be held to relate to the amended section, unless such penalty is specifically repealed.

Every application for a license to sell 3.2 percent malt liquor shall be made on a form supplied by the city and shall state the name of the applicant, his age, representations as to his character with such references as may be required, his citizenship, whether the application is for "on sale" or "off sale," the business in connection with which the proposed license will operate and its location, whether the applicant is the owner and operator of the business, how long he has been in that business at that place, and such other information as the city council may require from time to time. It shall be unlawful to make any false statement in an application. Applications shall be filed with the city clerk-treasurer. 
(b)  Proof of financial responsibility. Prior to the issuance of a 3.2 percent malt liquor license, the applicant shall demonstrate proof of financial responsibility as defined in Minn. Stats. § 340A.409, with reference to liability under the Minn. Stats. § 340A.801. Such proof shall be filed with the state commissioner of public safety, except that if a license involves sales of 3.2 percent malt liquor of a prospective vendor who is not required by law to file such proof with the commissioner of public safety, such proof shall be filed with the city clerk-treasurer. Any liability insurance policy filed as proof of financial responsibility under this subsection shall conform to state law. 
(c)  Exemptions. If the applicant claims 3.2 percent malt liquor sales of under $10,000.00, then such proof of financial responsibility shall not be required if the applicant complies with the following conditions of exemption from proof of financial responsibility: 
(1)  The applicant furnishes a written commitment to cease sale of 3.2 percent malt liquor at that point in the license year when retail sales of 3.2 percent malt liquor reach $9,950.00;

(c)  Fees for both "on sale" and "off sale" licenses shall be as established from time to time by city council resolution and kept on file in the city clerk-treasurer's office. 
(d)  No part of the fee paid for the license issued under this article shall be refunded except in the following instances upon application to the city council within 90 days from the happening of the event. There shall be refunded a pro rata portion of the fee for the unexpired period of the license, computed on a monthly basis, when operation of the licensed business ceases not less than one month before expiration of the license because of: 
(1)  Destruction or damage of the licensed premises by fire or other catastrophe that the licensee shall cease to carry on the licensed business; 
(2)  The licensee's death; 
(3)  A change in the legal status of the city making it unlawful for the licensed business to continue the business ceases to be lawful for a reason other than a license revocation; or 
(4)  The licensee ceases to carry on the licensed business under the license.

(a)  A court of proper jurisdiction may issue a summons directed to the owner or custodian of a dog commanding him to appear before the court to show cause why the dog should not be seized and destroyed by the police or any agent of the city, or otherwise disposed of in the manner authorized in this article upon sworn complaint being made to the court that any one of the following facts exist:

DIVISION 2. - KENNELS 

Sec. 10-54. - Kennel license. 
(a)  The maximum number of dogs allowed without a kennel license is two. The maximum number of dogs allowed with a private kennel license is to be determined by the number of acres: 
(1)  Greater than 2.5 acres but less than three acres: three dogs. 
(2)  Three acres or more but less than five acres: four dogs. 
(3)  Five acres or more but less than ten acres: six dogs. 
(4)  Ten acres or more: maximum ten dogs. 
(b)  No private kennel licenses shall be issued on parcels of 21/2 acres or less. No commercial kennel licenses shall be issued in zoning districts other than commercial and industrial districts. The city shall not approve variances to allow private kennel licenses on parcels of less than 21/2 acres, and shall not approve variances or other zoning devices to allow commercial kennel licenses in zones other than commercial and industrial districts. 
(c)  No person shall maintain a private or commercial kennel in the city without securing a license therefor from the city council. The fee for the license shall be as established by resolution of the city council. 
(d)  Prior to issuance of a private kennel license from the city council, a hearing before the planning and zoning commission must be held. Notice must be given to all affected property owners within one-quarter mile of the outside dimensions of the parcel where the kennel is contemplated. The planning and zoning commission will make a recommendation to the city council on the request. 
(e)  Prior to issuance of a commercial kennel license from the city council, a hearing before the planning and zoning commission requesting an interim use permit must be held. Notice must be given to all affected property owners within 500 feet of the outside dimensions of the parcel where the kennel is contemplated, and published in the city's official newspaper at least ten days before the public hearing. The planning and zoning commission will make a recommendation to the city council on the request. 
(f)  Private kennel licenses do not confer any property rights upon the licensee, and the issuance of said licenses does not assume that future licenses will be granted. Licensees will need to independently assess whether any improvements made in relation to city requirements will be amortized during the initial time period of the license. Licenses will be issued for a set number of dogs, which shall not be exceeded. Licensees who wish to add a dog need to reapply for a private kennel license. Licensees who relocate to another area of the city need to reapply for a private kennel license. Licenses are not assignable to other parties. 
(g)  The initial term for a private kennel license shall be one year; subsequent licenses, if so granted, will be for a term of up to three years. 
(h)  Licensees authorize city staff to perform periodic, random inspections of the kennel for the purpose of determining compliance with the conditions of their license. 
(i)  No party, person, corporation, or other entity will be allowed more than one private kennel license. 
(j)  Kennel licenses in effect on residential property at the time of adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived that do not meet the requirements of this article are considered legal, nonconforming licenses and can continue to keep up to the number of dogs authorized by the kennel license at the time of adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived. Adding more dogs to an existing license would require meeting the requirements of subsection (f) of this section.

(4)  If dogs are confined by chains, such chains must be attached so as not to become entangled with chains of other dogs. 
(5)  Individual animal enclosures must be of a size to allow each dog to turn around fully, stand, sit and lie in a comfortable condition.

Sec. 10-57. - Revocation of kennel licenses. 
(a)  Upon observation that one or more of the conditions issued by the city council on a private or commercial kennel license holder is not observed, the city will notify the licensee that the city intends to revoke the private or commercial kennel license. A hearing before the planning and zoning commission will be held prior to making a decision. A recommendation to the city council to revoke a private kennel license will require a majority of those members present and voting. A decision by the city council to revoke a private kennel license will require a majority vote of those members present and voting. The decisions of the city council pertaining to private kennel licenses are final and not appealable; the decisions of the city council on commercial kennel licenses are appealable to the county district court. 
(b)  Upon evidence that the decision of the city council has not been followed by the licensee, and in the case of commercial kennel licensees an appeal has not been filed in county district court, the city will contact the animal control officer to pick up the dog and arrange for compliance with the city council's decision. All costs associated with compliance will be billed to the real property owner where the dog resides. Unpaid bills will be certified to the county and placed as a lien on the property.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 3, Second Series, adopted Sept. 3, 2008, repealed the former Div. 3, §§ 10-70-10-77, and enacted a new Div. 3 as set out herein. The former Div. 3 pertained to potentially dangerous and dangerous dogs and derived from Ord. No. 101E, § 1(16-20), 9-19-2007; Ord. No. 101F, § 2, 4-16-2008.

(2)  Has killed a domestic animal, without provocation, while off the owner's property; or 
(3)  Has, while off the owner's property, exhibited unusually aggressive behavior such as an attack on a person or another animal; or 
(4)  Has been found to be potentially dangerous and, after the owner has notice that the dog is potentially dangerous, the dog aggressively bites, attacks, or endangers the safety of humans or domestic animals. 
    Great bodily harm means bodily injury which creates a high probability of death, or which causes serious permanent disfigurement, or which causes a permanent or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ or other serious bodily harm.

(Ord. No. 3, Second Series, 9-3-2008) 
Sec. 10-71. - Designation as potentially dangerous dog or dangerous dog. 
    The city administrator shall designate any dog as a potentially dangerous dog or a dangerous dog upon receiving evidence that the dog meets any of the criteria in section 10-70 in the case of either a potentially dangerous dog or a dangerous dog. Upon such designation the dog shall be seized and impounded by the animal control authority. 
(Ord. No. 3, Second Series, 9-3-2008) 
Sec. 10-72. - Procedure. 
    The city administrator, after having determined that a dog is either potentially dangerous or dangerous, shall proceed in the following manner: 
(a)  Hearing. The owner of any dog declared potentially dangerous or dangerous has the right to a hearing before the city council. 
(b)  Security. A person claiming an interest in a seized dog may prevent impoundment of the dog during the hearing process by posting security in an amount sufficient to provide for the dog's actual cost of care and keeping. The security must be posted within seven days of the seizure inclusive of the date of the seizure. 
(c)  Notice. The city shall give notice of this section by delivering or mailing it to the owner of the dog, or by posting a copy of it at the place where the dog is kept, or by delivering it to a person residing on the property, and telephoning, if possible. The notice must include: 
(1)  A description of the seized dog; the authority for and purpose of the potentially dangerous dog or dangerous dog declaration and seizure; the time, place, and circumstances under which the dog was declared dangerous; and the telephone number and contact person where the dog is kept; 
(2)  A statement that the owner of the dog may request a hearing concerning the potentially dangerous dog or dangerous dog declaration and, if applicable, prior potentially dangerous dog declarations for the dog, and that failure to do so within 14 days of the date of the notice will terminate the owner's right to a hearing under this section; 
(3)  A statement that if an appeal request is made within 14 days of the notice, the owner must immediately comply with the requirements of section 10-75(1) and until such time as the city council issues an opinion; 
(4)  A statement that if the city council affirms the potentially dangerous dog or dangerous dog declaration, the owner will have 14 days from receipt of that decision to comply with all other requirements of sections 10-75 or 10-76, as applicable; 
(5)  A form to request a hearing under this subdivision; and 
(6)  A statement that all actual costs of the care, keeping, and disposition of the dog are the responsibility of the person claiming an interest in the dog, except to the extent that a court or hearing officer finds that the seizure or impoundment was not substantially justified by law. 
(d)  Right of hearing. Any hearing must be held within 14 days of the request to determine the validity of the dangerous dog declaration. The hearing officer will be the city council to conduct the hearing. In the event that the potentially dangerous dog or dangerous dog declaration is upheld by the city council, actual expenses of the hearing up to a maximum of $1,000.00 will be the responsibility of the dog's owner. The city council shall issue a decision on the matter within ten days after the hearing. The decision must be delivered to the dog's owner by hand delivery or registered mail as soon as practical and a copy must be provided to the animal control authority. 
    Nothing in this section shall prevent the city administrator from ordering the immediate seizure and quarantine of a rabies-suspected dog. 
    Any person who fails or refuses to release a dog to the animal control authority, a police officer, or a sheriff's deputy upon demand, after it has been found by the city administrator or the city council to be potentially dangerous or dangerous and ordered into custody, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

(1)  The dog is dangerous as demonstrated by a vicious attack, an unprovoked attack without warning, or multiple attacks; or 
(2)  The owner of the dog has demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to control the dog in order to prevent injury to persons or other animals. 
(Ord. No. 3, Second Series, 9-3-2008) 
Sec. 10-74. - Stopping an attack. 
    If any police officer, sheriff's deputy, city staff member, or the animal control authority is witness to an attack by a dog upon a person or domestic animal, the officer, deputy, city staff member, or animal control authority may take whatever means deemed appropriate to bring the attack to an end and prevent further injury to the victim.

Notice shall be provided to the owner(s) of the basis for the seizure and the right to request a hearing before the city council to determine whether the requirement(s) was/were violated. A request for hearing must be made within 14 days of the seizure. If the owner(s) fail(s) to request a hearing within 14 days, or is(are) found to have violated the requirement(s), the council shall order the dog destroyed in a proper and humane manner and the owner(s) shall pay the costs of confining and destroying the dog. If the owner(s) is(are) found not to have violated the requirement(s), the owner(s) may reclaim the dog under the provisions of this section.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Secs. 18-1-18-18. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
State Law reference- Obscene material, performances, etc., Minn. Stats. § 617.241 et seq. 

Sec. 18-19. - Authority, purpose, and intent. 
(a)  Authority. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that sexually explicit speech, including nude dancing, is entitled to some level of protection under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. As a result, municipalities may not ban adult establishments. The Supreme Court has ruled, however, that cities may adopt content-neutral zoning and licensing provisions to regulate and control the adverse secondary effects of adult establishments on the community. 
(b)  Findings of the city council. The state attorney general's office and the cities of St. Paul, Alexandria, and Rochester, Minnesota, as well as Indianapolis, Indiana; Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles, California; Seattle, Washington; St. Croix County, Wisconsin; and Adams County, Colorado; have conducted studies of the impact of adult establishments on their respective communities. These studies have concluded that adult establishments have an adverse impact on the surrounding neighborhoods. Those impacts include increased crime rates, lower property values, increased transiency, neighborhood blight, and potential health risks. The city council is relying on these studies, many of which were conducted in larger cities, recognizing that the same or similar adverse impacts could occur in a small city such as the City of East Bethel. The findings are based upon the experiences of other cities where such businesses have located. Based on these studies, the city council makes the following findings regarding the need to regulate adult establishments: 
(1)  Adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the types set forth in subsection (b) of this section. 
(2)  The adverse impacts caused by adult establishments tend to diminish if adult establishments are governed by location and licensing requirements. 
(3)  The city may adopt regulations to promote the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. 
(4)  The public health, safety, morals, and general welfare will be promoted by regulations governing adult establishments. 
(5)  Adult establishments can contribute to increased criminal activity and police calls in the area in which they are located, taxing law enforcement services. 
(6)  Adult establishments can be used as fronts for prostitution and other criminal activity. The experience of other cities indicates that the proper management and operation of such businesses, however, can minimize this risk. 
(7)  Adult establishments can cause or contribute to public health problems by the presence of live adult entertainment in conjunction with food and/or drink on the same premises. 
(8)  Many members of the public perceive areas within which adult establishments are located as less safe than other areas that do not have such uses. 
(9)  The adverse impact that adult establishments have on the surrounding area diminishes as the distance from the adult establishments increases. 
(10)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the adult establishments. A licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the adult establishment is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(11)  The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article. 
(12)  The barring of individuals with sexually related criminal convictions from the management of adult establishments for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which may lead to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(13)  The general health, safety, and welfare of the community is promoted by prohibiting nudity in adult establishments. This prohibition is based on concerns of potential adverse effects such as prostitution, the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, exposure to minors, obscenity, and unsanitary conditions in public places. 
(14)  Small cities experience many of the same adverse impacts of adult establishments present in larger communities. 
(c)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate adult establishments to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to: 
(1)  Prevent criminal activity within the city; 
(2)  To allow for efficient and effective law enforcement services in the city; 
(3)  Prevent deterioration of neighborhoods and the consequent adverse effects on real estate values of properties within those neighborhoods; 
(4)  To locate adult establishments away from residential areas, schools, parks, and places of worship; 
(5)  To provide a content-neutral, objective, licensing scheme that allows the city to monitor adult establishments for violations of building and health codes; and 
(6)  Prevent ownership of adult establishments by persons with prior, relevant criminal convictions. 
(d)  Reasonable opportunity. The provisions of this article do not prohibit adult establishments from having a reasonable opportunity to locate in the city. This article is not for the purpose of, nor is it intended to, impose a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including adult-oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to adult-oriented materials protected by the First Amendment or to deny access by distributors and exhibitors of adult-oriented entertainment to their intended market.

ARTICLE III. - PAWNSHOPS 

Sec. 18-81. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The city council finds that the use of services provided by pawnbrokers provides an opportunity for the commission of crimes and their concealment because pawn businesses have the ability to easily and quickly receive and transfer property stolen by others. The city council also finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers. The council desires to provide a system that effectively and efficiently identifies criminal activity related to pawnshops. The purpose of this article is to prevent pawn businesses from being used as facilities for the commission of crimes and to ensure that such businesses comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(b)  To assist the sheriff's office in better regulating current and future pawn businesses, decrease and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of the pawn industry, and increase identification of criminal activities in the pawn industry through the timely collection and sharing of pawn transaction information, this article also implements and establishes the required use of the automated pawn system (APS).

(Ord. No. 6, Second Series, § C, 1-7-2009) 
Sec. 18-252. - Criminal history business license background investigations.

Footnotes:

Editor's note- Ord. No. 24, Second Series, §§ 1-16, did not specify manner of inclusion. To facilitate indexing, said provisions have been included as Art. VII, §§ 18-271-18-286. 

Sec. 18-271. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to prohibit massage businesses and services to the public except those licensed as therapeutic massage enterprises and massage therapists pursuant to this article. The licensing regulations prescribed herein are necessary in order to prevent criminal activity and to protect the health and welfare of the community. This article is not intended to impose restrictions or limitations on the freedom of protected speech or expression. 
(Ord. No. 24, Second Series, § 1, 6-16-2010) 
Sec. 18-272. - Findings of the city council. 
    The city council makes the following findings regarding the need to license therapeutic massage enterprises and therapists and to prohibit all other types of massage businesses and services to the public: 
(1)  Persons who have bona fide and standardized training in therapeutic massage, health, and hygiene can provide a legitimate and necessary service to the general public. 
(2)  Health and sanitation regulations governing therapeutic massage enterprises and therapists can minimize the risk of the spread of communicable diseases and can promote overall health and sanitation. 
(3)  The license qualifications and restrictions on therapeutic massage enterprises and massage therapists identified in this article can minimize the risk that such businesses and persons will facilitate prostitution and other criminal activity in the community. 
(4)  Massage services provided by persons with no specialized and standardized training in massage can endanger citizens by facilitating the spread of communicable diseases, by exposing citizens to unhealthy and unsanitary conditions, and by increasing the risk of personal injury. 
(5)  Massage businesses which employ persons with no specialized and standardized training can tax city law-enforcement services, because such businesses are more likely to be operated as fronts for prostitution and other criminal activity than operations established by persons with standardized training. 
(6)  The training of professional massage therapists at accredited institutions is an important means of ensuring the fullest measure of protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.

Sec. 26-285. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to reduce public exposure to health risks where law enforcement officers or fire officials have determined that hazardous chemicals from a suspected clandestine drug lab site or associated dumpsite may exist. The city council finds that such sites may contain suspected chemicals and residues that place people, particularly children or adults of childbearing age, at risk when exposed through inhabiting or visiting the site, now and in the future. 
(b)  Based upon professional reports, assessments, testing and investigations, the city council finds that such hazardous chemicals can condense, penetrate, and contaminate on the land, surfaces, furnishings, buildings, and equipment in or near structures or other locations where such sites exist. The council finds that these conditions present health and safety risks to residents, occupants and visitors through fire, explosion, skin and respiratory exposure and related dangers. The council further finds that such sites present health and safety risks to occupied residences, buildings and structures and to the general housing stock of the community.

(Ord. No. 54, Second Series, § 1, 12-2-2015) 
Sec. 34-5. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Accessory structure or facility means any building or improvement clearly subordinate to a principal use such as garages, sheds, or storage buildings located on the same parcel as the principal structure. 
    Accessory use means a use which is clearly incidental to, customarily found in connection with, and (except in the case of accessory off-street parking spaces or loading) located on the same parcel as the principal use to which it is related. 
    Base flood elevation means the elevation of the "regional flood." The term "base flood elevation" is used in the flood insurance survey. 
    Basement means any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of excavation below ground level. 
    Board of adjustment means the board appointed by the city pursuant to the provisions of the East Bethel Zoning Ordinance Number 203 and any successor ordinance or amendments thereto, including the powers enumerated therein. 
    Conditional use means a specific type of structure or land use listed in this chapter that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Equal degree of encroachment means a method of determining the location of floodway boundaries so that floodplain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows. 
    Flood means a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas. 
    Flood frequency means the frequency for which it is expected that a specific flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded. 
    Flood fringe means a portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway. The term "flood fringe" is synonymous with the term "floodway fringe" used in the flood insurance study for Anoka County, Minnesota. 
    Floodplain means the beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood. 
    Floodproofing means a combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or elimination of flood damages. 
    Floodway means the bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and those portions of the adjoining floodplain which are reasonably required to carry or store the regional flood discharge. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include the term "recreational vehicle." 
    Obstruction means any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire fence, stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory floodplain which may impede, retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by such water. 
    Principal use or structure means all uses or structures that are not accessory uses or structures. 
    Reach means a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a stream or river influenced by a natural or manmade obstruction. In an urban area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings would most typically constitute a reach. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regional flood means a flood which is representative of large floods known to have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year recurrence interval. The term "regional flood" is synonymous with the term "base flood" used in the flood insurance study. 
    Regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE) means an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. 
    Special flood hazard area means a term used for flood insurance purposes synonymous with "One hundred year floodplain." 
    Structure means anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in section 34-183(3)a. and other similar items. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means within any consecutive 365-day period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." For the purpose of this chapter, "historic structure" is as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1. 
    Variance means a modification of a specific development standard required in this chapter to allow an alternative development standard not stated as acceptable in this chapter, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty or unique circumstance.

Sec. 34-59. - Zoning district established. 
    The floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter are hereby divided into three districts: Floodway district, flood fringe district, and general floodplain district. 
(1)  Floodway district. The floodway district includes those areas designated as floodway on the flood insurance rate map adopted in section 34-4. For lakes, wetlands and other basins, the floodway district includes those areas designated as Zone A or AE on the flood insurance rate map that are at or below the ordinary high water level as defined in Minnesota Statutes, § 103G.005, subdivision 14. 
(2)  Flood fringe district. The flood fringe district includes those areas designated as floodway fringe on the flood insurance rate map adopted in section 34-4, as being within Zone AE but being located outside of the floodway. For lakes, wetlands and other basins (that do not have a floodway designated), the flood fringe district includes those areas designated as Zone A or AE on the flood insurance rate map panels adopted in section 34-4 that are below the one percent annual chance (100-year) flood elevation but above the ordinary high water level as defined in Minnesota Statutes, § 103G.005, subdivision 14. 
(3)  General floodplain district. The general floodplain district includes those areas designated as Zone A or Zone AE without a floodway on the flood insurance rate map adopted in section 34-4, but not subject to the criteria in sections (1) and (2) above.

(3)  The cumulative placement of fill in excess of 1,000 cubic yards located on a parcel shall be allowable only as a conditional use, unless said fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with subsection (1) of this section. 
(4)  The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(5)  The provisions of section 34-116(5) shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 54, Second Series, § 1, 12-2-2015) 
Sec. 34-114. - Conditional uses. 
    In the flood fringe district, any structure that is not elevated on fill or floodproofed in accordance with section 34-113(1) and (2) or any use of land that does not comply with the standards in section 34-113(3) and (4) shall only be allowable as a conditional use. 
(Ord. No. 54, Second Series, § 1, 12-2-2015) 
Sec. 34-115. - Standards for conditional uses. 
    The following standards shall apply to conditional uses in the flood fringe district: 
(1)  Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These alternative methods may include but are not necessarily limited to the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, or above grade enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if: 
a.  The enclosed area is above grade on at least one side of the structure; 
b.  Is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood-resistant materials; and 
c.  Is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards: 
1.  The structure's design and as-built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer, certified building official, or architect as being in compliance with the general design standards of the state building code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent floodwater from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding. 
2.  Above grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate: 
(i)  The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. When openings are placed in a structure's walls to provide for entry of floodwaters to equalize pressures, the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(ii)  That the enclosed area will be designed of flood-resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the state building code and shall be used solely for building access, parking or vehicles or storage. 
(2)  Basements as a conditional use shall be subject to the following standards: 
a.  Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
b.  Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with subsection (3) of this section. 
(3)  All areas of nonresidential structures including basements to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the state building code. Structurally dry floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the state building code and this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted. 
(4)  When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted. The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the city. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists. 
(5)  Storage of materials and equipment as a conditional use shall be subject to the following standards: 
a.  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited. 
b.  Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the city. 
(6)  The provisions of section 34-116 shall also apply. 
(Ord. No. 54, Second Series, § 1, 12-2-2015) 
Sec. 34-116. - Standards for all flood fringe uses. 
    The following standards shall apply to all uses in the flood fringe district: 
(1)  All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted the board of adjustment must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the structure during times of flooding. A variance may be granted only after a finding is made by the board of adjustment that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist. 
(2)  Accessory commercial land uses, such as yards, railroad tracts, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. Such uses are allowed only by permit issued by the city. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth greater than two feet or be subject to flood velocities greater than four feet per second upon occurrence of the regional flood. 
(3)  Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal manufacturing and industrial plant operations especially along streams having protracted flood duration's. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in subsection (2) of this section. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in floodplain areas. 
(4)  Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures property elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multistructure or multilot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be required. 
(5)  Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the official zoning map. 
(6)  Recreational vehicles shall comply with the requirements contained in section 34-183(3). 
(7)  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.

Sec. 34-148. - General floodplain district floodway/flood fringe determination. 
    The following procedures shall apply in determining the floodway and/or flood fringe in the general floodplain district: 
(1)  Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the general floodplain district, the zoning administrator must obtain, review and reasonably utilize any regional flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source. 
(2)  If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily available, the applicant must furnish additional information, as needed, to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use would fall within the floodway or flood fringe district. Information must be consistent with accepted hydrological and hydraulic engineering standards and the standards in (3) below. 
(3)  The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include the following components, as applicable: 
a.  Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (one percent chance) flood. 
b.  Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas. 
c.  Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half foot. A lesser stage increase than one-half foot is required if, as a result of the stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach must be assumed in computing floodway boundaries. 
(4)  The zoning administrator will review the submitted information and assess the technical evaluation and the recommended floodway and/or flood fringe district boundary. The assessment must include the cumulative effects of previous floodway encroachments. The zoning administrator may seek technical assistance from a designated engineer or other expert person or agency, including the department of natural resources. Based on this assessment, the zoning administrator may approve or deny the application. 
(5)  Once the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries have been determined, the zoning administrator must process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of section 34-31 of this chapter.

Sec. 34-206. - Variances from standards. 
    An application to the variance to the provisions of this chapter will be processed and reviewed in accordance with the City of East Bethel Code of Ordinances, Zoning Ordinance, Appendix A, Section 4 and: 
(1)  In any case where, upon application to the board of adjustment, it appears, that by reason of exceptional circumstances, the strict enforcement of any provision of the standards would cause unnecessary hardship or that strict conformity with the standards would be unreasonable, impractical or not feasible under the circumstances, the board of adjustment may grant a variance consistent with the general purposes of this chapter provided that: 
a.  The condition causing the hardship is unique to that property. 
b.  The variance is shown to be necessary in order to secure for the applicant a right that is enjoyed by other owners in the same area or district. 
c.  The granting of the variance will not be contrary to the public interest or damaging to the rights of other persons or to property values in the neighborhood. 
d.  No variance shall be granted which will have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in that district or permit a lower degree of flood protection that the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area. 
e.  The granting of the variance will not be contrary to land use management policies of the area or district. 
f.  No variance shall be granted simply because there are no objections or because those who do not object outnumber those who do; nor for any other reason than a hardship. 
(2)  Before passing upon an application for variance, the board of adjustment shall hold a public hearing. Notice of such public hearing specifying the time, place, and matters to come before the board of adjustment shall be published in the official newspaper of the city at least ten days in advance of such hearing. 
(3)  The board of adjustment, in granting a variance, may prescribe any conditions necessary for the management of the floodplain. 
(4)  Flood insurance notice and recordkeeping. The applicant for a variance shall acknowledge in writing that: 
a.  The issuance of a variance on constructing a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rated for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 
b.  Construction below the 100-year or regional flood level increases risks to life and property.

Sec. 50-10. - Suspension, revocation, denial, nonrenewal. 
(a)  Hearing suspension, revocation, denial and/or non-renewal are the last step for any enforcement matters. All reasonable efforts will be made to resolve any enforcement or violation issues within a progressive system of notifications and provisions of reasonable times allowed for corrections. Should the process to achieve compliance be unsuccessful, action to deny, revoke, suspend, or not renew a license under this article shall be initiated by the city by giving written notice to the licensee of a hearing before the city council to consider such denial, revocation, suspension or nonrenewal. A written notice shall specify all violations and shall state the date, time, place and purpose of the hearing. The hearing shall be held no less than ten days and no more than 30 days after giving the notice. In such hearing the city council shall give due regard to the frequency and seriousness of violations, the ease with which such violations could have been cured or avoided and good faith efforts to comply with city requirements. Following the hearing, the city council in its sole discretion may deny, revoke, suspend, or decline to renew the license for all or any part or parts of the rental dwelling, or may grant a license upon such terms and conditions as it deems necessary to accomplish the purposes of this article. Further, an action to deny, revoke, suspend, or not renew a license based upon violations of this article may be postponed or discontinued at any time if it appears that the licensee has taken appropriate measures which will prevent further instances of disorderly use. The city council shall issue its decision upon written findings. 
(b)  Reason for action. The city council may revoke, suspend, deny or decline to renew any license issued under this article upon appropriate grounds including, but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  False statements on any application or other information or report required by this article to be given by the applicant or licensee. 
(2)  Failure to pay any application fee, penalty, re-inspection, or reinstatement fee required by this article and resolutions. 
(3)  Failure to correct deficiencies noted in notices of violation in the time specified in the notice. 
(4)  Any other violation of this article. 
(c)  Reinstatement of license. Upon a decision to revoke, deny, or for non-renewal of a license, no new application for the same rental dwelling will be accepted for a period of time specified in the written decision of the city council, not to exceed one year. Any such new application must be accompanied by a reinstatement fee, as specified by resolution, in addition to all other fees required by this article. 
(d)  No new rentals. A written decision to revoke, suspend, deny, or not renew a license shall specify the part or parts of the rental dwelling to which it applies. Thereafter, and until a license is reissued or reinstated, no rental units becoming vacant in such part or parts of the rental dwelling may be re-let or occupied. Revocation, suspension or nonrenewal of a license shall not excuse the owner of a rental dwelling from compliance with the terms of this article for any other unit or units in the rental dwelling which remain occupied. 
(e)  Failure to comply. Failure to comply with any term of this article during a period of revocation, suspension, or nonrenewal is a misdemeanor and is also grounds for extension of the term of such revocation or suspension or continuation of nonrenewal, or for a decision not to reinstate the license, notwithstanding any limitations on the period of suspension, revocation or nonrenewal specified in the city council's written decision.

(a)  Hearing suspension, revocation, denial and/or non-renewal are the last step for any enforcement matters. All reasonable efforts will be made to resolve any enforcement or violation issues within a progressive system of notifications and provisions of reasonable times allowed for corrections. Should the process to achieve compliance be unsuccessful, action to deny, revoke, suspend, or not renew a license under this article shall be initiated by the city by giving written notice to the licensee of a hearing before the city council to consider such denial, revocation, suspension or nonrenewal. A written notice shall specify all violations and shall state the date, time, place and purpose of the hearing. The hearing shall be held no less than ten days and no more than 30 days after giving the notice. In such hearing the city council shall give due regard to the frequency and seriousness of violations, the ease with which such violations could have been cured or avoided and good faith efforts to comply with city requirements. Following the hearing, the city council in its sole discretion may deny, revoke, suspend, or decline to renew the license for all or any part or parts of the rental dwelling, or may grant a license upon such terms and conditions as it deems necessary to accomplish the purposes of this article. Further, an action to deny, revoke, suspend, or not renew a license based upon violations of this article may be postponed or discontinued at any time if it appears that the licensee has taken appropriate measures which will prevent further instances of disorderly use. The city council shall issue its decision upon written findings. 
(b)  Reason for action. The city council may revoke, suspend, deny or decline to renew any license issued under this article upon appropriate grounds including, but not limited to, the following:

Upon a decision to revoke, deny, or for non-renewal of a license, no new application for the same rental dwelling will be accepted for a period of time specified in the written decision of the city council, not to exceed one year. Any such new application must be accompanied by a reinstatement fee, as specified by resolution, in addition to all other fees required by this article. 
(d)  No new rentals. A written decision to revoke, suspend, deny, or not renew a license shall specify the part or parts of the rental dwelling to which it applies. Thereafter, and until a license is reissued or reinstated, no rental units becoming vacant in such part or parts of the rental dwelling may be re-let or occupied. Revocation, suspension or nonrenewal of a license shall not excuse the owner of a rental dwelling from compliance with the terms of this article for any other unit or units in the rental dwelling which remain occupied. 
(e)  Failure to comply. Failure to comply with any term of this article during a period of revocation, suspension, or nonrenewal is a misdemeanor and is also grounds for extension of the term of such revocation or suspension or continuation of nonrenewal, or for a decision not to reinstate the license, notwithstanding any limitations on the period of suspension, revocation or nonrenewal specified in the city council's written decision.

Sec. 54-19. - Substitution clause. 
    The owner of any sign which is otherwise allowed by this chapter may substitute noncommercial speech in lieu of any commercial speech or noncommercial speech. This substitution of copy may be made without any additional approval or permitting. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial speech over any other noncommercial speech. This provision prevails over any more specific provision to the contrary.

ARTICLE III. - RIGHT-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 62-140. - Findings and purpose. 
    This article imposes reasonable regulations and restrictions on the placement, maintenance and construction of equipment and facilities within rights-of-way and imposes a fee for rights-of-way users. The city holds the public rights-of-way in trust for the benefit of all of its citizens, and is thus charged with the responsibility of ensuring that all citizens have the benefit of using and enjoying the public rights-of-way. A primary cause of the deterioration of the city's rights-of-way is the increased use by persons who have equipment and facilities within the rights-of-way. The city finds that rights-of-way users should contribute to the costs of maintaining the rights-of-way since these users receive revenue through their use of the public rights-of-way. Additionally, the placement and maintenance of equipment and facilities within the rights-of-way is an inconvenience to the general public. Therefore, in order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, and to preserve the structural and aesthetic integrity of its public rights-of-way, the city council finds that it is necessary to enact the regulations set forth in this article. 
    This section shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 Session Laws, Chapter 123, substantially codified in Minn. Stats. §§ 237.16, 237.162, 237.163, 237.79, 237.81, and 238.086 (the "Act") and the other laws governing applicable rights of the city and users of the right-of-way. This section shall also be interpreted consistent with Minnesota Rules 7819.0050-7819.9950 where possible. To the extent that any provision of this section cannot be interpreted consistently with the Minnesota Rules, the interpretation most consistent with the full delegation of statutory and common law police power to the city is intended.

(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. G), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-147. - Permit-Requirements. 
(a)  Permit required. Except as otherwise provided in this Code, no person may obstruct or excavate any right-of-way without first having obtained the appropriate right-of-way permit from the director to do so. 
(1)  Excavation permit. An excavation permit is required by a registrant to excavate that part of the right-of-way described in such permit and to hinder the free and open passage over the specified portion of the right-of-way by placing facilities described therein, to the extent and for the duration specified therein. 
(2)  Obstruction permit. An obstruction permit is required by a registrant to hinder the free and open passage over the specified portion of the right-of-way by placing equipment described therein on the right-of-way, to the extent and for the duration specified therein. An obstruction permit is not required if a person already possesses a valid excavation permit for the same project. 
(3)  Overhead facilities. Permits for installation, repair or other work on above-ground facilities within the meaning of Minn. Stat. § 237.163, subd. 6(b)(4) will be obstruction permits, notwithstanding the need for excavation, provided the excavation is augured or hand dug for the purpose of placing a pole type structure. 
(b)  Permit extensions. No person may excavate or obstruct the right-of-way beyond the date specified in the permit unless such person makes a supplementary application for another right-of-way permit before the expiration of the initial permit, and a new permit or permit extension is granted. 
(c)  Delay penalty. Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the city shall establish and impose a delay penalty for unreasonable delays in right-of-way excavation, obstruction, patching, or restoration. The delay penalty shall be established from time to time by city council resolution. 
(d)  Permit display. Permits issued under this article shall be conspicuously displayed or otherwise available at all times at the indicated work site and shall be available for inspection by the director or his designee.

(e)  Application to franchises. Unless otherwise agreed to in a franchise, management costs may be charged separately from and in addition to the franchise fees imposed on a right-of-way user in the franchise. 
(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. K), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-151. - Right-of-way patching and restoration. 
(a)  Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the patching and restoration of the right-of-way, as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified in the permit. 
(b)  Patch and restoration. The permittee shall patch its own work under any excavation permit. The city may choose either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or the city may undertake to restore the right-of-way. 
(1)  City restoration. If the city restores the right-of-way, the permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If, during the 36 months following such restoration, the pavement settles due to permittee's improper backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, all costs associated with having to correct the defective work. 
(2)  Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way itself, it shall at the time of application for an excavation permit post a construction performance bond in an amount determined by the director to be sufficient to cover the cost of restoration. If, within 36 months after completion of the restoration of the right-of-way, the director determines that the right-of-way has been properly restored, the surety on the construction performance bond shall be released. 
(c)  Standards. The permittee shall perform patching and restoration according to the standards and with the materials specified by the director. The director shall have the authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The director in exercising this authority shall comply with PUC standards for right-of-way restoration and shall further be guided by the following considerations: 
(1)  The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations, disruptions or damage to the right-of-way; 
(2)  The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way; 
(3)  The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way; the remaining life expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the excavation; 
(4)  Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the right-of-way; and 
(5)  The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise take place. 
(d)  Guarantees. If the permittee is required by the director to restore the right-of-way, it shall have an obligation to guarantee the restoration work for a period of 36 months following its completion. During this 36-month period it shall, upon notification from the director, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the director. Said work shall be completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the director. 
(e)  Failure to restore. If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the director, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the director, the director at its option may do such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to the city, within ten days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If the permittee fails to pay within ten days of billing, the city may exercise its rights under the construction performance bond. 
(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. L), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-152. - Joint applications. 
(a)  Joint application. Registrants may jointly apply for permits to excavate or obstruct the right-of-way at the same place and time. 
(b)  Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same obstruction or excavation may share in the payment of the obstruction or excavation permit fee. Registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each will pay and indicate the same on their applications. 
(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. M), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-153. - Supplementary applications. 
(a)  Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the permit must be obstructed or excavated must, before working in that greater area, make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required thereby; and be granted a new permit or permit extension. 
(b)  Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit start date or continue working after the end date. If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the previous permit. This supplementary application must be done before the permit end date. 
(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. N), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-154. - Other obligations. 
(a)  Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not relieve the permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of local, state and federal laws. A permittee shall perform work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the work. 
(b)  Prohibited work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval of the director, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work. 
(c)  Interference with right-of-way. A permittee shall not so obstruct a right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. Private vehicles of those doing work in the right-of-way may not be parked within or next to a permit area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The loading or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area unless specifically authorized by the permit. 
(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. O), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-155. - Denial of permit. 
    The director may deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements and conditions of this article or if the director determines that the denial is necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city or when necessary to protect the interests of the city in the rights-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. P), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-156. - Installation requirements. 
    The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other work performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with engineering standards adopted by the PUC or other applicable local requirements, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the PUC Rules.

(c)  Authority of director. 
(1)  At the time of inspection the director may order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to, the life, health, safety or well-being of the public. 
(2)  The director may issue an order to the permittee for any work which does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards, conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after issuance of the order the permittee shall present proof to the director that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the director may revoke the permit pursuant to section 62-160. 
(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. R), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-158. - Work done without a permit. 
(a)  Emergency situations. 
(1)  Each registrant shall immediately notify the director of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency. Within two business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this article for the actions it took in response to the emergency. 
(2)  If the director becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's facilities, the director will attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the director may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the emergency. 
(b)  Nonemergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, and as a penalty pay double the normal fees for said permit, deposit with the director the amounts necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way and comply with all of the requirements of this article. 
(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. S), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-159. - Supplementary notification. 
    If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends sooner than the date given on the permit, permittee shall notify the director of the accurate information as soon as this information is known. 
(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. T), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-160. - Revocation of permits. 
(a)  Breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any right-of-way permit, without a fee refund, if there is a breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A breach by the permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit; 
(2)  An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens; 
(3)  Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a right-of-way permit; 
(4)  The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; unless a permit extension is obtained; or 
(5)  The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to section 62-157. 
(b)  Written notice of breach. If the director determines that the permittee has committed a breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the director shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A breach will allow the director, at his discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach. 
(c)  Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving the written demand to remedy the violation, the permittee shall provide the director with a plan, acceptable to the director that will cure the breach. The permittee's failure to so contact the director, the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or the permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, the permittee's failure to so contact the director, the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or the permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan shall automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year. 
(d)  Cause for probation. From time to time, the director may establish a list of conditions of the permit, which, if breached, will automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working out of the allotted time period or otherwise outside of the permit authorization. 
(e)  Automatic revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a breach as outlined in subsection (a) of this section, the permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs. 
(f)  Removal of facilities/equipment and reimbursement. If a permittee's permit is revoked, the city may make a demand in writing that the permittee remove its facilities and equipment from the right-of-way. If the permittee fails to remove its facilities and equipment within ten days of receiving such demand, the city may remove the permittee's facilities and equipment and seek reimbursement from the permittee for such removal costs. Additionally, the city may require the permittee to restore the right-of-way after its facilities and equipment have been removed, or the city may choose to undertake the restoration and seek reimbursement from permittee for such restoration costs. In addition to any removal and/or restoration costs, the permittee shall reimburse the city for all other costs incurred by the city in connection with such revocation, including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees. 
(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. U), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-161. - Mapping data. 
(a)  Information required. Each registrant shall provide mapping information required by the director in accordance with PUC Rules. 
(b)  Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minnesota Rules § 7560.0150, subpt. 2, shall require the permittee's use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals, and the service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the director reasonably requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the director evidence satisfactory to the director of the installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this subsection and with applicable Gopher State One Call law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after December 31, 2005, shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for payments to contractors working on a public improvement project including those under Minn. Stats. ch. 429, and city approval of performance under development agreements, or other subdivision or site plan approval under Minn. Stats. ch. 462. The director shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of providing such information to the city. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit issued for the work or for future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors. 
(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. V), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-162. - Undergrounding. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public and is intended to foster (i) safe travel over the right-of-way, (ii) non-travel related safety around homes and buildings where overhead feeds are connected and (iii) orderly development in the city consistent with its Comprehensive Plan. Location and relocation, installation and reinstallation of facilities in the right-of-way or in or on other public ground must be made in accordance with this section and is intended to be enforced consistently with state and federal law regulating right-of-way users, to the fullest extent of the city's statutory and common law authority. 
(b)  Undergrounding of facilities. All facilities newly installed, constructed or otherwise placed in the public right-of-way or in other public property held in common for public use must be located and maintained underground pursuant to the terms and conditions of this section and in accordance with applicable construction standards, subject to the exceptions below. Above-ground installation, construction, modification, or replacement of existing meters, gauges, transformers, street lighting, pad mount switches, capacitor banks, re-closers and service connection pedestals shall be allowed. These requirements shall apply equally outside of the corporate limits of the city coincident with city jurisdiction of platting, subdivision regulation or comprehensive planning as may now or in the future be allowed by law. 
(c)  Undergrounding of permanent replacement, relocated or reconstructed facilities. If the city finds that one or more of the purposes set forth in section 62-162(a) would be promoted, the city may require a permanent replacement, relocation or reconstruction of a facility to be located, and maintained underground, with due regard for seasonal working conditions. For purposes of this subdivision, reconstruction means any substantial repair of or any improvement to existing facilities. Undergrounding may be required whether a replacement, relocation or reconstruction is initiated by the right-of-way user owning or operating the facilities, or by the city in connection with (1) the present or future use by the city or other local government unit of the right-of-way or other public ground for a public project, (2) the public health or safety, or (3) the safety and convenience of travel over the right-of-way. Subject to subdivision (d) below, all relocations from previously placed underground facilities shall be to another underground location. 
(d)  Exceptions to undergrounding. The following exceptions to the strict application of this subdivision shall be allowed upon the conditions stated: 
(1)  Technical feasibility; promotion of policy. Above-ground installation, construction, or placement of facilities shall be allowed in residential, commercial and industrial areas where the council, following consideration and recommendation by the planning commission, finds that: 
a.  Underground placement is not technically feasible due to topographical, subsoil or other existing conditions which significantly and adversely affect underground facilities placement; or, 
b.  Failure to promote the purposes of undergrounding. The right-of-way user clearly and convincingly demonstrates that none of the purposes under section 62-162(a) would be advanced by underground placement of facilities on the project in question, or the city determines on its own review that undergrounding is not warranted based on the circumstances of the proposed undergrounding. 
(2)  Temporary service. Above-ground installation, construction, or placement of temporary service lines shall only be allowed: 
a.  During new construction of any project for a period not to exceed three months; 
b.  During an emergency in order to safeguard lives or property within the city; 
c.  For a period of not more than seven months when soil conditions make excavation impractical. 
(3)  Facilities subject to preemptive public utilities commission siting and routing jurisdiction. Facilities that are subject to certificate of need and siting and routing requirements of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission are exempted from this section 62-162 to the extent that the city's undergrounding authority is preempted by law. 
(e)  Developer responsibility. All owners, platters, or developers are responsible for complying with the requirements of this subdivision, and prior to final approval of any plat or development plan, shall submit to the director written instruments from the appropriate right-of-way users showing that all necessary arrangements with said users for installation of such facilities have been made. 
(Ord. No. 31, Second Series, § 6, 10-5-2011) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 31, Second Series, § 6, adopted Oct. 5, 2011, repealed the former § 62-162, and enacted a new § 62-162 as set out herein. The former § 62-162 pertained to location of facilities and derived from Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. W), adopted Feb. 1, 2006. 
Sec. 62-163. - Relocation of facilities. 
    A registrant must promptly and at its own expense, with due regard for seasonal working conditions, permanently remove and relocate its facilities in the right-of-way whenever the director for good cause requires such removal and relocation, and shall restore the right-of-way to the same condition it was in prior to said removal or relocation. The director may require removal and relocation to prevent interference with a present or future city use of the right-of-way; a public improvement undertaken by the city; an economic development project in which the city has an interest or investment; when the public health, safety and welfare require it; or when necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. X), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-164. - Pre-excavation facility and equipment location. 
    Each registrant who has facilities or equipment in the area to be excavated shall mark the horizontal and approximate vertical placement of all such facilities.

(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. Y), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-165. - Damage to other facilities. 
(a)  When the director does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a registrant's facilities to protect it, the director shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. 
(b)  Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the right-of-way. Each registrant shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the facilities of another registrant caused during the city's response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant's facilities. 
(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. Z), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-166. - Right-of-way vacation. 
(a)  Reservation of right. If the city vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities of a registrant, and if the vacation does not require the relocation of a registrant's or permittee's facilities, the city shall reserve, to and for itself and all registrants having facilities in the vacated right-of-way, the right to install, maintain and operate any facilities in the vacated right-of-way and to enter upon such right-of-way at any time for the purpose of reconstructing, inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same. 
(b)  Relocation of facilities. If the vacation requires the relocation of a registrant's or permittee's facilities and if the vacation proceedings are initiated by the registrant or permittee, the registrant or permittee must pay the relocation costs. If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the city, the registrant or permittee must pay the relocation costs unless, otherwise agreed to by the city and the registrant or permittee. If the vacation proceedings are initiated by a person other than the registrant or permittee, such other person must pay the relocation costs. 
(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. AA), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-167. - Indemnification and liability. 
    By registering with the director, or by accepting a permit under this article, a registrant or permittee agrees as follows: 
(1)  Limitation of liability. By reason of the acceptance of a registration or the grant of a right-of-way permit, the city does not assume any liability for injuries to persons, damage to property, or loss of service claims by parties other than the registrant or the city, or for claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the installation, presence, maintenance, or operation of facilities by registrants or activities of registrants. 
(2)  Indemnification. A registrant or permittee shall indemnify, keep, and hold the city free and harmless from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to property occasioned by the issuance of permits or by the construction, maintenance, repair, inspection, or operation of the registrant's or permittee's facilities located in the right-of-way. 
(3)  Defense. If a suit is brought against the city under circumstances where the registrant or permittee is required to indemnify, the registrant or permittee, at its sole cost and expense, shall defend the city in the suit if written notice of the suit is promptly given to the registrant or permittee within a period in which the registrant or permittee is not prejudiced by the lack or delay of notice. 
If the registrant or permittee is required to indemnify and defend, it shall thereafter have control of the litigation, but the registrant or permittee may not settle the litigation without the consent of the city. Such indemnification shall not constitute a waiver of any defense, immunity, or damage limitation otherwise available to the city. In defending an action on behalf of the city, the registrant or permittee is entitled to assert in an action every defense, immunity, or damage limitation that the city could assert in its own behalf. 
(Ord. No. 202, § I(subd. BB), 2-1-2006) 
Sec. 62-168. - Abandoned and unusable facilities. 
(a)  Discontinued operations. A registrant who has determined to discontinue its operations in the city must either: 
(1)  Provide information satisfactory to the director that the registrant's obligations for its facilities in the right-of-way under this article have been lawfully assumed by another registrant; 
(2)  Submit to the director a proposal and instruments for transferring ownership of its facilities to the city. If a registrant proceeds under this clause, the city may, at its option: 
a.  Purchase the facilities; 
b.  Require the registrant, at its own expense, to remove the facilities; or 
c.  Require the registrant to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the city for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the facilities. 
(b)  Abandoned facilities. Facilities of a registrant that remain continuously unused for two years shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance, taking possession of the facilities and restoring them to a useable condition, or requiring removal of the facilities by the registrant, or the registrant's successor in interest. 
(c)  Removal. Any registrant who has unusable and abandoned facilities in any right-of-way shall remove it from that right-of-way during the next scheduled excavation, unless this requirement is waived by the director.

ARTICLE VI. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 66-160. - Conformity with the comprehensive plan and zoning ordinance. 
    A proposed subdivision shall conform to the comprehensive plan, to related policies adopted by the city, and to the city's zoning ordinance, as set forth in Appendix A to this Code and as may be amended. 
(Ord. of 10-17-2007, § 7(7-1)) 
Sec. 66-161. - Land requirements. 
(a)  Land shall be suited to the purpose for which it is to be subdivided. No plan shall be approved if the site is not suitable for the purposes proposed by reason of potential flooding, topography, adverse soil conditions, rock formations, or wetlands. 
(b)  Land subject to hazards to life, health, or property shall not be subdivided until all such hazards have been eliminated or unless adequate safeguards against such hazards are provided by the subdivision plan. 
(c)  Proposed subdivisions shall be coordinated with surrounding properties and/or neighborhoods, so that the city as a whole may develop efficiently and harmoniously. 
(Ord. of 10-17-2007, § 7(7-2)) 
Sec. 66-162. - Blocks. 
(a)  Length. The maximum length of blocks shall be 1,325 feet and the minimum length 400 feet. Blocks over 800 feet long may require pedestrian ways at least ten feet wide at their approximate center. The use of additional pedestrian ways to schools, parks, and other destinations may be required. 
(b)  Arrangement. A block shall be so designed as to provide two tiers of lots unless it adjoins a major collector or an arterial street or where topographic wetland or other conditions render the block arrangement unreasonable. 
(c)  Block width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth, except where topography or other conditions render the block depth unreasonable. 
(Ord. of 10-17-2007, § 7(7-3)) 
Sec. 66-163. - Lots. 
(a)  Area. The minimum lot area, width, and depth shall not be less than that established by the city's zoning ordinance, set forth in Appendix A to this Code, in effect at the time of adoption of the final plat. Minimum lot area for urban lots shall consist of buildable land and be exclusive of utility transmission easements that encumber lot development. 
(b)  Corner lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have additional width to permit appropriate building setback from both streets and a side yard bufferyard where the side yard abuts a collector or arterial street as required in the zoning ordinance. 
(c)  Side lot lines. Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles to street lines or radial to curved street lines. 
(d)  Width. Every lot must have the minimum width measured at the minimum front yard setback and at the setback from the OHW level of an abutting lake or stream and extending to the location of the principal building. All lots shall have frontage on a public street. 
(e)  Lot frontage. All lots must have frontage on a public street. The required lot frontage is measured at the public right-of-way. Flag lots are prohibited. 
(f)  Building sites. Each lot shall provide an adequate building site at least 18 inches above the top of the adjacent curb unless approved by the city engineer upon the basis of plans submitted showing alternative, acceptable surface drainage measures. 
(g)  Urban single- and two-family lot access. All new single- and two-family urban lots shall be designed to receive access from a local street. 
(h)  Access to arterial streets and collector streets. In the case where a proposed plat is adjacent to a collector or arterial street, said streets to be defined by the city's comprehensive plan, there shall be no direct vehicular access from individual urban single-family or two-family lots to such streets and roads. In the platting of small tracts of land fronting on limited access highways, arterial, or collector streets where there is no other alternative, a temporary entrance may be granted, subject to terms and conditions defined by city council and applicable county or state agencies. As neighboring land becomes subdivided and more preferable access arrangements become possible, such temporary access permits shall become void. In such cases where direct lot access to collector or arterial streets is allowed, special traffic safety measures including, but not limited to, provisions for on-site vehicle turnaround shall be required. In cases where a proposed plat is adjacent to the county or state highway, the plat shall be subject to county and/or state approval or city ordinance, whichever is more restrictive. 
(i)  Design of new commercial, industrial and multiple-family lots. New commercial, industrial, and multiple-family lots fronting on an arterial or major collector street shall be designed to minimize the number of direct access points through the following methods listed in preferential order. If the highest preference is not possible, the next preference shall be utilized until an access method is possible. 
(1)  Access from a local street. 
(2)  Frontage road serving multiple properties. 
(3)  Frontage driveway or connected parking lot with cross easements serving multiple properties. 
(4)  Shared driveways. 
(5)  One driveway access, no closer than 200 feet to another driveway and that meets the city's minimum spacing standards from a street intersection. All driveways shall be reviewed for inconsistency with the policies of the city's comprehensive plan. 
(j)  Setback lines. Setback of building lines shall be shown on all lots intended for residential use and shall not be less than the setback required by the city's zoning ordinance, as set forth in Appendix A to this Code and as may be amended. 
(k)  Watercourses. Watercourses may be contained within abutting lots. Watercourses shall be protected by easement that will include a buffer strip extending outward from the delineated wetland boundary or the watercourse OHW level as defined by section 66-11. Lots with easements protecting watercourses shall have sufficient dimensions and contiguous area outside the watercourse easement to meet or exceed the minimum lot area and width specified in the zoning ordinance, set forth in Appendix A to this Code, for the district in which the lots are located. 
(l)  Grading for drainage. Lots shall be graded so as to provide drainage away from building locations and shall conform to the approved final grading plan. Stormwater drainage from an improved subdivision or lot shall not be directed at an adjoining property at a rate above a predevelopment condition except where drainage is directed to a designed drainage easement. 
(m)  Features. In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be shown for all natural features such as tree growth, watercourses, historic places, or similar conditions which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and stability to the proposed development. 
(n)  Frontage on two streets. Double frontage, or lots with frontage on two parallel streets, shall not be permitted except where lots back on major collector or arterial streets, county or state highways, or where topographic or other conditions render subdividing otherwise unreasonable. Additional lot depth and a 20-foot-wide landscaped bufferyard shall be provided where a lot backs onto a major collector or arterial streets. 
(o)  Irregularly shaped lots. On single-family residential lots determined to be irregular in shape (e.g., triangular), the developer shall demonstrate to the city an ability to properly place principal buildings and accessory structures upon the site which are compatible in size and character to the surrounding area. 
(p)  Building expansion. All single-family residential lots shall be designed in consideration of potentials for buildings accommodating accessory structures, porches and decks, etc., without need for setback variance. Said buildings and structures are to be compatible in size and character with the surrounding area. 
(q)  Lot remnants/outlots. All remnants of lots below minimum lot size left over after subdividing a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels. Outlots may be platted within a subdivision to delineate future development phases or commonly owned open spaces. The outlet shall be sized in a manner to accommodate its intended use. An outlot shall be platted into a lot and block prior to issuance of a building permit. No building permits shall be issued for an outlot except for open-air structures allowed as a recreational component in an open space area. 
(Ord. of 10-17-2007, § 7(7-4)) 
Sec. 66-164. - Streets. 
(a)  Streets, continuous. Except for culs-de-sac, streets shall connect with streets already dedicated in adjoining or adjacent subdivisions, or provide for future connections to adjoining unsubdivided tracts, or shall be a reasonable projection of streets in the nearest subdivided tracts. The arrangement of major collector and arterial streets shall be considered in their relation to the reasonable circulation of traffic, to topographic conditions, to runoff of stormwater, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the area to be served in compliance with the city's comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Local streets and dead-end streets. Local streets should be so planned as to discourage their use by nonlocal traffic. Dead-end streets are prohibited, but culs-de-sac shall be permitted where topography or other physical conditions justify their use. Culs-de-sac shall not be longer than 500 feet, including a terminal turn around which shall be provided at the closed end, with a right-of-way radius of not less than 70 feet. A 50-foot street radius will be required on all culs-de-sac. 
(c)  Street plans for future subdivisions. Where the plat application includes only part of the tract owned or intended for development by the subdivider, or abuts an undeveloped tract, a build out plan (ghost plat) illustrating a proposed future street system for the unsubdivided tract, prepared and submitted by the subdivider, may be required by the city. 
(d)  Temporary cul-de-sac. In those instances where a street is terminated pending future extension in conjunction with future subdivision and the street segment is more than 200 feet between the dead-end and the nearest intersection, a temporary turn around facility shall be provided at the closed end, in conformance with cul-de-sac requirements. This temporary cul-de-sac must be placed inside a temporary roadway easement if it is located outside street right-of-way. Financial guarantee will be required for removal or restoration as determined by the city engineer. 
(e)  Provisions for resubdivision of large lots and parcels. When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or parcels, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical location and openings of future streets and appropriate resubdivision, with provision for adequate utility connections for such resubdivision. 
(f)  Subdivisions abutting major rights-of-way. Wherever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to the right-of-way of a U.S. or state highway, county road, local major collector, or local arterial street, provision may be made for a service street approximately parallel and adjacent to the boundary of such right-of-way; provided that due consideration is given to proper circulation design, setbacks from an intersection on the major rights-of-way, or for a street at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land between such street and right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for approach connections to future grade separations, or for lot depths. 
(g)  Compliance with comprehensive plan. All subdivisions incorporating streets which are identified in the city comprehensive plan, as amended, shall comply with the minimum right-of-way, surface width, and design standards as outlined in this chapter, and must be reviewed and approved by the city engineer. 
(h)  Half-streets. Half-streets shall be prohibited except where it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided, in which case the dedication of a half-street may be permitted. The probable length of time elapsing before dedication of the remainder shall be considered in this decision. No permanent street improvement shall be permitted within a half-street right-of-way. All lots having frontage or access solely from a half-street are prohibited from being eligible for building permits. 
(i)  Dedication. All proposed streets shown on the plat shall be in conformity to city, county, and state plans and standards and be offered for dedication as public streets unless otherwise determined by city council. 
(j)  Additional right-of-way. Additional right-of-way and roadway widths may be required by the council to promote public safety and convenience when special conditions require it. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing street of inadequate width, sufficient additional width shall be provided to meet the standards of this chapter. 
(k)  Restriction of access. Access of local streets onto arterial and collector streets shall be discouraged at intervals of less than 500 feet. 
(l)  Centerline curvature. The minimum horizontal curvature of streets shall be in accordance with the Mn/DOT Highway Design Manual for the type of street and design speed. The minimum curvature shall be a 300-foot radius. 
(m)  Streets in flood hazard area. No street shall be approved if its final surface is below the regulatory flood protection elevation. City council shall require profiles and elevations of finished streets for areas subject to flooding. Fill may be used for streets, provided such fill does not unduly increase flood heights and provided any such fill would not result in a stage increase violating the requirements of chapter 34, pertaining to floods, as may be amended. 
(n)  Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except under conditions accepted by city council. 
(o)  Private streets. Private streets, except in the case of planned unit developments, shall be prohibited and no public improvements shall be approved for any private street. All streets shall be dedicated for public use. All private streets shall meet the construction design standards for city streets. 
(p)  Curb and gutter. All residential streets (except in the RR and A districts), and all streets in commercial and industrial areas, shall have concrete curb and gutter in compliance with established city standard design detail plates. 
(q)  Traffic calming. Traffic calming measures may be required by the city in subdivisions to control vehicular speed. A copy of the report identifying the types and kinds of calming measures has been developed and is available at city offices.

Secs. 66-171-66-193. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VII. - PUBLIC LAND DEDICATION 

Sec. 66-194. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, and statement of purpose. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. Minn. Stats. § 462.358, subd. 2b provides that municipal subdivision regulations may require that a reasonable portion of any proposed subdivision be dedicated to the public or preserved for conservation purposes or for public use such as parks, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, or open space, and that the municipality may alternatively accept an equivalent amount in cash based upon the undeveloped land value. 
(b)  Findings of fact. The city council finds that: 
(1)  The preservation and development of parks, significant natural communities, features of significant historical interest, playgrounds, trails, and open space areas within the city are essential to maintaining a healthy and desirable environment for residents and persons employed within the city. The presence of parks, trails, and open space amenities also enhances the value and attractiveness of residential and commercial/industrial developments to landowners, developers, purchasers, employers, and employees. The city must not only provide for its present citizens, but it must also provide for the future. 
(2)  New developments place a burden upon the city's parks and open space system. New facilities must be developed concurrently with development in order to provide the desired level of service and the quality of the environment for all. Therefore, new developments shall be required to contribute toward the city's park system in rough proportion to the relative burden they will place upon the park system. 
(3)  The city council recognizes that the need for such parks, trails, and public open spaces is directly related to the density and intensity of population and development permitted and allowed in the city. Urban development results in increased population, increased intensity of use, and greater demands for such public areas and facilities. 
(4)  Development of land for schools, religious institutions, or other nonprofit organizations may create additional demand on the city's park and recreational land and facilities. The city may create partnerships with these organizations that foster cooperative use of school, nonprofit, and park properties for recreational activities. 
(Ord. of 10-17-2007, § 8(8-1)) 
Sec. 66-195. - Required dedication. 
(a)  Dedication of land or cash. 
(1)  Pursuant to Minn. Stats. § 462.358, subd. 2b, the city requires all subdividers, as a prerequisite to approval of a final subdivision plat or development of any land previously divided by plat, metes or bounds, or any other means, to convey to the city or dedicate to the public use for park, playground, open space, or trail, a reasonable portion of the land being platted or developed as hereinafter specified. The portions to be dedicated will be approved by the city; or in lieu thereof, the subdivider shall at the option of the city pay to the city, for use in the acquisition or development of public parks, playgrounds, or in debt retirement in connection with land previously acquired for such public purposes, an equivalent amount in cash based upon the undeveloped land value. 
(2)  The form of contribution (cash, land, or any combination thereof) shall be decided by city council based upon need and conformance with the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Administrative procedures. The city council shall establish such administrative procedures as it may deem necessary and required to implement the provisions of this chapter. 
(c)  Parks commission recommendation. 
(1)  The parks commission shall, in each case, recommend to city council the total area and location of such land that the parks commission feels should be so conveyed or dedicated within the development for the above public purposes. These recommendations shall be based on the recommendations included in the city parks, trails, and open space plan. 
(2)  The parks commission shall, prior to the time that the planning commission completes its public hearings on the preliminary plat, review the preliminary plat and recommend to the planning commission the total area and location of the land the parks commission determines should be dedicated for park use. The parks commission shall present these recommendations to the planning commission and city council. In those instances where the parks commission concludes that a cash equivalency payment should be made by the applicant or owner in lieu of dedication of land, the parks commission shall recommend to the planning commission the percentage of the total park dedication requirement to be paid to the city in cash. In the event that review at a regular meeting of the parks commission would result in a delay in the review and approval process so that the time limitations of Minn. Stats. § 462.358 may not be met, the requirement of review by the parks commission may be waived by either the applicant or by city council at the time of its review of the application. 
(d)  Standards for determination. 
(1)  The parks commission shall develop and recommend to city council for adoption standards and guidelines for determining which portion of each such development should reasonably be required to be conveyed or dedicated. Such standards and guidelines may take into consideration the zoning classification to be assigned to the land to be developed, the particular use proposed for such land, amenities to be provided, and factors of density and site development as proposed by the subdivider. The parks commission shall further recommend changes and amendments from time to time to such standards and guidelines to reflect changes in the usage of land which may occur, changes in zoning classification, and concepts and changes in planning and development concepts that relate to the development and usages to which land may be put. 
(2)  The parks commission shall develop and recommend standards for design and construction of public parks, trails, and open space areas in the city. 
(e)  Dedicated land requirements. Any land to be dedicated as a requirement of this chapter shall be reasonably adapted for the above public purposes. Factors used in evaluating the adequacy of proposed dedication areas shall include size, shape, topography, drainage, geology, tree cover, rare species, and other significant wildlife habitats, access, and location. 
(f)  Minimum area of dedicated land. Subdividers shall be required to dedicate to the city for park, trail, playground, open space, and other public purposes as a minimum that percentage of net land area or equivalent market value in cash as set out below: 
(1)  Residential land uses. 
Units Per Acre Percentage of Land or Equivalent Market Value in Cash Up to 6 10 6 or more 10 percent plus 1 percent for each dwelling unit (DU) over 6 units/acre  
(2)  Cash in lieu. In no event shall the cash in lieu of land payment exceed $2,000.00 per residential unit. 
a.  Metes and bounds lot splits and subdivisions which create a lot with an existing habitable residence shall have that lot excluded from any requirements for park dedication fees. 
(3)  Review of cash in lieu maximum. City council shall review the maximum cash in lieu of land payment at least every two years to ensure that it remains consistent with park and trail system development costs. 
(4)  Commercial and industrial land uses. Dedication requirement of five percent of land or equivalent market value in cash. In no event shall the cash in lieu of land payment exceed $2,000.00 per acre of land proposed for development. 
(5)  Schools, religious institutions, and other nonprofit organizations. Dedication requirement shall be determined by city council based on discussion with the school district or nonprofit agency. Recommendations will be based on anticipated use of city park facilities by the school or organization, and shall consider agreements for cooperative use of school recreational facilities. 
(6)  Determination of fair market value. To determine the fair market value of the undeveloped land, the developer shall submit an appraisal at the time of preliminary plat application. The city will then obtain a review appraisal as a validation of the developer's appraisal. If city staff and the developer are unable to agree on fair market value, city council will make the determination of fair market value. 
(7)  Lands designated on official map or parks, trails, and open space plan. Where a proposed park, playground, trail, or open space area indicated in the city parks, trails, and open space plan or comprehensive plan is located in whole or in part within a proposed subdivision, all or part of the proposed site shall be designated as such and should be dedicated to the city based on the area of land dedication required by this chapter. 
(8)  Deviation from required dedication. The dedication requirements based on the development's proportional share of the city park system are presumptively appropriate. 
(9)  Wetlands and ponding areas. Existing wetlands and drainageways accepted by the city shall not be considered in the park land and/or cash contribution to the city. 
(g)  Land dedication/payment of fees. 
(1)  Land dedication. When land is to be dedicated to satisfy the park dedication requirement, separate lots or outlots shall be indicated on the plat drawings for the area to be dedicated. Such lots or outlot shall be deeded to the city prior to the issuance of any building permits within the plat. The developer shall be responsible for finished grading, ground cover, and construction of trails in all lands to be dedicated to the city. No credit toward the required dedication shall be given for this work, except that credit for the cost of improvements to trails included in the city's adopted trail plan may be given. 
(2)  Cash fee. When a cash fee is to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the payment of such fee shall be required as follows: 
a.  For residential and commercial/industrial developments, the fee shall be paid prior to the city's release of the signed final plat Mylars for recording with the county. The amount of any required cash contribution shall be calculated based on the rates established by the city and in effect as of the date of the release of the final plat for filing. 
b.  Park dedication is required for all newly created lots or parcels. 
c.  In plats that include outlots for future development, the subdivider may pay to the city the development's proportional share for the entire subdivision, including the outlots; or the development's proportional share excluding such outlots, providing that the park dedication requirement shall be satisfied when such outlots are replatted in which the amount of any required cash contribution shall be calculated based on the rates established by the city and in effect as of the date of the release of the final plat for filing. 
(h)  Park fund. 
(1)  Purpose. Cash payments shall be placed by the city in a special fund and used only for the acquisition of land for parks, trails, playgrounds, public open space, development of existing park and playground sites, public open space, and debt retirement in connection with land previously acquired for public purposes. 
(2)  Annual financial report. Each year the parks commission shall present to city council, in such detail as city council shall require, its estimate of the financial needs of the parks commission for the ensuring fiscal year. 
(3)  Gifts and donations. The parks commission is authorized to receive gifts, devises, bequests, endowments, or other donations of money and property on behalf of the city. All monies received shall be deposited in the park fund.

ARTICLE IX. - WETLANDS PROTECTION 

Sec. 66-251. - Intent and purpose. 
(a)  Intent. 
(1)  The city finds that wetlands serve a variety of beneficial functions and values. Wetlands maintain water quality, reduce flooding and erosion, provide food and habitat for wildlife, provide open space, and are an integral part of the city's environment. Wetlands are important physical, educational, ecological, aesthetic, recreational, and economic assets to the city. They are critical to the city's supply of clean drinking water, stormwater management, and other aspects of health, safety, and general welfare. Regulating wetlands and the land uses around them is therefore in the public interest. 
(2)  In order to protect wetlands, this chapter incorporates by reference the Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act of 1991 (hereinafter referred to as the WCA) and any future amendments adopted by the legislature. The city has determined that some activities are exempted from the provisions of the WCA. Any activities exempted from the provisions of the WCA are also exempted from the requirements of this chapter, insofar as they relate to the WCA. The provisions of this chapter cover all wetlands, including those governed by the department of natural resources. 
(3)  Additional pollution control agency regulations. 
a.  In addition to having regulations that affect the physical impacts within wetland areas, the state pollution control agency (PCA) has required the city to address potential non-point source impacts from future development with the establishment of buffer strip standards to complement the existing stormwater standards. A buffer strip is an upland area left in its (or restored to its) natural (non-turf grass) state that surrounds a wetland or stormwater pond and reduces negative impacts to wetlands from adjacent development. 
b.  Catchbasins and storm sewers typically collect street and front yard drainage and direct the drainage to an appropriately sized pond for pre-treatment prior to discharge to a wetland or water body. Back yard drainage typically reaches wetlands or water bodies without any pretreatment thereby allowing lawn and garden chemicals, sediments, pet wastes, fertilizer, and other types of contaminants to directly impact the receiving water body. 
(4)  The city has found that wetlands vary significantly in the degree that they have been altered. Wetlands exhibit great variations in their overall quality. Therefore, the city has determined that it is necessary and beneficial to protect wetlands based on their needs for their existing quality. 
(b)  Purpose. Through the adoption and enforcement of this chapter, the city shall promote the general health, safety, and welfare of its residents by both conserving and protecting wetlands, and requiring sound management practices and mitigation when development occurs in the vicinity of wetlands. Through the implementation of this chapter, the city seeks to accomplish the following: 
(1)  To satisfy the requirements of the WCA as it may be amended and thereby achieve no net loss of wetlands within the city. 
(2)  To satisfy the requirements of the Minnesota PCA by treating non-point source pollution that currently is not treated by ponds (primarily back yard drainage) and to limit disturbance from adjacent development by utilizing the appropriately sized buffer strip. 
(3)  To balance the needs to preserve and protect natural resources and systems with both the rights of private property owners and the need to support the efficient use of developable land within the city. 
(4)  To promote water quality by maintaining the ability of wetlands to recharge groundwater and receive the discharge of groundwater, to retain sediment and toxins, and to filter nutrients from surface water runoff before it discharges into the Rum and Sunrise Rivers, thus avoiding the contamination and eutrophication of these water features. 
(5)  To provide wildlife habitat and thereby support the maintenance of diversity of both plant and animal species within the city. 
(6)  To prevent property damage and the losses associated with flood conditions, and reduce erosion problems. 
(7)  To preserve the natural character of the landscape through the restoration of wetland ecosystems. 
(Ord. of 10-17-2007, § 10(10-1)) 
Sec. 66-252. - Scope of application. 
(a)  Applicants that have preliminary plat approvals previously obtained or have subdivision approvals within 60 days after council's approval of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived are exempt from this chapter. Any subdivisions submitted for approval 60 days or more after the council formally approves the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be subject to this chapter. 
(b)  This article shall apply to any applicant for a subdivision approval, or a grading, excavation, or mining permit to allow wetland disturbing activities. No subdivision approval or grading permit to allow wetland disturbing activities shall be issued until approval of the wetland replacement plan application or a certificate of exemption has been obtained in strict conformance with the provisions of this article and the Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act. This article applies to all land, public or private, located within the city. 
(c)  This article shall apply to all land containing wetlands, rivers, lakes, or streams, and land within the setback and buffer areas required by this article. Wetlands, rivers, lakes, or streams shall be subject to the requirements established herein, as well as restrictions and requirements established by other applicable federal, state, and city ordinances and regulations. These wetland protection regulations shall not be construed to allow anything that is otherwise prohibited in the zoning district where the wetland area is located. 
(d)  A wetland is land that meets the definition of "wetlands" set forth in the Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act. It will be the responsibility of an applicant to have wetlands that are located on their property delineated by approved methods as stated in the Wetland Conservation Act. All delineations must be reviewed by the city's Wetland Conservation Act agent for approval. 
(Ord. of 10-17-2007, § 10(10-2))

(1)  Building elevation standards shall conform to the standards of the water management plan. 
(2)  Structures intended to provide access across a wetland shall be prohibited unless a permit is obtained in conformance with WCA regulations. 
(3)  The Minnesota PCA's best management practices shall be followed to avoid erosion and sedimentation during construction processes. 
(4)  The city engineer shall identify all signs associated with the proposed plat as it pertains to wetland demarcation signs, wetland buffers, or other environmental educational signs related to the protection of natural resources to the proposed subdivision. Installation of such signs shall be at the expense of the developer. 
(5)  The developer shall install corner markers delineating wetland buffer locations. 
(Ord. of 10-17-2007, § 10(10-3)) 
Sec. 66-254. - Wetland alteration. 
    This article follows the requirements of the Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act with the following exception: A wetland alteration permit will not be issued for dredging, excavating, or grading in all wetlands (including those not regulated by WCA) unless the following standards are followed: 
(1)  The dredging will not have a net adverse effect on the ecological and hydrological characteristics of the wetland. A wetland alteration plan shall be submitted, reviewed, and approved by the local government unit (LGU) representative. If the LGU representative determines a net impact, the wetland alteration plan shall follow WCA provisions for wildlife habitat improvements in wetlands. 
(2)  It shall be located so as to minimize the impact on vegetation. Exceptions may be allowed in basins dominated by invasive exotic species such as reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea). 
(3)  It shall not adversely change water flow. 
(4)  The size of the dredged area shall be limited to the minimum required for the proposed action. 
(5)  Disposal of the dredged material is prohibited within the wetland area unless it is part of an approved wetland replacement plan. 
(6)  Disposal of any dredged material shall include proper erosion control and nutrient retention measures. 
(7)  Dredging in any wetland area is prohibited during waterfowl breeding season or fish spawning season (April 1-July 31), unless it is determined by the city that the wetland is not used for waterfowl breeding or fish spawning. 
(Ord. of 10-17-2007, § 10(10-4)) 
Sec. 66-255. - Buffer strips. 
    For subdivisions approved 60 days after the ordinance from which this chapter is derived was passed by city council, a buffer strip shall be maintained abutting all wetlands. 
(1)  Design standards. 
a.  Buffer strip vegetation shall be considered adequate when the buffer has a continuous, dense layer of perennial grasses, flowers, trees and/or shrubs that have been undisturbed for at least ten consecutive years. Vegetation shall be considered unacceptable if: 
1.  It is composed of 20 percent or greater noxious weeds and/or invasive species; 
2.  Topography or sparse vegetation tends to channelize the flow of surface water; or 
3.  For some other reason, the vegetation is unlikely to retain nutrients and sediment. 
b.  Where buffer strips or a portion thereof are not vegetated or have been cultivated or otherwise disturbed within ten years of the permit application, such areas shall be replanted and maintained according to each of the following standards: 
1.  Buffer strips shall be planted with a seed mix containing board of water and soil resources (BWSR) approved seeding mix and seeding rates, except for a one time planting of annual nurse or cover crop such as oats or rye. 
2.  Native shrubs or trees may be substituted for forbs. Shrubs and/or trees shall be planted at a rate of 60 plants per acre. Shrubs and/or trees shall be distributed so as to provide a natural appearance and shall not be planted in rows. Plants shall be of local ecotype, and represent species that were historically part of the native vegetation of the county. 
3.  Native grasses, forbs, trees, and shrubs shall be planted by a qualified contractor utilizing methods described in the BWSR-Restoring and Managing Native Wetland and Upland Vegetation. 
4.  No fertilizer shall be used in establishing new buffer areas. 
5.  Buffer strips (both natural and created) shall be protected by erosion control measures as determined by the city. These must be employed during construction until permanent ground cover is established to prevent siltation of the buffer area and wetland. 
6.  A walking trail may be established within a wetland buffer area. The trail should be constructed to minimize erosion. An undisturbed area of vegetative buffer at least ten feet in width should remain between the trail and the wetland edge. 
7.  A wetland strip landscaping plan will need to be submitted to the local government unit WCA agent for approval. At a minimum, this plan shall include the following: 
(i)  A plan sheet that shows the location of the buffers within the subdivision. This sheet should also show buffers that are considered acceptable in their current state and identify them as areas that shall not be disturbed during grading. 
(ii)  For buffer areas that are not acceptable, a plan shall be developed that provides species and planting and/or seeding locations. 
(iii)  The following minimum maintenance will be required for seeded areas: 
A.  Establishment (spring seeding): Prepare site-late April-May; seed-May 1-July 1. 
B.  Maintenance: Mow (6-10 inches)-July 15-August 15; mow-September 1 (optional); weed control-mowing should keep annual weeds down; spot spray thistles, etc. 
C.  Establishment (fall seeding): Prepare site-late August-early September; seed-late September to freeze up. 
D.  Maintenance (following season): Mow (6-10 inches)-June 15-August 15; mow-September 1 (optional); weed control-mowing should keep annual weeds down; spot spray thistles, etc.; applicants may obtain from the city a set of standard seeding and planting specifications for buffer areas which meet all the city requirements. 
(2)  Buffer strip maintenance. 
a.  The clearing and removal of vegetation in the buffer area is prohibited, except for selective clearing and pruning of invasive species, noxious weeds, and individual trees and shrubs which are dead or diseased. 
b.  Where acceptable to adjacent properties, owners are encouraged to leave dead trees and branches in the buffer area because they are part of the native natural environment and provide necessary habitat to many birds and native wildlife. 
c.  All buffer areas are measured from the delineated wetland edge as marked in the field. 
d.  Dumping of vegetative waste is prohibited within the buffer strip. 
(3)  Buffer strip width. 
a.  Table 1 provides the wetland buffer average required for each water body type. The buffer width can be adjusted along the wetland boundary as long as the width does not fall below the minimum and the average acres requirements are met. The Wetland Conservation Act agent or city council will approve the final buffers variations and take into consideration guidance as provided in Exhibit A.

Exhibit A provides guidance for buffer strip widths that are presented in Table 1.   
b.  Any wetland restored, relocated, replaced, or enhanced because of wetland alterations should have at least the minimum buffer area required for the type of wetland involved. 
c.  For roadways, trails, and driveways, or portions thereof, that are routed across wetlands and are subject to WCA replacement requirements, buffer will be required on the fill slope but fill should not be expanded to accommodate additional wetland buffer. 
d.  If the area of the buffer has a pre-construction slope of 12 percent or greater, the buffer shall be at the maximum width for the applicant's water body type. The use of a meandering buffer area to maintain a natural appearance is encouraged but not required in areas of flat topography. 
e.  For all lots adjacent to the water bodies, the maximum easement on the property shall be 25 feet. The remainder of the upland buffer and the wetland area will become an outlot to the development. The establishment of the buffer area will be the responsibility of the developer.

(Ord. No. 15, Second Series, 1-6-2010) 
Sec. 74-214. - Specific standards. 
    In addition to the general standards specified in [section 74-213], no conditional use permit shall be granted for transmission line unless and until the city council determines that all of the following specific standards are met. 
(a)  Utility poles and appurtenances (such as wires) over 40 feet in height and freestanding upon the ground, and transmission lines that are not subject to state review under the Minnesota power plant siting must comply and participate in the following process: 
Phase I: Preliminary process before a transmission line conditional use permit application is submitted: 
(1)  Before submitting a conditional use permit application, the applicant must participate in a work group process. The work group will consist of one council member, one member from each of the city's commissions (planning, parks, and roads); and the city planner. The work group will include at least one city resident appointed by city council. Up to two additional residents may be appointed as deemed appropriate and necessary by the city council. 
(2)  The work group will meet with the applicant to review the proposed project and alternatives for the proposed locations. The applicant must submit an analysis to the work group that includes but is not limited to the following: 
a.  Documentation demonstrating the need and purpose for such a transmission line so alternatives to the transmission line can be adequately assessed; 
b.  All of the alternatives and associated costs considered by the applicant; 
c.  Alternative locations; 
d.  A "no-build" alternative that discusses measures that could be taken in an attempt to meet the documented need without construction of the transmission line; and 
e.  Designation of the applicant's preferred location. 
(b)  The city may retain an independent technical expert paid for by the applicant to assist the work group. The city will advise the applicant of the identity of the expert and the applicant will have five business days to object to the expert after receiving notice from the city. If the applicant does not object to the expert within that time, the expert will be deemed to be acceptable. If the applicant objects to the expert, the work group will give good faith consideration to the objection and determine whether to use the expert or select another one. If another is selected, the process set forth above will be used for the selection of the expert. The work group will conduct an analysis of the alternatives and present its report to the city's planning commission. The city's planning commission, based on the work group submittals and applicant presentations, will narrow the alternatives for the siting of the transmission line or facility. One of those alternatives may be a no-build alternative. 
(c)  Following the phase I process, the applicant may submit an application for a conditional use permit. In addition to the other information required by the city for a conditional use permit application, the application must include the following information for each alternative selected by the planning commission: 
(1)  The cost; 
(2)  The amount of vegetation that would be removed or damaged; 
(3)  For an electric transmission line, a summary of current research regarding the health effects of EMF levels, conducted by health and scientific professionals, including those who do and do not receive utility sponsorship; 
(4)  For an electric transmission line, the EMF levels under maximum and average anticipated loading at the base of the utility poles, underneath the wires between the poles, at ground level above underground wires, at the edge of the property line, at the edge of the closest habitable building along the proposed route, and at the point above ground where there would be the greatest EMF level; 
(5)  For an electric transmission line, a description of the reasonable and prudent measures that the applicant would take to minimize EMF levels along all alternative routes; 
(6)  Depictions of the views of the proposed transmission line, if above ground, from at least two directions selected by city staff; 
(7)  A statement of ownership interest in the property for which the conditional use permit is requested; 
(8)  A description of the potential environmental impacts for each alternative; 
(9)  A proposed timeline for each alternative to include planning, permitting, construction, and activation; 
(10)  All necessary data to incorporate into the city's emergency management plan; and 
(11)  Other information, data, surveys, and studies that may be reasonably required by the work group. 
(d)  The applicant must comply with all of the following unless the applicant shows that compliance is not reasonable or prudent: 
(1)  The routes must be on or along corridors presently used for public roads, railroads, or above-ground utilities, or on corridors that were previously used for such purposes and are being retained for future public or utility purposes; 
(2)  Along arterial or collector streets, as identified in the city's comprehensive plan, transportation section, instead of local streets; 
(3)  Along platted utility easements in residential zones which do not abut public roads or roadway easements may not be used, unless the lines are placed underground; and 
(4)  Along privately acquired easements. 
(e)  After receiving a complete application, the planning commission must hold a public hearing on the application. At least ten days before the hearing, the city must mail notice of the hearing to all affected owners of property, which shall be all property wholly or partially within a 1,000-foot radius of any portion of the alternative locations to be presented to the planning commission. 
The city will ensure notice is mailed to affected property owners that provides for a description of the project; description of the potential impacts to include but not limited to pole heights, clearing limits, tree removal, and easement distances; and, other relevant information regarding the proposed transmission line such as size/capacity, description of the need and land acquisition issues. 
(f)  Following the public hearing, the planning commission will recommend a preferred alternative to the city council. The city council may accept the recommendation, modify the recommendation, or reject the recommendation by a majority vote of the members present. The planning commission may recommend and the city council may impose reasonable conditions as part of the permit. 
(g)  In making their decisions, the planning commission and city council must consider the following factors: 
(1)  The potential adverse aesthetic, economic, environmental, social, health, and/or safety impacts on adjacent properties or people; 
(2)  The potential interference with public use of public property; 
(3)  The applicant's need to adequately and reliably serve customers within the relevant service area now and in the foreseeable future; 
(4)  Compliance with the requirements in section [74-214] and other ordinances relating to utility facilities in the right-of-way; 
(5)  Cost; and 
(6)  Traffic impacts. 
(h)  The applicant may notify the city and request selection of a different alternative after the city council's action if the applicant believes that it cannot use the selected alternative because of a reason that was beyond its own control and not apparent during the selection process. The city council may approve a different alternative that has been subject to phase 1 requirements if it finds that the applicant is prevented from using the selected location. 
(i)  At a minimum, conditions addressed in the permit required by this article must address the following items: 
(1)  A description of any easements, as proposed, for the placement of a transmission line by the power or communications company, subject to availability; 
(2)  Address the requirements of the city's tree preservation ordinance; 
(3)  Address the requirements and comply with all applicable elements of the city's comprehensive plan, zoning ordinance, and engineering standards manual. 
(j)  Phase II: site plan. 
(1)  The applicant must apply for site plan approval after receiving the conditional use permit and before beginning construction. At the applicant's request, the city council may choose to consider the site plan at the time of the conditional use permit. The application must comply with the conditions specified in subsections (a) through (e). The applicant must have sufficient interest in the property on which the transmission lines are to be located and for which the site plan review is requested. 
(2)  The applicant must submit a landscape plan prepared by a registered landscape architect. The plan must be designed to mitigate the amount of trees removed for the transmission line and must minimize the visual impact on abutting properties caused by the transmission line. The landscape plan will be subject to review and approval by the city. The applicant must submit a letter of credit or cash escrow in an amount equal to at least 150 percent of the approved estimated landscaping cost. The landscaping must be installed and maintained in compliance with code provisions and the plan as approved by the city. With the concurrence of the abutting property owner, the landscape plan may include plantings on abutting property; in which case, the applicant will be responsible for installation, and the abutting property owner will be responsible for the maintenance of the landscaping. 
(3)  The applicant must design the transmission line to minimize its visual impact. The applicant must submit configuration, material, and color options that are technically feasible. The city may require the applicant to design the transmission line in a manner that reduces the visual impact of the project, including regulating the height and spacing of utility poles. Utility poles may not exceed 80 feet in height, except when needed to cross a major roadway such as a freeway or to maintain horizontal alignment along uneven rights-of-way or easements. 
(4)  The line must not interfere with the use of public rights-of-way, including use for vehicular and pedestrian travel, snow storage, and lateral support. 
(5)  The applicant and any subsequent owner must continually maintain the transmission line in good condition, securing poles and/or guy wires to the ground, and replacing poles that are in a deteriorated condition.

10. - Variances. 
A.  Purpose.

Such application shall also include written and graphic materials fully explaining the requested variance.

The 60 day review period can be extended an additional 60 days pursuant to Minn. Stats. § 15.99. If the initial 60-day review period is extended, the city must provide written notice of the extension to the applicant before the end of the initial review period. 
2)  Upon receipt of a complete application, as determined by the city, and following preliminary staff analysis of the application, the city, when appropriate, shall establish a time and place for consideration of the application by the planning commission. At least ten days before the date of the meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be published in the official newspaper and mailed to all owners of land within 350 feet of the boundary of the property in question in all business districts and R-1 and R-2 districts, and 1,250 feet of the boundary of the property in question in the RR district. 
3)  Failure of a property owner to receive said notice shall not invalidate any such proceedings as set forth within this chapter provided a bona fide attempt to comply with the provisions of this chapter has been made. A copy of the notice and a list of the property owners and addresses to which the notice was sent shall be made a part of the record. 
D.  Procedure. 
1)  The planning commission shall not recommend approval of any variance application unless it finds that failure to grant the variance will result in undue hardship on the applicant and, as may be applicable, all of the following hardship criteria have been met: 
a.  To hear requests for variances from the literal provisions of the ordinance in instances where their strict enforcement would cause undue hardship because of circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration, and to grant such variances only when it is demonstrated that such actions will be in keeping with the spirit and intent or the ordinance. "Undue hardship" as used in conjunction with the granting of a variance means the property in question cannot be put to a reasonable use if used under conditions allowed by the official controls, the plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the property not created by the landowner, and the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. Economic considerations alone shall not constitute an undue hardship if reasonable use for the property exists under the terms of the ordinance. Undue hardship also includes, but is not limited to, inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems. 
b.  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative officer in the enforcement of the zoning ordinance. 
2)  The city shall have the authority to request additional information from the applicant. 
3)  The applicant or the applicant's representative may appear before the planning commission to present information and answer questions concerning the request. 
4)  The planning commission shall make a finding of fact and make a recommendation on such actions or conditions relating to the request as it deems necessary to carry out the purpose of this chapter. Such recommendations shall be in writing and accompanied by the report and recommendation of the city staff. 
5)  Upon receiving the report and recommendation of the planning commission and the city staff, the city shall schedule the application for consideration by the city council. Such reports and recommendations shall be entered in and made part of the permanent record. 
6)  Approval of the request shall require passage by the majority of the entire city council. 
7)  In granting a variance, the city council, after considering the recommendations of the city staff and the planning commission, shall impose such conditions as it deems necessary to carry out the purpose of this chapter. 
E.  Expiration. Any variance granted by the city shall run with the land and shall be perpetual. However, if no building permit has been issued or substantial work performed on the project within one year of approval, then the variance shall be null and void. The city council may extend the period for construction upon finding that the interest of the owners of neighboring properties will not be adversely affected by such extension. If the variance is part of an approved site and building plan, extension of the time for construction shall be contingent upon a similar extension of the time for the site and building plan by the city council as required by this chapter. Once the project is completed as approved, the variance becomes perpetual. 
F.  Specific project. A variance shall be valid only for the project for which it was granted. Construction of any project shall be in substantial compliance with the building plans and specifications reviewed and approved by the city. 
G.  Certification of taxes paid. Prior to approving an application for a variance, the applicant shall provide certification to the city that there are no delinquent property taxes, special assessments, interest, or city utility fees due upon the parcel of land to which the variance application relates. 
H.  Records of variances. A certified copy of any variance shall be filed with the Anoka County Recorder or Registrar of Titles. The city shall maintain a record of all variances issued including information on the use, location, conditions imposed by the city council, time limits, review dates, and such other information as may be appropriate. 
I.  Reapplication. No application for a variance for a particular use on a particular parcel shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of denial of the previous application unless a decision to reconsider such matter is made by a majority vote of the full city council. 
J.  Revocation. 
1)  A violation of any condition set forth in a variance shall be a violation of this chapter, and failure to correct said violation within 30 days of written notice of the violation from the city may result in revocation of the permit. The city council may grant an extension of up to 60 days to correct the violation(s). 
[2])  Revocation shall not occur earlier than ten city business days from the time the written notice of revocation is served upon the permittee or, if a hearing is requested, until written notice of the city council action has been served on the permittee. 
[3])  Notice to the permittee shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail at the address designated in the permit application. Such written notice of revocation shall contain: 
a)  The effective date of the revocation; 
b)  The nature of the violation(s) constituting the basis of the revocation; 
c)  The facts which support the conclusion that a violation(s) have occurred; and

(Ord. No. 19, Second Series, 5-5-2010) 
SECTION 05. - NONCONFORMITIES 

1. - Purpose. 
    Within the zoning districts established by this chapter, or amendments that may later be adopted, situations may occur where, as a result of the requirements contained in this chapter, an existing lot, structure, site improvement, or use does not conform to one or more of the requirements of this chapter. It is the intent of this section to regulate such nonconforming situations to accomplish the following: 
A.  Recognize the existence of uses and structures which were lawful when established but which no longer meet all ordinance requirements. 
B.  Discourage the enlargement, expansion, intensification, or extension of any nonconforming use or structure and discourage any increase in the impact of a nonconforming use or structure on adjacent properties. Only exceptional cases of any expansion or intensification of a nonconforming use will be permitted and only after city approval of a variance. 
C.  Encourage the elimination of nonconforming uses and structures or reduce their impact on adjacent properties. 
2. - Nonconforming use. 
    A nonconforming use may be continued, including through repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance, or improvement, but not including expansion unless: 
A.  The nonconforming [use] or occupancy is discontinued for a period of more than one year. 
B.  Any nonconforming use is destroyed by fire to the extent of 50 percent of its market value, and no building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is damaged. In such a case, any such building permit shall be subject to reasonable conditions in order to mitigate any newly created impact on adjacent property. 
C.  A nonconforming use may not be changed to another nonconforming use. 
D.  When any nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use, it may not be later changed to a nonconforming use. 
E.  A nonconforming use may be changed to lessen the nonconformity, but once lessened, the use may not be changed to increase the nonconformity. 
3. - Nonconforming lot of record. 
    Any separate lot or parcel that was legally created and is of record with the Anoka County Recorder's Office, but became nonconforming as a result of the adoption of this chapter, may be used for the legal use for which it is zoned subject to the following: 
A.  The lot shall have frontage on an improved public road or on a private road approved by the city council. The city council must, by resolution, specify the private road, verify that the private road is capable of supporting emergency vehicles, and specify that provisions exist for ongoing maintenance of the private road. 
B.  Vacant lots of record may be allowed as building sites without variances from lot size requirements provided the use is permitted in the zoning district, the lot(s) was created compliant with official controls in effect at the time, sewage treatment is in compliance with MPCA subsurface sewage treatment system, MN Rules 7080-7083, and setback requirements of this ordinance are met. 
C.  A vacant lot or parcel not served by public sewer may be used for a permitted use provided it has at least one acre of buildable area, and it can be demonstrated that a safe and adequate sewage treatment system can be installed to serve such use and meet required setbacks and lot coverage. 
D.  If in the case of two or more contiguous lots or parcels of land under single ownership, any individual lot or parcel does not meet the minimum requirements of this ordinance, such individual lot or parcel shall not be considered as a separate parcel of land for purposes of sale or development, but must be combined with adjacent lots so the combination of lots will equal one or more parcels of land meeting the full requirements of this section or the provisions of the zoning district in which the property is located, whichever is more restrictive. In no circumstances will there be approval of any proposal for multiple lot developments based upon lots of record that do not conform to the provisions of the existing zoning district. 
  
E.  A conforming lot shall not be reduced in size so that it becomes nonconforming in any respect under the conditions of this chapter. A nonconforming lot may be reduced in size but only if it is combined with other existing lots of record. Any lot currently nonconforming or that would become nonconforming due to a split, the property owner would cede property rights. 
F.  Additions to principal or accessory buildings or structures located on nonconforming lots may be permitted without a variance provided that any such addition meets all minimum setback and lot coverage requirements of the zoning district in which it is located, and that long-term sewage disposal needs can be met. 
G.  Nonconforming lots may be combined for tax purposes with a contiguous lot or lots, but may not be re-subdivided into a nonconforming lot even if the division is consistent with the original lot configuration. 
4. - Nonconforming structures. 
A.  Nonconforming structures may not be enlarged or altered in a way that increases their nonconformity. They must comply with the following: 
1)  Expansion or alteration of a nonconforming structure may be permitted provided the expansion meets the required setbacks from the public right-of-way, side and rear lot lines, wetlands, lakes, sewer treatment system, well, and all other requirements of this chapter. 
2)  Long-term sewage disposal needs can be met on lots that are not served by public sewer. 
  
B.  All construction projects for which a valid building permit was granted before the effective date of this chapter may be completed even if the structure will not meet the newly adopted provisions of this chapter. 
C.  Any nonconforming use is destroyed by fire to the extent of 50 percent of its market value, and no building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is damaged. In such a case, any such building permit shall be subject to reasonable conditions in order to mitigate any newly created impact on adjacent property. 
5. - Nonconforming site improvements. 
A.  Upon any change in occupancy, nonconforming paved parking areas may continue to be used without improvement if the number of parking spaces supplied remains adequate according to the regulations of this chapter, and the surface has not, in the city's judgment, deteriorated so as to be beyond repair. If the parking lot is beyond repair or not paved, then the parking lot surface must be paved and otherwise brought into conformance with this chapter. 
B.  Multiple occupancy building. If the nonconformity is not increased, a building permit may be issued for a portion of a multiple occupancy building without bringing the existing site conditions into compliance. 
C.  When expanding an existing nonconforming site, the newly constructed portion of the site shall meet all requirements of this chapter. 
D.  If a multiple occupancy building becomes completely vacant, the existing site conditions shall be brought into compliance with this chapter prior to future occupancy.

    The purpose of this section is to create standards for outdoor lighting so that it does not interfere with the reasonable use and enjoyment of property within the city. It is the intent of this section to encourage lighting practices and systems which will reduce light pollution while increasing nighttime safety, utility, security, and productivity. This is done through regulation of types, kind, construction, installations, and use of outdoor electrically powered illuminating devices. 
    The standards of this section shall not apply to the following: 
A.  Temporary holiday lighting. This chapter does not prohibit the use of temporary outdoor lighting used during customary holiday seasons as long as the lighting does not create an undue hardship to neighboring properties or create a traffic hazard. 
B.  Civic event lighting. This section does not prohibit the temporary outdoor lighting used for civic celebrations and promotions. 
C.  Emergency lighting. This section does not prohibit the use of outdoor lighting by police, fire, and rescue authorities. 
2. - Nonconforming uses. 
A.  All permitted outdoor lighting fixtures lawfully existing and legally installed prior to the effective date of this section are exempt from the regulations contained in this section. Replacement of the light source cannot exceed existing intensity/footcandles. 
B.  Whenever an outdoor light fixture that existed on the effective date of this section is replaced by a new outdoor light fixture, the new fixture must meet the standards of this section. 
3. - Method of measuring light intensity. 
    The footcandle level of a light source shall be taken after dark with the light meter held six inches above the ground with the meter facing the light source. A reading shall be taken with the light source on, and then with the light source off. The difference between the two readings will be identified as the illumination intensity. 
4. - Performance standards. 
A.  Residential lighting standards. In all residential districts, any lighting used to illuminate an off-street parking area or other structure or area shall be arranged to deflect light away from any adjoining residential property or from the public street. 
1)  Shielding. The light source shall be hooded or controlled so as not to light adjacent property in excess of the maximum intensity as defined below. Bare light bulbs shall not be permitted in view of adjacent property or public rights-of-way. 
2)  Intensity. No light source or combination thereof which casts light on a public street shall exceed one footcandle meter reading as measured from the centerline of said street, nor shall any light source or combination thereof which casts light on adjacent property exceed 0.5 footcandle as measured at any point of the property line. 
B.  Business/industrial lighting standards. Any lighting used to illuminate an off-street parking area or other structure or area shall be arranged to deflect light away from any adjoining property or from the public street. 
1)  Shielding. The light source shall be hooded or controlled so as not to light adjacent property in excess of the maximum intensity as defined below. The lighting shall contain a shield that directs and cuts off the light at an angle of 90 degrees or less. 
2)  Intensity. No light source or combination thereof which cast light on a public street shall exceed one footcandle meter reading as measured from the centerline of said street, nor shall any light source or combination thereof which cast light on adjacent property exceed 0.5 footcandle as measured at any point of the property line. 
3)  Height. The maximum height above the ground grade permitted for light sources mounted on a pole is 30 feet except by conditional use permit. A light source mounted on a building shall not exceed the height of the building, and no light sources shall be located on the roof unless said light enhances the architectural feature of the building and is approved by city council. 
4)  Location. The light source of an outdoor light fixture shall be set back a minimum of five feet from a street right-of-way and five feet from an interior side or rear lot line. 
5)  Hours of lighting. The city may also limit the hours of operation of outdoor lighting if it is deemed necessary to reduce impacts on surrounding properties. 
5. - Prohibitions. 
    No flickering, revolving, or flashing lights other than public safety lights and devices shall be permitted in any zoning district. 
6. Submission of plans. 
    For any permits requiring outdoor lighting, the applicant shall submit evidence that the proposed outdoor lighting will comply with this section. The submission shall contain the following:

SECTION 56. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) DISTRICT 

1. - Purpose. 
    The primary purpose of the planned unit development (PUD) provisions is to allow flexibility and variation from conventional ordinance standards in exchange for higher standards of development design and creativity, architectural control, natural resource protection, landscaping, public parks, public and private open space protection, pedestrian access, and multi-use corridor opportunities. The PUD provisions are also intended to promote the efficient use of land and promote cost-effective public and private infrastructure systems. 
    Public benefit: The public benefits to the surrounding neighborhood and the city as a whole that are intended to be derived from the approval of a planned unit development include, but are not limited to: 
A.  Preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics and open space. 
B.  A pattern of development which preserves natural vegetation, topographic and geologic features. 
C.  Preservation and enhancement of historic and natural resources that significantly contribute to the character of the city. 
D.  Use of design, landscape, or architectural features to create a pleasing environment or other special development features.

4. - Development standards. 
    The development standards for a PUD shall be guided by the underlying zoning district and established with PUD approval with the exception of the following standards: 
A.  Minimum area for a PUD. The minimum total area required for a PUD shall be three acres of contiguous upland (excluding wetlands). Tracts of land less than three acres may qualify only if the applicant can show that the minimum lot area requirement should be waived because a PUD is in the public interest and that one or both of the following conditions exist: 
1)  Unusual physical features of the property itself or of the surrounding neighborhood are such that development under the standard provisions of the normal district would not be appropriate in order to conserve a physical or terrain feature of importance to the neighborhood or community. 
2)  The property is adjacent to or across the street from property that has been developed under the provisions of this section and will contribute to the amenities of the neighborhood. 
B.  Commercial and industrial sites. All commercial and/or industrial sites shall at a minimum have two principal buildings or two principal uses on site to qualify as a PUD. All commercial and/or industrial sites that have two or more principal buildings must be processed as a PUD. 
C.  Open space. A primary function for a PUD is to encourage development that preserves and enhances the natural characteristics and valuable natural resources of a site and not force intense developments that use all portions of a given site to arrive at the maximum intensity or density allowed. In evaluating each individual proposal, the recognition of this objective will be a basic consideration in granting approval or denial. All open space shall be labeled as such and as to its intent or designed functions. 
D.  Relationship to adjacent areas. The design of a PUD shall take into account the relationship of the site to the surrounding areas. The perimeter of the PUD shall be so designed to minimize any undesirable impact of the development on adjacent properties and, conversely, to minimize any undesirable impact of adjacent land use and development characteristics on the PUD. 
5. - Procedure and administration. 
A.  Pre-application meeting. Prior to submission of any plan for consideration of the planning commission and city council, the applicant shall meet with city staff to discuss the contemplated project relative to community development objectives for the area in question to learn what procedural steps and exhibits shall be required.

B.  Concept plan review. Before submitting an application for preliminary plan review, the applicant shall submit a concept plan of the proposed PUD to be reviewed by the planning commission and city council. The concept plan review allows the applicant to receive general, non-binding feedback from the planning commission and city council before the applicant prepares and submits a more detailed application for preliminary plan review. 
C.  Preliminary plan review. The applicant for a PUD shall apply for preliminary plan review. The planning commission shall make a recommendation to the city council to approve or deny the preliminary plan and the council shall take final action on the application.

6. - Criteria for granting a PUD. 
    The planning commission may recommend, and the city council may act to approve or deny, a preliminary or final plan for a PUD in any district. The planning commission, in making a recommendation, and the city council, in acting upon a plan, shall consider the following factors; however, nothing herein shall be meant to guarantee approval of such PUD: 
A.  The consistency of the proposed PUD with the city's comprehensive plan; 
B.  The proposed uses compliance with the standards and criteria of the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations; 
C.  The extent to which the proposed PUD is designed to form a desirable and unified environment within its own boundaries in terms of relationship of structures, patterns of circulation, visual character, and sufficiency of drainage and utilities; 
D.  The extent to which the proposed uses will be compatible with present and planned uses in the surrounding area; 
E.  The impact of the proposed uses on the health, safety, and general welfare of the occupants of the surrounding area; 
F.  The burden or impact created by the PUD on parks, schools, streets, and other public facilities and utilities; 
G.  The sufficiency of each phase of the PUD to ensure its construction and operation is feasible without dependence upon any subsequent phase; 
G. [H.]  The impact of the PUD on environmental quality, property values, scenic views, and preservation of significant natural resources and amenities of the surrounding area; and 
H. [I.]  That any exceptions to city ordinances, policies, or regulations are justified by the design or development of the proposed use. 
7. - Final plan revisions. 
A.  Minor changes in the location, placement, and heights of buildings or structures may be authorized by the city if required by engineering or other circumstances not foreseen at the time the final plan review was approved. 
B.  Approval by the city council shall be required for changes such as rearrangement of lots, blocks, and building tracks or any other significant changes as determined by the city. These changes shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of the approved final plan review. 
8. - Method of amending a PUD. 
    Any desired change involving density, use, building type, enlargement, or intensification of the use not specifically allowed by a particular PUD, or any request for a variance from the specific terms of a previously passed PUD, shall require that an application be filed for an amendment and all procedures shall then apply as if a new plan was applied for. 
9. - Method of cancellation of a PUD. 
    Any existing approved PUD shall be deemed to be canceled if the owner of the land involved in the permit applies for and receives a rezoning with respect to said property prior to the time that there is any physical implementation of the matters covered by the previously approved PUD. In addition, an existing PUD shall be deemed to be automatically canceled in the event that a final plat, if the same is required in connection with the application, is not filed with Anoka County as required by and in accordance with the terms of the city subdivision regulations within 120 days following final approval of the PUD by the city council. The PUD shall expire and be considered null and void one year after it has been issued if no construction has begun or if use has not been established. In all other situations, an existing PUD shall be canceled and revoked, short of expiring according to its own terms, only upon the event of the city acting in accordance with law and due process, taking some rezoning action that supersedes the PUD. City council has the authority to set a completion date of construction activities with a PUD.

    Lake-natural environment. Generally small, often shallow lakes with limited capacities for assimilation of the impacts of development and recreational use. They often have adjacent lands with substantial constraints for development such as high water tables, exposed bedrock, and unsuitable soils. 
    Lake-recreational development. Generally medium-sized lakes of varying depths and shapes with a variety of landform, soil, and groundwater situations on the lakes around them. They often are characterized by moderate levels of recreational uses and existing development. Development consists mainly of seasonal and year-round residences and recreational-oriented commercial uses. 
    Lot. A parcel of land designated by plat, metes and bounds, registered land survey, auditors plat, or other legal means and separate and apart from any other parcel or portion of land, and from right-of-way, public or private.

    Nonconformity. The same as that term is defined or described in Minnesota Statutes 394. 
    Non-riparian. A lot with no frontage on a water body. 
    Ordinary high water level. The boundary of public waters shall be an elevation delineating the highest water level which has been maintained for a sufficient period of time to leave evidence upon the landscape, commonly that point where the natural vegetation changes from predominantly aquatic to predominantly terrestrial. For watercourses, the ordinary high water level is the elevation of the top of the bank of the channel. For reservoirs and flowage, the ordinary high water level is the operating elevation of the normal summer pool. On lakes with an ordinary high water level established by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, that elevation shall be considered the ordinary high water level. 
    Planned unit development. A type of development characterized by a unified site design for a number of dwelling units or dwelling sites on a parcel, whether for sale, rent, lease, and also usually involving clustering of these units or sites to provide areas of common open space, density increases, and a mix of structure types and land uses. These developments may be organized and operated as condominiums, time-share condominiums, cooperatives, full fee ownership, commercial enterprises, or any combination of these, or cluster subdivisions of dwelling units, residential condominiums, townhouses, apartment buildings, campgrounds, recreational vehicle parks, resorts, hotels, motels, and conversions of structures and land uses to these uses.

    Sensitive resource management. The preservation and management of areas unsuitable for development in their natural state due to constraints such as shallow soils over groundwater or bedrock, highly erosive or expansive soils, steep slopes, susceptibility to flooding, or occurrence of flora or fauna in need of special protection. 
    Setback. The minimum horizontal distance between a structure, sewage treatment system, or other facility and an ordinary high water level, top of a bluff, road, highway, property line, or other facility. 
    Sewage treatment system. An on-site septic tank and soil absorption system or other individual or cluster type sewage treatment system. 
    Sewer system. Pipelines or conduits, pumping stations, and force main, and all other construction, devices, appliances, or appurtenances used for conducting sewage or industrial waste or other wastes to a point of ultimate disposal. 
    Shore impact zone. Land located between the ordinary high water level of public water and a line parallel to it at a setback of 50 percent of the required structure setback. 
    Shoreland. Land which meets all of the following criteria from public waters: 
1)  A portion of the lot must be located within 1,000 feet from the ordinary high water level of a lake, or 300 feet from a river or stream, or the landward extent of a floodplain designated by an ordinance on a river or stream, whichever is greater.

    Steep slope. Land where development or agricultural activity is either not recommended or described as poorly suited due to slope steepness and the site's soil characteristics. Where specific information is not available, "steep slope" is a 12 percent slope measured over a horizontal distance of 50 feet. 
    Structure. Any building or appurtenance, including decks, except aerial or underground utility lines, such as sewer, electric, telephone, telegraph, gas lines, towers, poles, and other supporting facilities. 
    Subdivision. Land that is divided for the purpose of sale, rent, or lease, including planned unit development. 
    Surface water-oriented commercial use. The use of land for commercial purposes, where access to and use of a surface water feature is an integral part of the normal conductance of business. Marinas, resorts, and restaurants with transient docking facilities are examples of such use. 
    Tier one. A lot or parcel of land with frontage on a public water body. 
    Tier two. A lot or parcel of land that is across the street from a public or private road that serves the lots fronting a public water body.

    Water-oriented accessory structure or facility. A small, above ground building or other improvement, except stairways, fences, docks, and retaining walls, which, because of the relationship of its use to a surface water feature, reasonably needs to be located closer to public waters than the normal structure setback. Examples of such structures and facilities include boathouses, gazebos, screen houses, fish houses, pump houses, and detached decks. 
    Wetland. Lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is usually at or near the surface, or the land is covered by shallow water. For the purposes of the ordinance, wetlands must: 
a)  Have a predominance of hydric soils; 
b)  Be inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions; and 
c)  Under normal circumstances, support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation. 
Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. 
6. Administration. 
A.  Compliance. The use of any shoreland of public waters, the size and shape of lots, the use, size, type and location of structures on lots, the installation and maintenance of water supply and waste removal systems, the grading and filling of any shoreland area, the cutting of shoreland vegetation, and the subdivision of land shall be in full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations.

3)  A water use permit from the City of East Bethel is required for all users withdrawing less than 10,000 gallons of water per day or less than 1,000,000 gallons per year from a public body of water. The pumping system must be enclosed in a structure not to exceed four feet by four feet and no more than two feet in height. 
C.  Notification to the department of natural resources. 
1)  Copies of all notices of any public hearing to consider variances, amendments, or conditional uses under local shoreland management controls shall be sent to the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative and postmarked at least ten days before the hearings. Notices of hearings to consider proposed subdivisions/plats shall include copies of the subdivision/plat. 
2)  A copy of approved amendments and subdivisions/plats, and final decisions granting variances or conditional uses under local shoreland management controls shall be sent to the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative and postmarked within ten days of final action. 
D.  Variances. 
1)  Variances may only be granted in accordance with Minnesota Statutes. No variance may be granted for prohibited uses.

1)  They shall meet the width and size requirements for residential lots, and be suitable for the intended uses of controlled access lots. 
2)  If docking, mooring, or over-water storage of more than six watercraft is proposed at a controlled access lot, the width of the lot (keeping the same lot depth) shall be increased by the percent of the requirements for riparian residential lots for each watercraft beyond six, consistent with the following table: 
Controlled Access Lot Frontage Requirements Ratio of Lake Size to Shore Length (acres/miles) Required Increase in Frontage (percent) Less than 100 25 100-200 20 201-300 15 301-400 10 Greater than 400 5  
3)  They shall be jointly owned by all purchasers of lots in the subdivision or by all purchasers of nonriparian lots in the subdivision who are provided riparian access rights on the access lot. 
4)  Covenants or other equally effective legal instruments shall be developed that specify which lot owners have authority to use the access lot and what activities are allowed. The activities may include watercraft launching, loading, storage, beaching, mooring, or docking. They must also include other outdoor recreational activities that do not significantly conflict with general public use of the public water or the enjoyment of normal property rights by adjacent property owners. The covenants must limit the total number of vehicles allowed to be parked and the total number of watercraft allowed to be continuously moored, docked, or stored over water, and must require centralization of all common facilities and activities in the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize topographic and vegetation alterations. They must also require all parking areas, storage buildings, and other facilities to be screened by vegetation or topography as much as practical from view from the public water assuming summer leaf-on conditions. 
C.  Placement, design, and height of structures. 
1)  Lot area. Only land above the ordinary high water level of public waters can be used to meet lot area standards, and lot width standards must be met at both the ordinary high water level and at the building line. 
2)  Placement of structures on lots. When more than one setback applies to a site, structures and facilities must be located to meet all setbacks. Where structures exist on the adjoining lots on both sides of a proposed building site, structure setbacks may be altered with an approved variance to conform to the adjoining setbacks from the ordinary high water level provided the proposed building site is not located in a shore impact zone or in a bluff impact zone. Structures shall be located as follows. 
a)  Structure and on-site sewage system setbacks from ordinary high water level: 
Setbacks Structures Classes of Public Waters Sewered Unsewered Sewage

c)  Bluff impact zones. Structures and accessory facilities, except stairways and landings, must not be placed within bluff impact zones. 
3)  Design criteria for structures. 
a)  High water elevations. Structures must be placed in accordance with any floodplain regulations applicable to the site. Where these controls do not exist, the elevation to which the lowest floor, including basement, is placed or flood-proofed is at a level at least three feet above the highest known water level or three feet above the ordinary high water level, whichever is less, of the lake, creek, or stream fronted by the property. 
Water-oriented accessory structures may have the lowest floor placed lower than the elevation determined in this item if the structure is constructed of flood-resistant materials to that elevation, electrical and mechanical equipment is placed above that elevation, and if long-duration flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to withstand ice action and wind-driven waves and debris. 
b)  Accessory structures. Said structures shall meet the normal structure setback in item c) of this subpart and comply with the following provisions: 
(1)  The structure or facility must be treated or screened so as to be minimally visible from public waters and adjacent shorelands. Treatment techniques include, but are not limited to, use of vegetation, topography, increased setbacks or color, assuming summer leaf-on conditions; 
(2)  The structure or facility must not be designed or used for human habitation and must not contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities. 
c)  Stairways, lifts, and landings. Stairways and lifts shall be used for achieving access up and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts shall meet the following design requirements: 
(1)  Stairways and lifts shall not exceed four feet in width on residential lots. Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties and public recreational properties. 
(2)  Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots shall not exceed 32 square feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square feet may be used for commercial properties and public recreational properties. 
(3)  Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts, or landings. 
(4)  Stairways, lifts, and landings may be either constructed above the ground on posts or pilings, or placed into the ground, provided they are designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion by following the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's (MPCA) best management practices. 
(5)  Stairways, lifts, and landings shall be located in the most visually inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the public water, assuming summer leaf-on conditions whenever practical. 
(6)  Facilities such as ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for physically handicapped persons shall be allowed for achieving access to shore areas provided that the dimensional and performance standards of subitems 1 through 5 are complied with in addition to the requirements of Minnesota Regulations, chapter 1340. 
(7)  Significant historic sites. No structure shall be placed on a significant historic site in a manner that affects the values of the site unless adequate information about the site has been removed and documented in a public repository. Any alteration to or use of an historic site shall be subject to applicable historic preservation regulations. 
(8)  Steep slopes. The zoning administrator shall evaluate possible soil erosion impacts and development visibility from public waters before issuing a permit for construction of sewage treatment systems, roads, driveways, structures, or other improvements on steep slopes. When determined necessary, conditions must be attached to issued permits to prevent erosion and to preserve existing vegetative screening of structures, vehicles, and other facilities as viewed from the surface of public waters assuming summer leaf-on conditions. 
4)  Height of structures. All structures in residential districts, except churches and non-residential agricultural structures, shall not exceed 30 feet in height to the eave line of a residence or 30 feet total height for other structures. 
5)  For lakes, rivers, and streams, the lowest floor level must be placed at a level at least three feet above the highest known water level, or three feet above the ordinary high water level, whichever is greater. 
D.  Shoreland alterations. Alterations to vegetation and topography shall be regulated to preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping, fix nutrients, protect fish and wildlife habitat, and prevent erosion into public waters, according to the MPCA's Best Management Practices. 
1)  Vegetation alterations. Vegetation alterations necessary for the construction of structures, sewage treatment systems, roads, and parking areas as regulated by subpart 6 of this subdivision [item 9 of this section 57] are exempt from the vegetation alteration standards that follow. 
2)  Removal or alteration of vegetation within an SL district, except for agricultural and forest management uses as regulated in subparts b and c of subpart 8 of this subdivision [subsections B. and C. of item 11 of this section 57], respectively, is allowed subject to the following standards: 
a)  Intensive vegetation clearing within the shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes is not allowed. Intensive vegetation clearing for forest land conversion to another use outside of these areas but within an SL District is allowable as a conditional use if an erosion control and sedimentation plan is developed and approved by the soil and water conservation district in which the property is located. 
b)  In shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes, limited clearing of trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning, and trimming of trees is allowed to provide a view of the water from the principal dwelling site and to accommodate the placement of stairways, landings, picnic areas, access paths, livestock watering areas, beach and watercraft access areas, and permitted water-oriented accessory structures or facilities, provided that: 
(1)  The screening of structures, vehicles, or other facilities as viewed from the water, assuming summer leaf-on conditions, is not substantially reduced; 
(2)  Existing shading of water surfaces is preserved along rivers, creeks, and streams; and 
(3)  The above provisions are not applicable to the removal of trees, limbs, or branches that are dead, diseased, or pose safety hazards in which case responsible removal is allowed. 
E.  Topographic alterations/grading and filling. 
1)  Grading, filling, and excavations necessary for the construction of structures, sewage treatment systems, and driveways under validly-issued construction permits for these facilities do not require the issuance of a separate grading and filling permit. However, the grading and filling standards in this subpart shall be incorporated into the issuance of permits for construction of structures, sewage treatment systems, and driveways hereafter. 
2)  Public roads and parking areas are regulated by subpart 6 of this subdivision [item 9 of this section 57]. 
3)  Notwithstanding items 1.) and 2.) above, a grading and filling permit will be required for: 
a)  The movement of more than ten cubic yards of material on steep slopes or within shore or bluff impact zones; and 
b)  The movement of more than 50 cubic yards of material outside of steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones within an SL District. 
4)  The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to during the issuance of construction permits, grading and filling permits, conditional use permits, variances, and subdivision approvals: 
a)  Grading or filling in any type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 wetland must be evaluated to determine how extensively the proposed activity would affect the following functional qualities of the wetland: 
(1)  Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention; 
(2)  Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce local flooding; 
(3)  Protection of fish and wildlife habitat; 
(4)  Recreational use; 
(5)  Shoreline or bank stabilization; and 
(6)  Noteworthiness, including special qualities such as historic significance, critical habitat for endangered plants and animals, or others. 
This evaluation must also include a determination of whether the wetland alteration being proposed requires permits, reviews, or approvals by other local, state, or federal agencies, such as a watershed district, the Minnesota DNR, or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
a) [b)]  Alterations shall be designed and conducted in a manner that ensures only the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest time possible; 
b) [c)]  Mulches or similar materials shall be used where necessary for temporary bare soil coverage, and a permanent vegetation cover must be established as soon as possible; 
c) [d)]  Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments before they reach any surface water feature shall be used; 
d) [e)]  Altered areas must be stabilized to acceptable erosion control standards consistent with the Anoka County Soil and Water Conservation Districts and the U.S. Soil Conservation Service; 
e) [f)]  Fill or excavated material shall not be placed in a manner that creates an unstable slope; 
f) [g)]  Plans to place fill or excavate material on steep slopes shall be reviewed by qualified professionals to promote continued slope stability and must not create finished slopes of 30 percent or greater; 
g) [h)]  Fill or excavated material shall not be placed in bluff impact zones; 
h) [i)]  Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of public waters must first be authorized by the DNR Commissioner under Minnesota Statutes. 
i) [j)]  Alterations to topography shall only be allowed if they are accessory to permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent or nearby properties; 
j) [k)]  Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading of the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the finished slope does not exceed three feet horizontal to one foot vertical, the landward extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the ordinary high water level, and the height of the riprap above the ordinary high water level does not exceed three feet. 
9. - Placement and design of roads, driveways, and parking areas. 
A.  Public and private roads and parking areas shall be designed to take advantage of natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening from view from public waters. Documentation shall be provided by a qualified professional that all roads and parking areas are designed and constructed to minimize and control erosion to public waters consistent with the requirements of the Anoka Conservation District. 
B.  Roads, driveways, and parking areas must meet structure setbacks and shall not be placed within bluff and shore impact zones when other reasonable and feasible placement alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist, they may be placed within these areas and must be designed to minimize adverse impacts. 
C.  Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads, and access-related parking areas may be placed within shore impact zones provided the vegetative screening and erosion control conditions of this subpart are met. For private facilities, the grading and filling provisions of subpart 5 of this subdivision [subsection E. of item 8 of this section 57] must be met. 
10. - Stormwater management. 
    The following general and specific standards shall apply: 
A.  General standards. 
1)  When possible, existing natural drainageways, wetlands, and vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain stormwater runoff before discharge to public waters. 
2)  Development shall be planned and conducted to minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential, and runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and protected as soon as possible and sediment must be retained on-site. 
3)  When development density, topographic features, and soil and vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle stormwater runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways, and ponds may be used. Preference must be given to designs using surface drainage, vegetation, and infiltration rather than buried pipes and manmade materials and facilities. 
B.  Specific standards. 
1)  Impervious surface coverage of lots shall not exceed 25 percent of the lot area. 
2)  When constructed facilities are used for stormwater management, documentation must be provided by a qualified professional that they are designed and installed consistent with the Anoka Conservation District requirements. 
3)  Newly-constructed stormwater outfalls to public waters must provide for filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface debris before discharge. 
11. - Special provisions for commercial, industrial, public/semi-public, agricultural, forestry, and extractive uses and mining of metallic minerals and peat. 
A.  Standards for commercial, industrial, public, and semi-public uses. 
1)  Surface water-oriented commercial uses and industrial, public, or semi-public uses with similar needs to have access to and use of public waters may be located on parcels or lots with frontage on public waters. Those uses must meet the following standards: 
a)  In addition to meeting impervious coverage limits, setbacks, and other zoning standards in this ordinance, the uses must be designed to incorporate topographic and vegetative screening of parking areas and structures. 
b)  Uses that require short-term watercraft mooring for patrons must centralize these facilities and design them to avoid obstructions of navigation and to be the minimum size necessary to meet the need. 
c)  Uses that depend on patrons arriving by watercraft may use signs and lighting to convey needed information to the public, subject to the following general standards: 
(1)  No advertising signs or supporting facilities for signs may be placed in or upon public waters. Signs conveying information or safety messages may be placed in or on public waters by a public authority or under a permit issued by the county sheriff. 
(2)  Signs may be placed, when necessary, within the shore impact zone if they are designed and sized to be the minimum necessary to convey needed information. 
(3)  Other outside lighting may be located within the shore impact zone or over public waters if it is used primarily to illuminate potential safety hazards and is shielded or otherwise directed to prevent direct illumination out across public waters. This does not preclude use of navigational lights. 
2)  Commercial, industrial, public, and semi-public uses without water-oriented needs must be located on lots or parcels without public waters frontage, or, if located on lots or parcels with public waters frontage, must either be set back double the normal ordinary high water level setback or be substantially screened from view from the water by topography or vegetation, assuming summer leaf-on conditions. 
B.  Agriculture use standards. 
1)  General cultivation farming, grazing, nurseries, horticulture, truck farming, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting are permitted uses if steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones are maintained in permanent vegetation or operated under an approved conservation plan consistent with the Anoka Conservation District requirements or the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, as provided by a qualified professional or agency. 
2)  The shore impact zone for parcels with permitted agricultural land uses is equal to a line parallel to and 50 feet from the ordinary high water level. 
C.  Forest management standards. The harvesting of timber and associated reforestation must be conducted consistent with the provisions of the Minnesota Nonpoint Source Pollution Assessment-Forestry, and the provisions of Water Quality in Forest Management "Best Management Practices in Minnesota." 
D.  Extractive use standards. 
1)  Site development and restoration plan. An extractive use site development and restoration plan must be developed, approved, and followed over the course of operation of the site. The plan must address dust, noise, possible pollutant discharges, hours and duration of operation, and anticipated alterations to vegetation and topography. It must also identify actions to be taken during operation to mitigate adverse environmental impacts, particularly erosion, and must clearly explain how the site will be rehabilitated after extractive activities end.

14. - Nonconformities. 
    All legally established nonconformities as of the date of this ordinance may continue, but they will be managed according to applicable state statutes and Section 04. Applications and Procedures of this ordinance for the subjects of alterations and additions, repair after damage, discontinuance of use, and intensification of use; except that the following standards will also apply in shoreland areas: 
A.  Construction on nonconforming lots of record. 
1)  Lots of record in the Office of the Anoka County Recorder on the date of enactment of local shoreland controls that do not meet requirements of this section may be allowed as building sites without variances from lot size requirements provided the use is permitted in the zoning district, the lot has been in separate ownership from abutting lands at all times since it became substandard, the lot was created compliant with official controls in effect at the time, and sewage treatment and setback requirements of this ordinance are met. 
2)  A variance from setback requirements must be obtained before any use, sewage treatment system, or building permit is issued for a lot. In evaluating the variance, the planning commission shall consider sewage treatment and water supply capabilities and constraints of the lot and shall deny the variance if adequate facilities cannot be provided. 
3)  If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under the same ownership, any individual lot does not meet the requirements of this section, the lot must not be considered as a separate parcel of land for the purposes of sale or development. The lot must be combined with the one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or more parcels of land, each meeting the requirements of the ordinance as much as possible. 
B.  Additions/expansions to nonconforming structures. 
1)  All additions or expansions to the outside dimensions of an existing nonconforming structure must meet the setback, height, and other requirements of this section. Any deviation from these requirements must be authorized by a variance in accordance with Section 04. Applications and Procedures. 
2)  Deck additions may be allowed without a variance to a structure not meeting the required setback from the ordinary high water level if all of the following criteria and standards are met: 
a)  The structure existed on the date the structure setbacks were established. 
b)  A thorough evaluation of the property and structure reveals no reasonable location for a deck meeting or exceeding the existing ordinary high water level setback of the structure. 
c)  The deck encroachment toward the ordinary high water level does not exceed 15 percent of the existing setback of the structure from the ordinary high water level or does not encroach closer than 30 feet, whichever is more restrictive. 
d)  The deck is constructed primarily of wood, and is not roofed or screen-enclosed. 
C.  Nonconforming sewage treatment systems. 
1)  A sewage treatment system not meeting the requirements of subpart 10 of this subdivision must be upgraded, at a minimum, at any time a permit or variance of any type is required for any improvement on or use of the property, prior to issuance of any permits. For the purposes of this provision, a sewage treatment system shall not be considered nonconforming if the only deficiency is the sewage treatment system's improper setback from the ordinary high water level. 
2)  The city council has by formal resolution notified the DNR Commissioner of its program to identify nonconforming sewage treatment systems. The city will require upgrading or replacement of any nonconforming system identified by this program within a reasonable period of time not to exceed ten months. Sewage systems installed according to all applicable local shoreland management standards adopted under Minnesota Statutes in effect at the time of installation may be considered as conforming unless they are determined to be failing, except that systems using cesspools, leaching pits, seepage pits, or other deep disposal methods, or systems with less soil treatment area separation above groundwater than required by the MPCA for design of on-site sewage treatment systems, shall be considered nonconforming. 
15. - Subdivision/platting provisions. 
A.  Land suitability. Each lot created through subdivision must be suitable in its natural state for the proposed use with minimal alteration. A suitability analysis shall consider susceptibility to flooding, existence of wetlands, soil and rock formations with severe limitations for development, severe erosion potential, steep topography, inadequate water supply or sewage treatment capabilities, near-shore aquatic conditions unsuitable for water-based recreation, important fish and wildlife habitat, presence of significant historic sites, or any other feature of the natural land likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the city. 
B.  Consistency with other controls. Subdivisions shall conform to all official controls of the city. A subdivision shall not be approved where a later variance from one or more standards in official controls would be needed to use the lots for their intended purpose. A subdivision shall not be approved unless domestic water supply is available and a sewage treatment system consistent with this ordinance is installable and operable. Each lot shall meet the minimum lot size and dimensional requirements of this ordinance, including at least a minimum contiguous lawn area that is free of limiting factors sufficient for the construction of two standard soil treatment systems. Lots that would require use of holding tanks must not be approved. 
C.  Information requirements. The following information shall be required to determine land suitability: 
1)  Topographic contours at two foot intervals or less from U.S. Geological Survey maps or more accurate sources showing limiting site characteristics; 
2)  The surface water features required in Minnesota Statutes to be shown on plats obtained from U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle topographic maps or more accurate sources; 
3)  Adequate soils information to determine suitability for building and on-site sewage treatment capabilities for every lot from the most current existing sources or from field investigations such as soil borings, percolation tests, or other methods; 
4)  Information regarding adequacy of domestic water supply, extent of anticipated vegetation and topographic alterations, near-shore aquatic conditions, including depths to and types of bottom sediments and aquatic vegetation, and proposed methods for controlling stormwater runoff and erosion, both during and after construction activities; 
5)  Location of 100-year floodplain areas and floodway districts from existing adopted maps or data; and 
6)  A line or contour representing the ordinary high water level, the "toe" and the "top" of bluffs, and the minimum building setback distances from the top of the bluff and the lake or stream. 
D.  Dedications. When a land or easement dedication is a condition of subdivision approval, the approval must provide easements over natural drainage or ponding areas for management of stormwater and significant wetlands. 
E.  Platting. All subdivisions that create lots or parcels that are less than five acres in size, have less than 300 feet road frontage and width on a publicly-maintained street, or if a street is to be constructed or dedicated for the purpose of subdividing, shall be processed as a plat in accordance with the city's subdivision ordinance. 
F.  Controlled access or recreational lots. Lots intended as controlled accesses to public waters or for recreational use areas for use by nonriparian lots within a subdivision shall meet or exceed the sizing criteria in this section.

SECTION 58. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT (FP) OVERLAY DISTRICT 

1. - Title, applicability and authority. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the floodplain (FP) management district is to regulate the use of creeks, associated lakes, drainageways, and adjacent properties in order to minimize the loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base caused by the periodic inundation by flood waters. The intent is to apply the regulations and standards of this district as an overlay zone, further regulating the use of land as allowed by the other use districts of this ordinance. 
A.[B.]  Applicability. This district shall apply to those areas in East Bethel which are identified in this subdivision as being subject to inundation by the 100-year flood as established in subpart 3 of this subdivision [section 58]. 
2. - Conditional uses. 
    Electric power and communications transmission lines. 
3. - General provisions. 
A.  Warning and disclaimer of liability. This subdivision does not imply that properties outside the floodplain areas or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This subdivision shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee for any flood damages that result from reliance on this subdivision or any administrative decision made concerning this subdivision of this ordinance. 
A. [B.]  Permits. Permits from the city are required by this subdivision for the use of land and for the construction, addition, or alteration of any structure, obstruction, public or private sewage treatment system, and the grading and filling of the natural topography. Permit applications shall include elevations of the lot and lowest floor of all structures, and the location of the stream channel, its floodplain, and flood fringe. 
A. [C.]  Water supply and sewage disposal. The provisions of Chapter 4725, Department of Health Water Well Construction Code and MPCA Water Quality Division, Individual Sewage Treatment Systems Standards, Chapter 7080, shall apply to all properties within the FP district. 
4. - FP zoning district. 
A[1].  FP district boundaries. The boundaries of the FP zoning districts shall be as shown in the Flood Insurance Study (November 1979), Flood Insurance 
A[2].  Rate maps (May 15, 1980), and flood boundary and floodway maps (May 15, 1980) for East Bethel prepared by the Federal Insurance Administration which are on file with the city are hereby adopted by reference and made a part of this ordinance. 
B.  The areas delineated in the official zoning map as studied areas and/or numbered A zones, shall be considered a general delineation of the area subject to the "regional flood" or "base flood" and shall be subject to field evaluation of the actual conditions. Where there appears to be a conflict between the mapped boundary and the regional flood elevation, the city may use whichever delineation establishes the greater flood protection. If adequate soil borings and elevations show a possible error in the mapping, and after reviewing the date and site evaluation, a waiver for development may be granted or greater restrictions imposed. 
C.  The areas delineated in the official zoning map as unnumbered A zones shall be considered a general delineation of the area subject to the "regional flood" or "base flood" and shall be subject to field evaluation based on the specific soil conditions present. The general floodplain boundary may be expanded or reduced as may be justified by the presence or absence of soils, in or adjacent to the mapped area, that may be subject to flooding. 
D.  Applicants for permits in delineated floodplain areas where the regional flood elevation has not been established by this subdivision may be required to submit an engineering report and plans establishing the elevation of the regional flood with the application.

In the flood fringe (FF) area, any residential or non-residential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted use provided such use does not constitute a public nuisance, the use is allowable, the use complies with the requirements of the underlying zoning district, and the use complies with the requirements of this section. 
A[2].  Standards for FF permitted uses. The following standards shall apply to permitted uses in the FF area: 
1)  All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor, including basement floor, is at or above the RFPE. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one foot below the RFPE and the fill shall extend at such elevation 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon. 
2)  As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet for the outside dimension at ground level may be internally flood-proofed in accordance with subpart 4.D.6). 
3)  The cumulative placement of fill in excess of 1,000 cubic yards located on a parcel shall be allowable only as a Conditional or interim use, unless the fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with 1.) above. 
4)  The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the RFPE. 
5)  The provisions of e. of this subpart [subsection A[5] of this item 6] shall apply. 
A[3].  Conditional and interim uses. In the FF area, any structure that is not elevated on fill or flood-proofed in accordance with b. 1.) and 2.) [A[2]. 1) and 2)], or any use of land that does not comply with the standards in b.3.) and 4.) of this subpart [A[2]. 3) and 4)], shall only be allowable as a conditional or interim use. 
A[4].  Standards for FF area conditional and interim uses. The following standards shall apply to conditional uses in the FF area: 
1)  Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor to or above the RFPE. These alternative methods may include, but are not necessarily limited to, the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, or above-grade enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck-under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if the enclosed area is: 1) above-grade on at least one side of the structure, 2) is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials, and 3) is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards: 
a)  The structure's design and as-built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer, certified building official, or architect as being in compliance with the general design standards of the state building code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities must be at or above the RFPE or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding. 
b)  Above-grade, fully-enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck-under garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate: 
(1)  The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a flood-proofing technique. When openings are placed in a structure's walls to provide for entry of flood waters to equalize pressures, the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood water. 
(2)  That the enclosed area will be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the state building code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles, or storage. 
2)  Basements as a conditional or interim use shall be subject to the following standards: 
a)  Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the RFPE. 
b)  Non-residential basements may be allowed below the RFPE provided the basement is structurally dry flood-proofed in accordance with b.3.) [A[2].3)] of this subpart. 
3)  All areas of non-residential structures including basements to be placed below the RFPE shall be flood-proofed in accordance with the structurally dry flood-proofing classifications in the state building code. Structurally dry flood-proofing must meet the FP-l or FP-2 flood-proofing classification in the state building code and this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures flood-proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted. 
4)  When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal, or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted. The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on-site for a minimum 100-year flood level event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the city. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists. 
5)  Storage of materials and equipment as a conditional use shall be subject to the following standards: 
a)  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
b)  Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the city. 
6)  The provisions of subpart e. of this subpart [A[5] of this item 6] shall also apply. 
A[5].  Standards for all flood fringe (FF) uses. The following standards shall apply to all uses in the FF district: 
1)  All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet below the RFPE. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the planning commission must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the structure during times of flooding. A variance may be granted only after a finding is made by the city council that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist. 
2)  Accessory commercial land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the RFPE. Such uses are allowed only by permit issued by the city. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth greater than two feet or be subject to flood velocities greater than four feet per second upon occurrence of the regional flood. 
3)  Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal manufacturing and industrial plant operations, especially along streams having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in 2.) above. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in floodplain areas. 
4)  Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover, or other acceptable method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures and property elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be required. 
5)  Development in the floodplain shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary, watercourse, or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the official zoning map. 
6)  Travel trailers and travel vehicles shall comply with the requirements contained in subpart 7.e [A[5] of item 7 of this section 58]. 
7)  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
7. - General floodplain (GF) district. 
A[1].  Permitted uses. The following shall be permitted uses in the general floodplain (GF) district: 
1)  The uses listed in subpart 4.A. of this subdivision shall be permitted uses. 
2)  Wildlife or recreational ponds of one acre or less provided spoils are removed from the floodplain and managed to prevent erosion and sedimentation. 
A[2].  Conditional uses. In the GF district, any use which is not a permitted use may be allowed as a Conditional or interim use subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria pursuant to subpart c. below. In addition, subpart c. [A[3]] below shall apply if the proposed use is determined to be in the FW district and subpart 5.D shall apply if the proposed use is determined to be in the FF district. 
A[3].  General floodplain district floodway/flood fringe determination. The following procedures shall apply in determining the floodway and/or flood fringe in the GF district: 
1)  Upon receipt of an application for a conditional use permit or an interim use permit for a use within the GF district, the applicant shall be required to furnish the following information as is deemed necessary by the city for the determination of the RFPE and whether the proposed use is within the FW or FF district. 
a)  A typical valley cross section showing the channel of the stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water information. 
b)  Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground, pertinent structure, fill, or storage elevations, size, location, and spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site, location and elevations of streets, photographs showing existing land uses and vegetation upstream and downstream, and soil type. 
c)  Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed development. 
2)  The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above information to a designated engineer or other qualified person or agency acceptable to the city for technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in the FW or FF district and to determine the RFPE. Procedures consistent with Minnesota Rules, parts 6120.5000-6120.6200 shall be followed in this expert evaluation. The designated engineer or qualified person or agency shall: 
a)  Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood. 
b)  Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas. 
c)  Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood stages more than 0.5 feet. A maximum stage increase of less than 0.5 foot shall be established if, as a result of the additional stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in computing floodway boundaries. 
8. - Subdivisions. 
A[1].  Review criteria. No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable by reason of flooding or inadequate drainage, water supply, or sewage treatment facilities. All proposed lots within the floodplain districts shall contain a building site at or above the RFPE. The building site shall be of a size and configuration suitable for the proposed construction and adequate area must be available for a water supply well and two soil treatment areas. All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that comply with the provisions of this subdivision and have road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the RFPE. The subdivider shall install a survey monument within the subdivision at a location acceptable to the city which clearly shows the 100-year flood elevation. The subdivider shall show on all subdivision and lot drawings and platting documents the required elevation of all access roads. 
A[2].  FW/FF determinations in the GF district. In the GF district, applicants shall provide the information required in subpart 6.c. [A[3] of item 6 of this section 58)] above to determine the 100-year flood elevation, the FW and FF district boundaries, and the RFPE for the subdivision site. 
A[3].  Public utilities, railroads, roads, and bridges. 
1)  All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electricity, sewer, and water supply systems to be located in the floodplain shall be flood-proofed in accordance with the state building code or elevated above the RFPE.

SECTION 59. - SIGNIFICANT NATURAL ENVIRONMENTAL AREAS (SNEA) OVERLAY DISTRICT 

1. - Intent. 
    The primary purpose of the significant natural environmental areas (SNEA) overlay district is to protect resources and functional values that have been identified by Anoka Conservation District (ACD), Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR), and the metropolitan council as providing benefits to the sustainability of the natural resource communities. This section is intended to protect and rehabilitate areas within the City of East Bethel that contain native vegetation and natural features and/or natural resources that contribute to the health, welfare, and quality of life of the people in the City of East Bethel. The City of East Bethel has the right and responsibility to protect and conserve these areas for a variety of reasons including: 
A.  Natural communities and the wildlife habitat they provide; 
B.  Contribution to the community's health and safety (i.e., flood control, purification of stormwater runoff, clean and healthy groundwater supplies necessary for the health, safety, and enjoyment of the city's residents and neighboring communities); 
C.  Recreational purposes; 
D.  Aesthetic and quality of life contributions; 
E.  Protection and conservation of natural resources within and adjacent to the natural areas for the community's long-term environmental and economic benefits; and 
F.  Contribution to the community's historic and symbolic needs. 
2. - Purpose. 
    To achieve the policies in the comprehensive plan and state and federal policies and statutes, the City of East Bethel intends to determine, control, and guide future development within those land areas in the SNEA. Specifically, this section purports to: 
A.  Identify areas of SNEAs. These areas include natural areas that are: 1) preserved and minimally changed, and 2) those needing more management to maintain and enhance their natural integrity and resource value; 
B.  Control natural environment areas of ecological value to preserve and/or restore ecological functions to the maximum extent possible; 
C.  Regulate the use and subdivision of the land within as it relates to the criteria necessary to provide for the long-term sustainability of areas of SNEAs; 
D.  Promote innovative development techniques such as conservation and other development practices that measurably reduce the amount of impervious coverage and minimize impacts of development on SNEAs; 
E.  Aid developers in the creation of their development plans; 
F.  Aid city staff, the planning commission, and city council in their assessment of development plans in areas of "natural environmental significance"; and 
G.  Encourage cost effective site development through innovative development practices that efficiently use land and resources. Cost effective development can reduce infrastructure engineering and construction costs because of improved lot configurations, shortened and/or narrower streets, and reduced utility runs. Long-term public cost savings can also be realized by lowering public maintenance costs. 
3. - Conditional uses. 
    Electric power and communications transmission lines. 
4. - General provisions. 
A.  Identification of significant natural environmental areas (SNEAs). 
    SNEAs contain native vegetation and natural features and/or natural resources prioritized by the City of East Bethel according to the natural resource functions they provide, including vegetation diversity, wildlife habitat, economic value, community open space, water quality, flood protection, aesthetics, and recreation. 
    SNEAs may contain rare, threatened, or endangered species and/or protect natural resources of concern. Further fragmentation, disturbance, and development will adversely affect and may destroy the natural processes operating within SNEAs, as well as the composition, structure, and functions of the natural communities they contain. 
    SNEAs include areas that are significant in spite of alteration by human impact. These areas may need management to maintain, enhance, and/or repair its natural resource value to the community including, but not limited to, exotic species control, fire management, and stormwater pond construction for water quality enhancement. 
    SNEAs are identified by the City of East Bethel to: 
1)  Protect, conserve and enhance the City of East Bethel's natural resources including inventoried and identified native prairies, forests, woodlands, sensitive geological and hydrological features, wetlands, riparian (river and stream) corridors, wildlife corridors, and other sensitive natural features, 
2)  Promote open space, including an interconnected system of trails and corridors for wildlife where appropriate and feasible; 
3)  Provide for the orderly growth and development of the City of East Bethel residential areas; 
4)  Promote flexible site planning; 
5)  Encourage coordination between local government, county, state, and federal agencies concerned with natural resources; 
6)  Encourage early cooperative planning between landowners/developers, the City of East Bethel, and individuals with scientific expertise in natural communities and resources. 
B.  Criteria for designating SNEAs. The MNDNR, ACD, and metropolitan council has inventoried natural resources and designated SNEAs as having one or more of the following characteristics: 
1)  Contains a high degree of native biodiversity and few exotics; 
2)  Is of adequate size, cohesiveness, and shape to be biologically sustainable either as an isolated body or by a continued connection to an existing resource; 
3)  Is a remaining example of a pre-European Settlement Natural Community for Minnesota; 
4)  Is considered significant because it is rare in the City of East Bethel; 
5)  Contains a rare species site, and is critical in preserving the rare plant species or in conserving the rare animal species present, consistent with MN 84.0895, Protection of Threatened and Endangered Species [Minn. Stats. § 84.0895]; and 
6)  Contains sensitive geological and hydrological features. 
5. - Development procedure. 
    SNEA overlay district is intended to provide for greater flexibility in land use planning. The application procedure and applicable general requirements pertaining to planned unit developments (PUDs) shall apply to SNEAs, subject to any exceptions, modifications, or additions set forth in the ordinance. Amendments to the PUDs can be proposed and implemented upon city council approval. 
6. - Standards. 
    In order to provide maximum flexibility, no fixed standards shall apply to the SNEA overlay district. In evaluating each individual proposal, city council shall recognize that the primary function of the SNEA overlay district is to encourage development that preserves and enhances the natural characteristics and valuable natural resources of a site. 
(Ord. No. 19, Second Series, 5-5-2010) 
SECTION 67. - EFFECTIVE DATE 
    The ordinance will become effective upon adoption and publication according to law. 
    Adopted by the city council of the City of East Bethel this 5th day of September, 2007.

If after receiving Grantee's report the City determines that reasonable evidence still exists of inadequate System performance, the City may enlist an independent engineer, at Grantee's expense, to perform tests and analysis directed toward such suspected inadequacies. 
F.  As a result of an Evaluation and Renegotiation Session, the City or Grantee may determine that a change in the terms of the Franchise may be required, that the System or Franchise requirements should be updated, changed or that additional services should be provided. If the change is consistent with the terms of this Franchise, the needs of the City and existing state-of-the-art (or due to regulatory, technical, financial, marketing, inflation or legal requirements) and implementation of a change would not unreasonably add to the cost of providing cable television services, Grantee and the City will, in good faith, negotiate the terms of the change and any required amendment to this Franchise. Upon adoption of such a Franchise amendment, if one is required, the change will become effective and Grantee shall accept the same. In the event Grantee fails to negotiate a requested change of the City, the City may enforce the procedures of this section by any available remedy.

A.  Whenever the City finds that Grantee has allegedly violated one (1) or more terms, conditions or provisions of this Franchise, a written notice shall be given to Grantee. The written notice shall describe in reasonable detail the alleged violation so as to afford Grantee an opportunity to remedy the violation. Grantee shall have ten (10) days subsequent to receipt of the notice in which to correct the violation before the City may resort to the security fund. Grantee may, within five (5) days of receipt of notice, notify the City that there is a dispute as to whether a violation or failure has, in fact, occurred. Such notice by Grantee to the City shall specify with particularity the matters disputed by Grantee and shall stay the running of the above-described time.

If a violation is found, Grantee may petition for reconsideration. 
2.  If after hearing the dispute the claim is upheld by the City, Grantee shall have ten (10) days from such a determination to remedy the violation or failure. At any time after that ten (10) day period, the City may draw against the security fund all penalties due it. 
B.  The time for Grantee to correct any alleged violation may be extended by the City if the necessary action to correct the alleged violation is of such a nature or character to require more than ten (10) days within which to perform provided Grantee commences the corrective action within the ten (10) day period and thereafter uses reasonable diligence, as determined by the City, to correct the violation. 
C.  The security fund deposited pursuant to this Section shall become the property of the City in the event that the Franchise is cancelled by reason of the default of Grantee or revoked for cause. Grantee, however, shall be entitled to the return of such security fund, or portion' thereof, as remains on deposit at the expiration of the term of the Franchise. 
D.  The rights reserved to the City with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the City whether reserved by this Franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the City may have. 
E.  The City shall stay or waive the imposition of any penalties set forth above upon a finding that any failure or delay is a result of an act of God or due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of Grantee. 
10.06  Damages and Defense. 
A.  Grantee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City for all damages and penalties, at all times during the term of this Franchise, as a result of the procedures for granting this Franchise or the granting of this Franchise or of Grantee's exercise of this Franchise. These damages and penalties shall include, but shall not be limited to, damages arising out of personal injury, property damage, copyright infringement, defamation, antitrust, errors and omission, theft, fire, and all other damages arising out of Grantee's exercise of this Franchise, whether or not any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Franchise; such indemnification shall include, but not be limited to, reasonable attorney's fees and costs.

1.  Promptly notify Grantee of any claim or legal proceeding which gives rise to such right; 
2.  Afford Grantee the opportunity to participate in and fully control any compromise, settlement or other resolution or disposition of such claim or proceeding; unless, however, the City, in its sole discretion, determines that its interests can not be represented in good faith by Grantee; and 
3.  Fully cooperate with the reasonable requests of Grantee, at Grantee's expense, in its participation in, and control, compromise, settlement or resolution or other disposition of such claim or proceeding subject to paragraph (2) above. 
C.  In the event the City, in its sole discretion, determines that its interests cannot be represented in good faith by Grantee, Grantee shall pay all expenses incurred by the City in defending itself with regard to all damages and penalties mentioned in paragraph A above. These expenses shall include all out-of-pocket expenses, such as attorney's fees and costs. 
10.07  Liability Insurance.

10.09  Revocation Procedures. In the event that the City determines that Grantee has violated any provision of the Franchise, or any applicable federal, state or local law, the City may make a written demand on Grantee that it remedy such violation and that continued violation may be cause for revocation. If the violation, breach, failure, refusal, or neglect is not remedied to the satisfaction of the City within thirty (30) days following such demand, the City shall determine whether or not such violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect by Grantee is due to acts of God or other causes which result from circumstances beyond Grantee's control. 
A.  A public hearing shall be held and Grantee shall be provided with an opportunity to be heard upon 14 days written notice to Grantee of the time and the place of the hearing. The causes for pending revocation and the reasons alleged to constitute such cause shall be recited in the notice. Said notice shall affirmatively recite the causes that need to be shown by the City to support a revocation. 
B.  If notice is given and, at Grantee's option, after a full public proceeding is held, the City determines there is a violation, breach, failure, refusal, or neglect by Grantee, the City shall direct Grantee to correct or remedy the same within such reasonable additional time, in such manner and upon such reasonable terms and conditions as City may direct. 
C.  If after a public hearing it is determined that Grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions, obligations, or requirements of Franchise was prevented or impaired due to any cause beyond its reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable, such inability to perform shall be deemed to be excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof, provided Grantee has notified City in writing within thirty (30) days of its discovery of the occurrence of such an event. Such causes beyond Grantee's reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable shall include, but shall not be limited to, acts of God, civil emergencies and labor strikes. 
D.  If, after notice is given and, at Grantee's option, a full public proceeding is held, the city determines there was a violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect, then the City may declare, by resolution, the Franchise revoked and cancelled and of no further force and effect unless there is compliance within such period as City may fix, such period not to be less that thirty (30) days, provided no opportunity for compliance need be granted for fraud, misrepresentation, or violation of privacy rights. 
E.  The issue of revocation shall automatically be placed upon the City Council agenda at the expiration of the time set by it for compliance. The City then may terminate Franchise forthwith upon finding that Grantee has failed to achieve compliance or may further extend the period, in its discretion. 
F.  If the City, after notice is given and, at Grantee's option, a full public proceeding is held and appeal is exhausted, declares the Franchise breached, the parties may pursue their remedies pursuant to Franchise or any other remedy, legal or equitable. 
SECTION 11. - FORECLOSURE, RECEIVERSHIP AND ABANDONMENT. 
11.01  Foreclosure. Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of the System, Grantee shall notify the City of such fact and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in control of Grantee has taken place, and the provisions of this Franchise governing the consent to transfer or change in ownership shall apply without regard to how such transfer or change in ownership occurred.

The time for Grantee to correct any alleged violation may be extended by the City if the necessary action to correct the alleged violation is of such a nature or character to require more than twenty (20) days within which to perform provided Grantee commences the corrective action within the twenty (20) day period and thereafter uses reasonable diligence, as determined by the City, to correct the violation. 
C.  The security fund deposited pursuant to this section shall become the property of the City in the event that the Franchise is cancelled by reason of the default of Grantee or revoked for cause. Grantee, however, shall be entitled to the return of such security fund, or portion thereof, as remains on deposit at the expiration of the term of the Franchise. 
D.  The rights reserved to the City with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the City whether reserved by this Franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the City may have. 
E.  The City shall stay or waive the imposition of any penalties set forth above upon a finding that any failure or delay is a result of an act of God or due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of Grantee. 
11.06  Damages and Defense. 
A.  Grantee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City for all damages and penalties, at all times during the term of this Franchise, as a result of the procedures for granting this Franchise or the granting of this Franchise or of Grantee's exercise of this Franchise. These damages and penalties shall include, but shall not be limited to, damages arising out of personal injury, property damage, copyright infringement, defamation, antitrust, errors and omission, theft, fire, and all other damages arising out of Grantee's exercise of this Franchise, whether or not any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Franchise; such indemnification shall include, but not be limited to, reasonable attorney's fees and costs. 
B.  In order for the City to assert its rights to be indemnified, defended, and held harmless, the City must: 
1.  Promptly notify Grantee of any claim or legal proceeding which gives rise to such right; 
2.  Afford Grantee the opportunity to participate in and fully control any compromise, settlement or other resolution or disposition of such claim or proceeding; unless, however, the City, in its sole discretion, determines that its interests can not be represented in good faith by Grantee; and 
3.  Fully cooperate with the reasonable requests of Grantee, at Grantee's expense, in its participation in, and control, compromise, settlement or resolution or other disposition of such claim or proceeding subject to paragraph (2) above. 
C.  In the event the City, in its sole discretion, determines that its interests cannot be represented in good faith by Grantee. 
11.07  Liability Insurance. 
A.  Grantee shall maintain, throughout the term of the Franchise, liability insurance insuring Grantee and the City with regard to all damages mentioned in paragraph A of Section 11.06 hereof, in the minimum amounts of: 
1.  Three Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($300,000.00) for bodily injury or death to any one (1) Person;

3.  One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) for all other types of liability. 
B.  At the time of acceptance, Grantee shall furnish to the City a certificate evidencing that a satisfactory insurance policy has been obtained; said certificate shall be approved by the City and such insurance policy shall require that the City be notified thirty (30) days prior to any expiration or cancellation. 
11.08  City's Right to Revoke. In addition to all other rights which the City has pursuant to law or equity, the City reserves the right to revoke, terminate or cancel this Franchise, and all rights and privileges pertaining thereto, in the event that: 
A.  Grantee substantially violates any material provision of this Franchise; or 
B.  Grantee attempts to evade any of the material provisions of the Franchise and refuse to cure it; or 
C.  Grantee practices any fraud or deceit upon the City or Subscriber; or 
D.  Grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts, or is adjudged a bankrupt; or 
E.  Grantee materially misrepresents a fact in the application for or negotiation of, or renegotiation of, or renewal of, the Franchise. 
11.09  Revocation Procedures. In the event that the City determines that Grantee has violated any provision of the Franchise, or any applicable federal, state or local law, the City may make a written demand on Grantee that it remedy such violation and that continued violation may be cause for revocation. If the violation, breach, failure, refusal, or neglect is not remedied to the reasonable satisfaction of the City within thirty (30) days following such demand, the City shall determine whether or not such violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect by Grantee is due to acts of God or other causes which result from circumstances beyond Grantee's control. 
A.  A public hearing shall be held and Grantee shall be provided with an opportunity to be heard upon fourteen (14) days written notice to Grantee of the time and the place of the hearing. The causes for pending revocation and the reasons alleged to constitute such cause shall be recited in the notice. Said notice shall affirmatively recite the causes that need to be shown by the City to support a revocation. 
B.  If notice is given and, at Grantee's option, after a full public proceeding is held, the City determines there is a violation, breach, failure, refusal, or neglect by Grantee, the City shall direct Grantee to correct or remedy the same within such reasonable additional time, in such manner and upon such reasonable terms and conditions as City may direct. 
C.  If after a public hearing it is determined that Grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions, obligations, or requirements of Franchise was prevented or impaired due to any cause beyond its reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable, such inability to perform shall be deemed to be excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof, provided Grantee has notified City in writing within thirty (30) days of its discovery of the occurrence of such an event. Such causes beyond Grantee's reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable shall include, but shall not be limited to, acts of God, civil emergencies and labor strikes. 
D.  If, after notice is given and, at Grantee's option, a full public proceeding is held, the City determines there was a violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect, then the City may declare, by resolution, the Franchise revoked and cancelled and of no further force and effect unless there is compliance within such period as City may fix, such period not to be less that thirty (30) days, provided no opportunity for compliance need be granted for fraud or misrepresentation. 
E.  The issue of revocation shall automatically be placed upon the City Council agenda at the expiration of the time set by it for compliance. The City then may terminate Franchise forthwith upon finding that Grantee has failed to achieve compliance or may further extend the period, in its discretion. 
F.  If the City, after notice is given and, at Grantee's option, a full public proceeding is held and appeal is exhausted, declares the Franchise breached, the parties may pursue their remedies pursuant to Franchise or any other remedy, legal or equitable. 
SECTION 12. - FORECLOSURE, RECEIVERSHIP AND ABANDONMENT. 
12.01  Foreclosure. Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of the System, Grantee shall notify the City of such fact and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in control of Grantee has taken place, and the provisions of this Franchise governing the consent to transfer or change in ownership shall apply without regard to how such transfer or change in ownership occurred. 
12.02  Receivership. The City shall have the right to cancel this Franchise subject to any applicable provisions of Minnesota law, including the Bankruptcy Act, one hundred and twenty (120) days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of Grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said one hundred and twenty (120) days, or unless:

13.01  Removal After Revocation or Expiration. 
A.  At the expiration of the term for which the Franchise is granted, or upon its revocation, as provided for, the City shall have the right to require Grantee to remove, at Grantee's expense, all or any portion of the System from all Streets and Public Property within the City. In so removing the System, Grantee shall refill and compact at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made and shall leave all Streets, Public Property and private property in as good a condition as that prevailing prior to Grantee's removal of the System, and without affecting, altering or disturbing in any way electric, telephone or utility, cables wires or attachments. The City, or its delegation, shall have the right to inspect and approve the condition of such Streets and Public Property after removal. The security fund, insurance, indemnity and penalty provision of the Franchise shall remain in full force and effect during the entire term of removal. 
B.  If, in the sole discretion of the City, Grantee has failed to commence removal of the System, or such part thereof as was designated within thirty (30) days after written notice of the City's demand for removal is given, or if Grantee has failed to complete such removal within one (1) year after written notice of the City's demand for removal is given, the City shall have the right to exercise one of the following options: 
1.  Declare all right, title and interest to the System to be in the City or its delegator with all rights of ownership including, but not limited to, the right to operate the System or transfer the System to another for operation by it; or 
2.  Declare the System abandoned and cause the System, or such part thereof as the City shall designate, to be removed at no cost to the City. The cost of said removal shall be recoverable from the security fund, indemnity and penalty section provided for in the Franchise, or from Grantee directly. 
13.02  Sale or Transfer of Franchise. 
A.  This Franchise shall not be sold, assigned or transferred, either in whole or in part, or leased or sublet in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable, or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest in any Person without full compliance with the procedure set forth in this section. 
B.  The provisions of this section shall apply to the sale or transfer of all or a majority of Grantee's assets, merger (including any parent and its subsidiary corporation), consolidation, creation of a subsidiary corporation or sale or transfer of stock in Grantee so as to create a new controlling interest. The term "controlling interest" as used herein is not limited to majority stock ownership, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. 
C.  In reviewing a request for sale or transfer pursuant to paragraph (A) above, the City may inquire into the legal, technical and financial qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and Grantee shall assist the City in so inquiring. The City shall not unreasonably withhold its approval. In no event shall a transfer or assignment of ownership or control be approved without the transferee becoming a signator to this Franchise.

14.02  Subscriber Privacy. 
A.  Except as otherwise permitted by applicable law, signals may be transmitted from a Subscriber terminal for purposes of monitoring individual viewing patterns or practices without the express written permission of the Subscriber. The request for such permission shall be contained in a separate document with a prominent statement that the Subscriber is authorizing the permission in full knowledge of its provisions. Such written permission shall be for a limited period of time not to exceed one (1) year which shall be renewed at the option of the Subscriber. No penalty shall be invoked for a Subscriber's failure to provide or renew such authorization. The authorization shall be revocable at any time by the Subscriber without penalty of any kind whatsoever.

DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM 
1.  The System shall be designed, constructed, routinely inspected, and maintained to guaranty the System meets or exceeds the requirements of the most current additions of all applications for the National Electrical Code (NFPA 70) and the National Electrical Safety Code (ANSI C2) in effect at the time of construction. 
2.  General Requirements. Grantee shall use equipment used in high-quality, reliable, modern Cable Systems of similar design. Within ninety (90) days after the effective date, Grantee shall provide to the City a plan for construction of the System Upgrade indicating, at least, a general overview of the construction schedule. 
3.  General Description. The System shall provide Subscribers with a technically advanced and reliable System. The System shall operate with 860 MHz of bandwidth, capable of delivering a minimum of eighty (80) Channels of programming. The System will be two-way active, and it will have a return capacity of 37 MHz. The design will provide the benefits of proven eighty (80) Channel electronics while positioning the System for expansion of bandwidth and Channel capacity as technology and future services develop. 
4.  Design. The design of the System shall be based upon a "fiber to the node" architecture with a minimum of three (3) fibers to each node site. This architecture will deliver the signals by fiber optics directly to each neighborhood. With a neighborhood group average of only five hundred (500) homes, the resulting System will have improved reliability while delivering a high quality picture. Grantee will place fiber optic cables throughout the City, delivering the signals to an optical node placed in various geographic areas. There shall be no more than seven (7) active amplifiers in a cascade from each node to the residential dwelling. The incorporation of stand-by power supplies, strategically placed throughout the System including all hubs, will further reduce the likelihood of Service Interruptions. 
5.  Technical Specifications. The System shall meet or exceed FCC requirements. In no event shall the System fall below the following standards: 
a.  The System shall be capable of meeting FCC distortion parameters: 
1.  Carrier to RMS Noise. 
2.  Carrier to Second Order. 
3.  Carrier to Cross Modulation. 
4.  Carrier to Composite Triple Beat. 
b.  The frequency response of a single Channel as measured across any 6 MHz analog Channel shall not exceed +/- 3 dB. 
c.  The peak to valley of the entire passband shall not exceed N/10+ 3 dB for the entire System where N is the number of amplifiers in cascade. 
d.  The System shall be designed such that at a minimum all technical specifications of this Franchise Agreement are met. 
e.  The System shall be designed such that no noticeable degradation in signal quality will appear at the Subscriber terminal.

4.3.  Projects with Federal Funding . Relocation, removal, or rearrangement of any Facilities made necessary because of the extension into or through City of a federally-aided highway project shall be governed by the provisions of Minnesota Statutes Section 161.46, as supplemented or amended.

In the event a suit is brought against the City under circumstances where this agreement to indemnify applies, Company at its sole cost and expense shall defend the City in such suit if written notice thereof is promptly given to Company within a period wherein Company is not prejudiced by lack of such notice. If Company is required to indemnify and defend, it will thereafter have control of such litigation, but Company may not settle such litigation without the consent of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

The Company, in defending any action on behalf of the City, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf. This franchise agreement shall not be interpreted to constitute a waiver by the City of any of its defenses of immunity or limitations on liability under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 466.

The method of imposing the franchise fee, the percentage of revenue rate, or the flat rate based on metered service may differ for each customer class. The City shall seek to use a formula that provides a stable and predictable amount of fees, without placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage. If the Company claims that the City required fee formula is discriminatory or otherwise places the Company at a competitive disadvantage, the Company shall provide a formula that will produce a substantially similar fee amount to the City. The City will attempt to accommodate the Company but is under no franchise obligation to adopt the Company-proposed franchise fee formula and such review will not delay the implementation of the City-imposed fee. The fee shall not be imposed on the Company unless the City imposes a fee of the same or commensurate amount on the sale of gas energy by any other gas energy supplier within the City. 
8.2.  Separate Ordinance . The franchise fee shall be imposed by separate ordinance duly adopted by the City Council, which ordinance shall not be adopted until at least sixty (60) days after written notice enclosing such proposed ordinance has been served upon the Company by certified mail. 
8.3.  Collection of Fee . The franchise fee shall be payable not less than quarterly during complete billing months of the period for which payment is to be made. The franchise fee formula may be changed from time to time, however, the change shall meet the same notice requirements and the fee may not be changed more often than annually. Such fee shall not exceed any amount that the Company may legally charge to its customers prior to payment to the City. Such fee is subject to subsequent reductions to account for uncollectibles and customer refunds incurred by the Company. The Company agrees to make available for inspection by the City at reasonable times all records necessary to audit the Company's determination of the franchise fee payments. 
8.4.  Continuation of Franchise Fee . If this franchise expires and the City and the Company are unable to agree upon terms of a new franchise, the franchise fee, if any being imposed by the City at the time this franchise expires, will remain in effect until a new franchise is agreed upon. However, the franchise fee will not remain in effect for more than one year after the franchise expires. 
SECTION 9. - ABANDONED FACILITIES .

SECTION 10. - PROVISIONS OF ORDINANCE . 
10.1.  Severability . Every section, provision, or part of this Ordinance is declared separate from every other section, provision, or part; and if any section, provision, or part shall be held invalid, it shall not affect any other section, provision, or part. Where a provision of any other City ordinance conflicts with the provisions of this Ordinance, the provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail. 
10.2.  Limitation on Applicability . This Ordinance constitutes a franchise agreement between the City and Company as the only parties and no provision of this franchise shall in any way inure to the benefit of any third person (including the public at large) so as to constitute any such person as a third party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more of the terms hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto. 
SECTION 11. - AMENDMENT-PROCEDURE . 
    Either party to this franchise agreement may at any time propose that the agreement be amended.
