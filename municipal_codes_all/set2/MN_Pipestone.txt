deemed a separate violation.
Subd. 5. Control by the Public Works Director. The Public Works Director or
his/her designee shall have control and general supervision of all public sewers and service
connections in the City and shall be responsible for administering the provisions of this Section.
Subd. 6. Reduction of Clear Water in the Sanitary Sewer System.
A. The City Council finds that the discharge of water from roof,
surface, groundwater, sump pump, footing tile or swimming pool, or other natural precipitation
into the municipal sanitary sewer system has the potential to cause property damage and
overload the municipal and regional sanitary sewer systems. Therefore, in no case shall water
from roofs, surfaces, paved areas, yards, courts, courtyards, sump pumps, footing tile, swimming
pools or similar areas having rainwater flow onto the public sidewalk. In the case of one-and
two-family dwellings, storm water shall be permitted to be discharged onto flat areas, such as
streets or lawns, so long as the storm water shall flow away from the building and away from
adjoining property, and shall not create a nuisance. The City Council therefore finds it essential
for the maintenance of health, minimization of property damage, and to maintain the life and
capacity of the wastewater treatment system that the provisions of this ordinance be strictly
enforced.
1. Applicability. This ordinance shall apply to all water
entering the sanitary sewer system unless explicitly exempted by the City. The City and its
representatives are authorized to administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this
ordinance.
2. Definitions. For the purpose of this Ordinance, the
following terms are defined:
a. Clear Water means storm water, natural precipitation,
melting snow, ground water, roof drainage, ground surface and subsurface drainage,
down spout, yard drain, sump pump, foundation drain, yard fountain, pond, swimming
pool, cistern overflow, or any other water that is not required to be treated by state or
federal law. Swimming pool water that is required to be treated in accordance with city,
county or state regulations shall not be considered clear water.
b. Sewer service lateral means all sewer service pipes that
extend from the municipal sewer main to the structure that it serves.
3. Compatibility with Other Regulations. This ordinance is
not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision law.
(09-15-2005)
20
§3.20
The requirements of this ordinance are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance,
rule, regulation, or other provision of law, and where any provision of this ordinance imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other
provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards
for human health or the environment shall apply.
4. Prohibition Against Discharge into the Sanitary Sewer System.
No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal sanitary sewer collection
system, or infiltrate into the sanitary sewer system any clear water because of a sump pump,
defective plumbing, a defective sewer service lateral or by any other means.
5. Sump Pump Regulation. Any dwelling, structure or building that
has a sump pump discharge system to remove groundwater from its foundation drain must have a
permanently installed discharge line.
A "permanently installed discharge line" shall be one which provides for year-around discharge
capability to either the outside of the dwelling, building or structure, or is connected to the City
storm sewer. It shall consist of a rigid discharge line, without valving or quick connections for
altering the path of discharge and, if connected to the City storm sewer line, include a check
valve. It shall not be capable of connection or reconnection to the municipal sanitary sewer
system.
6. Inspection. By June 1, 2025, every person owning improved real
estate, or contractors and builders who are building a structure connected to the City's sanitary
sewer system, shall obtain an inspection of each building located on such property by an
inspector designated by the City. The purpose of this city inspection shall be to confirm that
there is no prohibited discharge into the municipal sanitary sewer system.
This inspection requirement may also be met by having the property owner contract with a
licensed plumber to perform the inspection. The plumber must inspect the property's sump
pump, sewer service lateral, and groundwater drainage system, and upon completion, return an
inspection form provided by the City documenting the results of the inspection. All costs
associated with an inspection by a privately retained plumber shall be the responsibility of the
property owner.
Unless the property owner already has a valid certificate of compliance issued by the City for the
property, the owner or owner's representative is required to complete an inspection and obtain a
certificate of compliance issued by the City before such property is offered for sale, gifted or
transferred, and before the owner or owner's representative enters into any contract for deed or
other transaction changing the party responsible for the property. A certificate of compliance
shall be issued by the city upon successful completion of an inspection. A certificate of
compliance shall be valid for ten years.
(09-15-2005)
21
§3.20
7. Corrections. Upon notice that the discharge of clear water on a
property is not in compliance with this ordinance, the owner or occupant of the property shall
cease from discharging clear water in violation of this ordinance and shall make the necessary
repairs and corrections to discharge the clear water in accordance with this ordinance.
Discharge of clear water in compliance with this ordinance shall be completed within 30 days
of the date of notice of noncompliance, or as determined by the Water Supervisor. A second
inspection of the property will be completed after 30 days following the notice of
noncompliance.
8. Violations. A monthly surcharge in an amount duly adopted by
the City Council and set forth in the City's fee schedule shall be assessed against any property
on which clear water is discharged in violation of this ordinance. The monthly surcharge will
be charged on the property's municipal utility billing statement if one or more of the following
conditions apply: (1) an inspection as required herein has not been allowed by the prope1iy
owner or occupant or a certificate of compliance has not been issued by the city within 30 days
after the city's notice of inspection; (2) the property owner or occupant fails to make the sewer
line cleanout readily available for the inspection; (3) the necessary corrections have not been
made within the time specified; and (4) the property owner or occupant reconnects a clear
water discharge line to the municipal sanitary sewer system after it has been previously
disconnected at the city's or a court's direction. A surcharge as established by the City Council
will be assessed for every month during which the property is not in compliance.
9. Temporary Waivers. The City may grant a temporary waiver
from the provisions of this section where strict enforcement would cause a threat of damage or
harm to other property, the environment, or public safety because of circumstances unique to the
individual property or due to weather conditions. A written request for a temporary waiver must
be first submitted to the Water Supervisor specifying the reasons for the temporary waiver.
If a temporary waiver is granted, the property owner shall pay an additional fee for sewage
service charges based on the number of gallons discharged into the City's sanitary sewer system
as estimated by the Water Supervisor.
The Water Supervisor may set conditions to the temporary waiver. The Water Supervisor may
terminate the temporary waiver upon a failure to comply with any conditions imposed on the
temporary waiver. The Water Supervisor must give a five-day written notice of the termination
to the property owner and occupant setting forth the reasons for the termination. After expiration
or termination of a temporary waiver, the property owner shall comply with the provisions of this
ordinance.
10. Appeals. Applications for appeal of any administrative
determination made pursuant to this Ordinance shall be addressed in writing to the City
Administrator within 30 days of the determination.
(09-15-2005)
22
§3.20
Applications shall at a minimum identify the property for the appeal is sought, the name of the
property owner, and describe in detail the determination which is being appealed. Within 60 days
of receipt of the application, the City Council shall make its decision on the matter and send a
written copy of such decision to the property owner by mail.
11. Severability and Validity. The provisions of this ordinance are
hereby declared to be severable. If any provision, clause, sentence, or paragraph of this ordinance
or the application thereof to any person, establishment, or circumstances be declared by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the validity of other
provisions or application of this ordinance.
Subd. 7. Use of Public Sewers Required.
A. Except as provided hereinafter, it is unlawful to construct or
maintain any privy, private vault, septic tank, cesspool, or other facility intended or used for the
disposal of wastewater.
B. The owner of all houses, buildings, or properties used for human
occupancy, employment, recreation, or other purposes from which wastewater is discharged, and
which is situated within the City and adjacent to any street, alley or right-of-way in which there
is now located, or may in the future be located a public sanitary sewer of the City, shall be
required at the owner's expense to install a suitable service connection to the public sewer in
accordance with the provisions of this Section, within ninety (90) days of the date said public
sewer is operational, provided said public sewer is within two hundred (200) feet of the structure
generating the wastewater. All future buildings constructed on property adjacent to the public
sewer shall be required to immediately connect to the public sewer. If sewer connections are not
made pursuant to this Section, an official thirty (30) day notice shall be served instructing the
affected property owner to make said connection. ·
C. In the event an owner shall fail to connect to a public sewer in
compliance with a notice given under Subdivision 3 B of this Section, the City may undertake to
have said connection made and shall assess the cost thereof against the benefited property. Such
assessment when levied, shall bear interest at the rate determined by the Council and shall be
certified to the Pipestone County Auditor and shall be collected and remitted to the City in the
same manner as assessments for local improvements. The rights of the City shall be in addition
to any remedial or enforcement provisions of this Section.

§3.20
H. Grease, oil, and $and interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Public Works Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, as specified in Subparagraph D, 2, any
flammable wastes as specified in Subparagraph C, 1, sand or other harmful ingredients; except
that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All
interceptors shall be of the type to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
In the maintaining of these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal
and disposal of the captured materials by appropriate means, and shall maintain a record of dates
and means of disposal which are subject to review by the Public Works Director. Any removal
and handling of the collecting materials not performed by the owner's personnel, must be
performed by a currently licensed waste disposal firm.
I. Where required by the City, the owner of any property serviced by
a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable structure, or control manhole,
with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate
observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes. Such structure shall be accessible and safely
located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the City. The structure
shall be installed by the owner at his/her expense and shall be maintained by the owner to be safe
and accessible at all times.
J. The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes may, at the discretion of the City be required to provide laboratory
measurements, tests, or analyses of waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this Section
and any special condition for discharge established by the City or regulatory agencies having
jurisdiction over the discharge. The number, type, and frequency of sampling and laboratory
analyses to be performed by the owner shall be stipulated by the City. The industry must supply
a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge to assure that compliance
with Federal, State, and local standards are being met. The owner shall report the results of
measurements and laboratory analyses to the City at such times and in such manner as prescribed
by the City. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses, and reporting
required by the City. At such times as deemed necessary, the City reserves the right to take
measurements and samples for analysis by an independent laboratory.
K. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of
waters and wastes to which reference is made in this Section shall be determined in accordance
with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater,
published by the American Public Health Association. Sampling methods, location, times,
duration and frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by the
Public Works Director.
L. Where required by the City, the owner of any property serviced by
a sanitary sewer shall provide protection from an accidental discharge of prohibited materials or
(09-15-2005)
30
§3.20
other substances regulated by this Section. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental
discharges of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be
submitted to the Public Works Director for review and approval prior to construction of the
facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve any user
from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this
Section. Users shall notify the Public Works Director immediately upon having a slug or
accidental discharge of substances or wastewater in violation of this Section to enable
countermeasures to be taken by the Public Works Director to minimize damage to the
wastewater treatment works. Such notification will not relieve any user of any liability for any
expense, loss or damage to the wastewater treatment system or treatment process, or for any
fines imposed on the City on account thereof under any State and Federal law. Employers shall
ensure that all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
M. It is unlawful for any person, having charge of any building or
other premises which drains into the public sewer, to permit any substance or matter which may
form a deposit or obstruction to flow or pass into the public sewer. Within thirty (30) days after
receipt of written notice from the City, the owner shall install a suitable and sufficient catch
basin or waste trap, or if one (1) already exists, shall clean out, repair or alter the same, and
perform such other work as the Public Works Director may deem necessary. Upon the owner's
refusal or neglect to install a catch basin or waste trap or to clean out, repair, or alter the same
after the period of thirty (30) days the Public Works Director may cause such work to be
completed at the expense of the owner or representative thereof.
N. Whenever any service connection becomes clogged, obstructed,
broken or out of order, or detrimental to the use of the public sewer, or unfit for the purpose of
drainage, the owner shall repair or cause such work to be done as the Public Works Director may
direct. Each day after ten (10) days that a person neglects or fails to so act shall constitute a
separate violation of this Section~ and the Public Works Director may then cause the work to be
done, and recover from such owner or agent the expense thereof by an action in the name of the
City.
0. The owner or operator of any motor vehicle washing or servicing
facility shall provide and maintain in serviceable condition at all times, a catch basin or waste
trap in the building drain system to prevent grease, oil, dirt, or any mineral deposit from entering
the public sewer system.
P. In addition to any penalties that may be imposed for violation of
any provision of this Chapter, the City may assess against any person the cost of repairing or
restoring sewers or associated facilities damaged as a result of the discharge or prohibited wastes
by such person, and may collect such assessment as an additional charge for the use of the public
sewer system or in any other manner deemed appropriate by the City.

discharges to the City's sewer system in accordance with the provisions of this Section. If the
owner, renter, or other person in control of the property does not agree to entrance of the city
onto the property, then the City may obtain an administrative search warrant to enter the property
as provided for in Chapter 1 of this Code.
B. The Public Works Director or other duly authorized employees are
authorized to obtain information concerning industrial processes which have a direct bearing on
the type and source of discharge to the wastewater collection system. An industry may withhold
information considered confidential however, the industry must establish that the revelation to
the public of the information in question, might result in an advantage to competitors.
C. The Public Works Director or other duly authorized employees of
the City bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all private
properties through which the City holds a duly negotiated easement for the purposes of, but
limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair, and maintenance of any

costs of prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day
during which a violation occurs or continues.
D. The failure of any officer or employee of the City to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to the penalty
imposed for violation.
SEC. 3.21. RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO A SEWER
SERVICE CHARGE.
Subd. 1. The City hereby establishes a Sewer Service Charge System whereby
all revenue collected from users of the wastewater treatment facilities will be used to offset all
expenditures incurred for operations and maintenance, equipment replacement, administrative
and for debt service on capital expenditures incurred in constructing the wastewater treatment
facility and related sewage systems.
Subd. 2. Each user shall pay its proportionate share of costs associated with the
administration, operation, maintenance and replacement of the public wastewater collection
system based on the users proportionate contribution to the total wastewater loading from all
users.
Subd. 3. Each user shall pay debt service charges to retire local capital costs as
determined by the Council.
Subd. 4. All revenues collected from users will be deposited and accounted for in
the Sewer Fund for the purpose of offsetting all expenditures for administration, operation,
maintenance, replacement and debt service of the public wastewater collection system.
Subd. 5. Sewer service rates and charges to users of the wastewater treatment
facility shall be determined and fixed in a "Sewer Service Charge System" developed according
to the provisions of this Section. The Sewer Service Charge System developed with the
assistance of the City Engineer shall be adopted by resolution upon enactment of this Section.
Subsequent changes in sewer service rates and charges shall be adopted by Council resolution.
(09-15-2005)
33
§ 3.21
Subd. 6. There will be four (4) classes of users:
A. Residential.
B. Commercial.
C. Institutional/Governmental.
D. Industrial.
Subd. 7. Unmetered Water Supply. If any premises discharge normal
Sewage or industrial waste in the sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, obtain
part or all of the water used thereon from sources other than the City, and the water so obtained
is not measured by a meter of equivalent specifications to the meters used by the City, then in
such case the City shall permit the discharge of normal sewage or industrial waste into its
sanitary sewerage system only when the owner of such premises or some other interested party
shall at his/her own expense install and maintain for the purpose of metering such water supply a
water meter of equivalent specifications to those installed by the City in connection with the City
water system. Each water meter shall be installed to measure all water received on such
premises and the above charges and rates shall be applied to the quantity of water received as
measured by such meter. If, because of the nature of the source of water supply, the City deems
it impracticable to thus meter the water on any premises, the Council may by resolution establish
a flat charge per month in accordance with the estimated use of water on such premises.
Subd. 8. Metered Water Not Discharged. If a lot, parcel of land, or premises
discharges sewage into the sanitary sewer system either directly or indirectly, and, the Public
Works Director is satisfied that a portion of the water measured by the meter or meters does not
and cannot enter the sanitary sewer system, the Public Works Director or his/her designee is
authorized to determine, in such manner and by such method as he/she may deem practicable,
the percentage of the water measured by the meter which enters the sanitary sewer system. In
such case, the charges and rates shall be based upon the percentage of the metered water as
determined by the Public Works Director. In the alternative in any such case, the Public
Works Director is authorized to require or to permit the installation of other or additional meters
in such manner that the quantity of water which actually enters the sanitary sewer system may be
determined. In such case, the charges or rates shall be based on the volume of water so shown to
actually enter the sanitary sewer system.
Subd. 9. Charges for Discharging Normal Domestic Strength Wastewater.
The charges assessed residential users and those users of other classes discharging Normal
Domestic Strength Wastewater shall be established proportionately according to billable
wastewater volume. Billable wastewater volume shall be calculated as follows:
A. Residential Users. Billable wastewater volume for residential
users shall be calculated on the basis of metered water usage. The monthly billable wastewater
volume shall be equal to monthly metered water usage with a maximum monthly sewer charge
(09-15-2005)
34
§ 3.21
established during the Winter Quarter (average monthly usage during December, January, and
February).
B. Non-residential Users. The billable wastewater volume of nonresidential
users may be determined in the same manner as for residential users. Except that if
the City determines there are significant seasonal variations in the metered water usage of nonresidential
users resulting in a proportionate increase in wastewater volume; then billable
wastewater volume shall be:
1. Calculated on the basis of monthly metered water usage as
recorded throughout the year and calculated on the basis of wastewater flow meters, or;
2. Calculated on a separate meter through which all water
ultimately entering the sanitary sewer system is metered.
Subd. 10. The Sewer Service Charges established in this Section shall not
prevent the assessment of additional charges to users who discharge wastes with concentrations
greater than Normal Domestic Strength or wastes of unusual character, or contractual agreements
with such users, as long as the following conditions are met:
. A. The user pays Operation Maintenance and Replacement costs in
proportion to the user's proportionate contribution of wastewater flows and loadings to the
treatment facility, and no user is charged at a rate less than that of "Normal Domestic Strength
Wastewater".
B. The measurement of such wastes are conducted according to the
latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater in a manner
acceptable to the City as provided in Section 3.20 Rules and Regulations Relating to Sewerage
Service. A study of unit costs of collection and treatment process attributable to Flow, BOD,
TSS and other significant loadings shall be developed for determining the proportionate
allocation of costs to flow and loadings for users discharging wastes of greater than Normal
Domestic Strength or wastes of unusual character.
Subd. 11. Determination of User Charges. User charges for Normal Domestic
Strength users shall be determined as follows:
water:
A. Calculation of unit cost for treatment of normal domestic strength
Uornr =
Where:

Unit cost for debt service in
$/100 gal.
Billable wastewater volume of a
particular user in I 00 gal.
Basic debt charge per unit per month
Subd. 12. Administration.
A. The Sewer Service Charge System and Sewer Service Fund shall
be administrated according to the following provisions:
(09-15-2005)
36
§ 3.21
1. The City Administrator shall maintain a proper system of
accounts suitable for determining the operation and maintenance, equipment replacement and
debt retirement costs of the treatment works, and shall furnish the Council with a report of such
costs annually in the year end financial report. The Council shall annually determine whether or
not sufficient revenue is being generated for the effective operation, maintenance, replacement
and management of the treatment works, and whether sufficient revenue is being generated for
debt retirement. The Council will also determine whether the user charges are distributed
proportionately to each user in accordance with Subdivision 9 of this Section and Section 204(b)
(2) (A) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended. The City shall at least annually
review the Sewer Service Charge System then in use to ensure the proportionality of the user
charges and to ensure the sufficiency of funds to maintain the capacity and performance to which
the facilities were constructed, and to retire the construction debt.
2. In accordance with Federal and State requirements each
user will be notified annually by mail the rates for OM&R, debt service and debt service charges.
3. In accordance with Federal and State requirements, the City
Administrator shall be responsible for maintaining all records necessary to document compliance
with the Sewer Service Charge System adopted.
4. Any additional costs caused by discharges to the treatment
works of toxics or other incompatible wastes, including the cost of restoring wastewater
treatment services, clean up and restoration of the receiving waters and environs, and sludge
disposal, shall be borne by the discharger(s) of said wastes, at no expense to the City.
Subd.13. Sewer Service Fund.
A. The City hereby established a "Sewer Service Fund" as an income
fund to receive all revenues generated by the Sewer Service Charge System, and all other income
dedicated to the operation, maintenance, replacement, and construction of the wastewater
treatment works, including taxes, special charges, fees, and assessment intended to retire
construction debt. The City also establishes the following accounts as income and expenditure
accounts within the Sewer Service Fund:
1. Operation and Maintenance and Equipment
Replacement Account.
2. Debt Retirement Account.
B. All revenue generated by the Sewer Service Charge System, and
all other income pertinent to the treatment system, including taxes and special assessments
dedicated to retire construction debt, shall be accounted for in a fund separate and apart from all
other funds of the City. Funds received by the Sewer Service Fund shall be transferred to the
(09-15-2005)
37
§ 3.21
"Operation and Maintenance Account," the "Equipment Replacement Account", and the "Debt
Retirement Account" in accordance with State and Federal regulations and the provisions of this
Section.
C. Revenue generated by the Sewer Service Charge System sufficient
to ensure adequate replacement throughout the design of useful life, which ever is longer, of the
wastewater facility shall be held separate and apart in the "Equipment Replacement Account"
and dedicated to affecting replacement costs. Interest income generated by the "Equipment
Replacement Account" shall remain in the "Equipment Replacement Account".
D. Revenue generated by the Sewer Service Charge System sufficient
for operation and maintenance shall be held separate and apart in the "Operation and
Maintenance Account".
Subd.14. Penalties.
A. Any person, firm, or corporation who violates any provision of this
code for which another penalty is not specifically provided, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor. The penalty which may be imposed for any crime which is a misdemeanor under
this code, including Minnesota Statutes specifically adopted by reference, shall be a sentence of
not more than 90 days or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both.
B. Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this

Section, means any area, place, building, object, district, or structure which has been duly
designated as such pursuant to the provisions of the City Code.
Subd. 2. Permits. Unless specifically permitted by this Section, and
notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, no construction in a Heritage Preservation
Site shall be commenced by the City or any other person without a special permit after
consideration by the Heritage Preservation Commission. "Construction" for the purpose of this
Section, shall include building, moving a building or structure, moving soil or changing the
natural terrain, demolition of a building or structure, remodeling or repairing, including painting,
a building or structure that will change the exterior appearance. Provided, that the Building
Official may approve the repair and issue the permit where there exists immediate danger of
injury to persons or property, in which case he/she shall forthwith notify the Heritage
Preservation Commission of the fact and circumstances constituting the danger and issuance of
the permit.
Subd. 3. Application and Plans. The application shall be accompanied by
detailed plans of the proposed work. The application shall be reviewed for its conformity with
the overall preservation plan (if any) for the district, site or structure as well as, conformity to the
Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation described as follows:
1. Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which required minimal alteration of the building,
structure, or site and its environment, or to use a property for its
originally intended purpose.
2. The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided when possible.
3. All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have historical basis and which
seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
4. Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired
significance in their own right, and this significance shall be
recognized and respected.

which characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.

§ 4.40
6. Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material and other
visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural
features should be based on accurate duplications of features,
substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than
on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural
elements from other buildings or structures.
7. The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
that will damage the historic building materials shall not be
undertaken.
8. Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by, or adjacent to any project.
9. Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall
be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations to
structures shall be done in the future, the essential form and
integrity of the structure would be unimpaired.
10. If the Commission finds that to issue a permit would adversely
affect the site, structure or district, it shall hold a public hearing
upon ten (10) days published notice and similar mailed notice to
the applicant within ten (10) days after the hearing the Commission
shall issue its written findings and inform the Building Official as
to whether or not the permit shall be issued.
Subd. 4. Time Limitation. Within thirty (30) days after filing an application,
plans, and meeting all the requirements of this Section, the Heritage Preservation Commission
shall have 1) approved the issuance of the permit, or 2) disapproved issuance and given notice of
hearing thereon. If the Commission has failed to take such action, the Building Official shall
forthwith issue such permit if, in all other respects, the application is in compliance with
applicable law.

SEC. 11.10. ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS AND MAP.
Subd. 1. Establishment of Districts. For the purpose of this Chapter, the City
of Pipestone is hereby divided into ten (10) zoning districts which are described in this Chapter.
These prescribed district regulations for land use and building and development standards shall
be enforced uniformly within each district. The purpose of the district, permitted uses, and yard
and lot requirements are listed for each general land use district. Any use not permitted by right
or located in a City utility easement shall require a conditional use permit.
I. Residential District. Districts designated for residential use, R-1, R-2, and
R-3 are limited to agricultural uses, accessory structures, and uses
normally associated with residential neighborhoods. Such uses include
schools, churches, and parks. However, under the provisions of PUD
(Planned Unit Development), planned unit residential projects are
permitted which may include limited business facilities integrated into
neighborhood design.
R-1 Single-Family Residential District
R-2 Urban Residential District
R-3 Multi-Family Residential District
2. Commercial Districts. Districts designed for commercial use B-1, B-2,
and B-3 are limited to business activities and certain residential uses.
Establishment of compact commercial districts provides for more efficient
extension of City utilities and services. Most industrial uses are separated
from other uses in order to maximize access and reduce hazards typically
associated with industrial uses. However, research industrial uses and
light industrial uses are permitted if they are of such a nature that hazards
are not present and they meet specific requirements set forth in this
ordinance.
B-1 Neighborhood Business District
B-2 Central Business District
B-3 Highway Business District
3. Industrial District. The districts designated for industry, 1-1 and 1-2,
provide suitable space for future industrial development performance
standards, parking specifications, and yard regulations are set forth in the
ordinance in order to ensure safe industrial development that is compatible
with adjacent uses.
1-1 Light Industrial District
1-2 General Industrial District

§11.10
4. Special District. A special district typically designated to accommodate a
narrow or special set of user or special purposes. The only Special District
designated in this ordinance is the C-1, Conservation District, which is
provided to prevent development and use of land that is unsuitable for
development due to periodic flooding or due to its location in an
environmentally sensitive area.

complying with this Chapter shall be included as apart of a yard, open
space, or off-street parking or loading space similarly required for any
other building, except as modified hereinafter.
B. No yard or lot existing on August 1, 1978, shall be reduced in size or area
below the minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards or lots created
after August 1, 1978, shall meet at last the minimum requirements
established by this Chapter.
Subd. 4. Minimum Requirements. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the promotion
of public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity, or general welfare. Wherever the
requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations, or ordinances, the most restrictive
or that imposing the higher standards, shall govern.
Subd. 5. Dwelling on Any Lot of Record. In any district where dwellings are
permitted, a one (1) family detached dwelling may be erected on any lot of official record on

extending not more than four feet (4') above the limiting height of the
building.
B. Places of Public Assembly: Places of public assembly in churches,
schools and other permitted public and semi-public buildings, provided
that they are located on the first floor of such buildings; provided that for
each two (2) feet by which the height of such exceeds the maximum
height otherwise permitted in the district, its side and rear yards shall be
increased in width or depth by an additional foot over the side and rear
yards required for the highest building otherwise permitted in the district
and further provided that the Zoning Board of Appeals and Adjustments
shall find that such additional height will not be materially detrimental to
surrounding property.
(09-15-2005)
17
§11.12
C. Elevator Penthouses; Etc.: Elevator penthouses (elevator machinery loft),
monitors, and scenery lofts, provided no linear dimension of any such
structure exceeds fifty (50) percent of the corresponding street lot line
frontage. Fire hose or cooling towers, elevators, gas holders, or other
structures incorporated into a principal structure where a manufacturing
process requires a greater height shall be excepted.

frontage on one (1) side of a street between two (2) intersecting streets is
developed with buildings that have front yards that is greater or less than
the required front yard in the district, no building shall project beyond the
average front yard so established. Where such varying average front yard
setback has been so established no variance action by the Zoning Board of
Appeals and Adjustments shall be required for structure placement.
Subd. 8. Yard Space, General. Any building, structure, or use hereafter
erected, altered, or established shall comply with the yard space requirements of the district in
which it is located except as specified below. The required yard space for any building,
structure, or use shall be contained on the same lot as the building, structure, or use and such
required yard space shall fall entirely in a district or districts in which the principal use is
permitted. Any required yard space shall be open from thirty (30) inches above the ground to the
sky except as specified elsewhere in this Chapter.
Subd. 9. Placement of Single and Two (2) Family Residential Structures on
Large Lots. In any Residential District where a single or two (2) family structure is to be
developed on large lots which could later be re-sl,lbdivided and still meet the dimensional and
area requirements for another lot for the district in which it is situated, it is desirable, but not
mandatory for such structure to be placed in a manner which would permit such later resubdivision.
Subd. 10. Yard Space Encroachments - Projections Into Yards.
A. The following projections may be permitted into any front, rear or exterior
side yard adjoining a street lot line:
1. Cornices, sills, belt courses, eaves and other ornamental features to

on which they are located.
5. Canopies to a distance of not more than four (4) feet six (6) inches.
6. Balconies, in residential districts, to a distance of not more than

(1/5) of the required least width of such side yard and not more than three
(3) feet in any case.
Subd. 11. Yard Space Exception, Steep Slopes. In any residential district
where natural grade of a lot within the required front yard has an average slope, normal to the
front lot line at every point along said line, of such a degree or percent of slope that it is not
practicable to provide a driveway with a grade twelve (12) percent or less to a private garage
conforming to the requirements of this Chapter, such garage may be located within such front
yard, but not in any case closer than twelve (12) feet to the street line.
Subd. 12. Erection of More Than One (1) Principal Structure on a Lot. In
any district, more than one (1) structure housing a permitted or permissible principal use may be
erected on a single lot, provided that yard and other requirements of this Chapter shall be met for
each structure as though it were on an individual lot.
Subd. 13. Housing Projects Utilizing the "Zero Lot Line" Concept. Every
development proposal in a R-3 or R-4 Residential District which is designed so as to place the
principal structure abutting a side property line in order to have only one (1) open side yard, must
file with the Zoning Administrator a signed copy of the covenant assuring access through the
adjacent yard for purposes of repairs and general maintenance. Such covenant is mandatory and
the issuance of any Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall be contingent on the filing.
Subd. 14. Accessory Buildings.
A. In case an accessory building is attached to the main building, it shall be
made structurally a part of the main building and shall comply in all
(09-15-2005)
19

respects with the requirements of this Chapter applicable to the main
building. An accessory building, unless attached to and made part of the
main building, shall not be closer than five (5) feet to the main building.
B. A detached accessory building used as a private garbage enclosure not
over one (1) story and not over fifteen (15) feet in height may occupy up
to hirty (30) percent of the are of any side or rear yard, but shall not be
placed in any front yard (closer than the building line setback from the
street line) in any Zoning District.
Subd. 15. Fences in Residential Districts. In any Residential District, fences
for decorative, screening, or confinement purposes may be constructed on any lot. Provided,
however, that fences in any front or side yard of a comer lot shall be limited to a maximum
height of thirty (30) inches along the street side within forty ( 40) feet of the intersecting street or
alley right-of-way lines, and of sixty (60) inches if of mesh or similar construction permitting
functional line-of-sight through such fencing for purposes of street traffic safety. If the
foregoing height limitation is not applicable, all fences shall be limited to a height of six (6) feet.
All fence heights shall be measured from contiguous ground level on both sides. Setbacks from
lot lines shall be sufficient in all cases to permit painting, repair, and general maintenance.
Provided, however, that adjoining owners may construct a fence on the lot line, each side of
which is to be maintained by such adjoining owner, if they have entered into a written agreement
and duly recorded the same in the office of the County Recorder. No more than seventy (70)
percent of any fence shall be solid.
Subd. 16. Determination of Yard Requirements. Before issuing any permit, a
determination shall be made by the Zoning Administrator as to what constitutes the rear yard and
side yard. After such determination has been made, no future permits on such premises shall be
issued which are not in full compliance with such determination. As to premises on which there
are existing structures, such determination shall also be made with reference to applications for
permits, reasonably construing the apparent election at the time of the original and any
subsequent construction.

§ 11.55
SEC.11.55. FLOOD PLAIN.
Subd. 1. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and Purpose.
1. Statutory Authorization. The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in
Minnesota Statutes Chapter 103F and 462, delegated the responsibility to local government units
to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of the City of
Pipestone, Minnesota does ordain as follows:
A. Findings of Fact. The flood hazard areas of Pipestone, Minnesota,
are subject to periodic inundation which results in potential loss of
life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures or flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and
general welfare.
B. Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. This Ordinance is based
upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is
consistent with the standards established by the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources.
C. National Flood Insurance Program Compliance. This Ordinance is
adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National
Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal
Regulations Parts 59 -78, as amended, so as to maintain the
community's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
2. Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in Subd. lA by
provisions contained herein.
Subd. 2. General Provisions.
1. Lands to Which Ordinance Applies. This Ordinance shall apply to all
lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Pipestone shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or
the attachments thereto as being located within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or
General Flood Plain Districts.
2. Establishment of Official Zoning Map. The Official Zoning Map together
with all materials attached thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
Ordinance. The attached material shall include the Flood Insurance Study for the City of
Pipestone prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency dated February 15, 1991,
(09-15-2005)
72
§ 11.55
and the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map and Flood Insurance Rate Map dated February 15,
1991 therein. The City is also adopting the Pipestone County Flood Insurance Rate Map Panel
#75 dated July 3, 1986. The Official Zoning Map shall be on file in the Office of the City
Administrator and the Building and Zoning Administrator.
3. Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. The regulatory flood protection
elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood
plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from
designation of a floodway.
4. Interpretation.
A. In their interpretation and application, the prov1s10ns of this
Ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be
liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body and shall not be
deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state
statutes.
B. The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by
scaling distances on the Official Zoning Map. Where
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries
of the district as shown on the Official Zoning Map, as for example
where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary
and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the
decision of the Zoning Administrator, the Board of Appeals and
Adjustment shall make the necessary interpretation. All decisions
will be based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood
profile, the ground elevations that existed on the site at the time the
Community adopted its initial floodplain ordinance or on the date
of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the
area within the 100-year floodplain if earlier, and other available
technical data. Persons contesting the location of the district
boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their
case to the Board of Appeals and Adjustment and to submit
technical evidence.
5. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this Ordinance
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However,
where this Ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail.
All other ordinances inconsistent with this Ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
(09-15-2005)
73
§ 11.55
6. W aming and Disclaimer of Liability. This Ordinance does not imply that
areas outside the flood plain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be :free
:from flooding or flood damages. This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City
of Pipestone or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result :from reliance
on this Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
7. Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this Ordinance
is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this
Ordinance shall not be affected thereby.

a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the
market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of
the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred
"substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
(a) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
(b) Any alteration of an "historic structure", provided that the

§ 11.55
H. Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and
floodwalls constructed to any height where the intent is to protect
individual structures and levees or dikes where the intent is to
protect agricultural crops for a frequency flood event equal to or
less than the 10-year frequency flood event.
4. Standards for Floodway Conditional Uses.
A. All Uses. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including
fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials
or equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use
that will cause any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional

The conditional use permit must be title registered with the
property in the Office of the County Recorder.
(09-15-2005)
80
§ 11.55
E. Accessory Structures.
(a) Accessory structures shall not be designed for human
habitation.
(b) Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and
placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum
obstruction to the flow of flood waters:
1. Whenever possible, structures shall constructed
with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of
flood flow; and
2. So far as practicable, structures shall be placed
approximately on the same flood flow lines as those
of adjoining structures.
( c) Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally
dry flood proofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2
flood proofing classifications in the State Building Code.
As an alternative, an accessory structure may be flood
proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 flood proofing classification in
the State Building Code provided the accessory structure
constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500
square feet in size at its largest projection, and for a
detached garage, the detached garage must be used solely
for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All flood
proofed accessory structures must meet the following
additional standards:
1. The structure must be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of
the structure and shall be designed to equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
2. Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure
must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation or properly flood proofed; and
3. To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic
pressure, there must be a minimum of two
"automatic" openings in the outside walls of the
structure having a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding. There must be openings on at
least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all
openings must be no higher than one foot above the
lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human
(09-15-2005)
81
§ 11.55
intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding
will not satisfy this requirement for automatic
openmgs.
F. Storage of Materials and Equipment.
G.
H.
Subd. 5.
(a) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to
human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.

readily removable from the area within the time available
after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan
approved by the Governing Body.
Structural works for flood control that will change the course,
current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall
be subject to the provisions of Minnesota Statute, Chapter 103G.
Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to
remove areas from the regulatory flood plain shall not be allowed
in the floodway.
A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not
cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and the
technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss
on both sides of a stream.
Flood Fringe District (FF).
1. Permitted Uses. Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures
Listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district(s). If no pre-existing, underlying
zoning use districts exist, then any residential or non-residential structure or use of a structure or
land shall be a permitted use in the Flood Fringe District provided such use does not constitute a
public nuisance. All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for Flood Fringe District
"Permitted Uses" listed in Subd. 5.2 and the "Standards for all Flood Fringe Uses" listed in Subd.
5.5.
2. Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses.
A. All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above
the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill
(09-15-2005)
82
§ 11.55
elevation for structures shall be no lower than one (1) foot below
the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill shall extend at
such elevation at least fifteen (15) feet beyond the outside limits of
the structure erected thereon.
B. As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that
constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square
feet at its largest projection may be internally flood proofed in
accordance with Subd. 4.E ( c ).
C. The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess
of one-thousand (1,000) cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel
shall be allowable only as a conditional use, unless said fill is
specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with
Subd. 5.2A of this ordinance.
D. The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill
to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
E. The provisions of Subd. 5 .5 of this Ordinance shall apply.
2. Conditional Uses. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or flood
proofed in accordance with Subd. 5.2A - 5.2B and or any use of land that does not comply with
the standards in Subd. 5.2C - 5.2D shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An application
for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures
specified in Subd. 5.4-5.5 and Subd. 10.4 of this Ordinance.
4. Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses.
A. Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory
flood protection elevation. These alternative methods may include
the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade,
enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The
base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-grade
and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if: 1) the enclosed
area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure; 2) it is
designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant
materials; and 3) it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building
access or storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods
are subject to the following additional standards:
(09-15-2005)
83
§ 11.55
(a) Design and Certification - The structure's design and asbuilt
condition must be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect as being in compliance
with the general design standards of the State Building
Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating,
ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory
flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood
water from entering or accumulating within these
components during times of flooding.
(b) Specific Standards for Above-grade, Enclosed Areas -
Above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or
tuck under garages must be designed to internally flood and
the design plans must stipulate:
1. A minimum area of openings in the walls where
internal flooding is to be used as a flood proofing
technique. There shall be a minimum of two
openings on at least two sides of the structure and
the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than
one-foot above grade. The automatic openings shall
have a minimum net area of net less than one square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject
to flooding unless a registered professional engineer
or architect certifies that a smaller net area would
suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped
with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or
devices provided that they permit the automatic
entry and exit of flood waters without any form of
human intervention; and
2. That the enclosed area will be designed of flood
resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or
FP-4 classifications in the State Building Code and
shall be used solely for building access, parking of
vehicles or storage.
B. Basements, as defined by Subd. 2.8B of this Ordinance, shall be
subject to the following:
(a) Residential basement construction shall not be allowed
below the regulatory flood protection elevation.
(b) Non-residential basements may be allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation provided the basement
is structurally dry flood proofed in accordance with Subd.
5.4C of this Ordinance.
(09-15-2005)
84
§ 11.55
C. All areas of non residential structures including basements to be
placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be
flood proofed in accordance with the structurally dry flood
proofing classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally
dry flood proofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing
classification in the State Building Code and this shall require
making the structure watertight with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures flood
proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted.
D. When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other
similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site
storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads,
dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, an
erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless the
community is enforcing a state approved shoreland management
ordinance. In the absence of a state approved shoreland ordinance,
the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill
on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or regional
flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a
registered professional engineer or other qualified individual
acceptable to the Governing Body. The plan may incorporate
alternative procedures for removal of the material from the flood
plain if adequate flood warning time exists.
E. Storage of Materials and Equipment.
(a) The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to
human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
(b) Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available
after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan
approved by the Governing Body.
F. The provisions of Subd. 5.5 of this Ordinance shall also apply.
5. Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses.
A. All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above
an elevation not more than two (2) feet below the regulatory flood
(09-15-2005)
85
§ 11.55
protection elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted,
the Board of Appeals and Adjustment must specify limitations on
the period of use or occupancy of the structure for times of
flooding and only after determining that adequate flood warning
time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
B. Commercial Uses - accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad
tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the
regulatory flood protection elevation. However, a permit for such
facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall
not be granted in the absence of a flood warning system that
provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the
depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product
number exceeds four (4) upon occurrence of the regional flood.
C. Manufacturing and Industrial Uses - measures shall be taken to
minimize interference with normal plant operations especially
along streams having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory
land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations
subject to requirements set out in Subd. 5.5B above. In
considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given
to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in
flood plain areas.
D. Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable
method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area
designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above
the 100-year flood elevation - FEMA's requirements incorporate
specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for
multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change
of special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
E. Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary
watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other
encroachment limit has not been specified on the Official Zoning
Map.

The designated engineer or expert shall:
(a) Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood.
(b) Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood
based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and
overbank areas.
( c) Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the
regional flood without increasing flood stages more than
0.5 foot. A lesser stage increase than .5' shall be required
if, as a result of the additional stage increase, increased
flood damages would result. An equal degree of
encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach
shall be assumed in computing floodway boundaries.
C. The Zoning Administrator shall present the technical evaluation
and findings of the designated engineer or expert to the Governing
Body. The Governing Body must fornrnlly accept the technical
evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood Fringe
District boundary or deny the permit application. The Governing
Body, prior to official action, may submit the application and all
supporting data and analyses to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, the Department of Natural Resources or the
Planning Commission for review and comment. Once the
Floodway and Flood Fringe District Boundaries have been
detennined, the Governing Body shall refer the matter back to the
Zoning Administrator who shall process the permit application
consistent with the applicable provisions of Subd. 4 and 5 of this
Ordinance.

94
§ 11.55
identify in writing the specific conditions that existed consistent
with the criteria specified in this Ordinance, any other zoning
regulations in the Community, and in the respective enabling
legislation that justified the granting of the variance. No variance
shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in
that district, permit a lower degree of flood protection than the
regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area, or
permit standards lower than those required by state law. The
following additional variance criteria of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency must be satisfied:
(a) Variances shall not be issued by a community within any
designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(b) Variances shall only be issued by a community upon (i) a
showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination
that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the
granting of a variance will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances.

official controls and also by Minnesota Statutes.
G. Flood Insurance Notice and Record Keeping. The Zoning
Administrator shall notify the applicant for a variance that: 1) The
issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood
level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and 2)
Such construction below the 100-year or regional flood level
increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions. A community
shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including
justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in
its annual or biennial report submitted to the Administrator of the

such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. Such actions may
include but are not limited to:
A. In responding to a suspected Ordinance violation, the Zoning

party. The Community must act in good faith to enforce these
official controls and to correct Ordinance violations to the extent
possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program.

the attention of the Zoning Administrator, the Zoning
Administrator shall immediately investigate the situation and
document the nature and extent of the violation of the official
control. As soon as is reasonably possible, this information will be
submitted to the appropriate Department of Natural Resources' and

with the Community's plan of action to correct the violation to the
degree possible.
C. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the suspected party of the
requirements of this Ordinance and all other official controls and
the nature and extent of the suspected violation of these controls.

the Zoning Administrator may order the construction or
development immediately halted until a proper permit or approval
is granted by the Community. If the construction or development
is already completed, then the Zoning Administrator may either:
(1) issue an order identifying the corrective actions that must be
made within a specified time period to bring the use or structure
into compliance with the official controls; or (2) notify the
responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact permit/development
approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30-days.
D. If the responsible paiiy does not appropriately respond to the
Zoning Administrator within the specified period of time, each
additional day that lapses shall constitute an additional violation of

Subd.13.
§ 11.55
this Ordinance and shall be prosecuted accordingly. The Zoning

period notify the landowner to restore the land to the condition
which existed prior to the violation of this Ordinance.
Amendments.

removed from flood plain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in error or that the
area has been filled to or above the elevation of the regulatory flood protection elevation and is
contiguous to lands outside the flood plain. Special exceptions to this rule may be permitted by
the Commissioner of Natural Resources if he determines that, through other measures, lands are
adequately protected for the intended use.
2. All amendments to this Ordinance, including amendments to the Official
Zoning Map, must be submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of Natural Resources
prior to adoption. Changes in the Official Zoning Map must meet the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's (FEMA) Technical Conditions and Criteria and must receive prior FEMA
approval before adoption. The Commissioner of Natural Resources must be given 10-days
written notice of all hearings to consider an amendment to this Ordinance and said notice shall
include a draft of the Ordinance amendment or technical study under consideration.

provisions:
1. No such structure may be enlarged or altered m a way which
interests its non-conformity.

If a lawful use of structures or of structures and land in combination (hereinafter, use) exists at
the effective date of this ordinance that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of
this ordinance, that use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:

Board of Adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the
provisions of this ordinance.

STATE STATUTE NUMBER 462.3595.
The following subdivisions 1 through 4 are taken from the M. S. Ch. 462.3595.
Subd. 1. Authority. The governing body may, by ordinance, designate
certain types of developments, including planned unit developments, and certain land
development activities as conditional uses under zoning regulations. Conditional uses may be
approved by the governing body or other designated authority by a showing by the applicant that
the standards and criteria stated in the ordinance will be satisfied. The standards and criteria
shall include both general requirements for all conditional uses, and insofar as practicable,
requirements specific to each designated conditional use.
Subd. 2. Public Hearings. Public hearings on the granting of conditional
use permits shall be held in the manner provided in section 462.357, subdivision 3.
Subd. 3. Duration. A conditional use permit shall remain in effect as long

shall be filed with the county recorder or registrar of titles of the county or counties in which the
municipality is located for record. The conditional use permit shall include the legal description

SEC. 11.63. VARIANCES AND APPEALS.
Subd. 1. Variances. The Board of Zoning Adjustments and Appeals shall
have the general authority to grant variances only if it is established that it is in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of this ordinance, and to attach such conditions to the variances as it
deems necessary to assure compliance with the purpose of this ordinance. A variance may be
permitted if all of the following requirements are met:
1. That the property in question cannot yield a reasonable use if
permitted to be used only under conditions allowed by the regulations governing the district in
which it is located.
(09-15-2005)
116
§11.63
2. That the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances not
normally applicable to landholdings within the same district.
3. That the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the locality.
Subd. 2. Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the Board of Zoning Adjustments and Appeals before any variance may be
granted.
Subd. 3. Appeals. The Board of Zoning Adjustments and Appeals shall
have the authority to hear and decide appeals from any order, requirement, decision, grant or
refusal made by the Zoning Administrator in the administration of this ordinance.
State Statute #462.357. Subd. 6. Appeals and Adjustments. Appeals to the Board of
Appeals and Adjustments may be taken by any affected person upon compliance with any
reasonable conditions imposed by the zoning ordinance. The Board of Appeals and Adjustments
has the following powers with respect to the zoning ordinance:
1. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error
in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative officer in the
enforcement of the zoning ordinance.
2. To hear requests for variances from the literal provisions of the
ordinance in instances where their strict enforcement would cause undue hardship because of
circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration, and to grant such variances
only when it is demonstrated that such actions will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of the
ordinance. "Undue hardship" as used in connection with the granting of a variance means the
property in question cannot be put to a reasonable use if used under conditions allowed by the
official controls, the plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the property not
created by the landowner, and the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the
locality. Economic considerations alone shall not constitute an undue hardship if reasonable use
for the property exists under the terms of the ordinance. Undue hardship also includes, but not
limited to, inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems. Variances shall be
granted for earth-sheltered construction as defined in Section 216c.06, subdivision 2, when in
harmony with the ordinance. The Board of Appeals and Adjustments or the governing body, as
the case may be, may not permit as a variance any sue that is not permitted under the ordinance
for property in the zone where the affected person's land is located. The Board or governing
body, as the case may be, may permit as a variance, the temporary use of a one-family dwelling
as a two-family dwelling. The Board or governing body, as the case may be, may impose
conditions in the granting of variances to insure compliance and to protect adjacent properties.

§ 11.90
Howard Needles Tammen and Bergendoff, and dated November 11, 1975, attached hereto and
made a part hereof, which map, together with such amendments thereto as may from time to time
be made, and all notations, references, elevations, data, zone boundaries, and other information
thereon, shall be and the same is hereby adopted as part of this Section.
Subd. 7. Non-Conforming Use. Regulations non-retroactive. The
regulations prescribed by this Section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or
other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the
effective date of this Section, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any non-conforming
use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change n the construction, alteration, or intended
use of any structure, the construction or alteration, of which was begun prior to the effective date
of this Section, and is diligently prosecuted and completed within two (2) years thereof.
Subd. 8. Permits.
1. Future Uses. Except as specifically provided in Items 1, 2, and 3
hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure shall be erected,
altered, or otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefore shall have
been applied for and granted by the Zoning Administrator, hereinafter, provided for. Each
application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient
particularity to permit it to conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is
in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted.
a. However, a permit for tree or structure of less than seventyfive
(75) feet of vertical height above the ground shall not
be required in the horizontal and conical zones or on any
approach and transitional zones beyond a horizontal
distance of four thousand two hundred ( 4,200) feet from
each end of the runway except when such tree or structure,
because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features,
would extend the height limit prescribed for the respective
zone.
b. Nothing contained in this foregoing exception shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any
construction, alteration, or growth of any structure or tree
in excess of any of the height limitations established by this
Section.
c. The provisions of this Section will not prevent the issuing
of a pennit for the erection of buildings or further
development on those lots within the Skyway Industrial
Park east of the airport not yet improved, but containing
(09-15-2005)
175
§11.90
water or sewer service or streets as of the effective date of
this Section. However, all future development within the
industrial park shall at all times be subject to the height
restrictions contained in this Section.
2. Existing Uses. Before any existing use or structure may be
replaced, substantially altered or repaired, or rebuilt within any zone established herein, a permit
must be secured authorizing such placement, change or repair. No permit shall be granted that
would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a non-conforming use,
structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of
this Section or any amendment thereto, or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
Except an indication, all applications for such a permit shall be permitted.
3. Non-Conforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed.
a. Whenever the Zoning Administrator determines that a nonconforming
structure or tree has been abandoned or more
than fifty (50) percent tom down, physically deteriorated,
or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow
such structure or tree to exceed the granted applicable
height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning
regulations. Whether application is made for a permit
under this Subparagraph or not, the Zoning Administrator
may order the owner of the abandoned, or partially
destroyed non-conforming structure, at his own expense, to
lower, remove, reconstruct, or equip the same in the
manner necessary to conform to the provisions to this
Section. In the event the owner of the non-confom1ing
structure shall neglect or refuse to comply with such order
for ten (10) days after receipt of written notice of such
order, proceed to have the abandoned or partially destroyed
non-confonning structure lowered, removed, reconstructed,
or equipped and assess the cost and expense thereof against
the land on which the structure is or was located.
b. Unless such an assessment is paid within ninety (90) days
from the service of notice thereof on the owner of the land,
the sum shall bear the interest rate of eight (8) percent per
annum from the date of the cost and expenses is incmTed
until paid, and shall be collected in the same manner as are
general taxes.

CHAPTER12
SUBDIVISION REGULATION (PLATTING)
SECTION 12.01. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
Subd. 1. Purpose. Land subdivision is the first step in the process of
community development. Once land has been divided into streets, blocks, lots and open spaces a
pattern has been established which determines how well community needs for residents, business
and industry will be met. It also determines, to a great extent, how well the community will be
able to handle its traffic circulation problems, how well it will be able to meet the demand for
home sites and how efficiently and economically it will be able to provide the many services that
are required. These subdivision regulations are designed to provide for harmonious development
of a subdivided area; for a coordinated layout; for the proper arrangement of streets; for adequate
and convenient spaces for traffic, utilities, recreation, light, air, and access for fire-fighting
equipment; and for adequate provision for water, drainage, sewer and other sanitary facilities.
This Chapter adopts subdivision regulations to provide for the orderly, economic and safe
development of land and urban services and facilities to promote the public health, safety, morals
and general welfare.
Subd. 2. Application. This Chapter shall apply to all land now lying
within, and hereafter annexed to, the City, and to unincorporated territory located within two (2)
miles of its limits in any direction. Except as herein otherwise provided, this Chapter shall apply
to the subdivision of a lot, tract or parcel of land into two (2) or more lots, tracts, or other
division of land for any purpose, whether immediate or future, including the re-subdivision,
rearrangement or re-platting of land or lots. This Chapter shall further apply to any parcel of
land being subdivided which includes an existing or future public right-of-way or easement
according to the Comprehensive Plan of the City, that has not been previously dedicated. This
Chapter shall not apply 1) to subdivision into tracts each of which tracts contain five (5) acres or
more, and at least three hundred (300) feet in width, or 2) to re-subdivision of land previously
subdivided the total area of which is one (1) acre or less, or 3) to the subdivision or allocation of
land as open space for common use by owners, occupants or leaseholders, or as easements for
the extension and maintenance of public sewerage, water, storm drainage, or other public
facilities.
Subd. 3. Plat Approval Required. No plat for a subdivision or part thereof
within the application of this Chapter shall be prepared, presented for approval, approved, or
recorded, except as prescribed herein.
Subd. 4. Restrictions on Filing and Recording Conveyances.
A. After the effective date of this Subdivision, no conveyance of land
to which this Chapter is applicable shall be filed or recorded if the land is described in the
conveyance by metes and bounds or by reference to an unapproved registered land survey made
after April 21, 1961 or to an unapproved plat.
(09-15-2005)
1

withdrawal in the office of the City Administrator. If he/she thereafter submits a Revised
Preliminary Plat it shall be so designated to distinguish it from the original thereof, provided that
a Revised Preliminary Plat shall be entitled to the same consideration, and subject to the same
procedure, except that unnecessary duplication should be avoided wherever possible.
H. If the Council's decision is to review the plat, such approval shall
be contingent upon filing a Final Plat in accordance with the requirements of this Chapter, and
the City Administrator shall forthwith advise the subdivider of the Council action. Action
approving the plat shall constitute approval of all supplementary documents, including, but not
limited to, the plan for construction and installation of improvements and the proposed method
of payment therefore. In the event that any variance has been requested by the subdivider, and
the Council approves the plat, it shall also make findings granting such variance. If its decision
is to disapprove, the Council shall make and adopt findings of fact and conclusions which shall
forthwith be forwarded to the subdivider.
I. The requirements of Subparagraphs E and G above, may be
waived by the Planning Commission and Council if the plat is a subdivision or a resubdivision of
an area, and if the plat does not affect the land use of the area and ifthe plat does not involve the
development of additional streets or portion thereof. If the formal hearing and notification
process are waived, the Planning Commission shall still approve the plat pursuant to the other
provisions of this Subdivision and pass its recommendation on to the Council for its approval or
disapproval which shall be given within thirty (30) days after the decision of the Planning

Street and Block Layout.
A. The subdivision shall be so designed as to be in harmony with
adjacent subdivisions and provide for the continuation of existing streets. Provisions shall be
made for streets through existing streets. Provisions shall be made for streets through the
subdivision for the platting of contiguous property. No strip of unplatted land or portion of street
or artifice shall be used or retained by the subdivider to impede the platting of adjacent parcels.
B. The street layout shall provide access adequate for emergency and
public service vehicles to all lots and parcels of land within the subdivision.
c. Where appropriate to the design, streets shall be established to
avoid jogs at intersections and to promote continuity of local streets and those of higher
classifications. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred fifty (150) feet shall
be discouraged.
(09-15-2005)
22
§ 12.20
D. Streets shall be established to take advantage of the contour of the
land so as to produce usable lots, cause a minimum of cutting and filling and to produce streets
with reasonable grades as defined herein.
E. Certain proposed streets, where appropriate, shall be extended to
the boundary line of the tract to provide for adequate circulation of traffic within the vicinity for
adjacent but as yet undeveloped or platted land tracts.
F. Streets shall intersect other streets as near to a ninety (90) degree
angle as topography and other factors permit. Intersections of streets with arterial or collector
streets shall be limited to a minimum angle of seventy (70) degrees unless specifically approved
by the Commission.
G. Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted portion of a street or
alley adjacent to the proposed subdivisions which conforms to the Official Map, the remainder of
the street or alley shall be platted to the prescribed width within the proposed subdivision.
H. Half-width streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these
regulations. Where an existing half-width street adjoins a portion of the boundary of a proposed
subdivision, street dedication in a width needed to make this a full-width street may be required.
I. Street and right-of-way widths shall conform to those indicated in
the Transportation Plan. Where such widths are not prescribed therein, the widths shall not be
less than the minimum stated herein.
J. Alleys may be platted in the rear of all lots to be used for
commercial or industrial purposes. Alleys will not generally be approved in single family
residential areas, unless required by unusual topography or other exceptional conditions.
K. Land abutting arterial or collector streets shall be platted with the
view of making the lots, if for residential use, desirable for such use by cushioning the impact of
heavy traffic on such traffic ways; and with the view also of minimizing interference with traffic
on such traffic ways as well as the accident hazard. This may be accomplished in several ways:
1. By platting the lots abutting such traffic ways at very
generous depth, with setbacks or front yards at least ten (10) feet greater or deeper than
otherwise required; and providing vehicular access to them by means of frontage access roads
next to the traffic way, connected therewith at infrequent intervals;
2. By not fronting the lots on the highway or thoroughfare,
but on a parallel local street at a distance of a generous lot depth, in which case private
driveways shall connect with such local street;
(09-15-2005)
23
§ 12.20
3. By a collector street platted more or less parallel with the
highway or thoroughfare, six hundred (600) to one thousand (1,000) feet distance therefrom,
from which loop streets or dead-end streets would extend toward the highway, the ends of which
provide access to the lots abutting the highway to their rear.
L. Dead-end streets will be approved if limited to eight hundred fifty
(850) feet in length, provided a permanently designed tum-around area having a minimum
diameter to the edge of the finished street or curb line of not less than fifty (50) feet and a
minimum right-of-way diameter of sixty (60) feet, is constructed.
M. Closed subdivisions over five (5) acres in size (with only one [1]
exit) shall be permitted at the discretion of the Planning Commission. This shall be done during
the Plat review.
N. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of
lots of appropriate depth, unless, in the opinion of the Commission, prevented by unusual
topography or other physical conditions.
0. The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks, and lots within blocks,
shall be determined with due regard to:
1. Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special
needs of the principal and all required accessory uses.
2. Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions, and
provisions regulating off-street parking and loading spaces.
3. Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety
of street traffic.
4. Limitations and opportunities of topography.
5. Generally, blocks shall not exceed one thousand three
hundred twenty (1,320) feet or less than three hundred fifty (350) feet in length measured along
the greatest dimension of the block.
P. Residential blocks shall normally be of sufficient width for two (2)
tiers of lots. Block lengths shall be determined by circulation and other needs.

25
§ 12.20
F. Double frontage lots and reversed frontage lots shall not generally
be platted except as hereinbefore otherwise permitted.
G. Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles to the right-ofway
line of the street on which the lot fronts.
H. Narrow, triangular lots, unusual shapes, and lots not permitting at
least a twenty-six (26) foot width house with side yards and driveway, rear yards and front yards
are prohibited. No plat will be accepted that contains lots undesirable for building, property
subject to recurrent flooding, property at grades greater than eight (8) percent or other factors
that may cause such properties to be marginal in building operations and cause such property to
be returned for property taxes.
Subb. 11. Utilities and Drainage.
A. Where an approved public water supply is within reasonable
access to the subdivision as determined by the number of lots, distance from and capacity of
existing mains, water lines shall be placed within the right-of-way of each street. Water lines
shall have a minimum diameter of six ( 6) inches (exception below), and all water mains shall be
looped so that water is available from two (2) directions to any point (exception below). Water
main, fire hydrants, gate valves and appurtenances shall be installed in accordance with
acceptable engineering practice and City municipal utilities policies.
Exception: At the discretion of the Planning Commission during the Plat review,
the Commission may allow the water line to dead end if a small portion of the subdivision is to
be developed. Fire hydrants shall be required on all dead end lines. If this is allowed, the
minimum diameter of the water line will increase to eight (8) inches. Looping of water mains is
still required when the development of the subdivision is near completion.
B. Sanitary sewers shall be constructed in accordance with the
standards of the City and each lot shall be provided with a connection to a sanitary sewer. The
City may accept an area for platting where such service cannot be provided when the lots are of
sufficient size and the soil is suitable for private disposal systems in accordance with City and
State Health Department recommendations. No such private disposal systems shall be
interconnected or run to a common private .or public drain. The minimum size public sanitary
sewer shall be eight (8) inches in diameter. Sewage lift stations may be constructed if necessary
to serve an area, provided a lift station may be constructed on an assessment basis to serve an
area only if at least fifty (50) percent of the cost is immediately assessable. The lift station cost
beyond the fifty (50) percent and the pro-rate immediately assessable may be held for future
assessment to the future area to be served.
C. All necessary facilities including underground pipe, manholes,
inlets, catch basins and other appurtenances necessary to provide adequate drainage for the
property or to maintain any natural drainage course shall be the responsibility of the developer.
(09-15-2005)
26
§12.20
Open drainage ditches will not be allowed unless specifically permitted by the City Engineer.
Platting of the property is prohibited unless it is possible to drain the property to the natural
drainage course for the area. As a minimum, no property plat will be accepted unless lots are of
such elevation as to drain in to the streets. The meeting of this minimum requirement does not
obligate the Council to accept the plat if there are substantial obstructions to the drainage of the
property contained therein, and the Council may require that the subdivider install pumping
facilities for storm drainage prior to plat acceptance if such facilities are necessary.
D. In some cases the proposed area to be platted will not be served at
its borders by water mains or sanitary sewer. The Council may require a petition for the creation
of an assessment district to extend the facilities to the platted area; or may require the subdivider
to pay the cost of such extension; or may accept the plat with a separate water or sewer system;
or may pay the cost thereof and hold the amount for future assessment; or may refuse acceptance
of the plat.
E. The City Engineer may design the improvements to be installed by
the City. A subdivider desiring to contract and install his/her own improvements shall do so in
accordance with City specifications and practice. The City Engineer will approve or disapprove
all plans, specifications and installations in the public street. For improvements installed by the
subdivider the City Engineer shall furnish a written statement to the subdivider of City
acceptance of the improvement prior to the City accepting maintenance of the improvement or
street as a part of the City system.
F. All utility lines for telephone and electrical service shall be placed
in rear line easements when carried on overhead poles. The Planning Commission may
recommend, and the Council require, that the type of overhead pole used be of a quality and
durability aesthetically in conformance with the nature of the residential development.
G. Where telephone, electric and gas service lines are to be placed
underground entirely, conduits or cables shall be placed within easements or dedicated public
ways, in such a manner so as not to conflict with other underground services.
H. All drainage and other underground utility installations which
traverse privately owned property shall be protected by easements.
I. Placement of utilities underground shall be encouraged m
accordance with the requirements of the City.
Subd.12. Other Requirements.
A. Sidewalks shall be required unless the Planning Commission
decides to waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis. This should be looked at as a safety
issue.
(09-15-2005)
27
§ 12.20
B. All streets are to be named. A proposed street which is in
alignment with and which joins an existing and named street shall be given the name of the
existing street. The name of a proposed street shall not duplicate the name of an existing street
to which it does not connect or with which it is not in alignment.
C. An easement for utilities shall be provided where necessary to
form a continuous right-of-way, at least sixteen (16) feet in width. Such easements are to be
dedicated and provide for utility service from street to street. If necessary for the extension of
water mains or sewer lines, electrical transformer pads or similar utilities, easements of greater
width may be required along lot lines or across lots.
1. Where a subdivision is transversed by a water course,
drainage way, channel or stream, a storm water easement, drainage right-of-way or park
dedication, whichever the Planning Commission may deem the most adequate, conforming
substantially with the lines of such water course shall be provided. The width of such easements
shall be determined by the Planning Commission.
