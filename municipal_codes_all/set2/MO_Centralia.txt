voted to the public within seventy-two (72) hours of the close of the meeting where such

used to limit or deny access to otherwise public records in a file, document, data file or
database containing public records. Records related to the procurement of or expenditures
relating to such computer, computer system, computer network or telecommunications
network, including the amount of moneys paid by or on behalf of a governmental body for
such computer, computer system, computer network or telecommunications network, shall be
open; and
Credit card numbers, personal identification numbers, digital certificates, physical and virtual
keys, access codes or authorization codes that are used to protect the security of electronic
transactions between a governmental body or person or entity doing business with a
governmental body. Nothing in this Subdivision shall be deemed to close the record of a
person or entity using a credit card held in the name of a governmental body or any record of
a transaction made by a person using a credit card or other method of payment for which
reimbursement is made by a governmental body.
A public record is any record, whether written or electronically stored, retained by or of any
governmental body, including any report, survey, memorandum or other document or study
prepared for the governmental body by a consultant or other professional service paid for in whole
or in part by public funds, including records created or maintained by private contractors under an
agreement with a governmental body or on behalf of a governmental body. The term "public
record" shall not include any internal memorandum or letter received or prepared by or on behalf
of a member of a governmental body consisting of advice, opinions and recommendations in
connection with the deliberative decision-making process of said body, unless such records are
retained by the governmental body or presented at a public meeting. Any document or study
prepared for a governmental body by a consultant or other professional service as described in
this paragraph shall be retained by the governmental body in the same manner as any other
public record. All City public records that may be closed under the Missouri Open Meetings and
Records Law or by some other provision of law are hereby deemed closed records unless the
governmental body votes to make them public.
Before closing a meeting and/or vote to the public, a majority of a quorum of the governmental
body shall vote to do so in a public vote. The vote of each member of the governmental body on
the question of closing the meeting or vote and the specific reason for closing the meeting or vote
by reference to a specific section of the Open Meetings and Records Law (see Section 610.021,
RSMo.) shall be announced publicly at an open meeting and entered into the minutes of that open
meeting. In the event any member of a governmental body makes a motion to close a meeting or
a record or a vote from the public and any other member believes that such motion, if passed,
would cause a meeting, record or vote to be closed from the public in violation of any provision of
the Open Meetings and Records Law, such latter member shall state his or her objection to the
motion at or before the time the vote is taken on the motion. The governmental body shall enter in
the minutes of the governmental body any objection made pursuant to this paragraph. Any
member making such an objection shall be allowed to fully participate in any meeting, record or
vote that is closed from the public over the member's objection. In the event the objecting member
also voted in opposition to the motion to close the meeting, record or vote at issue, the objection
and vote of the member as entered in the minutes shall be an absolute defense to any claim filed
against the objecting member pursuant to Section 610.027, RSMo. The governmental body
proposing to hold a closed meeting or vote shall give notice of the time, date and place of such
closed meeting or vote and the reason for holding it by reference to a specific exception allowed
under the provisions of Section 610.021, Revised Statutes of Missouri. The notice shall be given in
the same manner as required for meetings in Subsection (D) below. No other business may be
discussed in a closed meeting or vote which does not directly relate to the specific reason
announced to close the meeting or vote to the public. Any votes taken during a closed meeting
shall be taken by roll call vote. A journal of minutes of closed meetings shall be taken and retained
by each governmental body, including, but not limited to, a record of any votes taken at such
meeting. The minutes shall include the date, time, place, members present, members absent and
a record of any votes taken. When a roll call vote is taken, the minutes shall attribute each "yea"
and "nay" vote or abstinence if not voting to the name of the individual member of the

governmental body. The governmental body holding a closed meeting shall close only an existing
portion of the meeting facility necessary to house the members of the governmental body in the
closed session, allowing members of the public to remain to attend any subsequent open session
held by the governmental body following the closed session. No audio recording of any meeting,
record or vote closed pursuant to Section 610.021, RSMo., shall be permitted without permission
of the governmental body. Violators shall be guilty of a Class C misdemeanor.
The governmental body shall give notice of the time, date, place and tentative agenda of each
meeting. If the meeting will be conducted by telephone or other electronic means, the notice of the
meeting shall identify the mode by which the meeting will be conducted and the designated
location where the public may observe and attend the meeting. If a public body plans to meet by
Internet chat, Internet message board or other computer link, it shall post a notice of the meeting
on its website in addition to City Hall and shall notify the public how to access that meeting. The
notice for all meetings shall be posted on the appropriate bulletin board and message board at
City Hall at least twenty-four (24) hours, exclusive of weekends and holidays when the City Hall is
closed, prior to the commencement of the meeting. If an emergency makes it impossible or
impractical to give twenty-four (24) hours' notice, as much notice as is reasonably possible shall
be given. Notice shall also be given to any representative of the news media who requests notice
of meetings of a particular governmental body, concurrent with the notice being made available to
the members of the governmental body and at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the
commencement of the meeting, if possible.
Each meeting shall be held at a place reasonably accessible to the public and of sufficient size to
accommodate the anticipated attendance by members of the public and at a time reasonably
convenient to the public, unless for good cause such a place or time is impossible or impractical.
Every reasonable effort shall be made to grant special access to the meeting to handicapped or
disabled persons. The recording of any open meeting by audio tape, video tape or other electronic
means shall be allowed. Such recordings shall be conducted so as to minimize disruption to the
open meeting. When it is necessary to hold a meeting on less than twenty-four (24) hours' notice
or at a place that is not reasonably accessible to the public or at a time that is not reasonably
convenient to the public, the nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the normal
requirements shall be stated in the minutes of that meeting.
The term "public business" means all matters which relate in any way to the performance of the
governmental body's functions or the conduct of its business. A "public meeting" is any meeting of
a governmental body at which any public business is discussed, decided or public policy
formulated, whether such meeting is conducted in person or by means of communication
equipment, including, but not limited to, conference call, video conference, Internet chat or Internet
message board. The term "public meeting" shall not include an informal gathering of members of a
governmental body for ministerial or social purposes when there is no intent to avoid the purposes
of the Open Meetings and Records Law, but the term shall include a public vote of all or a majority
of the members of a governmental body, by electronic communication or any other means,
conducted in lieu of a public meeting with the members of the governmental body gathered at one
(1) location in order to conduct public business. A public vote is any vote, whether conducted in
person, by telephone or by any other electronic means, cast at any public meeting of a
governmental body. Except as otherwise provided by law, all votes shall be recorded and if a roll
call is taken, as to attribute each "yea" and "nay" vote, or abstinence if not voting, to the name of
the individual member of the governmental body. All public meetings shall be open to the public
and public votes and public records shall be open to the public for inspection and duplication. All
votes taken by roll call in meetings of the Board of Aldermen shall be cast by Aldermen who are
physically present and in attendance at the meeting. When it is necessary to take votes by roll call
in a meeting of the Board of Aldermen due to an emergency of the public body, with a quorum of
the Board of Aldermen physically present and in attendance and less than a quorum of the Board
of Aldermen also participating via telephone, facsimile, Internet or any other voice or electronic
means, the nature of the emergency of the Board of Aldermen justifying that departure from the
normal requirements shall be stated in the minutes. Where such emergency exists, the votes
taken shall be regarded as if all Aldermen were physically present and in attendance at the

meeting. A journal or minutes of open meetings of each governmental body shall be taken and
retained by each governmental body, including, but not limited to, a record of any votes taken at
such meeting. The minutes shall include the date, time, place, members present, members absent
and a record of any votes taken. When a roll call vote is taken, the minutes shall attribute each
"yea" and "nay" vote or abstinence if not voting to the name of the individual member of the
governmental body.
A formally constituted subunit of a parent governmental body may conduct a meeting without
notice during a lawful meeting of the parent governmental body, during a recess in that meeting or
immediately following that meeting, if the meeting of the subunit is publicly announced at the
parent meeting and the subject of the meeting reasonably coincides with the subjects discussed or
acted upon by the parent governmental body.
The City Administrator shall be the primary custodian of records for the City of Centralia, Missouri,
and shall be responsible for maintenance and control of all City records. In the absence of the City
Administrator, the City Clerk or the Assistant City Clerk shall be the custodian. Unless closed, the
custodian shall provide public access to all public records of the City for inspection and copying as
soon as possible but no later than the end of the third (3rd) business day following the date the
request is received by the custodian. If records are requested in a certain format, the custodian
shall provide the records in the requested format, if such format is available. If for reasonable
cause additional delay is necessary, the custodian shall give a detailed explanation of the cause
for the delay to the requester and also the earliest time and date the record will be available for
inspection and copying. No person may remove original public records from the offices of the
governmental body or its custodian without written permission of the custodian. If request for
access is denied, the custodian shall provide, upon request, a written statement of the grounds for
such denial. Such statement shall cite the specific provision of law under which access is denied
and shall be furnished to the requester no later than the end of the third (3rd) business day
following the date that the request for the statement is received by the custodian. If a public record
contains material which is not exempt from disclosure as well as material which is exempt from
disclosure, the custodian shall separate the exempt and non-exempt material and make the nonexempt
material available for examination and copying. When designing a public record, a
governmental body shall, to the extent practicable, facilitate a separation of exempt from nonexempt
information. If the separation is readily apparent to a person requesting to inspect or
receive copies of the form, the custodian shall generally describe the material exempted unless
that description would reveal the contents of the exempt information and thus defeat the purpose
of the exemption.
When any message relating to public business of a governmental body is transmitted by electronic
means by one (1) member of a governmental body to other members of a governmental body
such that, when counting the sender, a majority of the members of the governmental body are
electronically copied, the member of the governmental body electronically transmitting the
message shall also concurrently transmit that message to either the member's public office
computer or to the custodian of records in the same format. Any such message received by the
custodian of records or at the member's office computer shall be a public record, subject to the
closed record exceptions of Section 610.021, RSMo.
The City shall not, after August 28, 2004, enter into a contract for the creation or maintenance of a
public records database if that contract impairs the ability of the public to inspect or copy public
records including public records that are on-line or stored in an electronic record keeping system.
Such contract may not allow any impediment that as a practical matter makes it more difficult for
the public to inspect or copy the records than to inspect or copy the City's other public records. For
purposes of this paragraph, a useable electronic format shall allow, at a minimum, viewing and
printing of records. However, if the City keeps a record on a system capable of allowing the
copying of electronic documents into other electronic documents, the City shall provide data to the
public in such electronic format, if requested. But the activities authorized pursuant to this
paragraph may not take priority over the primary responsibilities of a governmental body. For
purposes of this paragraph the term "electronic services" means on-line access or access via

electronic services, provisions that (1) protect the security and integrity of the information system
of the City and of information systems that are shared by governmental bodies; and (2) limit the
liability of the City providing the services. The City may consult with the division of data processing
and telecommunications of the Missouri Office of Administration to develop the electronic services
offered by the City to the public pursuant to this paragraph.
Except as provided in Subsection (L) below, fees shall be assessed:
For furnishing copies of public records;
For document searches by City employees; and
For providing access to public records maintained on computer facilities, recording tapes or
disks, video tapes or films, pictures, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual
items or devices and for programming, if necessary.
Except as provided below, the charges shall be as follows: Five cents ($0.05) per page (for paper
copies not larger than nine (9) inches by fourteen (14) inches) for duplication costs; ten dollars
($10.00) per hour (prorated by quarters of an hour) for document searches by City employees;
and ten dollars ($10.00) per hour (prorated by quarters of an hour) for providing access to the
specialized public records described above in this paragraph and for programming, if necessary,
with copies of such items being twenty-five cents ($0.25) per item or page or one dollar ($1.00)
plus the actual cost of blank media for tape or computer disks. Fees for maps, blueprints or plats
that require special expertise to duplicate may include the actual rate of compensation for the
trained personnel required to duplicate such maps, blueprints or plats. If programming is required
beyond the customary and usual level to comply with a request for records or information, the fees
for compliance may include the actual costs of such programming. Documents may be copied,
documents may be searched for by City employees and access may be provided, without charge,
under the following circumstances:
Single copies of ordinances and regulations may be provided without charge to any person,
upon request, to enable said person to comply with said ordinances and regulations. Single
copies of ordinances and regulations may be provided without charge to another
governmental entity upon request.
Copies of documents may be provided without charge in compliance with or incident to
fulfillment of a contract obligation, when the City of Centralia is a party to said contract.
Copies of documents may be provided without charge to any person, organization or
governmental entity when the official or employee of the City of Centralia who is dealing with
said person, organization or governmental entity determines that providing said documents is
in the public interest:
In furthering a common purpose; or
In performing an activity desired by the City of Centralia; or
In achieving a result desired by the City of Centralia; or
Because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or
activities of the City and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
Copies of documents may be provided without charge when required to be provided incident
to any legal proceeding involving the City of Centralia.
Single copies of the agenda of any future meeting of any board, committee or commission of
this municipality may be provided to any person, upon request.

No charge shall be made for copies of documents, document searches or access provided
when the requester is an official or employee of the City of Centralia and the request is
pursuant to official City business.
The person requesting the public records may request the custodian to provide an estimate of
the cost to copy the public records, before the City produces the copies. Unless prior written
consent is given by the custodian, payment shall be made before or at the time public records
are duplicated. At any time, the custodian may require that advance payment be made before
public records are duplicated, including when the number of public records being requested to
be duplicated is large. With written consent of the custodian, payment for duplication costs
may be made by the requester on a date after duplication has been performed. Payment for
document searches by City employees, for providing access to the specialized public records
and for programming shall be made upon completion of the search, upon the completion of
providing access and/or completion of the programming.
If the governmental body is in doubt about the legality of closing a particular meeting, record or
vote, it may bring suit at the expense of the governmental body in the Circuit Court of Boone
County, Missouri, to ascertain the propriety of any such action or it may seek a formal opinion of
the Attorney General of the State of Missouri or the City Attorney.

grocery store, a general merchandise store, a confectionery, or a delicatessen store.
The applicant has and shall keep a stock of goods in the applicant's place of business for
which the package liquor license is being sought, of the kind ordinarily carried in such a place
of business, of the value of at least one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) according to invoices,
exclusive of fixtures and intoxicating liquors. That all of said goods are salable and that they
are prominently exposed and offered to the public for sale in said place and business. An

(Reserved)
If a person is licensed by the State and the City or is applying to be licensed by the State and City

A written, acknowledged statement from a person who states under oath that said person has
personally witnessed the actions of a dog that come within the provisions of Section 4-32, if
deemed reliable and sufficient.
If a Police Officer, the Code Enforcement Officer or the City Administrator determines that a dog
comes within the provisions of Section 4-32 and thus is a "dangerous dog", then that designation
shall be made in a written notice which shall include the following information:
A description of the dog, including breed, color and gender if known;
The name and address of the dog's owner, if known;
The dog's license tag number (if any);
The facts upon which the person made the determination to designate the dog as a
"dangerous dog" under the provisions of Section 4-32; and
The current location of the dog if different from the owner's address.
The written notice shall also state the additional requirements that the owner of a dangerous
dog must comply with as set forth in Section 4-34, along with the possible penalties for
violating those requirements. The written notice shall inform the owner that the owner must
begin complying with the requirements on a date set forth in the notice, which shall be no
later than thirty (30) days from the date the written notice is delivered. The written notice
also shall state that the owner of the dog designated a "dangerous dog" has the right to
contest the facts and the designation of the dog as a "dangerous dog" by filing a written
request with the City Clerk within five (5) days, for an informal hearing before a Hearing
Board composed of the Mayor and two (2) Aldermen.
The written notice designating a dog as a "dangerous dog" shall be personally delivered to the
dog's owner or to a member of the dog owner's family or household seventeen (17) years of age
or older. The owner of the dog designated a "dangerous dog" may within five (5) days from the
date of delivery of the notice file with the City Clerk a written request for an informal hearing before
a Hearing Board composed of the Mayor and two (2) Aldermen to contest the facts and the
designation of the owner's dog as a "dangerous dog" under the provisions of Section 4-32. The
two (2) Aldermen to hear the informal appeals with the Mayor shall be selected by the Board of
Aldermen. If a written request for an informal hearing before the Hearing Board is filed with the
City Clerk within the time permitted, the Hearing Board shall hold a hearing to determine if the dog
is a "dangerous dog" under the provisions of Section 4-32. The City Clerk shall provide at least
five (5) days' notice of the date, time and location of the hearing to the dog owner by personal
delivery of the hearing notice to the owner or to a member of the dog owner's family or household
seventeen (17) years of age or older, or by certified mail to the dog owner (with delivery presumed
two (2) days after the date of mailing). The hearing shall be open to the public, and all interested
persons (including City personnel) shall be given an opportunity to present evidence on the issue
of whether the dog is a "dangerous dog" under the provisions of Section 4-32, provided that the
Hearing Board may limit testimony and written evidence that appears to be cumulative or not
relevant. The Hearing Board shall then decide at the conclusion of the introduction of the evidence
at the hearing whether to uphold or set aside the designation of the dog as a "dangerous dog"
under the provisions of Section 4-32. The decision of the Hearing Board shall be set forth in
writing within five (5) days of the hearing date and a copy shall be given to the dog's owner and to
the Police Department.
If a Police Officer, the Code Enforcement Officer or the City Administrator determines and
designates a dog to be a "dangerous dog" under the provisions of Section 4-32 and that
designation is not contested within the time allowed, or if the Hearing Board after the informal
hearing upholds the designation made by a Police Officer, the Code Enforcement Officer or City
Administrator that a dog is a "dangerous dog" under the provisions of Section 4-32, then such
designation or decision shall create a conclusive presumption that the dog designated as a

dangerous dog.
[Ord. No. 1984 § 1, 12-15-1997; Ord. No. 2413 §§ 1, 3, 5-15-2006]
The owner of any dog that has been designated a "dangerous dog" under the provisions of this Article
shall comply with following, beginning at the time as provided for in Section 4-33:
Confinement. Except when leashed and muzzled as provided in this Section, a dangerous dog
shall be securely confined in an enclosed building or securely confined in a locked pen or other
like locked enclosure that is suitable to prevent the entry of children and is designed to prevent the
dog from escaping. If confined in an enclosed building the dangerous dog shall not be kept in any
part of the enclosed building that would allow the dog to leave such building on its own. Further,
the dangerous dog shall not be kept in any part of the enclosed building with open windows or
where screen windows or screen doors are the only obstacle preventing the dog from leaving the
building. If the dangerous dog is confined in a pen or other like enclosure, all gates or doors of the
pen or enclosure shall be locked with a key or combination lock. Further, the pen or enclosure
shall have secure sides of sufficient height and a secure top attached to the sides to prevent
escape of the dog. Further, the pen or enclosure shall either have a secure bottom or floor
permanently attached to the sides, or the sides of the pen or enclosure shall be embedded in the
ground no less than twenty-four (24) inches or be embedded into a concrete pad no less than four
(4) inches. Further, the pen or enclosure shall be of such material and closed in such a manner
that the dog cannot leave the pen or enclosure on its own. Further, the pen or enclosure shall
comply with all applicable zoning and Building Code provisions, but in addition shall be located at
least ten (10) feet from any property line. A Police Officer or the Code Enforcement Officer shall be
permitted to inspect the pen or enclosure in which the "dangerous dog" is kept, at any time, to
determine compliance with this Article.
Outside of confinement. No dangerous dog shall be outside of its required building, pen or
enclosure, including on the dog owner's property, except under the following conditions:
The dangerous dog shall be secured on a leash of sufficient strength to restrain the dog and
shall be not more than four (4) feet in length. The leash shall be physically controlled by a
person capable of restraining the dog with a leash and shall not be attached to an object such
as a tree, post or building; and
The dangerous dog shall further be muzzled by a properly fitted muzzling device fastened
over the dog's mouth sufficient to prevent the dog from biting a person or another animal.
Such muzzle shall not interfere with the dog's breathing or vision.
Signs. If a dangerous dog is confined in a pen or other enclosure, a sturdy sign that can weather
the elements shall be conspicuously posted on the side of the pen or enclosure where the door is,
with the following words in letters at least four (4) inches in height: "Beware of Dangerous Dog". If
a dangerous dog is confined in an enclosed building, a sturdy sign that can weather the elements
shall be conspicuously posted in front of the front entrance of the building or attached to the front

Liability insurance or cash escrow. The owner of a dangerous dog shall comply with one (1) of the
following two (2) alternative provisions:
Liability insurance. The owner of a dangerous dog shall obtain and keep in effect at all times
while the dog is kept within the City public liability insurance in a single incident amount of at
least fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) covering any property damage or bodily injury,
including death, to any person or persons that may be caused by the dog. Such insurance
policy shall provide that no cancellation of the policy will be made unless ten (10) days' written
notice is first given by the insurance company to the City of such cancellation. The insurance
policy shall further provide that the insurance company shall give written notice to the City of
any termination, expiration or non-renewal of the insurance policy. The owner of the
dangerous dog shall present to the City Clerk written proof that such liability insurance has
been obtained and is in effect, including the expiration date of the policy; or
Cash escrow. The owner of a dangerous dog shall deposit with the City the sum of seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) in cash or by certified check or money order to be held by the
City in escrow. The dangerous dog owner shall not be entitled to earn any interest on the
deposit and the City shall owe no interest to said dog owner. The City shall hold the money in
escrow as a source of funds to pay for any subsequent injury to a person (other than the
owner of the dangerous dog), subsequent injury to an animal (other than a wild animal) or
subsequent damage to another person's property caused by the dangerous dog. If funds are
expended by the City from such escrowed amount for such injury or damage, the then owner
of the dangerous dog shall, within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice by the City of
the funds expenditure, deposit with the City, in cash or by certified check or money order, a
sum sufficient to return the amount of the escrowed funds to seven hundred fifty dollars
($750.00). If the owner of a dangerous dog who had deposited funds with the City as required
above later shall provide sufficient proof to the Code Enforcement Officer or the City
Administrator of the death of such dangerous dog, then the City Administrator shall direct that
the balance of the escrowed funds after payment for all above-stated injuries and property
damage shall be refunded to the dangerous dog owner who deposited the funds with the City.
The City shall have no obligation to refund to a dangerous dog owner or other person any
amounts deposited into escrow by the dangerous dog owner as required above except as
provided above to the dangerous dog owner concerning the death of the dangerous dog or
except by motion approved by a majority vote of the Board of Aldermen with any stipulated
conditions.
Dangerous dog tags. Every dangerous dog shall wear a red circular metallic tag affixed by a
permanent metal fastening to the dog's collar in addition to the metallic tag required for all dogs.
The owner shall obtain the red circular tag from the City Clerk after providing the City Clerk with
information, including the name and address of the owner, and the breed, age, gender, color and
identifying marks of the dog, as well as the location where the dog is to be kept, if not at the
owner's address. The City Clerk shall issue the red circular metallic tag at no cost to the owner of
each dangerous dog. The red circular metallic tag shall be worn on the collar of a dangerous dog
at all times to clearly and easily identify the dog as a dangerous dog. The City may inscribe such
wording and numbering on the red circular metallic tag as deemed necessary. In case any red
circular metallic tag becomes lost, a duplicate may be issued by the City Clerk. It is unlawful to
counterfeit or attempt to counterfeit the red circular metallic tag. It further is unlawful to take,
remove or cause to be taken or removed the metallic tag or collar placed upon the dangerous dog
by its owner, without the consent of the owner or keeper thereof. No red circular metallic tag shall
be placed on any dog except the one for which it is issued. No red circular metallic tag is
transferable.
Notification of escape of dangerous dog or injury committed by dangerous dog. The owner of a
dangerous dog shall notify the Police Department immediately if the dog is at large outside its

Change of address. If the owner of a dangerous dog moves such dog to a different address, the
owner of the dangerous dog shall notify the City Clerk of such fact and the new address within
twenty-four (24) hours, whether or not the address is within the City.
Disposition or death of dangerous dog. The owner of a dangerous dog shall notify the City Clerk
within twenty-four (24) hours if a dangerous dog has died or has been sold, given away or
custody/possession transferred to another person. If the dog has been sold, given away or
custody/possession transferred, the dangerous dog owner further shall provide the City Clerk with
the name, address and telephone number of the new owner or custodian, who shall then be
required to comply with this Article if the dog remains within the City. The owner of a dangerous
dog further shall provide written notification of the dog's classification as a dangerous dog by the
City to the person receiving the dog. The dangerous dog owner shall furnish a copy of such
notification to the City Clerk along with written acknowledgement by the new owner or custodian of
the receipt of such notification, within twenty-four (24) hours of the transfer.
Photographing dangerous dogs. The dangerous dog owner shall allow the Police Department to
take photographs of the dangerous dog, for the City to have a photographic record of the color,
size and kind of dog.
Microchip implantation and scanning. The dangerous dog owner shall cause an operable 125kHz
frequency microchip to be implanted by a licensed veterinarian in the owner's dangerous dog for
identification purposes. The dangerous dog owner shall pay for the cost of the microchip and the
cost of the implantation. After the implantation, the dangerous dog owner shall bring the
dangerous dog to the Centralia Police Department for the implanted microchip to be scanned by
the Code Enforcement Officer or a Police Officer to determine that the microchip has been
implanted and that it is in good working order. The dangerous dog owner shall at the same time
also bring any microchip purchase records and any veterinarian implantation records for the
owner's dangerous dog to the Centralia Police Department to be photocopied. At any time in the
future upon request of the Code Enforcement Officer, the City Administrator or a Police Officer, the
then current dangerous dog owner shall bring the dangerous dog to the Centralia Police
Department and permit the dangerous dog's microchip to be scanned.

attacks any person or domestic animal.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4-29 concerning the procedure when a dog or cat bites,
injures or attacks any person or any domestic animal, the following procedure shall be followed
immediately after the dog bite or dog attack incident if the incident is being considered by a Police
Officer, the Code Enforcement Officer or the City Administrator as one where the dog could be
designated as a dangerous dog: The dog shall be taken up and impounded at the City Pound by
the Code Enforcement Officer or any Police Officer of the City until ten (10) days have elapsed or
the dog has been designated as a "dangerous dog," whichever first occurs. If the dog has not
been designated a dangerous dog within that time period and the dog has not developed or
manifested rabies, then the dog may be redeemed by the dog owner (the person possessing,
owning or otherwise having the dog under such person's control) upon payment of the
impoundment fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) and a boarding fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) per day
or part thereof that the dog is confined in the City Pound for the cost of care and feeding of such
dog. If such dog is not redeemed within three (3) days after the expiration of the ten (10) days, it
shall be disposed of as provided in Article II of Chapter 4. If the dog has not been designated a

dog shall be immediately and humanely put to death by the Code Enforcement Officer, any Police
Officer of the City or a licensed veterinarian. If the dog has been designated a dangerous dog
within the ten-day time period but the dog has not developed rabies within ten (10) days, then the
dangerous dog shall continue to be held in the City Pound until the earlier of the following:
The dog owner requests an informal hearing before the Hearing Board to determine if the dog
should be designated a dangerous dog and the Hearing Board on the hearing date sets aside
the designation;
The dog owner either provides proof to the City that the dog owner has the liability insurance
required by Section 4-34 or deposits with the City the seven-hundred-fifty-dollar escrow
required by Section 4-34; or
Thirty (30) days have elapsed since the dog has been designated a dangerous dog without
the owner providing proof to the City of liability insurance required by Section 4-34 or
providing the seven-hundred-fifty-dollar escrow required by Section 4-34. The dog shall be
released to the dog owner upon payment of the impoundment fee of twenty dollars ($20.00)
and the boarding fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) per day if the Hearing Board sets aside the
dangerous dog designation or upon the owner providing the City proof of the required liability
insurance or providing the seven-hundred-fifty-dollar escrow required by Section 4-34. If the
thirty (30) days elapses since the dog was designated a dangerous dog without the owner
providing proof of the liability insurance required above or depositing with the City the sevenhundred-
fifty-dollar escrow required above, the dog shall be immediately and humanely put to
death by the Code Enforcement Officer, any Police Officer of the City or a licensed
veterinarian. The Code Enforcement Officer, Chief of Police or City Administrator shall have
the authority to have a dog designated as a dangerous dog held at the Central Missouri
Humane Society instead of the City Pound at the City's cost, with the dog owner being
charged the City's impoundment fee and boarding fee for each day the dog is held by the
Central Missouri Humane Society, which is expected to be not more than thirty (30) days.

Whenever the City Administrator or City Engineer or the Inspector designated in Section 5-17 has
determined that any building or structure is a public nuisance under the provisions of this Article,
the City Administrator shall as soon as possible thereafter notify the owner, occupant, lessee,
mortgagee, agent and all other persons having an interest in the building or structure as shown by
the land records of the Recorder of Deeds for the County, that such building or structure has been
found to be a public nuisance under the provisions of this Article. The notice shall set forth a
description of the condition found in the building or structure so as to constitute the building or
structure as a public nuisance under Section 5-15. The notice shall also provide for abatement of
the nuisance by ordering the building or structure to be vacated if such be the case, reconditioned
or removed, giving a reasonable time for commencement of the work, and requiring the work to
proceed continuously without unnecessary delay.
Whenever under this Article a notice is required to be served upon the persons interested in any
building or structure, the notice shall be served upon the owner, occupant, lessee, mortgagee,
agent and all other persons having an interest in the building or structure as shown by the land
records of the Recorder of Deeds for the County, and shall be signed by the City Administrator or
on his behalf by an Inspector of dangerous buildings who shall have made an inspection of the
building or structure about which the notice is to be given. The notice shall be served, if the party
or parties to be served reside in the City or can be found in the City, by handing the notice to the
person to be served by anyone competent to be a witness or by leaving the notice at the dwelling
or usual place of abode of the one to be served with a member of the family over the age of fifteen
(15) years. If the interested party is a corporation or partnership located in the City, then the
service shall be made by delivering a copy of the notice to an officer, partner or managing or
general agent, or by leaving the copy of the notice at any business office of the party with the
person having charge thereof, or by delivering a copy of the notice to its registered agent. If the
person to be served shall not reside or be located in the City or shall have absented himself from
the City or concealed himself so that personal service may not be made as herein provided for

requested; but if his address shall not be known, then service of notice shall be by publication. The
publication shall contain the full text of the notice and shall be published at least once each week
for four (4) consecutive weeks on the same day of the week in some newspaper of general
circulation published in the County, and the time specified in the notice for a hearing to be held, or
for the commencement of work or for any other thing to be done shall be at least forty-five (45)
days from the date of the first publication of notice. Where service of notice is by publication, a
courtesy notice including the text of the published notice may be posted on the dangerous building
by the City Administrator or by the Dangerous Building Inspector, which shall be construed to be
notice in addition to that required by State law.

In all cases where the conditions causing the building or structure to be a public nuisance cannot
be reasonably repaired or maintained so that the building or structure will no longer exist in
violation of the terms of this Article, the building or structure shall be demolished.
In any case where the conditions constituting the public nuisance are such that the costs to repair
or maintain the building or structure so that it will no longer constitute a public nuisance equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the value of the building or structure, it shall be ordered repaired or
demolished, and in the event it is not repaired or demolished by the owner, then the City shall

of land upon which the building or structure stands, and shall be added to the costs of
performance for demolition or repair in the event the City shall be required to do so, and payable
as provided for such costs. In lieu of a written record of the hearing, the Mayor may order that all

Within thirty (30) days from the date of the hearing required by Section 5-20, the Mayor shall upon the
basis of competent and substantial evidence offered at the hearing make a conclusion of law as to
whether or not the building or structure in question is a public nuisance under the terms of this Article

not the procedures required by this Article have been substantially met and complied with, and whether
or not the abatement order of the Inspector of Dangerous Buildings to abate the nuisance was
reasonable in its terms and conditions and within the standards of this Article. In the event it is found
that the abatement order was not reasonable or within the standards of this Article, it shall be the duty
of the Mayor to make his own finding of fact as to what is reasonably required to abate the public

special tax bill or assessment, from the date of its issuance, shall be a lien on the lot, tract or
parcel of land until paid and shall be registered in the office of the Collector of the City in a book
kept by him for such purposes. If an order is issued by the Mayor, as provided for in Section 5-

per annum on the unpaid balance of the special assessment computed from the date of issuance.
If any annual payment of principal or interest shall not be paid within thirty (30) days of its due date
the entire balance of the tax bill shall immediately become due and payable.
If request for ten (10) annual payments is not made prior to the time the Mayor shall certify the
cost of the work to the City Clerk, the tax bill shall be payable in sixty (60) days from its date of
issuance with interest thereon at eight percent (8%) per annum until paid.
Tax bills issued under this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the bill, the doing
of the work and the liability of the property for the charges stated in the bill and shall be collected if
default should occur by suit brought in a court of competent jurisdiction by the City Attorney on
behalf of the City. Judgment in any such suit shall be special and against the property only and
shall be satisfied by sale of the property or so much thereof as is necessary to satisfy the
judgment and the costs of the sale.

dangerous buildings.
[Ord. No. 1409 § 6, 12-21-1987; Ord. No. 1810 § 6, 9-19-1994]
If there are proceeds of any insurance policy based upon a covered claim payment made for damage
or loss to a building or other structure caused by or arising out of any fire, explosion, or other casualty
loss, and if the covered claim payment for such damage or loss is in excess of fifty percent (50%) of
the face value of the policy on such building or other structure, then the following procedure shall
apply:
The insurer for such building or structure shall withhold from the covered claim payment twentyfive
percent (25%) of the covered claim payment, and shall pay that amount to the City to deposit
into an interest-bearing account. Any named mortgagee on the insurance policy shall maintain
priority over any obligation under this Section. If a special tax bill or assessment is issued by the
City for the expenses of demolition, removal, repair or clean-up of such building as a dangerous
building and the property relating thereto pursuant to this Article, the moneys held by the City shall
be applied toward payment of the special tax bill or assessment. If there is any excess, it shall be
paid by the City to the insured or as the terms of the policy, including any endorsements thereto,
provide. Where such tax bill is issued for the cost of demolition or clean-up required by damage or
loss to a building or other structure arising out of any fire, explosion or other casualty loss, the
debt shall be deemed a personal debt against the property owner.
If within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such insurance moneys the City has not instituted legal
proceedings by issuance of the order provided for in Section 5-20.2, then the City shall release
such proceeds and any interest which has accrued on such proceeds to the insured under the
insurance policy or as the terms of the policy including any endorsements thereto provide. If the
City has instituted legal proceedings as specified in this Subsection within thirty (30) days of or
before the receipt of such insurance moneys, all moneys in excess of that necessary to comply
with any order issued under this Article for the removal, repair and clean-up of the building or
structure and the property relating thereto, less salvage value, shall be paid to the insured.
The City may certify that, in lieu of payment of all or part of the covered claim payment under this
Section, it has obtained satisfactory proof that the insured has or will remove debris and repair,
clean-up, rebuild or otherwise make the premises safe and secure. In this event, the City shall
issue a certificate within thirty (30) days after receipt of proof to permit covered claim payment to
the insured without deduction payable to the City as provided in this Section. It shall be the
obligation of the insured or other person making claim to provide the insurance company with the
written certificate provided for in this Subsection.
No provision of this Section shall be construed to make the City a party to any insurance contract.

A person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented or
made available; or
Any person associated with that person.
For purposes of this Section, an unlawful housing practice includes:
A refusal to permit, at the expense of the person with the disability, reasonable modifications
of existing premises occupied or to be occupied by such person if such modifications may be
necessary to afford such person full enjoyment of the premises, except that, in the case of a
rental, the landlord may, where it is reasonable to do so, condition permission for a
modification on the renter's agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition
that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted; or
A refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices or services, when
such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and
enjoy a dwelling; or
In connection with the design and construction of covered multifamily dwellings for first (1st)
occupancy after March 13, 1991 (defined as buildings consisting of four (4) or more units if
such buildings have one (1) or more elevators, and ground floor units in other buildings
consisting of four (4) more units), a failure to design and construct those dwellings in such a
manner that:
The public use and common use portions of such dwellings are readily accessible to and
usable by persons with a disability; and
All the doors designed to allow passage into and within all premises within such dwellings
are sufficiently wide to allow passage by persons with a disability in wheelchairs; and
All premises within such dwellings contain the following features of adaptive design:
An accessible route into and through the dwelling;
Light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other environmental controls in
accessible locations;
Reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars; and
Usable kitchens and bathrooms such that an individual in a wheelchair can
maneuver about the space.
Compliance with the appropriate requirements of the American National Standard for Buildings
and Facilities providing accessibility and usability for people with physical disabilities, commonly
cited as "ANSI A117.1", suffices to satisfy the requirements of Subparagraph (a) of Paragraph (3)
of Subsection (B) of this Section.
Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to invalidate or limit any Missouri law or City ordinance
that requires dwellings to be designed and constructed in a manner that affords persons with
disabilities greater access than is required by this Chapter.
Nothing in this Section requires that a dwelling be made available to an individual whose tenancy
would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would
result in substantial physical damage to the property of others.
Nothing in this Section limits the applicability of any reasonable local or State restriction regarding
the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling, nor does any provision in this
Section and regarding familial status apply with respect to housing for older persons (defined as
housing intended for and solely occupied by persons sixty-two (62) years of age or older).

Chapter 79, RSMo., including Section 79.110, authorizes Fourth Class Cities of the State of
Missouri to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety and
general welfare.
The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of this Chapter uses a standard engineering
method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps.
Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this Chapter is
representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on
the particular streams subject to this Chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could
be expected to have a one-percent chance of occurrence in any one (1) year as delineated on
the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for Boone County,
Missouri, dated April 19, 2017, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
[Ord. No. 2885 § 1, 3-6-2017]
Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis
of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to
minimize flood losses; to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
59.22 (a) (3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3 (c) by applying the provisions of this
Chapter to:
Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flooding or
cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided
with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development
purposes due to the flood hazard.
It is not intended by this Chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easement, covenants
or deed restrictions. However, where this Chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of
this Chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this Chapter are hereby repealed
to the extent of the inconsistency only.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be minimum
requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the City of Centralia, Missouri, and shall not
be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State Statutes.

Floodway. If the City determines there are areas of special flood hazard that may be defined as
floodway, through the use of base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal,
State or other source, including data developed pursuant to paragraph (4)(f)(iv) of Subsection (A)
of Section 12-6 and the City determines this data is suitable as criteria to be used for new
construction, substantial improvements or other development in Zone A, the City then shall meet
the standards below:
Adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory
floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water
surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point; and
Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other
development, within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood
levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within all unnumbered and numbered
A Zones and AE Zones on the community's FIRM are required to either:
Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, or
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
Meet the permitting, elevating and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes of this
Chapter.

The danger to life and property due to flood damage;
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of
such damage on the individual owners;
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use;
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management
program for that area;
The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the
floodwaters, if applicable, expected at the site; and
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems; streets; and bridges.
Conditions For Approving Floodplain Management Variances.
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of one-half (1 1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots
with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (2) through (6)
below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre,
the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places or
local inventory of historic places upon determination provided that the proposed activity will
not preclude the structure's continued historic designation.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
A showing of good and sufficient cause,
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to
the applicant, and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, nor conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of the City Administrator
that:

identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the exterior and interior building
components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes,
flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation must be built with flood-resistant materials in
accordance with paragraph (4)(b) of Subsection (A) of Section 12-6.
The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structures in accordance with paragraph (4)(a) of Subsection (A) of
Section 12-6. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific
flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact
forces.

elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a water-tight, floodproofed
enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with
paragraph (4)(d) of Subsection (A) of Section 12-6.
The agricultural structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening
requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year
flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in
accordance with paragraph (1)(c) of Subsection (B) of Section 12-6.
The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway
encroachment provisions of Subsection (D) of Section 12-6. No variances may be issued for

No owner or agent of an owner of any lot, tract, parcel or other real property within the City shall
permit thereon or upon any abutting sidewalk any weeds, grass, or deleterious, unhealthful
growths or other noxious matter that may be growing or located thereon. All said growth or
vegetation, except ornamental shrubs, bushes, trees and any agricultural crop, which is in excess
of twelve (12) inches in height shall be considered a nuisance and in violation of this Section, for
the purposes of the provisions of Subsection (B) and Subsection (C) of this Section.
When any growth which violates Subsection (A) of this Section exists on any lot, tract, parcel or
other real property or upon any sidewalk abutting thereon within the City, the City Administrator
shall, if he desires to avail the City of the remedies available under Subsection (C) below, give
individual notice of the violation to each owner or agent of an owner of such property, said notice
to contain the following information: the growth which constitutes the violation of Subsection (A),
the street address or legal description of the property involved, the names of all owners of the
property, a demand to the owners for compliance with the provisions of Subsection (A), that a
hearing shall be held by the City Administrator on said violation on a specified date not earlier than
four (4) days after the notice is given to every owner or agent, the time and place of the hearing
and that if the City Administrator at the hearing declares the growth to constitute a nuisance, the
owner or agent has five (5) business days thereafter to cut, destroy or remove the growth and if
not done, the City may do so and issue a special property tax bill for the cost of said work which
shall be a first lien on the real estate until paid, with interest accruing on said bill at eight percent
(8%) per annum. The notice shall be given either by United States mail, mailed to the last known
address of each owner or agent as shown in the City tax records, other City records, or otherwise,
or by causing the notice to be personally delivered to each owner or agent of an owner, or by a
combination of the two (2) methods of notice. The City Administrator may, but is not required to,
additionally publish once, in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, a copy of the notice
delivered or mailed to each owner or agent of an owner. If publication is desired by the City
Administrator, the notice shall be published at least four (4) days before the date of the hearing. If
an owner owns more than one (1) lot, tract or parcel of real property in violation of Subsection (A),
all of said property may be included in the notice to that owner provided for in this Subsection.
Compliance with the procedures set forth in this Subsection and Subsection (C) of this Section
shall in no way be a prerequisite to prosecution for violation of Subsection (D) of this Section.

cut, destroy or otherwise remove the weeds, grass or deleterious unhealthful growths or other
noxious matter growing or located on said property or upon the sidewalk abutting thereon in
violation of Subsection (A) of this Section within four (4) days from the delivery of said notice to the
owners or agents and, if the notice is published, within four (4) days from the date of publication,
the City Administrator shall thereafter, at the date, time and place specified in the notice, hold a
hearing thereon to determine whether said growth constitutes a nuisance, and at said hearing if
the City Administrator does declare that said growth does constitute a nuisance, the City
Administrator shall order the same abated within five (5) business days after the date of the
hearing. If said growth is not cut down, destroyed or otherwise removed within five (5) business
days after the date of the hearing, the City Administrator shall thereafter have said growth cut
down and removed by the City and shall certify costs thereof to the City Clerk. The City Clerk shall
cause a special tax bill therefor against the said property to be prepared and to be collected by the
Collector, with other taxes assessed against the property. The tax bill from the date of its issuance
shall be a first lien on the property until paid and shall be prima facie evidence of the recitals
therein and of its validity, and no mere clerical error or informality in the same or in the
proceedings leading up to the issuance shall be a defense thereto. Each special tax bill shall be
issued by the City Clerk and delivered to the Collector on or before the first (1st) day of June of

The collection service, and the service charges set forth in Subsection (A) herein, shall be
terminated upon presentation of satisfactory proof to the City Administrator that the dwelling unit,
business establishment or other improved real property where service is being provided is

under extraordinary circumstances. If service charges are not paid on or before the fifteenth (15th)
day of the month the service charges are due, a notice regarding the unpaid service charges shall
be delivered to the person responsible for payment in the same manner that the City provides
notice of delinquent water and electricity fees as provided in Section 26-112, and a penalty of five
percent (5%) of the service charges due shall be added to the utility bill. The solid waste collection
and disposal service shall be discontinued for the dwelling unit, business establishment or other

stated in the notice. The service shall not be reinstated until the full amount of the service charges
and penalty have been paid, along with any bad check liabilities as provided in Subsection (E)
herein.
The provisions of Section 26-114 shall be followed concerning insufficient funds checks, drafts or
orders. Further, a check, draft or order not honored as specified in Section 26-114 shall be
considered a failure to pay solid waste service charges by the fifteenth (15th) day of the month
and the provisions of this Section 13-13 on notice, penalties and discontinuance of service shall
be followed if payment in cash is not made within two (2) days after the check, draft or order was
not honored.
The services established by the provisions of this Chapter are designed as an integral part of the
City's program of health and sanitation, to be operated as an adjunct to the City's system for
providing potable water and the City's system for providing sewage disposal. The City may
enforce collection of service charges, penalties and bad check liabilities by bringing proper legal
action against the person responsible for payment of said amounts, to recover any sums due plus
a reasonable attorney's fee to be fixed by the Court.
The service charge for collection and disposal of solid waste from voluntary customers not within
the City shall be twice the charge which would otherwise be applicable for collection and disposal
of solid waste, within the City.

Any person who operates a motor vehicle upon a City street shall be deemed to have given
consent to, subject to the provisions of Chapter 577 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri, a
chemical test or tests of the person's breath, blood, saliva or urine for the purpose of determining
the alcohol or drug content of the person's blood if the person is arrested for any offense arising
out of acts which the arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe were committed while the
person was driving a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated or drugged condition. The test shall be
administered at the direction of the Law Enforcement Officer whenever the person has been
arrested or stopped for any reason.
The test or tests shall be administered and performed in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 577 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri, including the following provisions:
The implied consent to submit to the chemical tests of the person's breath, blood, saliva or
urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol or drug content shall be limited to not more
than two (2) such tests arising from the same arrest, incident or charge.
The person tested may have a physician, or a qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse,
or other qualified person at the choosing and expense of the person to be tested, administer a
test in addition to any administered at the direction of a Law Enforcement Officer. The failure
or inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the test taken at the direction of a Law Enforcement Officer.
Upon the request of the person who is tested, full information concerning the test shall be
made available to such person.
Any person given a chemical test of the person's breath pursuant to this Section or a field
sobriety test may be videotaped during any such test at the direction of the Law Enforcement
Officer. Any such video recording made during the chemical testing pursuant to this Section or
a field sobriety test shall be admissible as evidence at any trial of a municipal prosecution of
such person for driving while intoxicated or driving with excessive blood alcohol content.
Upon the trial of any person for violation of the provisions of Section 18-9.1 or Section 18-9.2
arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while driving a motor vehicle
while in an intoxicated condition, the amount of alcohol in the person's blood at the time of the act
alleged as shown by any chemical analysis of the person's blood, breath, saliva or urine is
admissible in evidence and the provisions of Subdivision (5) of Section 491.060 of the Revised
Statutes of Missouri shall not prevent the admissibility or introduction of such evidence if otherwise
admissible. If there was eight-hundredths of one percent (.08%) or more by weight of alcohol in
the person's blood, this shall be prima facie evidence that the person was intoxicated at the time
the specimen was taken. Percent by weight of alcohol in the blood shall be based upon grams of
alcohol per one hundred (100) milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per two hundred ten (210)
liters of breath.
The foregoing provisions of this Section shall not be construed as limiting the introduction of any
other competent evidence bearing upon the question whether the person was intoxicated.
A chemical analysis of a person's breath, blood, saliva or urine, in order to give rise to the
presumption or to have the effect provided for in Subsection (C) of this Section, shall have been
performed as provided in Sections 577.020 to 577.041 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri and in
accordance with methods and standards approved by the Missouri Department of Health.
Any charge alleging a violation of Section 18-9.1 or Section 18-9.2 shall be dismissed with
prejudice if a chemical analysis of the defendant's breath, blood, saliva or urine performed in
accordance with Sections 577.020 to 577.041 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri and rules
promulgated thereunder by the Missouri Department of Health demonstrate that there was less
than eight-hundredths of one percent (.08%) of alcohol in the defendant's blood unless one (1) or
more of the following considerations cause the court to find a dismissal unwarranted:

There is evidence that the chemical analysis is unreliable as evidence of the defendant's
intoxication at the time of the alleged violation due to the lapse of time between the alleged
violation and the obtaining of the specimen; or
There is evidence that the defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance, or
drug, or a combination of either or both with or without alcohol; or
There is substantial evidence of intoxication from physical observations of witnesses or
admissions of the defendant.

the opportunity to review the case and to consider filing appropriate State charges.
In all other cases the City Prosecuting Attorney shall have the discretion to file the appropriate
charge with the Municipal Court, or he may refer the case to the State Prosecuting Official.
The procedures described herein shall be directory and not mandatory. The failure to follow the
procedures provided for in this Section shall not invalidate any prosecution or be cause to overturn
any conviction for violations of Section 18-9.1 or 18-9.2, but may be reason for discipline of the
City Official(s) violating this Section.

Municipal Court except in accordance with the following procedure:
The defendant must either be represented by an attorney or must voluntarily waive his right to such
representation by execution of a written waiver. If the defendant chooses to do neither (or if, because
he is an indigent, he is unable to employ an attorney), the prosecution of the case shall be suspended

to proceed with a State Criminal Prosecution shall the Municipal Prosecution be resumed.

Section 20-4. Aiding and abetting another in commission of
ordinance violation.
[Ord. No. 1998 § 1, 2-17-1998]
A person commits the ordinance violation of aiding and abetting another in the commission of an
ordinance violation when either before or during the commission of an ordinance violation with the
purpose of promoting the commission of an ordinance violation, that person aids or agrees to aid
or attempts to aid such other person in planning, committing or attempting to commit the
ordinance violation.
However, a person will not be considered to have committed the ordinance violation of aiding and
abetting another in the commission of an ordinance violation if:
Alleged aider and abetter is the victim of the ordinance violation committed or attempted; or
The ordinance violation is so defined that the person's conduct was necessarily incident to the
commission or attempt to commit the ordinance violation. If that person's conduct constitutes
a related but separate ordinance violation, the person is responsible for that ordinance
violation but not for the conduct or ordinance violation committed or attempted by the other
person; or
Before the commission of the ordinance violation, that person abandons the person's purpose
and gives timely warning to law enforcement authorities or otherwise makes proper effort to
prevent the commission of the ordinance violation, which is an affirmative defense.
It is no defense to any prosecution for aiding and abetting another in the commission of an
ordinance violation that such other person has been acquitted or has not been convicted or has
been convicted of some other offense or ordinance violation or degree of offense or lacked
criminal capacity or was unaware of the defendant's criminal purpose or is not amenable to
justice.

IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE
A substance that is not a controlled substance, which by dosage unit appearance (including
color, shape, size and markings), or by representations made, would lead a reasonable
person to believe that the substance is a controlled substance. In determining whether the
substance is an "imitation controlled substance", the court should consider, in addition to all
other logically relevant factors, the following:

Food and Drug Administration approved package, with the Federal Food and Drug
Administration approved labeling information;
Statements made by an owner or by anyone else in control of the substance concerning
the nature of the substance, or its use or effect;
Whether the substance is packaged in a manner normally used for illicit controlled
substances;
Prior convictions, if any, of an owner, or anyone in control of the object, under State or
Federal law related to controlled substances or fraud;
The proximity of the substances to controlled substances; and
Whether the consideration tendered in exchange for the non-controlled substance

COERCION
A threat, however communicated:
To commit any crime; or
To inflict physical injury in the future on the person threatened or another; or
To accuse any person of any crime; or
To expose any person to hatred, contempt or ridicule; or
To harm the credit or business repute of any person; or
To take or withhold action as a public servant, or to cause a public servant to take or
withhold action; or
To inflict any other harm which would not benefit the actor.
A threat of accusation, lawsuit or other invocation of official action is not coercion if
the property sought to be obtained by virtue of such threat was honestly claimed as
restitution or indemnification for harm done in the circumstances to which the
accusation, exposure, lawsuit or other official action relates, or as compensation for
property or lawful service. The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the
issue of justification as to any threat.
DECEIT
Purposely making a representation which is false and which the actor does not believe to be
true and upon which the victim relies, as to a matter of fact, law, value, intention or other state
of mind. The term DECEIT does not, however, include falsity as to matters having no
pecuniary insignificance, or puffing by statements unlikely to deceive ordinary persons in the
group addressed. Deception as to the actor's intention to perform a promise shall not be
inferred from the fact alone that he did not subsequently perform the promise.
DEPRIVE
To withhold property from the owner permanently; or
To restore property only upon payment of reward or other compensation; or
To use or dispose of property in a manner that makes recovery of the property by the
owner unlikely.
PROPERTY OR SERVICES IS THAT OF ANOTHER
Means if any natural person, corporation, partnership, association, governmental subdivision
or instrumentality, other than the actor, has a possessory or proprietary interest therein,
except that property shall not be deemed property of another who has only a security interest
therein, even if legal title is in the creditor pursuant to a conditional sales contract or other
security arrangement.
PROPERTY
Anything of value, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible, in possession or in action,
and shall include but not be limited to the evidence of a debt actually executed but not
delivered or issued as a valid instrument.
SERVICES
Includes transportation, telephone, electricity, gas, water, cable television services, or other
public service, accommodation in hotels, restaurants or elsewhere, admission to exhibitions
and use of vehicles.

the employee in regular status. However, no appointed officer of the Police Department on
probationary status shall be granted regular status except in the same manner as the officer was
originally appointed to probationary status.
An employee who is transferred or promoted before completion of the probationary period shall be
evaluated on the basis of overall job performance in all positions worked during the probationary

performance does not meet the required work standards.
The City Administrator or department heads may establish a qualifying period longer than six (6)
months for positions requiring special skills. The City Administrator may waive in writing a portion
of the probationary period if he has had sufficient time to examine the employee's performance
and deems it is in the City's best interest.
During the qualifying period, the employee's job performance shall be reviewed and evaluated
after four (4) months by the employee's supervisor. The employee shall be informed of any
changes in performance that must be made and instructed on how to make the changes before
his/her six (6) month evaluation. An employee's qualifying period may be extended beyond the
standard six (6) months if the department head feels the employee's work performance has not
been satisfactory. In such cases, the department head shall inform the employee of the action and

If during the qualifying period an employee fails to perform the duties of the position satisfactorily,
the employee may be returned to the former or similar position when one becomes available.
Provided however, in cases where the position was filled by a demotion, the department head may
transfer or recommend dismissal of the employee.
At any time during the qualifying period when an employee is about to be laid off because of a
reduction in force, the department head with the consent of the City Administrator (or the Mayor
for members of the Police Department) and the employee, may demote the employee to a lower
class in lieu of layoff if work is available. The qualifying period for the new position shall start from
the beginning of work in the new position. However, if the demotion brings about a return to a
classification for which the employee has already served a qualifying period, no new qualifying
period shall be necessary.
The employee's performance shall be evaluated by the appropriate supervisor at least ten (10)
workdays prior to the expiration of the employee's qualifying period. After the review, the
supervisor shall then recommend the employee not be retained in the position as set forth in
Subsection (D) or shall provide a written record of the employee's satisfactory completion of the
qualifying period for the employee's permanent personnel records.
Time spent in an "acting" capacity prior to receiving a regular appointment to the same
classification and department shall be considered as time spent as a qualifying employee in the

period. An employee whose position is reclassified prior to completing a qualifying period shall not
complete a new qualifying period but shall be required to successfully complete the original

Administrator, prevent appointment of a regular employee.
Part-time, seasonal, and temporary personnel who return to City employment may have previous

capable of performing, if an opening exists.
Article III. Classification and Pay Plan
Section 22-35. Classification plan.
[Ord. No. 1425 § 1, 3-21-1988]
The City shall prepare a classification plan for all full-time, regular employees. Its purpose shall be to
assemble into classes employees whose duties and responsibilities are sufficiently alike to be grouped
under the same descriptive file, to be accorded the same pay scale, and to require similar
qualifications for employment. The classification plan is to be used:
As a guide in recruiting and examining candidates for employment.
In determining lines of promotion and in developing employee training programs.
In determining salary to be paid for various types of work.
In determining personal service items in departmental budgets, and
In providing uniform job terminology understandable by all City officers and employees and by the
general public.
Section 22-36. Job classifications and descriptions.
[Ord. No. 1425 § 1, 3-21-1988]
Each classified position shall have a written job description which shall include a job title, written
specifications for the position, a non-inclusive illustration of the types of work performed by the
employee in the position, and a statement of minimum qualifications for appointment to the position. A
master file of all job descriptions shall be maintained by the City Administrator or by a person
designated by the City Administrator. Each classified position shall have a corresponding job
description. Job descriptions shall be reviewed and updated periodically. Each department head shall
maintain a file of those job descriptions pertaining to his department.
Supervisory, part-time, and temporary positions involving positions not comparable with another
position may be left as unclassified positions in the salary and wage schedules. Other than this, each
employee shall be assigned to a job classification and shall be paid the rate pertaining thereto from
that point forward. The City Administrator may create or abolish a job classification, but only with the
approval of the Board of Aldermen.
Section 22-37. Reclassification.
[Ord. No. 1425 § 1, 3-21-1988]
Positions may be reclassified as necessary to keep the plan accurate. Reclassification shall be done
when duties, responsibilities and requirements assigned to a position have been increased, reduced or
otherwise modified to the extent that the position no longer is adequately described by the original
class specifications. Department heads shall be responsible for recommending the reclassification of
positions. Employees may request their department head to review the class allocation of their position

Police Department other than the Chief of Police, and shall include a minimum and maximum rate of
pay for each class in the job classification plan. The salary and wage schedules shall not be amended

Cross Reference — As to salaries, generally; see § 2-31.
Section 22-39. Temporary reclassifications.
[Ord. No. 1425 § 1, 3-21-1988]
Any employee may be required to work temporarily at duties in a lower job classification at the
employee's regular rate of pay. Any employee may be required to temporarily work at duties in a higher
classification or to temporarily engage in a part of the duties of a higher classification at the rate of pay
of the higher classification.
Section 22-40. Compensation Plan.

The Compensation Plan is a listing of all classified positions in City service with their corresponding
levels of pay. The Compensation Plan will show the assignment of each position to a pay range and
each pay range will be assigned eight (8) steps. Each step in each range shall show the corresponding
hourly wage associated with the step. Bi-weekly wages will be calculated by multiplying hourly wages
by eighty (80). Annual wages will be calculated by multiplying hourly wages by two thousand eighty
(2,080).
Section 22-41. Administration of plan.
[Ord. No. 1425 § 1, 3-21-1988]

action. The Mayor and Board of Aldermen shall approve or disapprove each request for classification
and reclassification of a position.

Individuals with either probationary or regular status hired for a classified position at the minimum pay
step shall be advanced to the second (2nd) step of the pay range for the employee's position upon
completion of six (6) months of service. Upon completion of two (2) years of service, an employee shall
be advanced to the third (3rd) step of the pay range for the employee's position. Upon completion of

Except as hereinafter provided in Subsections (B), (C), (D), (E), and (K), and (L) the regular work week
for all City employees shall begin at 7:00 A.M. on Monday and shall end at 7:00 A.M. on the next
Monday. Each full-time employee shall be scheduled to work forty (40) hours during a work week and
normally be scheduled at least one (1) full day off during that week. Employees working more than
forty (40) hours during a regular work week shall receive overtime pay at the rate of one and one-half
(1 1/2) times their regular hourly rate for all hours in excess of forty (40) hours worked during that work
week. The regular hours of work shall be consecutive except for interruptions for lunch or other
appropriate meal, which shall consist of one (1) hour of uncompensated time during each work shift.
An employee unable to take the full hour of meal time shall so note on his or her timecard or time sheet
and shall be paid for that time. The department head shall assign to each employee regular work
duties and responsibilities which can normally be accomplished within the established work day and
work week.
When an employee is required to work on a designated holiday, that employee shall receive credit
for twice the hours worked on that holiday up to eight (8) hours; except the additionally credited
hours shall not be used for the calculation of overtime.
No regular work week shall be established for salaried officers or employees, nor shall overtime
be paid to these officers or employees. Salaried officers or employees may be allowed
compensatory time upon the written authorization of the City Administrator (or the Mayor for the
Chief of Police), but shall not accrue compensatory time as a matter of right nor shall
compensatory time be reimbursed upon termination or resignation.

Employees receiving an hourly wage may be granted compensatory time by their department
head, but such compensatory time is allowed only within the same City pay period.
Temporary employees shall be paid for the number of hours actually worked within a pay period
and the pay shall be based on the rate established for the temporary classified positions.
Temporary employees shall be eligible for overtime but not for holiday pay.
The shift for members of the Police Department compensated at an hourly rate shall not include
uncompensated time for meals.
See also Section 22-66 of this Chapter.
Excused sick leave or preapproved vacation leave used during a week shall count as time worked
for the purpose of computing overtime. Stated more fully, an employee who uses one (1)
preapproved vacation leave day or who has one (1) excused sick day during a work week shall be
paid at one and one-half (1 1/2) times the employee's regular rate for hours actually worked in
excess of thirty-two (32) hours during that work week; and an employee who has two (2)
previously approved vacation leave days or who has two (2) excused sick days during a work
week shall be paid at one and one-half (1 1/2) times the employee's regular rate for hours actually
worked in excess of twenty-four (24) hours during that work week, and so forth. However, if an
employee works and uses sick leave hours in the same work day (such as an employee going to a
doctor's appointment and then being called in to work in the evening), then the employee shall be
credited first with the hours actually worked and then with only the number of hours of sick leave
necessary to reach a total of eight (8) hours. Only if the hours actually worked by an employee
exceed eight (8) hours shall the employee be credited with more than eight (8) hours in
determination of overtime eligibility.
Any employee who works more than sixteen (16) consecutive hours without an intervening break
of at least four (4) hours during a time of community emergency shall be paid at one and one-half
(1 1/2) times his or her normal pay rate for all hours so worked, provided that in no instance shall
the pay rate be augmented by regular overtime or other special pay provision so as to raise the
rate of pay to more than one and one-half (1 1/2) times the regular rate of pay.
Except when provisions of an agreement or memorandum of understanding between the City and
an employee group creates an alternative arrangement, special pay provisions shall apply when:
An employee is called in to work on a day that the employee has not been scheduled, or
An employee who has completed his or her work schedule for the day and has left work after
which that employee is called back to work. Such an employee shall be paid for the work
performed at the rate appropriate for the total hours worked in that workweek and subject to
the provisions of Subsection (G) above. However, when the employee who is called in or
called back then works for a period of less than two (2) hours, that employee upon reporting
for such work shall be paid for a minimum of two (2) hours work and that pay shall be at the
employee's overtime rate.
An employee called to work before that employee's scheduled shift and who continues
working into that employee's scheduled shift shall not be considered to be either called in or
called back and shall be paid only for all hours worked. If there is a reasonably brief period,
not to exceed thirty (30) minutes, between the time of completing the work for which the
employee is called in or called back and the employee's normal starting time, this time shall
be considered also as time worked.
The hours credited for work for an employee who is called in or called back shall not include
travel time to or from home; these minimum pay provisions are intended to allow for the
inconvenience and the travel time involved.
Nothing in these provisions shall be taken as allowing for an employee to be paid overtime
or premium pay twice for the same hours worked, nor to allow pyramiding or compounding

of pay to a rate of pay that is greater than the standard overtime rate.
Any employee who is assigned to work away from the City of Centralia to provide mutual-aid
assistance to another entity and who is further required to lodge overnight at the other work
location shall be paid a rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the regular pay rate for those hours
worked, beginning from the time the employee leaves the City for the assignment. During this
assigned time the employee shall be responsible for the employee's own meals, and the
employee shall receive no per diem reimbursements from the City.
An alternate regular work period shall be established for members of the Police Department who
have arrest powers. This regular work period shall begin at 7:00 A.M. on a Monday and shall end
at 7:00 A.M. on the second (2nd) Monday thereafter. The initial regular work period shall
commence at 7:00 A.M. on Monday, September 28, 2009 and shall thereafter be the same as the
regular bi-weekly pay period described in Section 22-47 below. Each such full-time member of the
Police Department who has arrest powers shall be scheduled to work eighty (80) hours during a
regular period. Such employees working more than eighty (80) hours during a regular period shall
receive overtime pay at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times their regular hourly rate for all
hours in excess of eighty (80) hours worked during the work period. The Chief of Police may adopt
a work schedule for such employees which allows for work shifts longer than eight (8) hours.
However, said schedule shall insure that each such employee is scheduled for no less than eighty
(80) hours in the regular work period and that the use of scheduled overtime hours is minimized.
Employees subject to the provisions of this Subsection shall accrue vacation hours and sick leave
hours according to the same schedules used for other employees. They shall use hours of such
vacation and sick leave based on the length of the shifts from which they are absent. The
provisions of Subsection (H) of Section 22-72 shall not apply to such employees.
For employees subject to the alternative work period, the provisions of Subsection (G) above shall
not apply. However, such employees shall be able to count excused sick leave or preapproved
vacation leave used during the regular work period for the purpose of computing overtime. The
method of counting such leave shall be similar to that of Subsection (G), but shall be based upon
the number of hours of the regularly scheduled shift or shifts during which the employee uses such
leave.
An alternate regular schedule may be allowed for members of a Union recognized by the City of
Centralia in a Collective Bargaining Agreement or if allowed by the Board of Aldermen.

require work on Sundays, but because of circumstances may be required for Sunday duty, shall be
paid at one and one-half (1 1/2) times his regular pay rate. If an employee is called back to work after

as those terms are defined in Section 22-56. However, the City shall be the final arbiter with
regard as to the appropriateness of imposing stronger measures in the case of flagrant,
criminal, or gross violations of this Chapter.
Except for appointed officers of the City or except as provided below, the authority to undertake
recognized forms of disciplinary action rests with the department head for employees under that
department head and with the City Administrator (except for the Police Department). A department
head shall not dismiss an employee under the department head until the department head first
has consulted with both the City Administrator and the City Attorney to ensure that the proposed
dismissal will be in accordance with this Personnel Code.
In the case of the Police Department, a Police Sergeant or Lieutenant may give an immediate
suspension to an employee under his or her authority without approval of the Chief of Police when
that employee is jeopardizing the health and safety of that employee or others. The suspension in
this instance is of a temporary nature in order to provide time for the Police Sergeant or Lieutenant
to consult with the Chief of Police regarding further action. A Police Sergeant or Lieutenant also
may give a verbal warning without advance approval from the Chief of Police. Appointed officers
of the City (set forth in Section 2-25) may only be dismissed as provided in Section 2-27 or other
ordinance pertaining to that particular appointive officer.
The disciplinary procedure should be taken as a whole. Nothing in this Chapter shall be taken as
conferring any right of continued employment to an "at will" employee or officer, nor should an
individual Section be taken to confer any specific rights to an employee or officer except those
consistent with the entire procedure. See also Section 22-4.

Section 22-61. Evidence.
[Ord. No. 1425 § 1, 3-21-1988]

effort should be made by the Department Head to reverse this trend as soon as it is apparent. Based
on this philosophy, sufficient evidence should be available in the employee's personnel file to justify the
action taken. This should not, however, be interpreted to limit the stronger disciplinary actions for
instances of willful misconduct.

Service at least seven (7) days prior to the date the employee is required to work. If, within five (5)
days after the Notice of Recall is postmarked, the employee being recalled does not respond to
the person specified by the Notice of Recall, the Department Head or the City Administrator shall

shall be retained on the basis of merit and the recommendation of the department head.
Laid off personnel with acceptable performance records shall have priority for reinstatement when

UNABLE TO PERFORM THE FUNCTIONS OF THE POSITION OF THE EMPLOYEE
When the employee is unable to work at all or is unable to perform any of the essential
functions of the employee's position within the meaning of the Federal Americans with
Disabilities Act and the regulations relating thereto at 29 CFR Part 1630, according to a
finding by a health care provider.
An employee is not entitled to take and use Family/Medical Leave unless the employee has been
employed by the City for at least twelve (12) months (fifty-two (52) weeks), whether or not
consecutive. Employment for any part of a week counts as a week of employment. Further, an
employee is not entitled to take Family/Medical Leave unless the employee also has been
employed by the City for at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hours during the twelve
(12) month period immediately preceding the commencement of taking and using any
Family/Medical Leave.
Each employee (whether male or female and whether or not married to another City employee)
entitled to take Family/Medical Leave shall be granted a total of twelve (12) work-weeks of
Family/Medical Leave during a twelve (12) month period commencing with the employee's
employment anniversary date for any of the following reasons:
For the birth of the employee's child, and to care for the newborn child, including prenatal
care for a female employee, provided that this leave cannot be taken later than one (1) year
after birth of the child.

For placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care, including mattes that
must be taken care of before placement for placement to proceed, provided that this leave
cannot be taken later than one (1) year after placement of the child.
To care for the employee's spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition.
For the employee's own care because of a serious health condition of the employee that
makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of the employee.
For purposes of determining work-weeks for Family/Medical Leave, a work-week shall be
forty (40) hours for all City employees, whether an employee receives an hourly wage or is
salaried. Periods of Family/Medical Leave shall be recorded to the nearest half (1/2) hour.
Generally, Family/Medical Leave is unpaid. However, the City requires that in any situation that
qualifies for Family/Medical Leave, accrued and unused paid vacation leave, accrued and unused
paid sick leave and unused paid leave for an additional holiday chosen by the employee shall be
fully taken and used first by the employee and counted as part of Family/Medical Leave before the
employee may take any remaining portion of Family/Medical Leave that is unpaid. In a situation
that qualifies for paid sick leave but does not qualify for Family/Medical Leave, no part of such sick
leave taken in that situation by an employee shall be counted as part of Family/Medical Leave.
Whenever unused paid leave is taken and used by the employee and counted as part of
Family/Medical Leave, the employee shall not be required to comply with any requirements for
Family/Medical Leave that are more restrictive from the employee's standpoint than are required
for the paid leave being taken and used.
Sick leave and vacation leave shall not accrue to an employee during the time period the
employee is taking Family/Medical Leave that is unpaid. On return from Family/Medical Leave, an
employee shall be returned to the same position the employee held when the leave commenced,
or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of
employment; provided however, that an employee shall have no greater right to reinstatement or
to other conditions of employment than if the employee had been continuously employed during
the Family/Medical Leave period. An employee shall not be required to be returned to the same
position the employee held when the leave commenced or to an equivalent position, if the
employee obtained Family/Medical Leave in a fraudulent manner.
Except as provided in Subsection (E), if the need for leave that qualifies for Family/Medical Leave
is foreseeable to an employee at least thirty (30) days in advance based on an expected birth of a
child, placement for adoption or foster care of a child, or planned medical treatment for a serious
health condition of the employee or the employee's spouse, child or parent, then the employee
shall provide the City Administrator with at least thirty (30) days advance notice of the employee's
intention to take such leave before the Family/Medical Leave commences (unless waived by the
City Administrator). If the need for leave that qualifies for Family/Medical Leave is not foreseeable
to an employee for at least thirty (30) days so that thirty (30) days notice is not practicable, such
as because of lack of knowledge of approximately when leave will be required to begin, a change
in circumstances, or a medical emergency, then the employee shall provide the City Administrator
with notice of the employee's intention to take such leave as soon as practicable, which generally
should be within no more than one (1) or two (2) business days of when the need for the leave
becomes known to the employee, except in extraordinary circumstances. The notice given by the
employee to the City Administrator may be verbal or in writing, but shall be sufficiently specific to
make the City Administrator aware that the employee is requesting leave that qualifies for
Family/Medical Leave. In addition, the notice shall include the anticipated timing and duration of
the leave. It is recommended that notice of the leave request be provided by the employee to the
City Administrator by completion of a written leave request form. If an employee fails to give thirty
(30) days notice for foreseeable Family/Medical Leave with no reasonable excuse for the delay,
the City Administrator may deny the taking of the Family/Medical leave until thirty (30) days after
the date the employee provides notice to the City Administrator of the need for Family/Medical
Leave.

When an employee plans medical treatment that qualifies for Family/Medical Leave, the employee
shall consult with the department head and make a reasonable effort to schedule the leave so as
not to disrupt unduly the City's operations, subject to the approval of the health care provider.
Generally, an employee is expected to consult with the department head prior to the scheduling of
treatment in order to work out a treatment schedule which best suits the needs of both the City
and the employee. In any event, when notice is given by an employee of the need for leave that
qualifies for Family/Medical Leave, the City Administrator may, for justifiable cause, require an
employee to attempt to reschedule treatment, subject to the ability of the health care provider to
reschedule the treatment and the approval of the health care provider as to any modifications of
the treatment schedule.
Leave that qualifies for Family/Medical Leave may be taken by an employee either as intermittent
leave or on a reduced leave schedule under certain circumstances. Where Family/Medical Leave
is taken because of a birth or placement of a child for adoption or foster care, an employee shall
have the right to take intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule in that situation, subject to
the provisions of this Subsection. Where Family/Medical Leave is taken to care for the employee's
spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition or for the employee's own care because of
a serious health condition of the employee that makes the employee unable to perform the
functions of the position of the employee, an employee shall have the right to take intermittent
leave or a reduced leave schedule when a health care provider certifies in writing that either:
There is a medical necessity for such leave that can be best accommodated through
intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule, or
In the case of care for the employee's spouse, child or parent, that the leave is necessary to
care for any such person or will assist in the person's recovery.
The time increments of intermittent leave or a reduced work schedule shall be at least onehalf
(1/2) hour and shall be recorded to the nearest half (1/2) hour. Employees having the
right to take intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule must attempt with the City to
work out a schedule which meets the employee's needs without unduly disrupting the City's
operations, subject to the approval of the health care provider. Further, the City
Administrator may temporarily transfer an employee who is taking intermittent leave or a
reduced leave schedule that is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment to an
available alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits for which the employee is
qualified that better accommodates the leave being taken. Transfer to an alternative position
may include altering an existing job to better accommodate the employee's need for
intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule. The alternative position does not have to
have equivalent duties. The City may increase the pay and benefits of an existing alternative
position, so as to make them equivalent to the employee's regular job. Further, the City may
also transfer the employee to a part-time job with the same hourly rate of pay and benefits,
provided the employee is not required to take more leave than is medically necessary. If the
employee is transferred to a part-time position, the City may not eliminate benefits to the
employee which otherwise would not be provided to a part-time employee.
When an employee requests leave qualifying for Family/Medical Leave to care for the employee's
spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition, or for the employee's own care because of
a serious health condition of the employee that makes the employee unable to perform the
functions of the position of the employee, the City Administrator shall at the time of such request
give written notice to the employee to obtain a written medical certification from a health care
provider regarding the health condition of the employee or the employee's spouse, child or parent.
The employee shall provide the medical certification to the City Administrator no later than fifteen
(15) days after the City Administrator notifies the employee to obtain the medical certification,
unless it is not practicable for the employee under the particular circumstances to do so despite
the employee's diligent, good faith efforts. The medical certification shall be provided on the form
developed by the United States Department of Labor or on a similar form that meets the
requirements of the Federal regulations as to the information and questions that can be included.

If the City Administrator finds a medical certification provided by an employee to be incomplete,
the City Administrator shall allow the employee a reasonable opportunity to cure any such
deficiency. If an employee requests leave qualifying for Family/Medical Leave for the employee's
own care because of a serious health condition of the employee that makes the employee unable
to perform the functions of the position of the employee, the City Administrator shall promptly
provide the employee with a written statement of the essential functions of the employee's job,
which the employee shall then provide to the health care provider in order for the health care
provider to complete the medical certification.
If the City Administrator has reason to doubt the validity of a medical certification, the City
Administrator shall have the right to require the employee to obtain a second opinion from a
different health care provider in the form of a medical certification, at the City's expense. The City
Administrator shall have the right to select and designate the health care provider to furnish the
second opinion in the form of a medical certification, provided the selected health care provider
cannot be employed on a regular basis by the City. The City Administrator shall select and
designate the health care provider to furnish the second opinion in a prompt manner. If the
opinions of the employee's health care provider and the City's designated health care provider
differ, the City Administrator shall have the right to obtain a medical certification from a third health
care provider, at the City's expense. This third opinion shall be final and binding. The third health
care provider must be designated or approved jointly by the City Administrator and the employee.
The City Administrator and the employee must each act promptly and in good faith to attempt to
reach agreement on whom to select as the third opinion provider. If the City Administrator does not
promptly attempt in good faith to attempt to reach agreement, the City will be bound by the first
medical certification. If the employee does not promptly attempt in good faith to reach agreement,
or if the employee refuses to promptly see the health care provider agreed upon, then the
employee will be bound by the second medical certification.
In the case of Family/Medical Leave that is foreseeable to the employee, an employee who fails to
provide to the City Administrator a medical certification from a health care provider in timely
fashion, within fifteen (15) days after the City Administrator notifies the employee to obtain the
medical certification, may be denied the taking of leave by the City Administrator until the required
medical certification is provided to the City Administrator.
The City Administrator shall have the right to request that the employee obtain subsequent
medical certifications from a health care provider regarding the current health condition of the
employee or the employee's spouse, child or parent. The City Administrator shall have the right to
request such subsequent medical certifications at any reasonable interval, but not more often than
every thirty (30) days, except that the City Administrator may request a subsequent medical
certification more frequently than every thirty (30) days when:
The employee requests an extension of leave qualifying for Family/Medical Leave; or
Circumstances described by the original or earlier medical certification have changed
significantly, such as concerning the duration of an illness, the nature of an illness or
complications from an illness or injury; or
The City Administrator receives information that casts doubt upon the continuing validity of
the original medical certification or an earlier medical certification.
At the time an employee requests leave qualifying for Family/Medical Leave, the City
Administrator shall provide a written statement to the employee providing guidance concerning the
employee's rights and obligations regarding Family/Medical Leave, which statement shall be in the
form of a "fact sheet" from the United States Department of Labor. At the same time, the City
Administrator also shall provide the employee requesting leave with a written notice prepared by
the City detailing the specific expectations of the City and obligations of the employee regarding
Family/Medical Leave and explaining any consequences to the employee of a failure to meet the
obligations.

employee's choosing. These holidays shall be taken within each fiscal year and shall be arranged
with at least one (1) week's notice to the employee's supervisor. Employees shall endeavor not to
schedule these holidays during a period when their department is operating short-handed. For any

hours.
If an employee is sick and unable to work, in order to take sick leave, the employee shall notify the

starting time. Because of the necessity to maintain constant staffing twenty-four (24) hours a day,
a member of the Police Department shall notify his supervisor of illness four (4) hours before the
start of the scheduled shift. If the employee fails to so notify, the employee shall be deemed to be
absent without pay, unless the employee has a justifiable reason for failure to so notify. The
employee shall provide the City a doctor's written report of the sickness after three (3) days
sickness, unless excused by the City Administrator.
Absences for a fraction of a day shall be charged according to the number of hours actually used
to the nearest one half (1/2) hour.
An employee who is laid off from a position for reasons that are not discreditable to the employee,

An employee separating or being separated from City employment shall not be allowed the use of
sick leave in the last two (2) calendar weeks of employment, except that the employee shall be
credited for sick leave used before notice of separation is given.
Abuse of the sick leave privilege may result in dismissal.

duties, unless it can be shown that the injury occurred as a result of a willful or negligent act by the
injured employee.
Injury or disability leave shall terminate when one (1) one the following occurs:
When the employee is released by his physician to return to work.
At such time that he is declared capable of performing his normal duties by a physician
appointed by the City Administrator.
On the date a physician declares him totally and permanently disabled.
The injured or disabled employee shall be excused from work without the loss of pay, vacation or
sick leave in order to obtain medical attention on the day the injury or disability occurs and any
subsequent treatment related to the injury during days he is working. All such absences shall be
limited to the time required to obtain the necessary medical attention. An employee is required to
furnish satisfactory proof of such medical attention.
Upon the recommendation of the attending physician, the employee may be excused from work
without the loss of pay, vacation or sick leave for the balance of the day medical attention is first
required.
In the event an injured or disabled employee is unable to return to work the day following the date
on which the injury or disability occurs or on which medical attention is first required, such
employee may be granted leave without pay unless the employee elects to use accumulated sick
leave. Such a leave may be extended until such time as he is able to return to work or for a
maximum of one (1) year.
An injured or disabled employee who is unable to return to work and who has been granted a
leave of absence shall continue to accumulate seniority and retirement credit and shall be
permitted to accumulate vacation and sick leave allowances for a period not to exceed one (1)
year. Such vacation and sick leave allowances shall be credited to the account of the employee
only upon return to an employment status.
An employee injured on the job who draws pay in accordance with the Worker's Compensation
Act shall have the injury or disability leave charged against sick leave, vacation leave, or holiday
leave on a prorated basis to offset the difference in pay between the Worker's Compensation
payment and regular pay. No employee on injury or disability leave shall receive a combination of
Worker's Compensation payment and leave pay in excess of regular full pay. Payment of the
difference between regular wages or salary and the payment from the State Worker's
Compensation Commission shall be subject to the following conditions:
The disability or injury was sustained directly in the performance of the employee's work, as
provided by the State Worker's Compensation Act.
If incapacitated for regular assignments, the employee may be given other duties with the City
for a period of recuperation. Unwillingness to accept such an assignment as directed by the
department head or City Administrator shall make the employee ineligible for disability leave
during the time involved.
A physician selected or approved by the City Administrator shall determine the physical ability
of the employee to continue working or return to work.
Disability leave shall not exceed sixty (60) working days for any one (1) injury.

This procedure is intended to facilitate employees discussing employment problems with their
supervisors, thereby providing a basis to talk over matters of mutual interest, to explain, to reach
agreement, and to make adjustment if necessary.
Section 22-95. Grievance policy.
[Ord. No. 1425 § 1, 3-21-1988]
Employees have the right to present a grievance concerning: the interpretation or application of
the provisions of this Chapter or of department rules; working conditions; the relationship between
the employee and his/her co-worker(s) or supervisor; or application of equal opportunity laws and
ordinances.
Termination of an at will employee or officer is not subject to the grievance procedure.
When a question exists as to whether a particular matter is covered by the grievance procedure,
final judgement shall rest with the City Administrator. A grievance claim shall be denied when the
grievance concerns: City Board of Aldermen policies and ordinances; State Statutes; pertains to
matters in which the employee has no direct interest; or when the City Administrator has good
reason to believe that a grievance has been brought in bad faith or for inappropriate reasons, such
as harassment.
The presentation of a grievance shall never subject the employee to restraint interference,
discrimination or reprisal.
At no time shall an employee take a grievance directly to a member of the Board of Aldermen.
Section 22-96. Grievance procedure.
[Ord. No. 1425 § 1, 3-21-1988]
An employee shall file a grievance no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after the occurrence of the

who has the authority to alter the action or change the conditions which caused the grievance. The
supervisor shall answer the complaint within ten (10) working days. EXCEPTION: If the immediate
supervisor is the department head, go to Step Three.
Step Two. If, after conferring with the employee's immediate supervisor, the aggrieved employee
believes that the oral presentation failed to settle the grievance, the employee may present a
written complaint to the department head within five (5) working days after receiving an answer
from the subordinate supervisor. The employee shall receive a written reply to the complaint within
five (5) working days from the date the grievance was personally received by the department
head. A copy shall be given to the employee's supervisor.
Step Three. If, after reviewing the Department Head's reply to the grievance, the employee is not
satisfied with the decision, the employee may appeal the decision within five (5) working days to

committed by a private citizen it would have resulted in an arrest, a City Police Officer observing or
having knowledge of the incident shall explain the circumstance to his/her immediate supervisor
and request a decision as to whether the accused employee should be arrested forthwith, or a
warrant for arrest be obtained, or whether criminal action should be delayed pending further

is within the scope of their authority. They shall not look to higher authority for the initiation of this
action, but shall report the findings of their preliminary investigation by the proper Investigating

effected as to a location where the accused employee can meet with the Investigating Authority
and personally receive a copy of the complaint. If the complaint is of criminal conduct, the
employee shall be informed of that fact and advised of his constitutional rights. All subsequent
investigation shall be as if the allegation were made against a private citizen.
Except in the case of criminal investigations, the accused employee shall be kept informed of the
status of the investigation.

the appropriate action is taken regarding the administration of the disciplinary action determined
in the particular case.
The appropriate City officer shall notify the complainant, if known, of the category of the
conclusion reached through investigation, and may report that "the appropriate disciplinary action

Article X. Policy Regarding Prohibited Drug and Alcohol
Use
Section 22-134. Intent of Article X.
[Ord. No. 1425, § 1, 3-21-1988]
The City recognizes that the state of an employee's health affects the employee's job performance, the
kind of work the employee can perform, and may affect the employee's opportunities for continued
employment. The City also recognizes that alcohol and drug abuse ranks as one of the major health
problems in the world. It is the intent of this policy to provide employees with the City's viewpoint on
behavioral medical disorders, to encourage an enlightened viewpoint toward these disorders, and to
provide guidelines for consistent handling throughout the City regarding alcohol and drug usage
situations. The term "alcohol" in this policy means intoxicating liquor.
Section 22-135. General policy of Article X.
[Ord. No. 1425, § 1, 3-21-1988]
The City intends to give the same consideration to persons with chemical (alcohol or other drugs)
misuse patterns or dependencies as it does to employees having other diseases. The City is
concerned with only those situations where the use of alcohol and other drugs seriously interferes with
any employee's health and job performance, adversely affects the job performance of other
employees, or is considered serious enough as to be detrimental to the City's business.
Early recognition and treatment of chemical dependency problems is important for successful
rehabilitation; services to the public; and reduced personal, family, and social disruption. The City
supports sound treatment efforts. An employee's job will not be jeopardized for conscientiously seeking
assistance. Constructive disciplinary measures may be used to provide motivation to seek assistance.
Normal City benefits, such as sick leave and the group medical plan, are available to give help in the
rehabilitation process.
Section 22-136. Legal drugs and alcohol.
[Ord. No. 1425, § 1, 3-21-1988]
The use of any legally obtained drug, including alcohol, to the point where such use adversely affects
the employee's job performance, is prohibited. This prohibition covers arriving on City premises under
the effects of any drug or that adversely affects the employee's job performance, including the use of
prescribed drugs under medical direction. Where physician-directed use of drugs adversely affects job
performance, it is in the best interest of the employee, coworkers, and the City that sick leave be used.
Any employee engaging in the misuse of alcoholic beverages on City premises is subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination. See also Section 22-57.
Section 22-137. Illegal drugs.
[Ord. No. 1425, § 1, 3-21-1988]
Illegal drugs, for the purpose of this policy, include (a) drugs that are not legally obtainable, and (b)
drugs that are legally obtainable but have been obtained illegally.
The sale, possession, purchase, transfer, or use of illegal drugs by employees on City premises or
while on City business is prohibited. Arriving on City premises under the influence of any drug to
the extent that job performance is adversely affected is prohibited. This prohibition applies to any

City premises or while on City business is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination. See also Section 22-57.

subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
Any employee arrested for the sale, purchase, transfer, possession, or use of illegal drugs offthe-
job, may be considered in violation of this policy. In deciding what action to take, the City
shall consider the nature of the charges, the employee's present job assignment, the
employee's record with the City, and other factors relative to the impact of the employee's
arrest upon the ability of the City to continue to conduct business.
Section 22-138. Testing for drugs or alcohol.
[Ord. No. 1425, § 1, 3-21-1988]
The City Administrator may request an employee to submit to testing for the presence of drugs,
including alcohol, in the following circumstances:
As a part of the physical examination following appointment to a position, or of any annual or
otherwise regularly-scheduled physical examination which is a requirement of specific job
categories.
When the City Administrator or the employee's Department Head has a reasonable suspicion that
the employee has used drugs or alcohol in a prohibited manner. Conditions and circumstances
which constitute a basis for determining reasonable suspicion may include but are not limited to
the following:
Observation of changed, erratic or abnormal behavior (such as slurred speech, glassy or
bloodshot eyes, poor coordination, and alcohol odor on the breath) or of impaired work
efficiency which would lead a reasonable person to believe the employee is under the
influence of drugs or alcohol.
The employee is found in possession of an illegal drug or of alcohol, or is arrested for the
same outside of work.
The employee is involved in an accident or incident in which safety precautions were violated
by the employee, or carelessness by the employee contributed to the accident or incident.
Information provided by a reliable and credible source.
When the City Administrator determines that an employee shall be monitored during treatment or
following rehabilitation for prohibited drug or alcohol use. Such monitoring shall be for a period not
to exceed two (2) years, unless tests show renewed, prohibited drug or alcohol use.
The City Administrator or Department Head shall detail in writing the specific facts, symptoms or
observations which formed the basis for a determination that reasonable suspicion existed to
warrant the testing of an employee for drugs or alcohol.
Refusal to submit to a required test may be taken into account as a part of the City
Administrator's assessment of the employee's job performance and may also be a direct cause
for discipline up to and including termination. Employees with a positive test result should be
given the opportunity to explain any situation that might account for the positive test result before
any disciplinary action is taken.

Attorney, and the employee's Department Head. Records of test results shall be kept separate from an
employee's personnel records, in a special medical file.

same test sample using an alternative scientific testing method, or by the testing of a second sample,
obtained on a separate occasion from the first.
Section 22-142. Voluntary treatment.
[Ord. No. 1425, § 1, 3-21-1988]
An employee who, prior to notification that he or she is suspected of prohibited acts or drug or alcohol
use, voluntarily submits to treatment for drug abuse or alcohol abuse under a City-provided or
acceptable, private treatment and rehabilitation program shall not be subject to disciplinary action,

Section 22-149. Controlled substance and alcohol testing
provisions.
[Ord. No. 1884 § 1(22-149), 1-15-1996]
Employees subject to this policy shall be subject to controlled substance and breath alcohol testing
including the following types of tests: pre-employment testing, random testing (except as provided
herein), reasonable suspicion testing; post-accident testing; return to work testing; and follow-up
testing to rehabilitation programs.
Pre-employment Testing. Pre-employment urine drug testing shall be required of all applicants for
positions covered by this policy as a condition of the application procedure. Future employment as
defined shall be considered as if the application was for original entry into service for purposes of
this policy. Receipt of satisfactory test results is required prior to commencement of employment
and/or engaging in safety-sensitive functions, and the failure of a controlled substance or breath
alcohol test disqualifies an applicant from appointment to employment for a period of at least one
hundred twenty (120) days. Evidence of the absence of controlled substances or alcohol
dependency from a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) and negative controlled substance and
breath alcohol tests shall be required prior to further consideration for any employment, including
reports from prior employees by an employee's written authorization.
Reasonable Suspicion Testing. Reasonable suspicion testing shall be used to determine fitness
for duty evaluation, including appropriate urine and/or breath alcohol testing when there are
objective, observable reasons to believe that a controlled substance or alcohol use is adversely
affecting an employee's job performance or that the employee has violated this policy. Reasonable
suspicion referral from testing shall be made on the basis of documented, objective facts and
circumstances which are consistent with the effects of substance use. Reasonable suspicion
observations and reports can only be made by supervisory or management personnel who are
trained to detect the signs and symptoms of controlled substance and alcohol use and who may
reasonably conclude that an employee may be adversely affected or impaired in the employee's
work performance due to the use of the controlled substance or alcohol. The observing supervisor
or manager, whether or not the person is the employee's immediate supervisor, is required to
complete the appropriate required documentation concurrently with the observation and
consideration to impose reasonable suspicion testing.
Reasonable suspicion testing shall be required and completed whenever possible within two (2)
hours of the observation, but in any case no later than eight (8) hours after the observation for
breath alcohol testing and thirty-two (32) hours for controlled substance testing.
Post-accident Testing. Post-accident testing shall be required to test employees after a vehicular
accident has occurred in which a fatality has occurred, or when a traffic citation is issued after an
accident. Post-accident testing may be required where injury to a person requires transport to a
medical treatment facility, or disabling damage to one (1) or more vehicles requires towing from
the accident site to occur. Testing shall include both breath alcohol and urine drug testing of each
employee involved.
Post accident testing shall be required and completed whenever possible within two (2) hours of

Random Testing. Random testing shall be conducted on all persons covered by this policy.
Random testing shall be unannounced and conducted with unpredictable frequency throughout
the year using an established scientifically-based selection method. Testing shall be conducted
whenever and as ordered by appropriate supervisory personnel, but no less frequently than
required by Federal law and regulations, and in such numbers as is minimally determined under
the regulations.
Return To Work Testing. Return to work urine drug and alcohol testing for all employees covered
by this policy shall be required for all employees who previously tested positive on a controlled
substance or alcohol test. The employee must test negative and be evaluated and released to
return to work by a Substance Abuse Professional before being permitted to return to work.
Follow-up Testing. Follow-up testing of employees returning to work after previously testing
positive on a controlled substance or alcohol test shall be required. Such employees must submit
to frequent unannounced random urine drug and breath alcohol testing at least six (6) times in the
following twelve (12) months after return to work, which random testing may be continued for a
period of up to sixty (60) months from the employee's return to work date.
Additional Drug Tests. Any employee who questions the results of a required urine drug test under
this policy may request that any additional test be conducted. The test must be conducted on a
split sample that was provided at the same time as the original sample and the test analysis shall
be conducted at a different qualified laboratory than where the original test was conducted. All
costs for employee-requested testing shall be paid by the employee unless the second test
invalidates the original test. An employee's request for a re-test must be made to the City's
Medical Review Officer (MRO) within seventy-two (72) hours of the notice to the employee of the
initial test result. Requests made after the seventy-two (72) hour limit will only be accepted if the
delay was due to documentable facts that were beyond the control of the employee. The method
of collecting, storing, and testing the split sample required under this policy shall be consistent with
the procedures established in 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 40.
Failure To Test. Any employee who fails to submit to the required testing under this policy is
considered to have tested positive and shall be subject to all of the consequences that flow related
to positive testing.
Delay In Testing. Any employee ordered to test shall report immediately to the test site upon being
ordered to submit to testing. No delay of any type may be granted or taken. Delay in reporting by
the employee shall be treated as a refusal to test and shall subject the employee to all of the
consequences that flow related to positive testing. Failure to provide a sufficient sample or
providing an adulterated sample shall be considered as a refusal to test and shall subject the
employee to all of the consequences that flow related to positive testing.
Section 22-150. Testing controls.
[Ord. No. 1884 § 1(22-150), 1-15-1996]
Alcohol. Federal regulations require breath alcohol testing to be done on an Evidential Breath
Testing device approved by the National Highway Safety Administration. An initial screening test is
conducted first. Any result that is less than two-hundredths (0.02) blood alcohol concentration is
considered negative. If the blood alcohol concentration is two-hundredths (0.02) or greater, a
second confirmatory test must be conducted. Any employee who tests with a blood alcohol
concentration of two-hundredths (0.02) or greater shall be removed from service for at least
twenty-four (24) hours.
Any employee who is found to have engaged in prohibited alcohol conduct under this policy shall
be immediately removed from work-related activity; and the employee shall not be permitted to
resume work until the employee

Professional (SAP). The SAP shall evaluate each employee who tests positive to determine what
assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving problems associated with the controlled
substance or alcohol.
Assessment by a SAP does not protect an employee from disciplinary action or guarantee
continued employment or reinstatement by the City. The City disciplinary policy in Article IV of
Chapter 22 of the Centralia City Code provides guidance to the discipline that may be imposed,

Article XII. Harassment and Sexual Harassment Policy
Cross Reference — Also see §§ 22-7, 22-57(V) and 22-98.
Section 22-159. Statement of policy.
[Ord. No. 2027 § 1(22-159), 8-17-1998]
It is the policy of the City of Centralia to maintain a working environment that is free from all forms of
discrimination because of a person's race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, ancestry, or
disability, including harassment and sexual harassment. It is against the policy of the City of Centralia,
and illegal under State and Federal law, for any employee, male or female, to sexually harass another
employee. It is also against the policy of the City of Centralia for there to be harassment or sexual
harassment of its employees or officers by anyone, including elected officials, officers, supervisors and
all other employees including permanent and temporary employees, employees covered or exempted
from other personnel rules or regulations, clients, vendors, or salespersons, and employees or
contractors working under contract for the City.
Section 22-160. Description of harassment and sexual
harassment.
[Ord. No. 2027 § 1 (22-160), 8-17-1998]
Harassment is repeated and unwelcome physical, visual, written or spoken conduct that
substantially interferes with an individual's work performance, or intends or works to demean or
intimidate the person to whom it is directed, or creates what a reasonable person would consider
to be an intimidating, hostile, abusive or offensive working environment.
Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination and means unwelcome sexual advances,
requests for sexual favors, and other verbal statements or physical conduct of a sexual nature
directed to an officer or employee when:

Submission to such statements or conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or
condition of employment, or
Submission to or rejection of such statements or conduct by an individual is used as a
component of the basis for employment decisions affecting that individual, or
The statements or conduct having the purpose or effect of unreasonably or substantially
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
Examples of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to the following, when such
statements, conduct, acts or behavior come within one (1) of the above three (3) definitions
of sexual harassment:
1. Either explicitly or implicitly conditioning any term of employment (for example
continued employment, wages, evaluation, advancement, assigned duties or shifts)
on the provision of sexual favors,
2. Touching or grabbing a sexual part of a person's body,
3. Touching or grabbing any part of a person's body after that person has indicated, or it
is known, that such physical contact is unwelcome,
4. Continuing to ask a person to socialize on-duty or off-duty when that person has
indicated that he or she is not interested,
5. Displaying or transmitting in any manner, including through the Internet or through
computer generation, sexually suggestive photographs, pictures, objects, cartoons, or
posters to a person if it is known or should be known that the behavior is unwelcome.
Such items are not allowed on City premises, including personal lockers,
6. Delivering sexually suggestive notes or letters to a person if it is known or should be
known that the person does not welcome such notes or letters,
7. Referring to or calling a person a sexualized name if it is known or should be known
that the person does not welcome such behavior,
8. Telling sexual jokes or using sexually vulgar or sexually explicit language in the
presence of a person if it is known or should be known that the person does not
welcome such behavior,
9. Retaliation of any kind toward a person for the person having filed or supported a
complaint of sexual harassment, including, but not limited to, ostracizing the person,
pressuring the person to drop or not support the complaint, or adversely altering the
person's duties or work environment,
10. Derogatory or provoking remarks about or relating to a person's sex,
11. Harassing acts or behavior directed against a person on the basis of a person's sex,
or
12. Off-duty conduct that falls within the above definition of sexual harassment and
affects the work environment.
Sexual harassment can also consist of intimidating, abusive or hostile behavior of a nonsexual
nature toward an employee or officer on the basis of gender. Verbal abuse and
hostility that is not sexual in character but is directed solely at females because they are
female, or males because they are male, for example, is likewise a violation of this policy on
the same level as harassment of a sexual nature.
Sexual harassment can also take the form of offensive conduct by non-employees, such as
vendors, outside contractors, and the like, against employees or officers in the workplace.

Any employee or officer who believes that a person or situation the employee or officer is exposed to
constitutes harassment or sexual harassment of himself/herself or another person shall take the
following steps:
The employee or officer shall immediately indicate to the individual(s) involved and the individual's
supervisor, if applicable, that the action, conduct, words, situation, or other circumstance are
unwelcome and the employee or officer wants it to stop. The employee or officer shall advise the
individual(s) involved that the employee or officer is required to document the circumstances and
the conversation. The matter shall be addressed at the onset, rather than waiting until it escalates.
An employee shall advise his/her supervisor about the matter immediately. If the perpetrator is the
supervisor, the employee shall contact the City Administrator directly. An officer shall contact the
City Administrator about the matter immediately. A supervisor who is informed of or knows about
harassment or sexual harassment shall immediately contact the City Administrator about the
matter. If the perpetrator is the City Administrator, the Mayor shall be contacted immediately about
the matter.
An employee or officer who observes prohibited conduct being exhibited toward another employee
or officer shall have the same responsibility to report the matter as the victim does. The victim may
be too frightened to make the complaint himself/herself.
The workplace is often the site of office romances, where both parties willingly participate in
sexual banter and acts. These types of acts are prohibited in the workplace because (a) the
relationship can change and the parties become adversaries, and (b) activities such as these
distract other persons and create an air of unprofessionalism.
Persons are not only encouraged to report instances of harassment and sexual harassment, they
are obligated to report instances of harassment and sexual harassment. Persons are obligated to
cooperate in every investigation of harassment and sexual harassment, including, but not
necessarily limited to, coming forward with evidence, both favorable and unfavorable, concerning
a person accused of harassment or sexual harassment, and fully and truthfully making a written
report or verbally answering questions when required to do so by an investigator during the course
of an investigation of harassment or sexual harassment. Disciplinary action may be taken against
any employee or officer who fails to report instances of harassment or sexual harassment, or who
fails or refuses to cooperate in the investigation of a complaint of harassment or sexual
harassment. No disciplinary action or negative job-related action shall be taken against any
person who in good faith files a complaint of harassment or sexual harassment, or who provides
truthful information in investigation of such matter.

official shall be investigated and disposed of according to the procedure set out in Article IX of this
Chapter.

the City Administrator and in all cases a report of the complaint and findings shall be presented to
the Board of Aldermen in a closed meeting after completion of the investigation. Complaints
against the City Administrator shall be investigated by the Mayor and a report of the complaint and
findings shall be presented to the Board of Aldermen in a closed meeting.

Any new consumer who cannot provide a satisfactory credit history of at least twelve (12)
consecutive months with no more than three (3) delinquent payments of thirty (30) days or
less from the consumer's directly previous utility provider of electricity and/or water and
sewer; and
Any new consumer who has had no previous utility provider of electricity and/or water and

Any new consumer who will be receiving utility services for a recreational vehicle in a location
permitted within the City; and
Any new consumer who at the time the consumer is requesting utility service has an
outstanding balance on a City utility bill from being a previous City consumer of utility service
or services. New consumers with an outstanding balance on a City utility bill at the time new
utility service is requested shall make an electric deposit of two hundred dollars ($200.00) and
a water deposit of one hundred dollars ($100.00) before utility service is provided. Such new

one hundred dollars ($100.00) and a water deposit of fifty dollars ($50.00) before utility
service is provided. All other new consumers of City utility services shall not be required to

For any property with City utility service that City personnel knows is being rented and if utility
service to any such rented property is billed in the landlord's name, then if such utility service to
such property is ever disconnected for non-payment, the City Administrator shall have the
authority to require that the landlord of such property shall then make an electric deposit of one
hundred dollars ($100.00) and a water deposit of fifty dollars ($50.00) on such property before
new utility service is provided to that property, regardless of who is billed for the new utilities.
If any existing consumer of City electricity, water and sewer service, who does not have any City
utility deposit on his or her account, is disconnected for non-payment, then such consumer shall
make an electric deposit of one hundred dollars ($100.00) and a water deposit of fifty dollars
($50.00) before utility service is reconnected after the first such disconnection, or if any existing
consumer of City electricity, water and sewer service is disconnected for non-payment two (2)
times within such twelve-month period, then such consumer shall make an electric deposit
combined with any existing remaining deposit equal to a total amount of two hundred dollars
($200.00) and a water deposit equal to a total amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) before
utility service is reconnected after the second such disconnection.

when one (1) utility service is in the name of a person and the same person has a business utility
service in one (1) or more additional locations as an officer, manager, employee or agent of the

prompt payment to the City of all light, power, water and sewer bills owed to the City, and as a
condition of purchase and use of City electricity, water and sewer services, the customer agrees that
the City may use such deposit to pay first any delinquent accounts owed the City for electricity, water
and sewer services and second then to pay any other debt owed the City for trash pickup service,
other services, taxes or penalties or charges owed the City. If after payment of all delinquent accounts
owed the City, there is money remaining in such deposit fund, the remainder shall be held for five (5)
years after the depositor shall cease to be a customer of the City, and the City shall make a reasonable
effort to refund the deposit balance to the depositor during that period of time. If the deposit balance
has not been claimed by and refunded to the depositor for five (5) years, the deposit balance shall be
deemed abandoned and shall be subject to the provisions of the Missouri Uniform Disposition of

State Treasurer at that time and shall pay the abandoned funds to the Missouri State Treasurer
pursuant to said State law.

income derived by the City from any such investment or reinvestment of such deposits shall be paid
over to the Electric and Water and Sewer Departments, not less often than semi-annually, by the City

In a new subdivision the developer shall be responsible for coordinating the installation of electric
distribution line extensions with the installation of all other utilities and with the construction of
streets and other facilities. The developer shall present to the City and all other utilities involved a
construction schedule for the area so that all underground systems can be installed in an orderly,
logical method. All installations which will be deeper than an underground electric system shall be
installed prior to the electric cables. All easements shall be graded to within six (6) inches of final
grade and shall be cleared of obstructions such as stumps, dirt piles and other materials, and all
lot corners shall be staked and marked for identification purposes prior to the installation of the
electric cables. The City shall perform or cause to be performed the installation of all conduit lines
and ancillary equipment. Conduits should be installed after the surface has been brought to
subgrade elevation and prior to the placing of any base or paving materials. All excavations in
streets shall be backfilled and compacted in accordance with the requirements of the City.
If the City and developer mutually consent, the developer may cause the distribution lines to be
installed to standards set forth by the City. Such installation shall be subject to inspection by the
City Administrator or his designated representative, and the developer shall furnish a set of "asbuilt"
measurements and plans when the installation is complete. Upon approval by the City of

The standard electric service to residential customers is one hundred twenty/two hundred forty
(120/240) volts, single phase three (3) wire, and shall be either one hundred (100), two hundred
(200) or four hundred (400) ampere capacity as required. In areas served by underground
distribution lines, all new electric services will be installed underground. In areas having existing
overhead distribution lines, the service will be installed overhead (except it may be installed
underground at the customer's request).
Three (3) phase electric service shall not be generally available as a residential service. However,
the City may at its sole discretion choose to provide three (3) phase service to a residence if three
(3) phase power is already available on the distribution lines adjacent to the property to be served.
The City also may at its sole discretion choose to provide three (3) phase service to a residence if
the customer requesting such service agrees to pay for all costs of installing such service which
are in excess of a normal single phase residential service, including the three (3) phase
transformer bank.
Section 26-24. Same — point of delivery.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987; Ord. No. 2166 § 4, 9-17-2001]
For a new, standard, residential, underground service with a single selfcontained meter, the point of
delivery is the line terminal of the meter socket. For a standard residential overhead service, the point
of delivery is at the weather head. On multiple-family buildings or special situations, the point of
delivery may be a junction box, current transformer enclosure, pedestal, distribution transformer
compartment, or other suitable point located outside the building and as determined by the City. In no
case will the point of delivery be inside the building or facility to be served. The connection of the point
of delivery shall be made by the City. The customer shall be responsible for the installation, upkeep
and maintenance of all wiring on the load side of the point of delivery. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the point of delivery for underground service to a single-family residence will be a point on the
side of the building which is closest to the electric power source. On duplex or multifamily buildings
designed as rental units, the point of delivery will be near a meter bank centrally located in the rear of
the building or at any other mutually agreeable point. Apartment buildings requiring more than eight (8)
meters may have more than one (1) point of delivery. On condominiums, one (1) service shall normally

serve two (2) units and the point of delivery will be at the rear of the building at the common point
between two (2) units; or in the case of a single unit being served, the point of delivery shall be on the
rear of the building at the point nearest the power source.
Section 26-25. Same — underground services.
[Ord. No. 782 § 1, 4-8-1963; Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987; Ord. No. 1439 § 1, 6-20-1988; Ord. No.
1797 § 1, 6-20-1994; Ord. No. 2166 § 5, 9-17-2001; Ord. No. 2493 § 1, 11-19-2007]
A standard, residential, underground service extends from the City transformer, secondary vault or
power pole located adjacent to the property line to the point of delivery which, except for some
subdivisions platted or first developed after July 1, 1994, shall normally be on the side of the
building which is closest to the source and in as straight a line as is practicable. The customer
shall be required to install conduit for the City's use in installing the service. The standard
minimum depth for underground service is two (2) feet. The installation of the conductor from the
power source to the point of delivery shall be performed by the City as its own expense. When
front lot line construction is utilized and the power source is on the front of the lot, the normal point
of delivery on a single-family residence is on the side of the building at the end closest to the
power source. In this instance, if requested to do so, the City shall extend the service to the
closest satisfactory point on the rear of the building, but no more than fifteen (15) feet from the
rear corner closest to the power source, and shall charge the customer for the added length at a
predetermined rate per foot. Because of this excess length such service shall be considered nonstandard.
Any underground service deviating from standard in any way other than the excess
length described above must be handled on an individual basis by contacting the City
Administrator. All costs in excess of those applicable to a standard underground service shall be
billed to the customer. The City shall reserve the right to refuse the installation of a non-standard
service if, in the sole judgment of the City, the service is impractical or likely to be unfeasible.
When, at the customer's request, an existing, residential, overhead electrical service is to be
replaced by a residential, underground electric service, the customer and City shall install a
standard, underground service as described above, except that the City shall perform the
attachment of conduit to any City utility pole and, further excepted, that there shall not be any
additional charge for extra service length for services running to the rear of a residence from an
existing power supply on a rear lot line.
As an alternative to the standard service described in Subsection (A) above, a standard,
residential, underground service for a building in a subdivision platted or first developed after July
1, 1994, may have as a point of delivery a one-unit, two-unit, three-unit, four-unit, five-unit or sixunit
meter base assembly located in the City's utility easement, street right-of-way or alley right-ofway
at the front, rear or side of the property as determined by the City to best satisfy the needs of
the area to be served. The City shall install at its expense the meter base assembly and the
required service loop from the transformer's secondary lines underground to the supply side of the
meter base assembly. The main loop of the meter base assembly shall become the point of
attachment for the City. Service feeder lines to the building shall be installed underground at the
customer's expense. The City shall be required to supply a properly-sized breaker (one hundred
(100) amp or two hundred (200) amp) for protection of the service feeder lines. All underground
service feeder lines shall be installed according to the latest edition of the National Electric Code
as adopted by the City and shall be inspected by the City or the City representative before the line
is covered and the trench filled.
Section 26-26. Same — overhead services.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
Standard overhead services extend from the City's power pole, located adjacent to the lot line, to a
mutually agreeable point of delivery. Where the power pole is on the rear lot line, the point of delivery
shall be on the rear of the building. Where the pole is on the front or side line of the lot, the point of

delivery shall be on the side of the building at the end closest to the power pole and as close to the
front of the building as is practicable, but no closer than fifteen (15) feet. Standard overhead services
are limited to two hundred (200) amps capacity and consist of a single triplexed cable. It is the
customer's responsibility to provide a suitable point of attachment on the building or structure which
meets the strength and height requirements of the City and all requirements of any Electric Code
adopted by the City. The point of attachment shall be of sufficient height to provide the clearance
necessary for safety as determined by the City. Overhead services larger than two hundred (200)
amps may require multiple conductors, special supports, additional poles, or other special installation
devices and must be handled individually by contacting the City Administrator. Any special requirement
attributable to the point of attachment shall be the customer's responsibility.
Section 26-27. Same — upgrading or changing residential
services.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987; Ord. No. 2166 § 6, 9-17-2001]
When a customer requires additional service capacity and provides for such capacity by installing
larger service entrance facilities, the City shall upgrade the existing service or install a new service
under the same terms and conditions as for a new service. When a customer desires a change in
the location or type of service, such as moving the point of attachment to avoid trees or other
obstacles, changing from overhead service to underground service, or any other change where
there is no additional capacity requirements, the change or adjustment will be made at the
expense of the customer.
When initiated by the City, all costs, including replacement or modification of the masthead and
meter base, shall be made the expense of the City.
Section 26-28. Commercial or industrial electrical services.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987; Ord. No. 1388 § 2, 8-17-1987]
Standard commercial or industrial service voltages shall be single phase three (3) wire, 120/240
volt; three (3) phase, four (4) wire, 208Y/120 volt; and three (3) phase, four (4) wire, 480Y/277
volt, three (3) phase, four (4) wire 240 delta/120 volt, and three (3) phase, three (3) wire 480 delta.
Primary voltages are also available to large customers with primary metering. In some areas,
distribution systems are in place with other than the standard characteristics listed. In the event
that a service is required in a non-standard area, the non-standard voltage may apply. The final
determination of service voltage available will be made by the City. Single phase, three (3) wire,
120/240 volt commercial service of four hundred (400) amp capacity or less will be handled in a
manner similar to residential services. All other services will be handled individually.
The standard commercial or industrial service shall be installed underground and in conduit. Direct
buried commercial or industrial service will not be permitted. The customer shall provide the
trenching and back-filling, and shall install the conduit from the City's source near the property line
including the riser, to the point of delivery on or adjacent to the outside building wall. All conduit
and other material must be Underwriter Laboratory approved for electric service. The City may
require the customer to supply and install a disconnect switch near the City's source. The
customer shall supply conductors from the source to the point of delivery and shall install the
conductors with a City Inspector present. The City will make the service connections at the load
terminals of the transformer and the current transformers or the line terminals of the meter base,
depending upon the application. The customer shall be responsible for all customer installed or
supplied equipment and lines and shall, if directed by the City, immediately correct any condition
which creates a hazard to the City system, City personnel, or the public. The contractor shall make
all connections at the disconnect. Prior to construction, the customer will specify in writing the

secondary terminal of the transformers; and the City shall make the final connections to the
transformer. The point of delivery and complete requirements of the customer or developer for this
type service shall be as specified by the City.
When a pad-mount or pole-mounted transformer serves two (2) or more facilities or customers,
the transformer will be placed in an easement or public right-of-way accessible to all properties
served. Standard services are then placed underground from the transformer to the point of
delivery on the outside of the building. The point of delivery shall be the meter socket, current
transformer cabinet or, in the case of multiple meters, the junction box or wiring through-mounted
in a mutually agreeable location outside the building and not an unreasonable distance from the
transformer. The conduit shall be heavy wall schedule forty (40) PVC placed a minimum of twentyfour
(24) inches below the surface and sized as determined by the City.
Section 26-30. Overhead or non-standard commercial or
industrial services.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
Overhead commercial or industrial services may, in the judgment of the City, be necessary where
transformers and other services in the area are overhead. The clearance and general requirements for
overhead service will be similar to those required for overhead residential service. Such service will be
handled on an individual basis. Application for such service shall be made to the City Administrator.
Section 26-31. Primary services.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
Primary service shall be provided to commercial or industrial customers if feasible. Before approval for
primary service is given, the customer shall be required to demonstrate that he has the resources and
ability to maintain the high voltage facilities and transformers which will be involved. For primary
service, the City shall install the primary metering equipment, either pole mounted, or pad-mounted, in
a surface enclosure. The equipment shall be located adjacent to the property line at a mutually
agreeable location. The point of delivery will be load side terminal of the primary metering equipment.

Section 26-34. Electric metering.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
A separate meter is required for each residential unit and for each business, industry, commercial
activity, school, religious facility, and recreational facility; except that multi-tenant office buildings
may have a single meter on each building, provided that no retail business or manufacturing is
therein conducted.
Any secondary service with a capacity of two hundred (200) amperes or less, will be metered
using a self-contained meter, meaning that all of the current will flow through the meter. Services
with a capacity greater than two hundred (200) amperes may be metered with self-contained
meters if, in the judgment of the City, the actual current flow at any time is less than the maximum
rating of the meter. All other installations shall be metered using current transformers (C.T.'s)
which will permit smaller current flows through the meter, directly proportional to the load current.
This metered current, which is a constant ratio to the load current, is used to determine the
customer's actual usage. All meters shall be installed in a location designated or approved by the
City.
Section 26-35. Self-contained meter installation.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
For installation of self-contained meters, the City will furnish the meter. The customer is required to
install the meter socket in his service entrance at or near the point of delivery on the outside of the

When required, the City shall furnish and install current transformers at the point of delivery. When the
point of delivery is on the customer's building and the service is underground, the customer shall
furnish and install a thirty-six (36) inch by thirty-six (36) inch by ten (10) inch deep galvanized, lockable
steel enclosure on the outside of the building for installation of the C.T.'s. C.T.'s shall not be installed
inside the customer's building except for industrial applications by special arrangement with the
customer and approval by the City Administrator. The City shall furnish the meter. The customer must
furnish the meter socket, necessary conduit, fittings, and conductors and install the meter loop and
socket on an outside wall or other location approved by the City.
Section 26-37. Security lighting.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
The City shall install and maintain security lights, commonly called "dusk to dawn" lights, when
such service is requested. Customers desiring this service should contact the City Administrator.
Security lights consist of luminaries mounted on existing power poles or other suitable supports,
as determined by the City, and connected to existing overhead lines. When no suitable support
exists, the City shall provide a suitable wood pole and one (1) span of overhead wire, if requested
to do so, but may assess an additional charge. If underground wiring or other special devices not
shown in the City's rate schedule are required for security lighting, the customer shall provide
these items. The customer shall pay for the actual costs of labor and material needed for
installation of the light. The expense will be included in the first regular utility bill following the
installation.
A monthly charge is assessed for each security light. The amount of this charge shall be set by the
Board of Aldermen and is designed to cover the cost of maintenance and the operating cost of the
fixture.

Section 26-38. Streetlighting.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
The City shall provide lighting on public streets and alleys as it deems proper. The primary
purpose of this lighting shall be to promote safety and convenience for pedestrians and the
traveling public. In order for the City to light a street, it must first be a dedicated "public way", must
be open to the public, and have a sufficient volume of use by the public to warrant lighting. The
City shall install and maintain streetlighting.
Lighting on residential streets is limited to intersections, potential danger areas such as curves or
crossings, and where blocks are extremely long, at intervals of approximately three hundred (300)
feet. The purpose of residential streetlighting shall be to promote safety and provide guidance to
the drivers and pedestrians using the public way. It shall not be intended solely to provide security
or other benefits to private property adjoining the street.
Any lighting installed on State controlled routes or highways must be approved by, and in
compliance with, regulations of the Missouri State Highway Commission.

Section 26-39.1. Electric service in large mobile home parks.
[Ord. No. 1580 § 1, 11-19-1990; Ord. No. 1644 § 1, 10-21-1991]
In any mobile home park which contains ten (10) or more units, the City may, at its sole discretion,
choose to install new poles and primary and secondary electrical lines to provide safe, uniform and
easily maintained electrical service to its customers in said mobile home park. For the purpose of this
Section, the term "units" shall include mobile homes, recreational vehicles, storage buildings,
workshops, unoccupied mobile home lots, and any structure which has or may have a separate
electrical service. After the new poles and primary and secondary lines are installed and energized, the
following requirements and standards shall apply to any new services, or services which are voluntarily
replaced or improved:
All new or voluntarily replaced or improved electrical services shall be connected to the City
electrical system through the new poles and primary and secondary lines. The City shall provide
only that minimum maintenance and repair of the older poles and primary and secondary electrical
lines necessary to continue use of the existing electrical service attachments. As services are
transferred from the original electrical lines to the newer lines, the City may remove those poles
and sections of wire which become unnecessary.
When said new or voluntarily replaced or improved electrical service is required for any reason,
the owner/operator of the mobile home park shall install a four-gang meter base assembly
including individually properly sized circuit breakers as needed. The City then will install, at its

supply side of the meter base assembly, provided the meter base assembly is securely mounted
by not less than four (4) by four (4) inch nominal size pressure treated CCA timbers. The four (4)
by four (4) inch timbers shall be attached to each side of the assembly along its entire height and
set not less than thirty (30) inches below grade so as to attain sufficient strength to prevent any
degree of sway or movement. All equipment and supports shall be plumb and level.
The main lugs of the four-gang meter base assembly shall then become the point of attachment
for the City. Service feeders to the mobile homes shall be installed underground at the
owner/operator's expense. All future maintenance of the service feeder shall be the responsibility
of the owner/operator.
The four-gang meter base assembly shall be mounted in line with the City poles. The distance
from the poles to each base shall be determined by the City. Installation of each meter base
assembly shall also meet the following requirements:
The four-gang meter base shall be equipped with main lugs not smaller than five hundred
(500) MCM.
The four-gang meter base shall have an equipment ground wire connected to a five-eighths
(5/8) inch by eight (8) foot copper-clad rod installed by the owner/operator. The equipment
ground wire shall be stapled or in conduit and strapped to the meter base support at least
every eight (8) inches or as in accordance with Chapter 250 of the National Electrical Code.
All service feeders, electrical equipment, splice boxes, fittings, hangers, straps, and
workmanship shall conform to the National Electrical Code, as adopted by the City and any
other applicable requirements of the Centralia City Code.
The bottom of the four-gang meter base assembly shall be at least eighteen (18) inches
above grade.
Consideration shall be given to future development, so that no more than two (2) three (3)
inch conduit risers shall be permitted per City pole. Risers shall be mounted directly adjacent
to one another so as to comply with existing spacing agreements between the City, General
Telephone Company, and TCI Cablevision.
If a new meter base is to be installed and there is no possibility that an adjacent unit can be further
added for service from the same base because of permanent obstructions, road access, minimum
space limits, or similar conditions, the City may allow a one-unit, two-unit or three-unit meter base
assembly to be substituted for the four-gang meter base assembly. Any one-unit, two-unit or threeunit
meter base assembly shall be of the pedestal type, shall include the standard trough and
stabilizer foot, and shall conform to all provisions of this Section.
When an existing City utility easement is not accessible for construction and maintenance of City
equipment by City employees because of obstructions within the easement, the City employees
may request that the owner/operator grant the City access to other property owned by the
owner/operator if the owner/operator does not clear the obstructions from the easement. If the
obstructions are not cleared, the City also may enforce its right under the utility easement.
If the original poles or wires are damaged by any means, the City's responsibility shall extend only
to providing primary wiring, single-phase secondary wiring, transformers and connections to
service loops of existing service heads. A City pole shall be set adjacent to a damaged pole. The
spacing between poles shall be determined by the City. The new pole shall be considered
temporary and must be followed by connection of the existing service to the new City electrical
system. The temporary pole shall be provided for not longer than ninety (90) days.
Pole-mounted meters and/or disconnects shall not be permitted on any original, new, or temporary
pole owned by the City. Repair or replacement of an electric service from the point of connection

Section 26-39.2. Net metering.
[Ord. No. 2256 § 1, 8-18-2003]
For the purposes of this Section, the following words and terms are defined to mean the following:
COMMISSION
The Public Service Commission of the State of Missouri.
CUSTOMER-GENERATOR
A consumer of electric energy who purchases electric energy from a retail electric power
supplier and is the owner of a qualified net metering unit.
QUALIFIED NET METERING UNIT
An electric generation unit which:
Is owned by a customer-generator;
Is a hydrogen fuel cell or is powered by sun, wind or biomass;
Has an electrical generating system with a capacity of not more than one hundred
kilowatts (100 kW);
Is located on premises that are owned, operated, leased or otherwise controlled by the
customer-generator;
Is interconnected with and operates in parallel and in synchronization with a retail electric
power supplier; and
Is intended primarily to offset part or all of the customer-generator's own electric power
requirements.
VALUE OF ELECTRIC ENERGY
The total resulting from the application of the appropriate rates, which may be time-of-use
rates at the option of the City, to the quantity of electric energy delivered to the City from a
qualified net metering unit or to the quantity of electric energy sold to a customer-generator.
The rate schedule shown in Section 26-115 of the Centralia City Code shall be available to
qualifying customer-generators upon request and shall be included with any other City electric
tariffs or rates whenever posted on any City website.
The City shall provide net metering service on a first-come, first served basis, until the total rated
generating capacity used by customer-generators is equal to or in excess of the lessor of ten
thousand kilowatts (10,000 kW) or one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) of the capacity necessary to
meet the City's aggregate customer peak demand for the preceding calendar year.
3/4/2020 City of Centralia, MO Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/CE3262?guid=29349956,29361554,29361898,29362235,29362513,29363112,29363205,29363236,29363273,29363… 434/611

The City shall notify the Commission when total generating capacity of customer-generators is
equal to or in excess of the lesser of ten thousand kilowatts (10,000 kW) or one-tenth of one
percent (0.1%) of the capacity necessary to meet the City's aggregate customer peak demand for
the preceding calendar year.
The City shall maintain and make available to the public records of the total generating capacity of
customer-generators, the type of generating systems and the energy sources used.
Any tariff or rate schedule used by the City to provide service to the customer-generator shall be
identical in rate structure, all retail rates components and any monthly charges, to the tariff or rate
schedule provision to which the same customer would be assigned if that customer were not a
customer-generator. Anytime-of-use rate which may be applied at the option of the City shall be
the time-of-use rates applicable to the customer- generator's assigned rate classification, absent
the output of the net metering unit.
No tariff or rate schedule adopted by the City shall require customer-generators perform or pay for
additional tests or analysis beyond those required to determine the effects of the operation of the
net metering system on the City's electric system or to purchase additional liability insurance
beyond that required by Subsection (H) of this Section.
The customer-generator shall carry no less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) of
liability insurance that provides for coverage of all risk of liability for personal injuries (including
death) and damage to property arising out of or caused by the operation of the net metering unit.
Insurance may be in the form of an existing policy or an endorsement on an existing policy.
The City shall calculate the net value of energy for a customer-generator in the following manner:
The City shall individually measure both:
The electric energy delivered by the customer-generator to the City; and
The electric energy provided by the City to the customer-generator during each billing
period by using metering capable of such function — either by a single meter capable of
registering the flow of electricity in two (2) directions or by using two (2) meters. The
customer-generator is responsible for the costs of the metering described in this
Subsection beyond those the City would incur in providing electric service to a customer
in the same rate class as the customer-generator, but who is not a customer-generator.
If the value of the electric energy supplied by the City exceeds the value of the electric energy
delivered by the customer-generator to the City during a billing period, then the customergenerator
shall be billed for the net value of the electric energy supplied by the City in
accordance with the rates, terms and conditions established by the City for customergenerators.
If the value of the electric energy delivered by the customer-generator to the City exceeds the
value of the electric energy supplied by the City, then the customer-generator shall:
Be billed for the appropriate customer charges for that billing period; and
Be credited for the net value of the electric energy delivered to the City during the billing
period, calculated using the City's avoided cost (time-of-use or non-time-of-use), with this
credit appearing on the customer-generator's bill no later than the following billing period.
The City, at its own expense, may install additional special metering (e.g. load research meter) to
monitor the flow of electricity in each direction, not to include meters needed to comply with
Subsection (I)(1) above.
The City and each customer-generator shall enter into an "Interconnection Agreement", which
said agreement shall be in form and content as set forth in the rules of the Commission and shown
3/4/2020 City of Centralia, MO Ecode360

as follows:[2]
Editor's Note — The Interconnection Agreement is included as an attachment to this chapter.
The City shall furnish the Commission with a copy of any standard information regarding net
metering and interconnection requirements provided to customers or posted on any City website.
The City shall also supply the Commission staff with a description of additional requirements, if
these additional requirements are applicable to all net metering customers and not specific in
individual interconnection situations, beyond those needed to meet the specific requirements
outline in Section C of the interconnection agreement described in Subsection (K).
Each customer-generator shall meet the following testing requirements:
Each customer-generator shall, at least once every year, conduct a test to confirm that the net
metering unit automatically ceases to energize the output (interconnection equipment output
voltage goes to zero) within two (2) seconds of being disconnected form the City's system.
Disconnecting the net metering unit from the City's electric system at the visible disconnect
switch and measuring the time required for the unit to cease to energize the output shall
satisfy this test.
The customer-generator shall maintain a record of the results of these tests and, upon
request, shall provide a copy of the test results to the City.
If the customer-generator is unable to provide a copy of the test results upon request, the
City shall notify the customer-generator by mail that the customer-generator has thirty
(30) days from the date the customer-generator receives the request to provide the
results of a test to the City.
If the customer-generator's equipment ever fails this test, the customer-generator shall
immediately disconnect the net metering unit.
If the customer-generator does not provide the results of a test to the City within thirty
(30) days of receiving a request from the City or the results of the test provided to the
City show that the unit is not functioning correctly, the City may immediately disconnect
the net metering unit.
The net metering unit shall not be reconnected to the City's electrical system by the
customer-generator until the net metering unit is repaired and operating in a normal and
safe manner.

When so requested by a developer of a new subdivision to be located outside of the City limits of
the City, the Board of Aldermen may agree to furnish municipal water service to said subdivision
and may, at its discretion, make said service contingent on agreement by the developer of said
subdivision to pay for all or part of the engineering and construction of the water mains to and
within said subdivision. The developer shall submit plans for the construction of said mains and
shall agree to obtain all easements required. The developer shall agree to transfer ownership of
the water main and easements to the City upon completion. The developer shall also assume the
maintenance of the installation for one (1) year after completion. The plans will show the location
of any required fire hydrants.
Unless otherwise determined in writing by the City Administrator, all extensions of water mains
shall continue entirely across the front or other dimension of each lot or tract to be served. The
term "other dimension" applies when the main is installed along the side or rear of a lot, as may be
the case on a corner lot, or where a lot fronts away from the right-of-way being utilized. The
location of the main and the decision as to whether "other dimension" is applicable is determined
by the City.
The completed plans shall be given to the developer who shall arrange for and furnish all
materials and shall perform or contract for the installation of the mains. The City reserves the right
to reject contractors whose past installations of water mains have been unsatisfactory or who
cannot demonstrate an ability to perform the required work in a timely fashion.
Section 26-42. Same — oversized mains.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987; Ord. No. 2177 § 3, 11-19-2001]
The standard water main shall be installed with an inner diameter of eight (8) inches. No water main
shall be installed with an inner diameter of less than six (6) inches. When it is necessary or prudent for
the City to require that a water main larger than the standard size be constructed by a developer
outside the City limits, the City shall reimburse the developer for the difference in cost between the
standard size and the required size. The City shall inform the developer of the amount to be paid by
the City before installation shall occur.
Section 26-43. Meter required.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
Customers desiring water service to new or previously unserved facilities, shall apply for such
service to the City Administrator and pay the appropriate fees. A separate meter is required for
each of the following types of facilities: residential apartment unit, boarding or lodging house,
commercial business, industrial or manufacturing plant, dormitory building, hotel building, motel
complex, mobile home park, single-family dwelling, dwelling unit in multifamily building, farmstead,
or recreational facility. For facilities not mentioned above, the rule for determining metering units is
one (1) meter for each family unit used for residential purposes, except at the owner's option as
outlined below, and one (1) meter for each business, industry, public or religious entity.
Owners of apartment building or other multifamily buildings may elect to install a single water
meter for each building. Owners of a mobile home park may elect to install a single water meter
for each mobile home, provided that the water main system, including all service connections and
appurtenances, meets the standards and requirements of the City and is on an easement
dedicated to the City.
Whenever more than one (1) family residential unit is served through a single meter, the monthly
charge for water used is the same as it would be if individual meters were used.

provided, that where the consumer shall desire a larger volume of water, such water may be supplied
by another three-fourths (3/4) inch connection, which connections shall be in no event be placed
nearer than two (2) feet apart; provided further, that when any consumer shall desire more than one (1)
three-fourths (3/4) inch connection, he shall pay the actual cost of such additional connection; provided
further, that when any consumer shall desire a single water connection larger than three-fourths (3/4)
inches, he shall make application for same to the City Administrator and, if his application is approved,
shall be furnished such larger connection by payment of the actual cost of such installation up to and
including the meter and appurtenances. All connections shall be made by the officers or employees of
the City as hereinabove provided.
Section 26-45. Water service lines.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
A standard service line as provided by the City consists of a water main tap and a service line of the
size requested extended to the customer's property line. Standard services can be installed up to two
(2) inch, only to property adjoining a water main. The standard installation includes the installation of a
meter in a below-grade meter box located on the customer's property adjoining the property line. While
the normal location for the meter is at the property line, it may be located indoors or in another location
as approved by the City. It is the customer's responsibility to extend the service from the discharge side
of the meter to his premises, or from a cut-off valve located near the property line if the meter is
located elsewhere. The customer or his engineer shall determine the required size of the service line.
The City reserves the right to size the meter in order to obtain an accurate registration of the water
consumed.
Section 26-46. Installation of meter and service line.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
The City will install a standard service line and install the meter and meter box at the property line
upon payment of the appropriate connection fees. When it is agreed to locate the meter at a
location other than the property line, the City shall install the service line with cut-off valve and
valve box at the property line upon payment of the required fee. The meter box and fitting must be
furnished and installed by the customer or his plumber, using materials and methods approved by
the City. Meters will be provided and installed by the City. The customer shall provide a finished
grade marker at the property line in the proposed location of the meter or cut-off valve prior to
installation. Water service lines cannot be extended across the property of one (1) party to reach
the property of another party.
The water service line to the customer's property and the meter shall remain the property of the
City and shall be maintained by the City. However, the customer shall be held responsible for
damage to the meter resulting from the negligence of persons using or occupying the premises.
Water service lines cannot be extended.
Any water service deviating from the standard service described above, including services larger
than two (2) inches, must be handled on an individual basis by contacting the City Administrator.
All costs in excess of those applicable to a standard water service will be billed to the customer.
The City reserves the right to refuse installation of any non-standard service if, in the judgment of
the City, the service is impractical or likely to be unfeasible.

[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987; Ord. No. 1465 § 1, 12-19-1988]
To assure that no contamination of the City's water supply shall occur, each customer is required to
maintain his water system in good condition and to see that no cross-connections which might allow
contaminated water to enter the City's system are permitted. A cross-connection is defined as any
physical connection between a potable water supply and any waste pipe, soil pipe, sewer, drain, or any
unapproved water source. Also, any water outlet which is or can be submerged in wastewater or any
device, either temporary or permanent, through which, or because of which, backflow can occur is
considered a cross-connection and is prohibited. If a cross-connection is found to exist, the City will
notify the customer and allow fifteen (15) days for the customer to either remove the cross-connection
or install a City approved backflow prevention device. If corrective action has not been taken in fifteen
(15) days, the City shall discontinue service. If, in the opinion of the City Administrator, a serious threat
to public health is posed by the cross-connection, the City shall discontinue service without the fifteen
(15) day notice. Every attempt shall be made to notify the customer of the problem, so speedy
corrective action can be taken. The City shall specify the types of backflow prevention devices which
may be used by individual customers and shall inspect to see that the devices are properly installed.
The City shall make such subsequent inspections and tests of the devices and the water supply
system as are required by State law and State regulations. Reports shall be prepared and retained in
accordance with said State law and State regulations. The City may require air gaps, reduced pressure
backflow prevention devices and/or double check valve assemblies to be installed. The customer shall
permit access to his premises at reasonable times for the inspection and testing. In addition to any
requirements stated in this Section, the customer and City shall follow all provisions of State law and
State regulations pertaining to backflow prevention.

or similar violation shall occur again, at the same place or location or by the same violator, within a
period of one (1) year from the date of notice of the original violation, the City Administrator shall again
cause such disconnection from the public sewer immediately, without the requirement of additional
notice to the violator, without first having to advise the Board of Aldermen, and without the necessity of

the date of their issue. Tax bills shall bear interest not to exceed the rate on ten (10) year United States
Treasury notes as established at the most recent auction, payable annually, from sixty (60) days after
the date of issue until paid. In addition, there shall be charged a fee on said special tax bill which is
computed as follows: The fee equals that percentage of the special tax bill, which when added to the
rate of interest stated above will result in a figure which would be equal to an annual interest rate at the
"market rate", as that term is defined in Section 408.030, Revised Statutes of Missouri. If any annual
installment, or the interest and fee thereon, is not paid when due, then all remaining installments shall,
at the option of the holder of the special tax bill, become immediately due and payable. The owner of
the property charged with the payment of the special tax bill, or the owner of any interest therein, shall
have the privilege of paying the whole of any special tax bill in full at any time, or on any annual
installment payment date of paying in full one (1) or more of the remaining installments not of maturity
date. Every special tax bill shall be a lien against the lot or tract or parcel of land described in said
special tax bill for a period ending one (1) year after the date of maturity of the last annual installment,
except in case where it becomes necessary to bring a suit to enforce the lien of any special tax bill,
when the lien of which shall continue until the expiration of the litigation.

Engineer or the City Administrator shall report same to the Board of Aldermen by bill or otherwise. The
Board of Aldermen shall therefor levy and assess a special tax by ordinance against each such lot or
piece of ground within the district, whereupon the City Clerk shall make out a certified tax bill under the
Seal of the City for the assessment against each lot or piece of ground within the district in the name of
the owner thereof. Such certified tax bills shall be signed by the Mayor and attested and recorded by
the City Clerk and shall be delivered to the contractor in payment for the work upon completion of the

[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
Any error made in issuing any tax bill may be corrected by the City Clerk, either by interlineations in it
or by issuing a new tax bill in lieu of the erroneous one; but when a tax bill is corrected by
interlineations, the date of making same shall be certified to by the City Clerk on the margin or back of
the bill. In any action brought on any special tax bill, the Court may correct any error in the amount of
the tax bill, and in any case where it is shown that the work done was not as good as required by the
contract, the Court may give judgement for the reasonable value of the work chargeable against the
land described in the tax bill. In all actions to enforce any special tax bill, the Court shall fix and allow a
reasonable attorney fee to the plaintiff's attorney for his services in the prosecution of such action and
tax the same as costs in the proceeding. In all cases where work is done or improvements made and
the cost thereof is assessed as a special tax, any owner of property upon which such tax is levied may
request, and the Board of Aldermen shall grant, a public hearing to determine whether such
assessment is excessive or is levied at a greater sum than was stated in the notices required by
Section 26-95. The Board of Aldermen is hereby empowered to adjust or reduce such assessment
which is determined to be excessive or levied at a greater sum than was stated in the notices. If such
adjustments or reductions result in the collection of special taxes insufficient to pay the costs of work
done or improvements made, the City may pay the difference between costs accrued and special
taxes collected out of General Revenue.

and shall keep an accurate account of the amount expended for labor and materials used. As soon as
the district sewer has been completed, the City Engineer or the City Administrator shall compute the
whole cost thereof and apportion the same against the lots, tracts or parcels of ground in proportion to
the area of the whole district, exclusive of public highways, and the City Engineer or the City
Administrator shall report the same to the Board of Aldermen, by bill or otherwise. The City Clerk shall
issue tax bills, payable to the City, against each lot, tract or parcel of ground for the amount for which it
is liable. When the tax bill made payable to the City is assigned, the City shall not be liable thereon in
any Court action, as provided in Section 88.826 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri.

respects as is provided in this Division in the case of district sewers. Should the Board of Aldermen, by
ordinance, unite two (2) or more sewer districts into a joint sewer district for the purpose of constructing

or the size, character or purpose of such sewer; provided, that no sewer district shall be included in
such joint district which is not contained in the natural drainage are of the valley or watercourse in

[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
Whenever the Board of Aldermen may desire to take and appropriate any such private sewer and
incorporate the same into or make the same a part of a public or district sewer system of the City, the
Board of Aldermen shall pass an ordinance to that effect, and shall therein state the sewer district into
which the same shall be incorporated or made a part of. Thereupon, the City Administrator of this City
shall ascertain and determine the proper amount of compensation to be paid for such private sewer
and report, in writing, to the Board of Aldermen the amount by him so ascertained and determined.
Thereupon the Mayor shall cause to be served by the Chief of Police upon the owner of such private
sewer a certified copy of such ordinance, and also a certified copy of such report of the City
Administrator, and such Chief of Police shall make return of such service to such Board of Aldermen,

Within ten (10) days after notice of such ordinance and report shall have been served as provided
in Section 26-108, either such owner of private property or the City, if dissatisfied with the amount
of compensation so reported by the City Administrator, may apply to the Circuit Court for the
appointment of Commissioners to ascertain the amount of compensation to be paid for such
sewer. When the amount of compensation to be paid shall have been finally determined, the
Board of Aldermen shall appropriate the amount to be paid for such private sewer, if such private
sewer is to be incorporated into or made a part of the public sewer system of the City, and shall
upon demand of the owner, pay the same over to such owner; but if such private sewer is to be
incorporated into or made a part of a district sewer, the City Administrator shall apportion the
amount to be paid therefor among all of the lots or pieces of ground, exclusive of improvements, in
the sewer district to which such private sewer is to be appropriated or made a part of in proportion
to the area of such whole district, exclusive of the public highways, and report such
apportionment, in writing, to the Board of Aldermen. The Board of Aldermen may thereupon levy
and access a special tax by ordinance against each lot or piece of ground within such sewer
district in the name of the owner thereof.
Thereupon special tax bills, payable to such owner of such private sewer, shall be made out,
certified, attested and recorded in the same manner as is provided in Division 3, and their legal
effect and method of enforcement shall in all respects be the same as in such provisions provided
for special tax bills for the construction of district sewers. Such special tax bills shall, on the
demand of such owner of such private sewer, be delivered to such owner, and shall be in full
payment of such private sewer. When and as soon as the City shall have appropriated such
amount so determined to be paid for a private sewer to be appropriated to or made a part of the
public sewer system of the City, or shall have ready for delivery the special tax bills herein

Any City utility customer which meets the requirements in this Section may make application to the
City by written authorization agreement to authorize the City and the utility customer's bank to
automatically withdraw the customer's City utility bill amount from the customer's bank account
monthly on the tenth (10th) day of each month, to be known as the automatic payment withdrawal
program. If the tenth (10th) day of the month is on a weekend or holiday, the automatic payment
withdrawal shall occur on the next bank business day following the tenth (10th) day of the month.
Except as provided below, the utility customer shall have had an active utility account with the City
for at least six (6) consecutive months prior to the date of the application without having utilities
disconnected from service for non-payment or having a check returned for any reason including
insufficient fund. As an alternative to complying with the above requirement for an active utility
account with the City meeting certain conditions, the utility customer may qualify by:
Obtaining a letter of credit-worthiness from the customer's most recent utility provider of
electricity, water and sewer service, and
Obtaining a credit rating for the previous twelve (12) months from the customer's bank that is
satisfactory to the City.
Each individual owner of the bank account from which the automatic payment withdrawals
are to be made shall sign an authorization agreement, whether or not such bank account
owner is a utility customer. After the utility customer and all bank account owners have
signed written authorization agreements and upon approval by the City Administrator after
all requirements have been met, the automatic payment withdrawals may be begun.
Authorization for automatic payment withdrawals of the customer's City utility bill amount
from a bank account may be terminated in writing at any time by the utility customer, the
City, the financial institution where the bank account is located, or any bank account owner.
The City Administrator may set additional procedures where appropriate to implement this
Section.
If an automatic payment withdrawal is returned for any reason including because of insufficient
funds, the utility customer shall be notified and required to pay the monthly bill in cash or by bank
check or money order. In addition, the utility customer shall pay a twenty dollar ($20.00) fee plus
an amount equal to the actual charge by the financial institution to the City for the return of said
unpaid automatic payment withdrawal. Further, an automatic payment withdrawal returned unpaid
for any reason as specified above shall be considered a failure to pay for utility service by the
fifteenth (15th) day of the month and the provisions of Section 26-112 shall be followed if payment
in cash, by bank check or money order is not made by the fifteenth (15th) day of the month,
including the charges provided for in this Subsection. If the utility customer's utility bill is not paid
by the fifteenth (15th) day of the month, then the utility customer also shall be required to pay an
additional sum amounting to five percent (5%) of the original total monthly account or charge as a
penalty. The penalty amount shall be credited to the Water Fund.
A utility customer which twice within a twelve (12) month period has automatic payment
withdrawals returned unpaid for any reason including because of insufficient funds shall be
removed from the automatic payment withdrawal program for one (1) year. A utility customer
which has been removed from the automatic withdrawal program may make a written request to
be reinstated in the program beginning at least one (1) year after removal provided that the City
has received no checks from the utility customer that have been returned for any reason within
one (1) year from the date the utility customer has requested to be reinstated in the program.

Net Metering.
Net metering is available in the City's distribution service territory at any point on the City's
existing facilities that have adequate capacity and suitable voltage for delivery of service.
Net metering service is available to any customer that owns and operates a solar, wind or
biomass generating facility or hydrogen fuel cell with a capacity of not more than one hundred
kilowatts (100 kW) that is located on the customer's premises, is interconnected and operates
in parallel with the City's existing transmission and distribution facilities and is intended
primarily to offset part or all of the customer's own electrical power requirements. This service
is offered in compliance with the Consumer Clean Energy Act (Section 386.887, RSMo.) and
Missouri Public Service Commission Rule 4 CSR 240-20.065.
"Net metering" means measuring the difference between the electricity supplied by the City
and the electricity generated by an eligible customer-generator and fed back to the electric
grid over the applicable billing period.
The electric service charge shall be computed in accordance with the monthly billing
under the customer's effective standard rate schedule. Under this net metering service,
only the kilowatt hour (kWh) units of a customer-generator's bill are affected.
If the electricity supplied by the City exceeds the electricity generated by the customergenerator
during the applicable billing period, the customer-generator shall be billed for
the billable kWhs supplied by the City in accordance with the rates and charges under
the City's standard rate schedule applicable to the customer.
If the electricity generated by the customer-generator exceeds the electricity supplied by
the City, the customer-generator shall be credited for the net value of the electric energy
delivered to the City during the applicable billing period and the City's avoided cost, with
this credit appearing on the customer-generator's bill no later than the following billing
period.
To qualify for the net metering service, the customer-generator shall meet the following
special conditions:

[Ord. No. 1840 § 1, 2-20-1995; Ord. No. 2529 § 1, 5-19-2008]
Any residential customer of the Centralia electric utility may make application to the City to participate
in a level billing payment program (also known as a budget billing program) for that customer's electric
utility bill. Said customer shall have had an active electric utility account with the City in the customer's
current location for a period of at least twelve (12) consecutive months and during that period of time
shall not have been disconnected from electric service for non-payment. Upon approval by the City
Administrator and upon the customer having executed an agreement to participate in the program, the
customer shall then be billed in the following manner:
For a customer whose contract will end in April or October, the customer shall be billed each of the
next eleven (11) months for a fixed charge based on the average usage of electricity during the
preceding twelve (12) month period. The bill for the twelfth (12th) month shall include an
adjustment calculated from the actual usage of electricity for that month and the preceding eleven
(11) months.
For a customer whose initial contract starts in any month except May or November, that initial
contract shall be for a period which is for more than six (6) months and also ends on the following
April or October, the customer shall be billed in equal monthly payments for a fixed charge based
on the average usage of electricity during the preceding twelve (12) month period. The bill for the
final month of the contract (either April or October) shall include an adjustment calculated from the
actual usage of electricity for that month and the preceding months of the contract.
If a customer wishes to continue in the program for an additional year, the City shall calculate a
new fixed bill based on the most recent twelve (12) months of usage and the customer shall
execute a new participation agreement. If a customer discontinues electric service before the
end of a twelve (12) month agreement, then the customer's final bill shall be adjusted to reflect
actual usage since the start of the current agreement. The City Administrator also may set

Division 4. Sewer User Charges
Section 26-120. Charge imposed on users of system.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
All users of the City of Centralia sewerage system, which said system includes all treatment plants,
works, pumps, valves, mains and lateral sewers, lift stations, gravity and pressure sewers, the sewage
disposal plant, instrumentalities, properties, and other incidentals, together with all appurtenances and
extensions thereto used by the City, now or hereafter existing, used or useful in connection with the
collecting, pumping, disposal and treatment of wastewater, as now or hereafter added to, expanded or
improved, shall pay a charge for the use of said system, with the components of that charge being as
set forth in this Division.
Section 26-121. Basis of charge.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
Each user shall pay for the services provided by the City based on said user's use of the treatment
works as determined by water or wastewater meter(s) acceptable to the City.
Section 26-122. Separation of funds.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
That portion of the total user charge collected which is designated for operation and maintenance,
including replacement purposes, shall be deposited in a separate non-lapsing fund known as the
Enterprise Fund and will be kept in two (2) primary accounts as follows:
An account designated for the specific purpose of defraying operation and maintenance costs,
excluding replacement, of the treatment works (Operation and Maintenance Account). Operational
costs shall include the costs of treatment. Costs associated with debt retirement of borrowed
capital for the treatment works may also be included in this account.
The operation and maintenance account shall cover but not be limited to the following items:
Billing and collection,
Administration,
Power,
Labor including fringe benefits,
Equipment,
Materials used for general maintenance,
Cost of treatment,
Debt service.
An account designated for the specific purpose of insuring replacement needs over the useful life

budgeted and made annually from the operation, maintenance, and replacement revenue in an
amount of eleven thousand six hundred two dollars ($11,602.00).
Fiscal year-end balances in the various accounts shall be carried over to the same accounts in the
subsequent fiscal year, and shall be used for no other purposes than those designated for these
accounts. Monies which have been transferred from other sources to meet temporary shortages in
the operation and maintenance account and the replacement account shall be returned to their
respective accounts upon appropriate adjustment of the user charge rates. The user charge
rate(s) shall be adjusted such that the transferred monies will be returned to their respective
accounts within the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the monies were borrowed.
Section 26-123. Same — billing period; non-consumptive uses.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
Except as provided below, and in Section 26-124, the monthly user charge shall be based on water
used during the month billing period. If a user consumes water or in some other manner uses water
that is not returned to the wastewater collection system, the user shall have the option to have the
monthly user charge based on wastewater used instead of water used, as measured by a wastewater
meter(s) or a separate water meter(s). This may be accomplished by either the direct measurement of
actual sewage volume entering the sewerage system or by the use of a secondary water meter or a
grouped set of secondary water meters, where the water passing through said secondary meter(s)
shall be totally segregated from the wastewater system. The wastewater use would then be defined as
the volume of water passing through the primary meter line less that passing through the secondary
meter(s). If all the water passing through a primary meter is consumed, then the user shall not be
considered connected to the water and sewerage system and thus there shall be no monthly user
charge and no monthly charge for each billing account as defined in Section 26-125. Consumption of
water shall be subject to verification by the City at any time. If this alternate form of metering is chosen
by the user, the user shall pay for the entire cost of the alternate meter(s) and for the entire cost of
installing and maintaining said alternate meter(s). Said alternate meter(s) shall be installed and
maintained in a manner acceptable to the City. The alternate meter(s) shall be the property of the user.
The City shall retain the right to check and calibrate the alternate meter(s).
Section 26-124. Same; individual agreements authorized; when.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
If the Board of Aldermen, in its sole discretion, determines that the alternate methods of measurement
of wastewater described in Section 26-123 are for technical or financial reasons, too burdensome on a
user who desires to be charged by the amount of wastewater used, the Board of Aldermen, may, by
written resolution, authorize and direct the Mayor to enter into an individual written agreement with a
user which provides some other accurate method for measuring the amount of the user's wastewater
entering the sewerage system. If such an agreement is made and such other method is used then the
user's bill shall be calculated by use of the method provided for in the agreement to measure
wastewater. If the method agreed to involves use of additional meters or other equipment that must be
installed or maintained to comply with the agreement, then the user shall pay for all costs of purchase,
installation and maintenance of said meters or other equipment. Said equipment shall be installed, and
maintained in a manner acceptable to the City. Such meters or other equipment shall be the property
of the user, but the City shall retain the right to check and calibrate, if applicable, said meters or other
equipment.

Section 26-126. Additional charges for toxic pollutants.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
Any user that discharges any toxic pollutants that cause an increase in the cost of managing the City of
Centralia treatment works, or any user that discharges any substances that singly or by interaction with
other substance cause identifiable increases in the cost of operation, maintenance, or replacement of
the treatment works, shall pay for such increased costs. The charge to each user shall be determined
by the City Administrator, with said determination then to be approved by the Board of Aldermen before
the amount is charged to the user.
Section 26-127. Charges apply to all users.
[Ord. No. 1356 § 1, 3-30-1987]
The charges herein established for the use of the sewerage system shall apply to all users of the

Except as provided below, no person shall make or cause to be made within the City any
excavation in any public street, place, walkway, right-of-way or easement unless and until written

representative in accordance with the provisions of this Article. No exception to the requirements
shall be permitted except:
Public work done by authority of the Missouri State Highways and Transportation

Emergency work done under the provisions of Section 30-13.3(H).
Application for an excavation permit shall be made in writing to the City Administrator. The

monthly basis for such fees and costs.
Every applicant for an excavation permit shall register with the City Clerk proof that the applicant is
maintaining liability insurance in the sum of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00)
covering liability for death, bodily injury and property damage attributable to the excavation or
resurfacing work done under a City permit or in consequence of any neglect in safeguarding such
work. Such liability insurance shall be in such form as to hold harmless and indemnify the City
from all claims and damages arising from any cause of action for such excavation and resurfacing
work and activities incident thereto. The insurance policy shall list the City as an additional named
insured, shall be carried with an insurance company which has been licensed or permitted to carry
on such business in the State of Missouri, and shall be kept and maintained continuously in force
and effect so long as the excavation and resurfacing work shall be in process. Before issuance of
the excavation permit, the applicant shall furnish the City with a certificate of the insurer that the
policy is in full force and effect and that the policy will not be altered, amended, or terminated
without notice having been given to the City prior thereto. The proof of insurance required for
issuance of a plumber's license pursuant to Section 23-65 shall be deemed to satisfy the
requirements of this Subsection.
In lieu of the insurance as provided above, the applicant may deposit a surety bond satisfactory to
the City Administrator in the sum of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00), conditioned
that the applicant will pay any judgment recovered by any person by reason of death, bodily injury
or property damage attributable to the excavation or resurfacing work done under a City permit or
in consequence of any neglect in safeguarding such work. Such bond shall be in such form as to
hold harmless the City from all claims and damage arising from any cause of action for such
excavation and restoration work and activities incident thereto.
If the insurance policy provided for in this Section lapses and is not immediately renewed, or any
bond terminates in any manner whatsoever and a substitute in lieu thereof is not deposited, the
permit for the excavation is hereby revoked.
When the resurfacing work referred to in Section 30-13.2 is done by the person making, or
causing to be made, the excavation, the street surfacing so replaced shall, for a period of one (1)
year following the date of restoration, be the responsibility of the excavator, who shall bear all
costs of maintenance on the repaved portion for such time. Failure to comply with the
requirements of this Section shall constitute a violation thereof, and the City may, in addition to
prosecution for violation, properly maintain or repair any unsatisfactory replacement of street
surface and charge the excavator for the cost and labor of such work, and no further excavation
permits shall be issued by the City to any person who has not corrected any deficiencies or paid
such costs.
In case of an emergency where the public safety is in danger and the office of the City
Administrator is not open, the provisions of this Article relating to the issuance of permits prior to
commencement of work of excavation shall not apply. In such case the person making the
excavation shall notify the Centralia Police Department dispatcher that the emergency work is
being commenced and the location thereof and the work may proceed immediately, following the
provisions set forth in this Article. Final surfacing or temporary patches shall not be applied to the
excavations until such time as the City Administrator or a designated representative has inspected
and approved the backfill and issued a permit therefor. Application for the permit shall be made on
the first day on which the office of the City Administrator is open after the work is commenced.
No application for an excavation permit shall be required for excavations made to install utilities
and other features within any proposed public lands or rights-of-way of any proposed subdivision
until a final plat for said subdivision is approved by the City and recorded with the Boone County
Recorder of Deeds.

have the right to remove the snow from in front of his driveway and to place said snow in the City street
adjacent to the curb or ditch so that his driveway may be opened for use.
Section 30-42. Sidewalk specifications.
[Ord. No. 1366 § 5, 5-18-1987]
All sidewalks hereafter constructed or reconstructed on public property within the City shall meet the
following requirements:
Except as provided below, the sidewalks shall be at least forty-eight (48) inches in width. An
existing sidewalk of thirty-six (36) inches in width or less may be replaced by one that is thirty-six
(36) inches in width. A new sidewalk which would be a continuation of an existing sidewalk may be
of the same width as the existing sidewalk, provided it shall not be less than thirty-six (36) inches
in width. No sidewalk shall be reconstructed at a lesser width than originally constructed except
when necessary because of street widening.
In order to enable persons using wheelchairs to travel freely and without assistance, all curbs
hereafter constructed or reconstructed where the sidewalk meets the street or alley or driveway
shall have a ramp built into it so that the sidewalk and street or alley or driveway blend to a
common level. Such ramp shall be not less than thirty-six (36) inches wide and shall not have a
slope greater than one (1) inch rise per twelve (12) inches length (eight and three-tenths percent
(8.3%)). Where because of surrounding buildings or other restrictions it is impossible to conform
the slope with this requirement, the ramp shall contain a slope with as shallow a rise as possible
under the circumstances, not to exceed ten percent (10%). There shall be a gradual rounding at
the bottom of the slope in all ramps. Provided, however, the Board of Aldermen shall have the
authority to permit deviations from the above specifications in this Subsection where conformance
to such specifications is impractical or physically impossible and where the method, material and
dimension used in lieu thereof does not create a hazard.
Concrete sidewalks shall be constructed according to plans presented to the City Administrator or
provided directly by the City. The plans will show line, grade and dimensions in sufficient detail as
to be verifiable by the City Administrator or the City Administrator's designated representative.
Plans shall not be required for minor repairs or replacement of small sections of existing sidewalk.
Unless otherwise specifically designated, the sidewalks shall have a depth of four (4) inches
except at driveways, where the depth shall be increased to six (6) inches.
Regarding concrete for sidewalks being built or replaced adjacent to property where the owner of
the property resides, the specifications, the composition and the installation of the concrete shall
be as directed by the property owner, provided the owner has earlier received approval of the
sidewalk plans as specified in Subsection (C) above and he complies with depth and width
requirements as specified in Subsection (C) above. The concrete in such cases shall be mixed on
the site by the property owner or by someone under the property owner's personal supervision.
Concrete used in the construction of sidewalks in all other instances shall meet all the following
specifications for composition and installation:
Sidewalks shall be constructed on a prepared smooth subgrade of at least six (6) inches
thickness and of uniform density, thoroughly compacted by rolling or tamping.
Forms shall be straight, free of warp, of sufficient strength to resist springing during
construction, and of a height equal to the full depth of the sidewalk. The forms shall be
thoroughly cleaned, well oiled, securely staked, braced, and held to the required line and
grade before any concrete is deposited.

The concrete shall be deposited between the forms on moistened subgrade and shall be
struck off and compacted to the required thickness. Concrete may be compacted by internal
vibrating equipment, spading, rodding, or tamping, or as directed by the City Administrator or
the City Administrator's representative.
Dummy joints, spaced approximately at five (5) feet intervals, shall be provided the full width
(and length for wider sidewalks). The joints may be made by a suitable tooling device,
removable strips, or sawing after the initial set and before shrink cracks appear.
Premolded expansion joint material, one-half (1/2) inch thick, shall be installed in the sidewalk
for its full depth wherever it meets another sidewalk, driveway, building, curb, lighting
standard, fireplug, or other rigid object, and transversally at a maximum of sixty (60) feet
apart. When the sidewalk fills the space between the curb and a building or wall, an
expansion joint shall be placed between the sidewalk and the curb and between the sidewalk
and the building or wall.
After the concrete has been brought true to line and grade it shall be finished to a medium
rough finish by use of a stiff broom or other approved method to produce an even, gritty
texture. All edges shall be rounded with an edging tool.
After the concrete has been finally finished and the free water has left the surface, the
exposed surface shall be sprayed with a transparent membrane solution (Hunts Process
Curing Compound, Cure Crete, or approved equal). The curing material shall be applied in
strict accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and as directed by the City
Administrator. If rain falls on the newly coated pavement before the film has dried sufficiently
to resist damage, or if the film is damaged in any other way, additional curing materials shall
be required to be applied to the affected portions. If hair checking develops before the
membrane can be applied, the concrete shall be initially cured with wet burlap before the
membrane is applied. After the side forms are removed, the sides shall be sprayed with the
curing compound.
The temperature of the concrete shall be between sixty (60) and ninety (90) degrees
Fahrenheit when placed in the forms. Concrete construction shall be discontinued when the
temperature falls below forty (40) degrees Fahrenheit unless the aggregates or the water are
heated to produce this required temperature. However, the City Administrator may require
that no concrete be poured when, in his opinion, the concrete might become damaged from
freezing due to subsequent falling of the temperature. The use of an accelerator such as
calcium chloride shall be permitted only with the consent of the City Administrator. When the
concrete is placed during cold weather, there must be means to protect the concrete. This will
be done by applying straw in sufficient depth to protect the concrete from freezing, or other
approved methods. Such protection shall be continued for at least seven (7) days unless
directed otherwise by the City Administrator. In no case may the concrete be placed on a
frozen subgrade. Concrete injured by frost action shall be removed and replaced at the
installer's expense.
After the concrete has sufficiently set, the forms shall be removed and the space on each side
of the walk shall be backfilled. The earth shall be compacted and graded in a manner
satisfactory to the City Administrator.
All sidewalks shall be constructed of portland cement concrete, which shall consist of a
mixture of portland cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, and water combined in the
proportion specified below. Admixtures for the purpose of entraining air, retarding or
accelerating the set, tinting and other purposes may be added as specifically required or
permitted by the City Administrator. Concrete prepared off-site shall be handled and
preserved in its batched proportion during transportation. Mixing time shall not exceed fortyfive
(45) minutes and excess water shall not be added.

payment will be made out of the General Revenue Funds of the City. Any tax bills issued in
payment of such repairs shall constitute a lien upon the property liable therefor until paid.[2]
State Law Reference — Similar provisions, see RSMo. §§ 88.703 and 88.710.
The Board of Aldermen, as provided for in Section 88.703 and Section 88.710, RSMo., shall have
the power, by ordinance, to authorize the building and construction of sidewalks and sidewalk
curbing on public property along any streets of the City and to assess the cost thereof, by special
tax assessment, to each lot or piece of ground abutting on such sidewalk in proportion to the front
thereof, for its part of the cost of the work authorized by said State laws. Corner lots shall be liable
for the extension of curbs and sidewalks to the curblines each way. The Board of Aldermen may,
by said same ordinance, include in the special tax assessment for constructing sidewalks on any
street or alley the related cost of bringing to the established grade said street or alley or part
thereof, proposed to be improved.[3]
State Law Reference — For similar provisions, see RSMo. §§ 88.703, 88.710 and 88.828.
Before the Board of Aldermen shall make any contract for repairing, building or constructing
sidewalks, an estimate of the cost thereof and related costs shall be made by the City Engineer of
City Administrator and submitted to the Board of Aldermen, and no contract shall be entered into
for any work or improvement for a price exceeding the estimate. Further, the Board of Aldermen
shall cause plans and specifications for any project to repair, build or construct sidewalks and
sidewalk curbing and related costs, together with an estimate of the total cost for the project,
including construction, construction contingency and fees and other expenses and an estimate of
the portion of the total cost to be assessed against each property to be benefitted by the said
project, to be prepared by the City Engineer or the City Administrator, and filed with the City Clerk,
subject to public inspection. The Board of Aldermen further shall cause notice of said project and
the above described items to be printed in two (2) consecutive issues of some weekly newspaper
printed in Boone County, Missouri. If requested by three (3) or more City residents, a public
hearing shall be held before the Board of Aldermen, at which time the public may express their
assent or objection to said project.[4]
State Law Reference — For similar provisions, see RSMo. §§ 88.812 and 88.824.
The special tax assessments made for constructing and repairing sidewalks and sidewalk curbing
and for the related costs thereof, including the cost of bringing to the established grade the street
or alley running along the sidewalk being repaired or constructed as provided for in Subsection
(B), shall be known as "special assessments for improvements" and shall be levied and collected
as a special tax, and a special tax bill shall be issued therefor. The said special tax bills further
may include a reasonable construction contingency and an amount not to exceed twenty percent
(20%) of the total cost of the project to be used for payment of fees and other expenses. The total
cost of constructing and repairing sidewalks and sidewalk curbing (and related costs), wherein a
special tax bill shall issue thereof, may be paid in ten (10) annual installments. In such case, the
tax bills shall be payable in annual installments as follows: One-tenth (1/10) in one (1) year, onetenth
(1/10) in two (2) years, one-tenth (1/10) in three (3) years, one-tenth (1/10) in four (4) years,
one-tenth (1/10) in five (5) years, one-tenth (1/10) in six (6) years, one-tenth (1/10) in seven (7)
years, one-tenth (1/10) in eight (8) years, one-tenth (1/10) in nine (9) years and one-tenth (1/10) in
ten (10) years after the date of their issue. Tax bills shall bear interest not to exceed the rate on
ten-year United States treasury notes as established at the most recent auction, payable annually,
from sixty (60) days after the date of issue until paid, in addition, there shall be charged a fee on
said special tax bill which is computed as follows:
The fee equals that percentage of the special tax bill, which when added to the rate of interest
stated above will result in a figure which would be equal to an annual interest rate at the "market
rate", as that term is defined in Section 408.030, RSMo. If any annual installment, or the interest
and fee thereon, is not paid when due, then all remaining installments shall, at the option of the
holder of the special tax bill, become immediately due and payable. The owner of the property
charged with the payment of the special tax bill, or the owner of any interest therein, shall have the
privilege of paying the whole of any special tax bill in full at any time, or on any annual installment
payment date of paying in full one (1) or more of the remaining installments not of maturity date.

Every special tax bill shall be a lien against the lot or tract or parcel of land described in said
special tax bill for a period ending one (1) year after the date of maturity of the last annual

State Law Reference — For similar provisions, see RSMo. §§ 88.812 and 88.816.
The Board of Aldermen may, by ordinance, issue assessment notes at the time the Board of
Aldermen authorizes special tax assessments and issues special tax bills therefor. The
assessment notes shall be issued as provided for in Section 88.815, RSMo. No assessment notes
issued shall constitute an indebtedness of the City of Centralia within the meaning of any
constitutional or statutory, limitation or provision.[6]
State Law Reference — As to authority, see RSMo. § 88.815.
After the Board of Aldermen has entered into a contract for the repair or reconstruction of
sidewalks, or for the building or construction of sidewalks and sidewalk curbing, the City Engineer
or City Administrator shall compute the cost of said contract and apportion the cost among the
tracts of land chargeable therewith, charging each tract of land with its proportionate part of the
costs, and the City Engineer or City Administrator shall make a written report to the Board of
Aldermen describing each tract of land chargeable with a part of the cost of the improvement, and
the amount with which it is chargeable. If the Board of Aldermen, by motion, approves the report,
then the City Clerk shall immediately thereafter issue and deposit the special tax bills into a
special fund, if assessment notes are issued as provided for in Subsection (E), or if appropriate,
shall hold such special tax bills for delivery to the contractor upon completion of the project in
payment for the work in accordance with the report prepared by the City Engineer or City
Administrator. The special tax bills shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section
88.822, RSMo.[7]
State Law Reference — As to authority for tax bills, etc., see RSMo. § 88.822.
Whenever the Board of Aldermen shall advertise for bids for the construction of new sidewalks or
for the reconstruction of sidewalks in the place of sidewalks condemned, and shall receive no bids
therefor, the Board of Aldermen may authorize the City of Centralia to proceed to construct or
reconstruct any said sidewalks at the City's own expense. The City shall keep an accurate
account of the amount expended for labor and material, including grading and filling, opposite
each lot or piece of ground, and the City Engineer or the City Administrator shall then present the
same to the Board of Aldermen for assessment, and each lot or piece of ground abutting on the
sidewalk constructed or reconstructed shall be liable for the costs thereof, as reported to the
Board of Aldermen by the City Engineer or the City Administrator, and special tax bills shall be
issued for the amount thereof, payable to the City of Centralia, against each lot or piece of ground
for the amount for which it is liable.[8]
State Law Reference — As to construction of sidewalks, see RSMo. § 88.826.
Any error made in issuing any tax bill may be corrected by the City Clerk, either by interlineations
in it or by issuing a new tax bill in lieu of the erroneous one; but when a tax bill is corrected by
interlineations, the date of making same shall be certified to by the City Clerk on the margin or
back of the bill. In any action brought on any special tax bill, the court may correct any error in the
amount of the tax bill, and in any case where it is shown that the work done was not as good as
required by the contract, the court may give judgement for the reasonable value of the work
chargeable against the land described in the tax bill. In all actions to enforce any special tax bill,
the court shall fix and allow a reasonable attorney fee to the plaintiff's attorney for his services in
the prosecution of such action and tax the same as costs in the proceeding. In all cases where
work is done or improvements made and the cost thereof is assessed as a special tax, any owner
of property upon which such tax is levied may request, and the Board of Aldermen shall grant, a
public hearing to determine whether such assessment is excessive or is levied at a greater sum
than was stated in the notices required by Subsection (C). The Board of Aldermen is hereby
empowered to adjust or reduce such assessment which is determined to be excessive or levied at
a greater sum than was stated in the notices. If such adjustments or reductions result in the

Section 30-52. Alternate special assessment procedure for
sidewalks.
[Ord. No. 1366 § 15, 5-18-1987]
The Board of Aldermen, instead of proceeding under the provisions of Section 30-51 above, shall,
in the alternative, have the power, by ordinance, to build, rebuild, reconstruct or repair sidewalks
on public property and to assess the cost thereof, by special tax assessment, under the provisions
of Sections 88.880 through 88.913, RSMo.
The Board of Aldermen shall have the power, by ordinance, to provide for the building of any
sidewalk or for the rebuilding and reconstruction of said sidewalk, including grading and filling
therefor, and including the removal of any obstructions, and including approaches (as that term is
defined in Section 30-49), at corner lots, and including the grading or parking of that portion of the
street lying between the property line and the street curbline. The work shall be performed
according to contract, and the Board of Aldermen may levy, by said ordinance, a special
assessment against each lot or tract along which such work is done, for the cost thereof, as
provided in Subsection (E) below. However, no such contract shall be let until the plans and
specifications for said work have been adopted by ordinance. No contract shall be let until an
advertisement for bids for the doing of said work has been published in at least one (1) issue of a
weekly newspaper published in the City of Centralia, and the date for the opening of said bids
shall be at least ten (10) days after the date of the first publication of said advertisement for bids.
Before the bids are opened, the City Engineer or the City Administrator shall prepare and file an
estimate showing the estimated quantities of grading, filling and of the various materials required
for the sidewalk in front of each separate lot, tract or parcel of ground, and an estimate of the cost
of said work per cubic yard or per square yard, as the case may be, and an estimate of the cost of
the removal of any obstruction. No contract shall be let for a price in excess of the said estimate of
the cost. After the bids are opened by the Board of Aldermen, the Board of Aldermen shall let the
contract for said work to the lowest and best responsible bidder, and in case there are no bids
received, or that all bids are rejected for any reason, the Board of Aldermen may readvertise for
bids for said work, or may, by ordinance, order and require the City Engineer or the City
Administrator to build and construct said sidewalk or do the other work as herein contemplated,
according to the specifications adopted therefor, provided that the cost of said work shall not
exceed the estimate that the City Engineer or the City Administrator previously filed. The City
Engineer or the City Administrator shall keep an accurate account of the cost of the separate
items thereof, and the Board of Aldermen shall pay for the labor and material and all other costs of
said work out of any funds which the City may have on hand available for such purposes. At the
completion of said work (either by contract or by the City of Centralia doing the work), the Board of
Aldermen shall, by ordinance, levy the cost of said work as a special assessment against the lot,
tract or parcel of ground along with each of said sidewalks or other improvements is made, in the
manner provided in Subsection (E).

The Board of Aldermen may, by ordinance, provide for the repairing or reconstruction of any
sidewalk by the City Engineer or the City Administrator, with the City of Centralia paying the cost
thereof in the same manner as specified in Subsection (B) above. After said work is performed,
the Board of Aldermen may assess and levy the cost of said repairing or reconstruction as a
special assessment, in the same manner as specified in Subsection (B) above.
The Board of Aldermen may, by ordinance, when deemed necessary or expedient, divide the City
of Centralia or any portion thereof into sidewalk districts. The Board of Aldermen may adopt plans
and specifications for the building of all sidewalks within said district or districts, and may advertise
for bids and award a contract to the lowest and best responsible bidder for the building and
construction of all sidewalks which may be ordered built by the Board of Aldermen within said
district for the next ensuing year. Said advertisement for bids shall be published in at least one (1)
issue of a weekly newspaper published in the City of Centralia. Before any bids are opened or any
contract let, the City Engineer of the City Administrator shall prepare and submit to the Board of
Aldermen an estimate of the cost of said sidewalk, including approaches, grading and parking,
material and like items, which estimate shall be the price per cubic yard or square yard, as the
case may be, for the finished improvement. No contract shall be let for a price in excess of said
estimate. The cost of all sidewalks, approaches, parking or other improvement herein
contemplated shall be, on their completion, levied as a special assessment against the lot, tract or
parcel of ground along and in front of which said improvement is made, as provided in Subsection
(E).
The cost of any of the work or improvements contemplated in any of the Subsections in Section
30-52 that are made and done either by contract or by the City Engineer or the City Administrator
(except the cost of condemnation and removal of sidewalks, which shall be paid by the City of
Centralia) shall be levied as a special assessment against the lot, tract or parcel of ground along
and in front of which said improvement is made. The cost of the approaches, as defined in Section
30-49, shall be levied as a special assessment against the corner lots which said approaches abut
and connect with. Said assessment shall be levied by ordinance, in which ordinance shall be set
out separately the number and title of the ordinance under authority of which the work will be
done, a separate description of each lot, tract or parcel of ground assessed, the name of the
owner thereof, the number of front feet therein abutting on said improvement, the separate items
of cost of said improvement and the total amount thereof; and said assessment ordinance shall
further provide for the making out of tax bills by the City Engineer, City Administrator or the City
Clerk, in evidence of said assessments, payable to the contractor doing the work, and for the
delivery of said tax bills in payment for said work, or if the work was done by the City Engineer or
the City Administrator, the tax bills shall be made payable to the City Engineer or the City
Administrator, for and to the use of the City of Centralia, and shall be collected the same as other
tax bills.
Tax bills shall be issued in accordance with Section 88.893, RSMo. The tax bills shall be payable
to the contractor doing the work, or to the City Engineer or to the City Administrator, to and for the
City of Centralia, as the case may be. The tax bills shall be due in thirty (30) days after the date of
issue thereof, and shall bear interest after said thirty (30) days at eight per cent (8%) per annum.
Except for property owned by the State of Missouri or any County or City, or by the United States,
the tax bills shall be a lien against the property described in said tax bill, second only to the lien of
State, County and City taxes. Said lien shall continue for a period of three (3) years after the
maturity of each tax bill, or until the final determination of any legal proceeding to collect the same.
Any real estate owned by the State of Missouri or any County or City abutting on the sidewalk
improvement shall be liable for the cost of said improvement the same as other property, and an
assessment shall be made thereon and tax bills issued in the same manner as tax bills against
other property, and tax bills so issued shall constitute a valid claim, but not a lien, against said
governments. The tax bills shall be certified as correct under the provisions of Section 88.907,
RSMo. The computation made for said certification shall be performed by the City Engineer or the
City Administrator. The City Clerk shall record all the tax bills as provided for in Section 88.910,
RSMo. Legal proceedings to enforce collection of tax bills shall be in accordance with Section
88.913, RSMo.

No owner, or agent of the owner, of any land located within the City, knowingly or with intent to
defraud, may transfer, sell, agree to sell or negotiate to sell that land by reference to or by other
use of a plat of any purported subdivision of the land before the plat has been approved by the
Board and recorded in the Office of the County Recorder of Deeds, unless the owner shall
disclose that such plat has not been approved by the Board, and the sale is contingent upon the
approval of the plat by the Board. Any person violating the provisions of this Section shall forfeit
and pay to the City a penalty not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300.00) for each lot
transferred or sold or agreed or negotiated to be sold; and the description by metes and bounds in
the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transferring shall not
exempt the transaction from this penalty. The City may enjoin or vacate the transfer or sale or
agreement by legal action, and may recover the penalty in such action.

Deeds or have any validity until it shall have been approved in the manner prescribed by this
Chapter and the Revised Statutes of Missouri and all property taxes and special assessments, if
any, against such land have been paid. In the event any such unapproved plat is recorded, it shall
be considered invalid, and the Board may institute proceedings to have the plat voided by
ordinance.
No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions shall be made in any plat or a subdivision after
approval has been given by the Board and endorsed in writing on the plat, unless the plat is first
resubmitted to the Board; except that the City Administrator shall have the authority to grant
adjustments for mathematical corrections.
The City Administrator shall not issue a building permit or moving permit or any structure on a lot
in a subdivision of which a plat has not been approved and recorded in the manner prescribed
herein.

for each component and category of improvement, based on the City Administrator's estimate
of the cost of the improvements as reflected by the approved improvement plans.
A land subdivision bond or an escrow agreement shall remain in effect and the escrowed sum
shall be held in the escrow account by the escrow agent until the City Administrator shall, by
written authorization to surety or escrow agent, release the surety from the obligation of the bond
or the escrow agent from the agent's obligation to retain some or all the escrowed sum in the
escrow account as improvements are completed and approved, pursuant to the provisions set
forth below. As each component or category of improvement is installed and completed, the City
Administrator shall authorize the release from the bond or amount held in the escrow account,
within thirty (30) days of completion of such component or category of improvement, an amount
equal to the cost of the component or category of improvement, minus a retention of five percent
(5%) of the cost of that component or category of improvement which shall be released only upon
completion of resolution of the Board. Any such component or category of improvement shall be
deemed to be completed upon receipt by the City Administrator, in compete and acceptable form,
the requisite written certification of completion of improvement from the City's inspecting agencies
and the Commission. The release shall be deemed effective when the escrowed funds are duly
posted with the United States Postal Service or other agreed-upon delivery service or when the
escrowed funds are hand delivered to an authorized person or placed as specified by the
developer. If the City has not released the escrowed funds within thirty (30) days as provided
above, the City shall pay the developer in addition to the escrowed funds due the developer,
interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) per month calculated from the expiration
of the thirty-day period until the escrowed funds have been released. The developer shall continue
to be responsible for defects, deficiencies and damage to public streets and other improvements
required during the development of each separate phase of the subdivision. Release of the
escrow agreement and escrow sum does not per se constitute acceptance of such improvements
by the City.
The term of the land subdivision bond or the escrow agreement shall not exceed two (2) years,
subject to the following:
If, at the end of the two-year period, all improvements reflected by the approved improvement
plans have not been completed, the City Administrator may extend the term of the land
subdivision bond or escrow agreement for a period not to exceed one (1) additional year at
each extension if, after review by the City Administrator, such longer period is necessary to
facilitate adequate and coordinated provisions for transportation, water, sewerage, schools,
parks, playgrounds, or other public requirements. If improvements have not been completed
at the end of the two-year period or as extended by the City Administrator, the City
Administrator may:
Require the surety to perform on the bond and pay or remit to the City such amount as
shall be equal to the lesser of the amount required to complete the improvements or the
amount not theretofore released; or
Require the escrow agent to remit to the City in cash or negotiable instruments
constituting the escrow sum, as the case may be, the balance in the escrow account
required to complete the improvements, and the balance, if any, in the escrow account
which exceeds such amount shall be returned to the developer; or
Require the developer to submit a new land subdivision bond or escrow agreement which
has been recalculated in order to allow for any inflation in the case of constructing
improvements.
If the surety fails to perform on the bond or the escrow agent fails to remit the amount
required within thirty (30) days after written request, the City Administrator may recommend to
the Board that the City Attorney take immediate action to require performance by the surety
under the bond or to secure the payment by the escrow agents of the amount required.

developer to make such changes necessary to cause the plat to be in conformance with the
regulations contained herein and the preliminary plat.
The City Administrator shall forward the plat to the Commission and advise the Commission as to
its conformance or non-conformance with these regulations. The Commission shall take action on
the plat in the manner prescribed for preliminary plats.
Sites designated for public ownership or use on the final plat, which are acceptable to an
applicable public governmental agency and may be used for schools, parks, recreation, or other

Acceptance of the final plat constitutes acceptance of the dedications of public easements and
street rights-of-way as property, but does not constitute acceptance by the City of streets or other
improvements for maintenance. The City shall have no duty to maintain the streets or other
improvements until the provisions of Section 30.1-16 have been met by the developer.
Section 30.1-12. Lot split/boundary adjustment procedure.
[Ord. No. 2765 § 1, 5-19-2014]
No lot split survey, instrument, deed or other conveyance dividing property shall be entitled to be
recorded in the Office of the County Recorder of Deeds or have any validity unless and until
approved by the City Administrator in compliance with this Section.
The lot split/boundary adjustment is intended to be used when:
The owner of a lot or tract plans to sell or convey any part of his lot or tract;
The owners of abutting lots or tracts plan to sell or convey part of each of the abutting lots or
tracts to a third party;
One (1) owner plans to sell an abutting owner part of his lot; or
Owners of abutting lots or tracts plan to exchange deeds to parts of their respective lots or
tracts for the purpose of correcting, establishing record title, or curing title defects.
The lot split/boundary adjustment procedure may be used if the following additional requirements
are met:
No additional improvements or streets are required to be constructed or dedicated, provided
that the correction of the legal description of an existing street or the enlargement of an
existing street shall be permitted.
No provisions for common land or recreational facilities are included in the proposed lot split.
The proposed lot split is not in conflict with any zoning provisions of Chapter 31 of the
Centralia City Code, of any special procedure permit, or of any conditional use permit.
No variances are required for the lot split.
Multiple lot splits of a lot or tract do not circumvent the intent of the subdivision regulations.
The procedure for approval of a lot split/boundary adjustment shall be as follows:
Any owner may apply for a lot split by completing a "Lot Split/Boundary Adjustment
Application" on such forms as are provided by the City.
Upon verification that the proposed lot split is in compliance with the City Code, the City
Administrator shall issue a permit authorizing the owner(s) to complete the conveyance or
correction.

All sewers and appurtenances, except that for sewer mains larger than eight (8) inches in
diameter, the City shall reimburse the developer for the difference in cost between the designated
main and an eight-inch main. The amount of this difference and the method for the City to pay this
cost shall be fixed by the City at the time of approval of the improvement plan.
Storm sewers, inlets, drainage channels and stormwater retention areas as shown on the
improvement plans.
Paved streets, curbs and gutters, and sidewalks as shown in the improvement plans. The City
may participate in or contribute to certain additional costs of construction of major thoroughfares
over and above the normal costs of local standard streets, when streets are designated at higher
standards by the City. Such participation, and its timing, is not mandated and is solely at the
election of the Board according to the needs of the community.
The City may require the developer to improve or contribute payment for the improvement of
public infrastructure outside of, but serving, the subdivision. Such improvements or contributions
shall be reasonably proportional to the additional public infrastructure service requirements
created by the subdivision as authorized under applicable zoning and building regulations. The
City Administrator may recommend and the Board may enter into a contractual development
agreement with the developer, to include such off-site improvements. Development agreements
requiring improvements or payment contributions shall be on such terms and conditions
prescribed by the Board as are reasonable to timely assure adequate public infrastructure
services to the subdivision and to address additional public infrastructure service requirements
caused by the subdivision and permissible land use therein. In lieu of immediate completion or
installation of all or part of any required improvements, the City also may accept bond from the
developer in such amount and with such sureties and secure the actual construction, installation
and completion of all such improvements within a period specified by the Commission that is
satisfactory to the Board.
Either payment for materials for the installation of water mains and fire hydrants, or reimbursement
to the City for the costs of such materials. Labor for the installation of such water mains shall be
furnished without charge by the City.
Where monuments do not already exist in the subdivision boundary, lot corners or other control
points, monuments consisting of a straight iron pipe not less than one-inch outside diameter or a
straight reinforcing bar not less than three-fourths (3/4) inches in diameter and not less than thirty
(30) inches in length and set vertically, with the bottom not less than thirty (30) inches deep, shall
be installed and adequately referenced to facilitate future replacement. If monuments are set prior
to the installation of improvements, their locations shall be verified and/or reestablished after
improvements have been completed.
Payment for street signs and posts in conformity with City standards. Labor for the installation of
such street signs shall be furnished without charge by the City.
Section 30.1-14. Sanitary sewer main construction cost
reimbursement from subsequent developer — when required.
[Ord. No. 2765 § 1, 5-19-2014]
When a developer, as defined in Section 30.1-2, incurs costs to construct a sanitary sewer main to
the property subject to development by said developer and when more than five hundred (500)
feet of the length of said main is located outside the boundaries of the property subject to
development and when a subsequent developer [except those referred to in Subsections (E) and
(F)] within the time limit in Subsection (G) plans to and will attach one (1) or more new sanitary

sewer mains or service connections to the said main or mains constructed by the original
developer, the subsequent developer shall reimburse the original developer for one-half (1/2) of
the cost of constructing said sanitary sewer main as provided in this Section. Said costs of
constructing said sanitary sewer mains shall include, but not be limited to, the actual costs of
design, materials, and labor. Reimbursement shall be limited to the costs for that portion of the
sanitary sewer main constructed by the original developer which runs from between the first point
of connection by the original developer to the existing sanitary sewer system of the City and the
farthest upstream point of connection to the sanitary sewer main by the subsequent developer or
the boundary line of the property subject to development by the original developer, whichever is
less footage.
No reimbursement shall be required from any subsequent developer for the costs of sanitary
sewer mains constructed within and upon the property subject to development by the original
developer.
When a sanitary sewer main is constructed by two (2) or more developers or property owners
working together, the costs of construction shall be apportioned in whatever manner is agreed
upon by those responsible for such construction. For the purpose of requiring reimbursement of
construction costs by a subsequent developer or additional subsequent developers, the provisions
described in Subsection (A) above shall treat the developers responsible for the initial sewer
construction as a single entity for purposes of this Section.
When an additional subsequent developer shall seek to attach to a sanitary sewer main in the
same circumstance as described in Subsection (A) above, the additional subsequent developer
shall thereafter reimburse the original developer and the first subsequent developer for the eligible
constructions costs based on a one-third share of that portion of the sewer main used by both of
the previous developers and a one-half share of that portion (if any) of the sewer main used only
by the original developer and the additional subsequent developer. The connection to the sanitary
sewer main by a further additional subsequent developer shall require the reimbursement to each
of the preceding developers so as to effect an equal division of the costs incurred by the original
developer for each applicable portion of sanitary sewer main as if he or she would have shared
the costs equally in the original construction with the preceding developers.
The City of Centralia shall be exempt from the requirement of subsequent developers providing
reimbursement as described in this Section.
The reimbursement requirements of this Section shall not be applied to an owner or subsequent
developer who:
Develops less than ten (10) lots in a nearby or contiguous area; or
Develops a group housing project as defined in Section 31-1, when said group housing
project includes less than ten (10) dwelling units in a nearby or contiguous area.
The period of time within which this Section shall be applicable to a subsequent developer
attaching to said sanitary sewer main or mains as described in Subsection (A) above shall be
measured from the time a subsequent developer files with the City a sketch plat for a subdivision
where such sanitary sewer main attachment will take place and shall be limited to ten (10) years
from the date of approval by ordinance by the Board of Aldermen of the final plat of the subdivision
of the property subject to development by the original developer or the first final plat of any original
developer's phased development developed in separate tracts or sections as permitted in Section
30.1-4.
At the time of the approval by the City Administrator of the improvement plans for a subdivision,
the original developer and City Administrator shall mutually agree on the portion of any sanitary
sewer main construction which might be subject to the conditions of Subsection (A) above. Such
portion shall be specifically designated on the improvement plan. Upon actual construction of said
portion of the sanitary sewer main, the original developer shall submit to the City Administrator a

detailed accounting of the eligible construction costs set forth in Subsection (A) calculated and
divided on a per-foot basis of eligible sanitary sewer main constructed, which could be subject to
reimbursement. Said detailed accounting shall include copies of invoices paid by the original
developer. Any disagreement between the original developer and the City Administrator
concerning the designation of reimbursable sewer costs or the amount of reimbursable costs shall
be referred to the Board of Aldermen alone for final determination, by resolution. The designation
of sanitary sewer subject to possible reimbursement and the cost of construction of said sewer
mains shall be set forth in the ordinance accepting the conveyance of said sanitary sewer mains
as described in Section 30.1-16(C) and shall be recorded by the City in the office of the Boone
County Recorder of Deeds.
Copies of the ordinance of conveyance for sanitary sewer mains eligible for reimbursement and
the detailed accounting of the construction costs for said mains shall be retained by the City
Administrator and given to any subsequent developer who proposes a development which might
make connection to the sewer mains eligible for reimbursement. In any instance where the
subsequent developer is found to be responsible for reimbursement to the original developer as
provided in this Section, the City Administrator shall notify the Board of Aldermen of that fact, and
the Board of Aldermen shall not grant final approval by ordinance for the subsequent developer of
the final plat of a subdivision for the first final plat of any phased development developed in
separate tracts or sections as permitted in Section 30.1-4, under Section 30.1-11(I), until said
reimbursement is made in full.
Unless otherwise specified by contract with the original developer, any payment of reimbursement
by a subsequent developer shall be made to the City Clerk and then shall be paid as specified
under this Section to the original developer and any prior subsequent developers, as identified in
the conveyance of the sewer mains to the City.
Section 30.1-15. Street construction cost reimbursement from
subsequent developer — when required.
[Ord. No. 2765 § 1, 5-19-2014]
When a developer, as defined in Section 30.1-2, incurs costs to construct a required street which
is adjacent to the boundary of a development or is located outside the boundaries of the property
subject to development and when a subsequent developer within the time limit in Subsection (D)
plans to develop property directly adjacent to such a street, the subsequent developer shall
reimburse the original developer for the cost of constructing the portion of said street which is on
the side of the center line of said street and adjacent to the property to be subsequently
developed. Said costs of constructing said street shall include, but not be limited to, the actual
costs of design, materials, and labor.
When a street as described in Subsection (A) above is constructed by two (2) or more developers
or property owners working together, the costs of construction shall be apportioned in whatever
manner is agreed upon by those responsible for such construction. For the purpose of requiring
reimbursement of construction costs by a subsequent developer, the provisions described in
Subsection (A) above shall treat the developers responsible for the initial street construction as a
single entity for purposes of this Section.
The City of Centralia shall be exempt from the requirement of subsequent developers providing
reimbursement as described in this Section.
The period of time for which this Section shall be applicable to a subsequent developer platting a
subdivision as described in Subsection (A) above shall be limited to five (5) years measured from
the date of approval by ordinance by the Board of Aldermen of the final plat of the subdivision of
the property subject to development by the original developer until the time a subsequent
developer files with the City a sketch plat for said subsequent subdivision. If the original

At the time of the approval by the City Administrator of the improvement plans for a subdivision,
the original developer and City Administrator shall mutually agree on the portion of any street
improvements which might be subject to the conditions of Subsection (A) above. Such portion
shall be specifically designated on the improvement plan. Upon actual construction of said portion
of said street(s), the original developer shall submit to the City Administrator a detailed accounting
of the eligible construction costs set forth in Subsection (A) calculated and divided on a per-foot
basis of eligible streets constructed, which could be subject to reimbursement. Said detailed
accounting shall include copies of invoices paid by the original developer. Any disagreement
between the original developer and the City Administrator concerning the designation of
reimbursable street construction or the amount of reimbursable costs shall be referred to the
Board of Aldermen alone for final determination, by resolution. The designation of streets subject
to possible reimbursement and the cost of construction of said streets shall be set forth in the
ordinance approving the final plat containing the conveyance of said street improvements.
Copies of the detailed accounting of the construction costs for said street improvements shall be
retained by the City Administrator and given to any subsequent developer who proposes a
development which abuts the streets constructed under the provisions of Subsection (A) above. In
any instance where the subsequent developer is found to be responsible for reimbursement to the
original developer as provided in this Section, the City Administrator shall notify the Board of
Aldermen of that fact, and the Board of Aldermen shall not grant final approval by ordinance for
the subsequent developer of the final plat of a subdivision for the first final plat of any phased
development developed in separate tracts or sections as permitted in Section 30.1-4, under
Section 30.1-11(I), until said reimbursement is made in full.
Unless otherwise specified by contract with the original developer, any payment of reimbursement
by a subsequent developer shall be made to the City Clerk and then shall be paid as specified
under this Section to the original developer, as identified in the conveyance of the street
improvements to the City.
When said street(s) are not yet constructed, but are guaranteed under the provisions of Section
30.1-9, the subsequent developer shall provide an acceptable improvement guarantee sufficient to
cover the share of costs accruing to the subsequent developer; and the original developer shall be
able to obtain release of an equal amount of the improvement guarantee submitted for the original
development.
Section 30.1-16. Acceptance of improvements for maintenance
by City — continuing obligation of developer for one year.
[Ord. No. 2765 § 1, 5-19-2014]
All required improvements shall be constructed under the observation and inspection of the City
before they are accepted for maintenance or given final approval by the City.
Upon the completion of street paving and storm sewer construction, the developer shall request a
final inspection of the streets and storm sewers. Any defects shall be corrected by the developer
at that time. The City shall accept the streets and storm sewers for limited maintenance after any
defects are corrected.
Upon completion of sanitary sewers, the developer shall request a final inspection of the sanitary
sewers. Any defects shall be corrected by the developer. After any defects are corrected, the
developer shall prepare a conveyance to the City for said sanitary sewers; and the Board shall
accept such conveyance by ordinance. (See also Section 30.1-14.)

The developer shall warranty the improvements built at the developer's direction for one (1) year
and repair, correct, or replace any improvement due to a defect in workmanship in making,
constructing, or installing the improvement. The developer shall, at the developer's expense,
promptly correct, repair, or replace the improvement upon being notified by the City.
This warranty shall run from the date of recording of the final plat or the date the conveyance of
said sewers are accepted by ordinance, whichever is later.
At the end of the one-year warranty, the City shall reinspect the improvements to see if any final
repairs are needed. Once any defects are corrected, repaired, or replaced the City shall accept
the improvements for full maintenance.
Section 30.1-17. Streets and alleys — generally.
[Ord. No. 2765 § 1, 5-19-2014]
All subdivision streets shall be arranged for the continuation of existing streets in adjoining
subdivisions and to the extent possible, the anticipated projections of streets through adjoining
unsubdivided or undeveloped property, to allow for convenient movement of vehicular traffic and
the orderly development of adjoining property, and shall adhere to the major street plan where
applicable.
When a new subdivision adjoins undivided lands, susceptible to being subdivided, the new streets
shall be carried to the boundaries of the land. When a street extends more than one hundred
seventy-five (175) feet from the center line of a paved, intersecting street, a temporary paved
turnaround shall be installed at this point.
Permanently designated dead-end or cul-de-sac streets shall not be longer than eight hundred
(800) feet measured from the nearest right-of-way line to the center of the cul-de-sac and shall be
provided with a paved turnaround at the closed end.
The minimum length of a block shall be three hundred (300) feet; the maximum length of a block
shall be one thousand (1,000) feet, except for non-residential subdivisions.
Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two (2) tiers of lots, except when adjacent to major streets,
railroads, or waterway, in which case either a frontage road or one (1) tier of lots shall be provided.
All streets in exact or approximate alignment with existing named streets shall bear the names of
such existing streets. All other streets shall be assigned names which do not conflict with names
of existing streets within Boone County and are consistent with the Boone County Address
Ordinance.
Whenever there exists a platted half (1/2) street or half (1/2) alley adjacent to land platted for a
subdivision, the remaining half (1/2) of the street or alley shall be provided for on the plat of the
subdivision. No new half (1/2) streets or half (1/2) alleys shall be accepted. If necessary, the
developer shall acquire and provide additional right-of-way and construction easements from the
landowners across from the subdivision sufficient to accommodate the entire paved road and
curbs and gutters, if required.
If any utility services are to be installed under the proposed streets they shall be installed prior to
paving where subsurface conditions prevent pushing of the service under the completed
pavement. If the sewer main or water main is located in the street right-of-way, sewer laterals and
water mains shall be installed and stubbed in prior to street paving. All such service connections
shall be referenced and marked for future use.
Where land is subdivided into larger lots than ordinary building lots, such lots shall be arranged so
as to allow the opening of future streets and/or street extensions, and logical further resubdivision.

The widths of the rights-of-way for streets and alleys and the widths of improved roadway within
such rights-of-way, unless modified by the Commission because of unusual conditions or
circumstances, are established as follows:
Arterial streets. The right-of-way and width of improved roadway for arterial streets shall be to
the standards of the Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission.
Subarterial streets. The right-of-way shall be eighty (80) feet wide, and the improved roadway
shall be at least thirty-eight (38) feet wide (measured back-of-curb to back-of-curb or, if no
curb, then to edge of pavement).

In all other respects, street paving and related public improvements design for estate lanes
shall be according to the design standards for local residential streets contained or referenced
herein.
Proposed subdivisions that include existing street rights-of-way narrower than required herein
shall provide the dedication of additional width along one (1) or both sides of the street. Proposed
subdivisions abutting only one (1) side of such street shall provide for the dedication of additional
width to constitute one-half of the right-of-way required, unless this would cause streets to be
misaligned.
Slab Thickness And Curb Standards.
The minimum slab thickness for residential streets and for alleys in non-residential areas shall
be six (6) inches of Portland cement concrete or five (5) inches of black base with two (2)
inches type "C" asphaltic concrete. The slab shall be placed on a rolled-stone base of at least
four (4) inches thickness.
The minimum slab thickness for non-residential streets shall be at least seven (7) inches of
Portland cement concrete or seven (7) inches of black base with two (2) inches of type "C"
asphaltic concrete. The slab shall be placed on a rolled-stone base of at least four (4) inches

subdivision side of streets abutting a subdivision.
The design of curb and gutters shall be as shown on drawings available from the City
Administrator.
At minimum, all materials shall be according to Missouri State Highway Department
standards.
Intersections.
Streets shall intersect at as near a right angle as possible, and no intersection angle shall
depart from a right angle more than ten degrees (10°).
Intersecting streets shall have center lines as nearly straight as possible. Streets with center
line offsets at intersections shall be offset by five (5) feet or less or one hundred twenty-five
(125) feet or more.
Where streets intersect at a right angle or where a street intersects with a cul-de-sac terminal
bulb, the pavement shall be rounded by a curve with a radius of not less than twenty (20) feet
for residential streets and not less than thirty (30) feet for non-residential streets.
When streets intersect at an angle of less than ninety degrees (90°), the City Administrator
may require the pavement to be rounded by a curve with a radius greater than required for
streets intersecting a ninety-degree angle.
Where alleys intersect streets or other alleys, the pavement shall be rounded by a curve with
a radius of not less than ten (10) feet.
At the intersection of an arterial or subarterial street with another arterial or subarterial street
or a collector street, additional right-of-way and improved roadway shall be provided so as to
allow for the designation of separate left-turn lanes.

Residential areas. Public alleys shall not be permitted in residential areas. Private alleys may
be established and permitted along the rear of adjoining lots for common use by adjoining
landowners for access in multifamily zoned areas, but the private alley shall be paved to
specifications designated by the City Administrator, and the instrument creating the private
alley shall specifically require that the repair and maintenance of the private alley shall be
provided by subdivision property owners adjoining the alley. That instrument shall be recorded
in the Office of the County Recorder of Deeds and may be in the plat or subdivision
covenants or restrictions.
Non-residential areas. Public alleys shall be provided in non-residential areas except that the
Commission may waive this requirement where other definite and assured provision is made
for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking, consistent with and
adequate for the use proposed.
Dead-end alleys shall not be permitted.
Section 30.1-19. Sidewalks.
[Ord. No. 2765 § 1, 5-19-2014]
Sidewalk Requirements.
Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of all streets in a subdivision and on the subdivision
side of streets abutting a subdivision.
Sidewalks shall be constructed to City specifications. The minimum requirements for
sidewalks shall be as set forth in Chapter 30, Article VI, of the Centralia City Code and in
accordance with Federal standards for handicapped access.
Where sidewalks are to be located adjacent to a roadway under the jurisdiction of the
Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission, said sidewalks may be required to be
placed in a public easement outside the State road right-of-way. Maintenance of sidewalks
along a State road right-of-way shall be the responsibility of the adjoining property owners of
the subdivision.
Where a final plat creates a common lot or a non-buildable lot, a sidewalk shall be
constructed along the portion of each street abutting the lot at the same time the abutting
street is constructed.
Sidewalk Exception Procedure. A developer may apply to the Commission for deletion of
sidewalks or approval of an alternate sidewalk plan. The City Administrator shall provide the
Commission with recommendations concerning conditions with a street right-of-way involved with
a request for exception or alternate sidewalk plan. The Commission may grant an application to
delete sidewalks or approve an alternate sidewalk plan in any of the following cases:
Where sidewalks are not deemed necessary for the public safety or where topographical or
other conditions make their installation and use impractical; or
Where lots are created having at least three hundred (300) feet of frontage which could be
resubdivided into smaller lots at a future time; or
Where the subdivision designer has submitted for review a proposed sidewalk plan that
provides for more direct and safer movement of pedestrian traffic; or
Where justifiable conditions can be shown that strict application of the requirements contained
in this Section would:
Impose practical difficulties or particular hardship; or

Section 30.1-20. Stormwater standards.
[Ord. No. 2765 § 1, 5-19-2014]
The purpose of this Section is to provide standards and regulations governing land development in
order to reduce or prevent flooding and at the same time minimize damage to real property.
Discharge Rate.
On residential land for all land disturbances greater than three (3) acres, the stormwater
discharge rate for the ten-year storm after development shall be equal to or less than the
predevelopment rate.
On non-residential land for all land disturbances greater than one (1) acre, the stormwater
discharge rate for the twenty-five-year storm after development shall be equal to or less than
the predevelopment rate.
Detention reservoirs or dry bottom stormwater storage areas may be designed to serve secondary
purposes such as recreation, open space, or other types of uses that will not be adversely affected
by occasional flooding as approved by the City Administrator.
Drainage detention areas that are not maintained by a public authority shall be conveyed as an
undivided interest in common to each lot owner in the subdivision for maintenance purposes.
During the construction phase of development, best management practices shall be provided and
maintained to prevent pollution of the waters of the United States.
For all land disturbance greater than one (1) acre, a stormwater pollution prevention plan shall be
developed and implemented that meets Missouri Department of Natural Resources permit
requirements.
Storm drainage improvements consisting of storm sewer systems or open channels shall
adequately drain the areas being developed. No significant changes in watersheds shall be
permitted. All stormwater shall be discharged at an adequate natural discharge point.
The design of drainage improvements shall be coordinated to the extent possible with present and
probably future improvements so as to form part of an integrated system and shall be in
accordance with the best stormwater management practices.
The final plat or the subdivision restrictions and covenants shall include provisions specifying
which lot owners in the subdivision or other private persons shall be responsible for and shall pay
for the maintenance of the subdivision land through which stormwater control easements and
access easements run, unless said facility has been accepted for maintenance by the City.
Maintenance shall include, but not be limited to, the cutting of grass and weeds and erosion
control.
If private storm drainage facilities and detention areas are not properly maintained by the
landowners, they shall constitute a public nuisance under Chapter 19 of the Centralia City Code.

The width of utility easements shall be determined by the City Administrator, but shall generally be
not less than ten (10) feet when adjoining a street right-of-way or be not less than a total of twenty
(20) feet when not adjoining a street right-of-way. No trees, shrubs or structures, including fences,
shall be permitted within the utility right-of-way. These provisions shall be stated in all utility
dedications on the final plat.
To the maximum extent feasible, utilities shall be located in designated easements and not in
street rights-of-way.
Where cut or fill for a street extends beyond the limits of the right-of-way, the developer shall
provide a slope easement of sufficient area and limits to permit the construction and maintenance
of the slope.
Whenever improvements to land are made, easements for the stormwater management facilities
(including structural facilities, engineered channels and overflow paths) shall be provided across
private property. Easements through existing developments shall be obtained as deemed
necessary. Drainage easements shall include access from a convenient public street or parking
lot. Minimum dimensions are as follows:
Where a storm drain consists of a closed conduit, the width shall be a minimum of twenty (20)
feet.
Where the drainage system consists of an engineered channel, easements shall at a
minimum be as wide as the top of bank width plus ten (10) feet each side.
Where the drainage system includes natural channels, easements shall be not less wide as
the top of bank width plus ten (10) feet or less than ten (10) feet from the high water mark of
other unimproved drainage features. In such instances, the City Administrator may require
wider easements when deemed necessary to protect property and public safety.
The width of an easement must contain the overflow from the one-hundred-year (one-percent
annual chance) storm event and shall indicate the highest expected water surface elevation of
said event.
Access easements to detention/retention facilities shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet wide
with cross slopes less than five (5) horizontal to one (1) vertical in order to be safely
accessible by a vehicle unless otherwise approved by the City Administrator.
Access easements around detention/retention facilities shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet
wide with cross slopes less than five (5) horizontal to one (1) vertical in order to be safely
accessible by a vehicle unless otherwise approved by the City Administrator.
Section 30.1-22. Test boring.
[Ord. No. 2765 § 1, 5-19-2014]
The City Administrator may require evidence as to the subsurface soil, rock, and water conditions of
the land to be developed.
Section 30.1-23. Wiring for subdivisions.
[Ord. No. 2765 § 1, 5-19-2014]
In residential subdivisions all electric and telephone distribution lines and cable television lines shall be
installed underground, except those overhead distribution feeder lines necessary to serve that
subdivision or other locations, as approved by the City Administrator. Cable switching enclosures, padmounted
transformers and service pedestal may also be installed above ground and may be installed
as a part of the street lighting standards where approved by the City Administrator. Utilities for non3/

residential subdivisions may be installed either above ground or below ground or both, subject to
design approval by the City Administrator. All utilities shall comply with the provisions of Chapter 26 of
the Centralia City Code. Electric utilities in non-residential subdivisions shall be installed in the street or
alley right-of-way unless the City Administrator allows otherwise. Lights within street rights-of-way shall
be placed as directed by the City Administrator and shall be designed and maintained to avoid
unnecessary illumination of residential interiors.
Section 30.1-24. Lot identification, size and arrangement.
[Ord. No. 2765 § 1, 5-19-2014]
All lots in original subdivisions shall be numbered consecutively from one (1) through the total
number of lots, even though the subdivision may be recorded in sections.
The size of lots shall meet the minimum zoning requirements of Chapter 31 of the Centralia City
Code for the area being subdivided. Areas used for open stormwater drainage easements shall
not be included in the calculations of running lot dimensions.
All lots shall abut on a publicly dedicated street. Each lot shall meet the minimum frontage
requirements of Chapter 31 of the Centralia City Code, consistent with the zone district where the
platted land is located. A point of public street access shall consist of a connection to a through
street.
Lots shall be arranged at right angles to street lines.
Corner lots located at the intersection of major and minor streets shall normally have driveway
access from the minor street. Driveways shall be located as far from the street intersection as
practicable and shall not be permitted within the sight distance triangle serving the intersection as
described in Chapter 31 of the City Code.
Flag lots will be allowed for lots that contain a minimum of twenty thousand (20,000) square feet.
However, flag lots of lesser area may be approved by the Commission, provided:
The access portion of such lots shall have a minimum width of forty (40) feet;
Such lots shall not be further subdivided into additional lots unless a public road is
constructed to City standards;
No more than two (2) flag lots may have adjoining driveway entrances to a public right-of-way;
The front building line for flag lots shall be established on both the access portion and on the
building site portion of the lots in accord with provisions of the particular zoning district.
No more than one hundred (100) dwelling units shall be final platted when the design of the
subdivision is such that only one (1) point of public street access is provided for the subdivision.
No more than two hundred (200) dwelling units shall be final platted when the design of the
subdivision is such that only two (2) points of public street access is provided for the subdivision
unless one (1) of the two (2) points of public street access is a collector or arterial street.
Streets which dead-end or "stub" into property which is adjacent to the property being subdivided
shall not count as a second access until such time as the dead-end or "stub" street is connected to
a through street and constructed to City standards.

[Ord. No. 2765 § 1, 5-19-2014]
The size, shape, and orientation of lots and the orientation of structures shall be designed to provide
desirable building sites logically related to topography, natural features, streets, parking areas,
common land (if any), other structures, and adjacent land uses. Due regard shall be given to natural
features such as large trees, unusual rock formations, watercourses, and sites which have historical
significance, scenic views, and similar assets, the preservation of which would add attractiveness and
value to the subdivision.
Section 30.1-26. Conformance With comprehensive plan.
[Ord. No. 2765 § 1, 5-19-2014]
It is the intent of this Chapter that subdivisions be designed and developed in conformance with the
City General Comprehensive Plan adopted by the Board by Resolution on February 16, 1987, and as
amended. In the review of sketch plats and preliminary plats, the Commission may direct changes in
the size and location of proposed streets and in the proposed land use of subdivisions. Such changes
shall be made whenever the Commission finds that a proposed subdivision does not follow the intent
of the General Comprehensive Plan and creates impediments to its implementation.
Section 30.1-27. Variances.
[Ord. No. 2765 § 1, 5-19-2014]
When the Board of Adjustment, as provided for in Section 89.480 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri,
determines that in a particular instance an owner cannot possibly or practically observe the
requirements of any provision of this Chapter because of the presence of unusual circumstances or
conditions, and that the strict application of one (1) or more of the requirements of such provisions
would either prevent or present a serious obstacle to the formulation of a plat for the reasonable use
and development of land in subdivision form, the Board of Adjustment may permit a variance from the
requirements of such provision.

To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Municipal wastewater system which will pass
through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or
otherwise be incompatible with the system;
To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and sludges from the system;
and
To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the Municipal wastewater system.
This Chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect contributors to the Municipal
wastewater system through the issuance of permits to certain non-domestic discharges,
authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires user reporting and provides for the
setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.

grains, spent hops, wastepaper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining
or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud or glass grinding or polishing wastes.
Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0, unless the POTW is specifically designed to
accommodate such wastewater, or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of
causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment and/or personnel of the POTW.
Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with
other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard
to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW or exceed the
limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be
limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307 (a) of the Act.
Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases or solids which, whether singly or by interaction with
other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent
entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair.
Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW, such as
residues, sludges or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the
reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to
be in non-compliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed
under Section 405 of the Act, any criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use or
disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic
Substances Control Act or State criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used.

State disposal system permit or the receiving water quality standards.
Any wastewater with objectionable color which cannot be removed in the treatment process, such
as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions.
Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW treatment
plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction
into the POTW collection lines which exceeds sixty degrees (60°) Centigrade (one hundred forty
degrees (140°) Fahrenheit), or which causes the flow entering the POTW treatment plant to
exceed forty degrees (40°) Centigrade (one hundred four degrees (104°) Fahrenheit).

wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall be provided, operated and maintained at the
user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities operating procedures shall be
submitted to the City for review and shall be acceptable to the City before construction of the
facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the City
under the provisions of this Chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or
method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the City prior to the user's initiation
of the changes.
The City shall annually publish in the Fireside Guard newspaper a list of the users which were not

The boundaries of the districts as enumerated in Section 31-2 are hereby established and adopted as
shown upon the map which is hereby designated as the "zoning district map," and which map and all
the notations, references and information shown thereon are hereby made as much a part of this
Chapter as if the same were set forth in full herein. It shall be the duty of the City Administrator to keep
on file in his office an authentic copy of such district map, and duplicate copies thereof, showing all the
changes, amendments or additions thereto. When definite distances in feet are not shown on the
zoning district map, the district boundaries on the zoning district map are intended to be along existing
street, alley or plotted lot lines, or extensions of the same, and if the exact location of such line is not
clear, it shall be determined by the City Administrator, due consideration being given to location, as
indicated by the scale of the zoning district map.
When streets or alleys on the ground differ from the streets or alleys shown on the zoning district map,
the City Administrator may apply the district designation on the map to the streets or alleys on the
ground in such manner as to conform to the intent and purpose of this Chapter.
Whenever any street or alley is vacated, the particular district in which the adjacent property lies shall
be automatically extended to the center line of any such street or alley.
All territory which may hereafter be annexed to the City shall be unzoned until zoning for said territory
shall be established by ordinance as provided by Sections 31-7 through 31-9 of this Chapter. Said
zoning ordinance shall be adopted within ninety (90) days of the date of annexation. No building
permits shall be used for construction within said annexed area until a zoning ordinance is enacted and
in effect.

planned development and shall not adversely affect the uses of properties immediately adjacent to the
proposed development.
The requirements and regulations herein prescribed, pertaining to height, open space, setbacks,
parking and loading, may be adjusted or modified by the Board of Adjustment after recommendation of
the Commission before a District "B-P" is established, so that the property in question may be
developed in a reasonable manner and, at the same time, will not be detrimental to the public welfare
and the interests of the City, but in keeping with the general intent and spirit of this Article.
The Commission shall have power to make and adopt such rules and regulations as are necessary
and proper to effectuate the purposes of this Section.
Section 31-32. Preliminary plan.

plan to the Commission for its inspection and review, upon which plan the Commission shall hold a
public hearing. This preliminary plan of the property to be zoned as a District "B-P", drawn to scale,
shall show the boundaries of the property proposed to be zoned, the existing topography with contour
intervals no greater than five (5) feet, unless waived by the Commission, and the proposed size,
location and arrangement of buildings, parking areas, with proposed arrangement of stalls and number
of cars, entrance and exit driveways and their relationship to existing and proposed streets, alleys and
other public ways or public property, and any additional information required by the Commission. The
plan shall show sufficient proposed control grades to interpret the intent of the developer. The
preliminary plan shall also show the development of adjacent properties within two hundred feet,
including the location and type of buildings and structures thereon. If the planned business district is
proposed in an unplatted area, the preliminary plan shall be accompanied by a plat, giving the full legal
description of the boundaries of the property to be included in the areas to be zoned as a planned
business district. It also shall be accompanied by a plan, drawn to scale, showing the general
arrangement of streets within the remainder of such unplatted area, which plan need not extend more
than one thousand (1,000) feet from the boundaries of the area to be zoned as a planned business
district.
The developer shall indicate on the preliminary plan the stages which will be followed in the
construction of the total project.
If this preliminary plan is found to comply with the intent of the requirements and regulations set forth in
this Section, the Commission shall, upon approval of the preliminary plan, prepare and submit to the
council a request of an amendment to this Article, which amendment is to provide for and establish a
"B-P" district for the land covered by the preliminary plan.

Upon approval of the zoning change by amendment, the proponent shall submit a final development
plan to the Commission for its review and recommendation. The final development plan may be
submitted separately for the first and each successive stage of construction.
It shall be the responsibility of the Commission to determine that each stage, or all, of the final
development plan conforms to the intent of the preliminary plan on which the zoning change was
made. The Commission, having reviewed the final development plan for any or all stages of the
development, and finding that it conforms to the intent of the preliminary plan, shall recommend its
approval to the Board of Aldermen.
If the final development plan fails to conform to the intent of the preliminary plan submitted in support
of the rezoning, such final development plan may be submitted to the Commission as an amended
preliminary plan, upon which the Commission shall hold a public hearing. The procedure shall be the
same as for the original preliminary plan.

approval of the final development plan, or any stage thereof, by the Board of Aldermen. Failure to
begin construction as scheduled shall void the plan, as approved, unless a request for an extension of
time is made by the proponents to the Board of Adjustment and approved by such board. If, for any
reason, the plan is abandoned, or if the construction is terminated after the completion of any stage,
and there is ample evidence that further development is not contemplated, the law or ordinance
establishing such District "B-P" may be rescinded by the Board of Aldermen, and the zoning of the
entire tract, or the portion which is undeveloped as a District "B-P", may be changed to a suitable

public hearing. This preliminary plan of the property to be zoned as District "B-T", drawn to scale, shall
show the boundaries of the property to be zoned, the existing topography, with contour intervals no
greater than five (5) feet, unless waived by the Commission, and the proposed size, location and
arrangement of trailer spaces, open spaces, parking areas, service buildings and other structures or
areas to be included, entrances and exits, driveways and their relationship to existing and proposed
streets, alleys and other public ways or public property, and any additional information required by the
Commission. The preliminary plan shall also show the development of adjacent properties within two
hundred (200) feet, including the location and type of buildings and structures thereon. If the planned
trailer court district is proposed in an unplatted area, the preliminary plan shall be accompanied by a
plat, giving the full legal description of the boundaries of the property to be included in the area to be
zoned as a planned trailer court district. It shall also be accompanied by a plan, drawn to scale, of the
general arrangement of streets within the remainder of such unplatted area, which plan need not
extend more than one thousand (1,000) feet from the boundaries of the area to be zoned as a planned
trailer court district.
The applicant shall indicate on the preliminary plan, if the development is to be accomplished in
stages, the order in which such stages shall be developed.
The preliminary plan shall also show the location of all sewer, water main, electrical and gas utilities,
which shall be provided in accordance with the applicable laws and ordinances of the City.
If the preliminary plan is found to comply with the intent of the requirements and regulations set forth in
this Section, the Commission shall, upon approval of the preliminary plan, prepare and submit to the
Board of Aldermen a request for an amendment to this Article, which amendment is to provide for and
establish a "B-T" District for the land covered by the preliminary plan.

[Ord. No. 738 § 13, 1-9-1961]
Upon approval of the zoning change by amendment, the applicant shall submit a final development
plan to the Commission, for its review and recommendation. The final development plan may be

It shall be the responsibility of the Commission to determine that each stage, or all, of the final
development plan conforms to the intent of the preliminary plan on which the zoning change was
made. The Commission, having reviewed the final development plan for any or all stages of the
development and finding that it conforms with the intent of the preliminary plan, shall recommend its
approval to the Board of Aldermen. If the final development plan fails to conform to the intent of the
preliminary plan submitted in support of the rezoning, such final development plan may be submitted to
the Commission as an amended preliminary plan upon which the Commission shall hold the public
hearing. The procedure shall be the same as for the original preliminary plan.
No building permit shall be issued for any development in a planned trailer court district until the Board
of Aldermen shall have approved the final development plan covering at least the first stage of
development, and until the developer has deposited with the City Clerk a bond in form satisfactory to
the Board of Aldermen to insure that the utilities, streets, curbs and gutters shall be constructed at the
expense of the developer within the planned area within a time to be designated by the Board of
Aldermen.
A final development plan, prepared for each succeeding stage, shall also be reviewed by the
Commission and when approved by the Board of Aldermen as provided for above, shall be filed in the
office of the City Clerk.
The applicant for a planned trailer court district shall prepare and submit a schedule of development in
one or more stages, which development shall begin within a period of one year following the approval
of a final development plan or any stage thereof by the Board of Aldermen. Failure to begin
construction as scheduled shall void the plan, as approved, unless a request for extension of time is
made by the applicant to the Board of Adjustment and approved by the Board. If for any reason the
plan is abandoned, or if the development is terminated after the completion of any stage, and there is
ample evidence that further development is not contemplated, the ordinance establishing such District
"B-T" may be rescinded by the City and the zoning of the entire tract, or the portion which is
undeveloped as a District "B-T", may be changed to a suitable classification.
After the final development plan has been approved and the zoning change made, and when in the
course of carrying out this plan, adjustments or rearrangements of trailer spaces, parking areas,
service buildings or other structures, entrances, heights, setbacks or other open spaces are requested
by the applicant, and such requests conform to the standards established by the approved final
development plan, for the area to be covered by such trailer spaces, service buildings or other
structures, parking spaces, entrances, heights, setbacks or other requirements, such adjustments may
be approved by the Board of Adjustment upon application and after receiving the recommendations of
the Commission.

No rear yard shall be required in Districts "B-1" to "M-1", inclusive, on any lot used for business or
industrial purposes, the rear line of which adjoins a railway right-of-way or which has a rear railway
track connection.
In computing the depth of a rear yard for any building where such yard abuts an alley, one-half
(1/2) of such alley may be assumed to be a portion of the rear yard.
In any district where buildings on adjoining lots, used exclusively for dwelling purposes, do not
conform to the side yard requirements of this Chapter, the Board may vary the side yard
requirements; provided, that no building may be built nearer than three (3) feet to the side lot line,
and provided, that the width of the building allowable under the regulations of this Chapter may not
be increased.

permitted business use may extend into the required yard, provided that no structure or pole
supporting the canopy or awning is attached to the ground within the required yard. Such canopy
or awning shall not extend beyond the property line, provided that where a business structure
abuts a public sidewalk, the canopy or awning may extend over the public sidewalk but no farther
than the curbline of the street. Where such a canopy or awning does overhang a public sidewalk,
it shall not obstruct or interfere in any way with streetlights, traffic devices, highway signs, utilities,
public improvements, or other public uses located on any public property or right-of-way. Such a
canopy or awning constructed after March 18, 1991 shall be placed at a minimum height of seven
(7) feet, six (6) inches, as measured from the lowest point of the canopy or awning to the public
sidewalk.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (C), in District "R-1", "R-2", or "R-3", a one-family
dwelling or two-family dwelling that does not have an attached garage and to which has been
granted a Certificate of Occupancy For Nonconforming use because a preexisting front yard failed
to meet depth requirements, may have a detached canopy of a quality in harmony with that of the
dwelling to which it relates, provided the canopy: is open on all four (4) sides, does not exceed
twelve (12) feet in width or twenty-one (21) feet in length, is erected over a paved driveway, does
not extend into a required front yard a distance of more than eight (8) feet from the existing front
line of the dwelling, does not extend any closer than ten (10) feet from the front lot line, and does

situation on the lot only, and does conform as to use and type of structure, in that the usage made of
the building conforms to the requirements of this Chapter and the structure is of the type allowed in the
district where such building may be situated, but the building is located nearer to a lot line than the
minimum setback required by this Chapter, an extension may be made to such building on a side other
than that which is nearer to a lot line than the required setback, so long as such extension, when
completed, will not violate this Chapter as to usage or type of structure allowed in the district, or as to
setback lines on the sides which were conforming as to setback prior to the extension; provided,
further, that the Board, by special permit in the case of evident hardship, may grant an extension of a

person's dwelling or usual place of abode. Notice by certified mail shall be considered
delivered on the date the envelope is mailed.
At the public hearing before the Planning and Zoning Commission, the applicant shall have an
opportunity to appear and be heard, and present such oral and documentary evidence as
shall be relevant on how the use of the subject property applied for complies with or will be in
compliance with the standards set forth in Subsection (C)(11). Any other persons, including
Commission members, may then have an opportunity to appear and to be heard and present
oral and documentary evidence relevant to the application for the issuance of the conditional
use permit. The Planning and Zoning Commission may limit the number of witnesses who
present evidence that is merely cumulative in nature. The Commission secretary or his
designate shall take minutes of the proceeding.
At a meeting of the Planning and Zoning Commission immediately following the public
hearing unless said meeting is continued as provided below, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall grant the application for issuance of a conditional use permit with whatever
stipulated conditions deemed necessary by a majority of the Commission members in
attendance to carry out the provisions and intent of this Chapter if
The Commission by a majority vote of the members in attendance at a meeting where a
quorum is present decides that all provisions have been met or will be met to obtain the
permit, including the provisions of Subsection (C)(11), and
No person (including the applicant) attending the public hearing objects at the
Commission meeting to the issuance of the permit with whatever stipulated conditions
are proposed to be made part of the permit by the said majority vote of the Planning and
Zoning Commission. Commission members may object to the issuance of the permit only
in their private capacity as citizens and only by signing the document referred to below.
An objection shall be made by an objecting person signing a document prepared by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and available at the meeting indicating objection to the
permit. All persons attending the meeting desiring to object to the issuance of the permit
shall be allowed to sign the document or a copy thereof. Unless said meeting is
continued as provided below, no objection shall be allowed to be made by any person at
a time after the adjournment of the meeting of the Planning and Zoning Commission
where the permit application was considered. If the meeting is continued, an objection
also may be made as provided above at the continued meeting. The Commission, to
permit negotiated compromise with the applicant, objectors and/or the Commission, may
continue the meeting to another date before granting or denying the application for
issuance of a conditional use permit, provided all persons who attend the meeting are
advised by the Commission orally or in writing at that meeting of the time, date and place
of the continued meeting. If no person objects to granting the permit but a majority of the
Commission members in attendance vote that not all provisions have been met to obtain
the permit, the application shall be rejected by the Commission. The applicant may
resubmit an application at a later date for consideration by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, but all application procedures shall be followed for the resubmitted
application before said application may be considered by the Planning and Zoning
Commission another time.
If a signed objection is received by the Planning and Zoning Commission to an application for
issuance of a conditional use permit under the procedure set forth in Subsection (C)(5) or if a
majority of the Commission members in attendance vote to deny the application under the
procedure set forth in Subsection (C)(5), then no conditional use permit may be granted to the
applicant by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The applicant then shall inform the City
Clerk in writing as to which of the following ways the applicant desires to proceed: That the
application is being withdrawn, that the application will be amended and resubmitted to the
Planning and Zoning Commission, or that the application be transferred to the Board of
Adjustment for consideration. If an application is transferred to the Board of Adjustment, the
Planning and Zoning Commission Chairman shall deliver to the City Administrator the

hearing. Notice of the date, time and place of such hearing shall be published once in a paper
of general circulation in the City at least fifteen (15) day prior to the hearing. In addition, the
City Clerk shall, on or before the date of publication of the notice in a paper of general
circulation, deliver written notice of the date, time and place of the hearing to the applicant
and to all owners and occupants of real estate located in full or in part within one hundred
eighty-five (185) feet of any of the boundaries of the subject property. Any mailed notice shall
be delivered to the last known address of the addressee. The written notice shall be delivered
by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by the City Clerk or his designate handing the

At the public hearing before the Board of Adjustment, the applicant shall have an opportunity
to appear and be heard, and present such oral and documentary evidence as shall be
relevant on how the use of the subject property applied for complies with or will be in
compliance with the standards set forth in Subsection (C)(11). Any other interested persons,
including Board members, may then have an opportunity to appear and to be heard and
present oral and documentary evidence relevant to the application for the issuance of the
conditional use permit. The Board may limit the number of witnesses who present evidence
that is merely cumulative in nature. The applicant and the Board shall have the right to crossexamine
any person presenting evidence. All documentary evidence shall be numbered
consecutively as exhibits. All testimony, objections thereto and rulings thereon shall be taken
down by a reporter employed by the Board of Adjustment for that purpose, who shall receive
reasonable compensation for such from the City. Transcripts shall be furnished in accordance
with the provisions of Section 31-60. A certified copy of the applicable zoning ordinances shall
be placed in evidence at the public hearing by the Board of Adjustment. The application and
all material submitted with the application shall be placed in evidence at the public hearing by
the applicant, as exhibits.
At a meeting of the Board of Adjustment on the same day of the public hearing before the

and as part of that decision, shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of
the decision made. No findings of fact, conclusion of law or decision may be made except as
based on evidence presented at the public hearing before the Board. The findings of fact and
conclusions of law shall address each standard set forth in Subsection (C)(11) and, if the
application for issuance is approved, each condition imposed as part of the conditional use
permit.
The Planning and Zoning Commission or the Board of Adjustment shall grant or deny an
application for issuance of a conditional use permit and may grant a conditional use permit
with stipulated conditions deemed necessary to carry out the provisions and intent of this
Chapter, after giving due consideration and regard to the following standards:
The proposed conditional use is in compliance with all provisions of the applicable zoning
district.
The proposed conditional use will be in conformance with the character of the adjacent
area within the same zoning district in which it is located. In making such a determination,
consideration may be given to the location, type and height of buildings or structures and
the type and extent of landscaping and screening on the site.
Off-street parking and loading areas, if applicable, are provided in accordance with the
applicable standards set forth in the Sections that are in Article XIV of this Chapter.
Adequate utilities, drainage, and other such facilities are provided.
Adequate access is provided and is designed to prevent traffic hazards and minimize
traffic congestion.
The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the conditional use will not be
detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare.
The conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the
adjacent area for the purposes already permitted nor substantially diminish and impair
property values within the adjacent area.
The establishment of the conditional use will not impede the normal and orderly
development and improvement of property in the adjacent area for uses permitted in the
applicable zoning district.
Duty to Comply with Other Laws. Approval and issuance of such permit shall not be deemed to
relieve the permit holder of the duty to comply with the provisions of other laws and ordinances.
Violation. The violation of any condition imposed by the conditional use permit shall constitute a
violation of this Chapter.
Tenure of Permits. The granting of a conditional use permit is to allow that use of the specific site.
If the use (including conditions ordered by either the Planning and Zoning Commission or the
Board of Adjustment) is not substantially altered, it shall be allowed on the site regardless of
ownership. A conditional use permit may not be transferred to any other site.
Amendment. Amendment or addition to any conditional use permit is subject to the same
procedures as those which apply to a new application. Minor adjustments to an approved
conditional use permit may be authorized by the City Administrator at his discretion, provided that
such adjustments are consistent with the above standards in Subsection (C)(11).

Section 31-66. Purpose.
[Ord. No. 2924, 10-16-2017]
Statement Of Purpose. The general purpose of this Article is to regulate the placement,
construction and modification of telecommunications Towers, Support Structures, and Antennas in
order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, while at the same time not
unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless telecommunications
marketplace in the City of Centralia. Specifically, this Article is intended to:
Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities and
systems to serve the citizens and businesses of the City of Centralia;
Minimize adverse visual impacts of Wireless Communications Facilities through careful
design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques;
Maximize the use of existing and Support Structures so as to minimize the need to construct
new or additional facilities;
Facilitate the addition of the least visible new Support Structures capable of achieving these
objectives;
Ensure that any new Support Structure is located in an area compatible with the
neighborhood or surrounding community to the extent possible; and
Ensure that regulation of Wireless Communications Facilities does not have the effect of
prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and does not unreasonably
discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service.
Applicability. Notwithstanding any ordinance to the contrary, the procedures set forth in this
Section shall be applicable to all Wireless Communications Facilities existing or installed, built or
modified after the effective date of this Article to the fullest extent permitted by law.

primary use in the district in which the use is proposed.
Building Codes, Safety Standards And Zoning Compliance. Wireless Communications
Facilities shall be constructed and maintained in compliance with all standards contained in
applicable State and local building codes. A certified engineer's structural report shall be
required with each application, unless waived upon application to the Director stating why
such report is unnecessary to the specific application and a determination in the discretion of
the Director approving such statement. In addition to any other approvals required by this
Article, no Wireless Communication Facility or portion thereof shall be erected, replaced, or
expanded prior to receipt of a Certificate of Zoning Compliance and the issuance of a Building
Permit. For all sites located within a Historic Preservation District, a Certificate of
Appropriateness shall also be required.
Regulatory Compliance. All Wireless Communications Facilities shall meet or exceed current
standards and regulations of the FAA, FCC and any other local, State or Federal agency with
the authority to regulate Wireless Communications Facilities, and including all required

standards or regulations be amended, then the owner shall bring such devices and structure
into compliance with the revised standards or regulations within the time period mandated by
the controlling agency. No approval for any placement, construction or modification of any
Wireless Communications Facilities permitted by this Article shall be granted for any Applicant
having an uncured violation of this Article, any zoning regulation regarding the lot on which
the structure is proposed, or any other governmental regulatory, licensing, or tax requirement
applicable to such Antenna or structures within the City.
Security. All Wireless Communications Facilities shall be protected from unauthorized access
by appropriate security measures. A description of proposed security measures shall be
provided as part of any application to install, build or modify Wireless Communications
Facilities. Additional measures may be required as a condition of the issuance of a Building
Permit or Administrative Permit as deemed necessary by the Director or by the Board of
Aldermen for a Conditional Use Permit.
Lighting. Antennas and Support Structures shall not be lighted unless required by the FAA or
other State or Federal agency with authority to regulate, in which case a description of the
required lighting scheme will be made a part of the application to install, build or modify the

Support Structure. Exposed Antennas on "crows nest" or other visible platforms or
extensions are prohibited.
Height. Support Structures shall be no taller than necessary and shall not exceed the
height limitation of any airport overlay zone as may be adopted by the City or other
regulatory agency. Support Structures may exceed underlying zoning district height
restrictions for buildings and structures only where shown to be necessary, provided that
no reasonable alternative exists. District height restrictions shall be considered by the
City in determining the appropriateness of the design and location of the application
under the applicable standards for approval.
Monopole Design. All Towers shall be of a monopole design. Lattice, guyed towers or
other non-monopole Tower designs shall not be permitted.
Compound Walls/Landscaping. All Towers shall be surrounded by a minimum of six-foot
high decorative wall constructed of brick, stone or comparable masonry materials and a
landscape strip of not less than ten (10) feet in width and planted with materials, which
will provide a visual barrier to a minimum height of six (6) feet. The landscape strip shall
be exterior to any security wall. In lieu of the required wall and landscape strip, an
alternative means of screening may be approved by the Director, or by the Board of
Aldermen, upon demonstration by the Applicant that an equivalent degree of visual
screening will be achieved. Landscaping or other improvements may be required for
Disguised Support Structures if needed to implement an approved disguise.
Setbacks. All Support Structures, and related structures, fences and walls shall be
separated from the property line of any adjacent property zoned for a residential use at
least a distance equal to the height of the Support Structure, and shall be separated from
all building setback lines by at least a distance equal to one-half (1/2) of the height of the
Support Structure.
Storage. Vehicle or outdoor storage on any Support Structure site is prohibited, unless
otherwise permitted by the zoning.

Section 31-71. Authorization By Administrative Permit.
[Ord. No. 2924, 10-16-2017]
The placement of Wireless Communications Facilities is permitted in all zoning districts by
Administrative Permit approved by the Director only as follows:
The attachment of additional or replacement Antennas, equipment, Cabinets or Shelters to
any non-conforming Support Structure existing on the effective date of this Article or
subsequently approved in accordance with these regulations and not satisfying the
requirements for such attachment pursuant to Section 31-70 as a permitted use as long as
the Applicant provides documentation from which the Director has reasonably determined that
the application will bring the Support Structure (including ground equipment and site) into
conformance with this Article to the maximum extent feasible and further provided that the
proposal does not cause a Substantial Modification to the height of the Support Structure or to
the exterior equipment compound area. A "non-conforming Support Structure" shall be any
Support Structure or associated site or equipment that does not comply with all of the
requirements of this Article, including but not limited to the General Requirements herein and
the requirements of the underlying zoning district.
The one-time replacement of any Tower existing on the effective date of this Article or
subsequently approved in accordance with these regulations so long as the purpose of the
replacement is to accommodate shared use of the site or to eliminate a safety hazard and the
new structure otherwise complies with this Article. The new Tower shall be of the same type
as the original except that a guyed or self-supporting (lattice) tower shall be replaced by a
monopole. The height of the new monopole Tower may exceed that of the original to the
extent the additional height would not be considered a Substantial Modification to the original
tower. Subsequent replacements or replacements requiring what would be a Substantial
Modification to the existing tower shall require the approval of a Conditional Use Permit.
The construction of a Disguised Support Structure provided that all related equipment shall be
placed underground or concealed within the structure or associated buildings consistent with
the disguise when the structure is located in any district other than a district authorizing
industrial uses as a permitted use. Equipment may be placed in an appropriately concealed
Cabinet if the Disguised Support Structure is incidental to an industrial, commercial,
institutional or other non-residential use.

[Ord. No. 2924, 10-16-2017]
All proposals to install, build or modify Wireless Communications Facilities not permitted by
Section 31-70 (Permitted Uses) or Section 31-71 (Administrative Permit) shall require a
recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission and approval of the conditional use
permit by the Board of Aldermen, subject to the forthcoming limitations.
Applications. Applications for conditional use permits shall be filed on such forms required by
the Director and processed subject to the requirements of and in the manner and time frame
as established for conditional use permits in the Zoning Code and, in addition to such other
requirements, shall be accompanied by one hundred dollars ($100.00), or such other deposit
amount as may be established by the Board of Aldermen. In addition, upon request by the
Director, an Applicant shall deposit with the City such additional amounts reasonably
necessary to reimburse the City for such actual and Direct costs and fees for legal,
engineering or other contractual or other consultant services determined by the City to be
needed in review or action on the application. No application for a Conditional Use Permit
under this Section shall be deemed complete until the Applicant has paid all fees and
deposits required under this Article. Any amount not used by the City shall be refunded to the
Applicant upon written request after a final decision.
Additional Minimum Requirements. No conditional use permit shall be issued unless the
applicant has clearly demonstrated by substantial evidence that placement of Wireless
Communications Facilities pursuant to Section 31-70 (Permitted Uses) or Section 31-71
(Administrative Permits) of this Article is not technologically or economically feasible. The City
may consider current or emerging industry standards and practices, among other information,
in determining feasibility.
Decision And Findings Required. A decision shall be accompanied by substantial evidence
supporting the decision, which shall be made a part of the written record of the meeting at
which a final decision on the application is rendered. Evidence shall be under oath and may
be submitted with the application or thereafter, or presented during the public hearing by the
Applicant or others.
Findings Required. In addition to the determinations or limitations specified herein and by this
Zoning Code for the consideration of Conditional Use Permits, no Conditional Use Permit
shall be approved by the Board of Aldermen unless findings in the affirmative are made that
the following conditions exist:
Applicant has conducted an analysis of available co-location opportunities on existing
wireless towers within the same search ring as defined by the Applicant in its application.
That the design of the Wireless Communications Facilities, including ground layout,
maximally reduces visual degradation and otherwise complies with provisions and intent
of this Article. New Towers shall be of a monopole design.
That the proposal minimizes the number and/or height size, and visibility of Wireless
Communications Facilities that will be required in the area. Where alternate technology or
design exists, or is reasonably available that would satisfy the general need for the
proposal, this factor is ordinarily not satisfied.
That the Applicant has not previously failed to request to locate within one (1) mile of any
existing structures after receiving notice that such structure was being built in the same
area of the new structure defined by the Applicant in its application.
Provided, that if one (1), but not more than one (1), of the previous five (a-d) conditions is not
satisfied, approval may be granted only on a finding of unique circumstances otherwise
necessitating approval to satisfy the purposes of this Article.

Additional Height Limitations. No Tower shall be approved at a height exceeding one hundred fifty
(150) feet AGL unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that such height is required for the
proper function of the applicant's system or that of a public safety communications system of a
governmental entity sharing the Tower. Such showing must also be supported by the opinion of a
telecommunications consultant or expert. The opinion of the consultant or expert shall include a
statement that no available alternatives exist to exceeding the height limit including but not limited
to the use of two (2) or more Support Structures, and the reason why such alternatives are not
viable.
Historic Preservation. A Conditional Use Permit shall not be issued for any Wireless
Communications Facility that the Board of Aldermen determines would create a significant
negative visual impact or otherwise have a significant negative impact on the historical character
and quality of any property within a Historic Preservation District or such District as a whole.
Section 31-73. Obsolete Non-Complying Support Structures.
[Ord. No. 2924, 10-16-2017]
Any upper portion of a Support Structure which is not occupied by active Antennas for a period of
twelve (12) months, and any entire Support Structure which is not so occupied for a period of six (6)
months, shall be removed at the owner's expense. Removal of upper portions of a Support Structure
manufactured as a single unit shall not be required. Failure to comply with this provision shall
constitute a nuisance that may be remedied by the City at the Support Structure or property owner's
expense. Any Applicant for a new Support Structure not built as a disguised part of another existing or
permitted structure shall place a bond or other security with the City prior to any final approval for the
purpose of removing any Support Structure as required herein and to compensate the City for
performing proper maintenance of such Support Structures to ensure such structures do not become
unsafe or otherwise fail to be maintained in compliance with this Article.
Section 31-74. Commercial Operation Of Unlawful Wireless
Communications Facilities.
[Ord. No. 2924, 10-16-2017]
