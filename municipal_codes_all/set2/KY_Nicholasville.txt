act or omission is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or a

(meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the

subdivisions;

sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and

subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate
new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers;



      (4)   Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same
meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case
may be, or to "§§ ________ to ________," inserting section numbers to
indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of
the ordinance incorporated into the Code;



      (5)   Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve
the original meaning of the ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in

ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or

any manner whatsoever, except by ordinance or resolution or other official
act of the city commission, which will cause the law of the city to be
misrepresented thereby.

§ 2-419.  DEFENSE OF CITY OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES RELATIVE TO ACTION IN TORT.



   (a)   Definitions. For purposes of this section the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly requires a different
meaning:



      (1)   Action in tort shall mean any claim for monetary damages
based upon negligence, intentional tort, nuisance, products liability and
strict liability and shall also include any wrongful death or survival-type
action.



      (2)   Officer shall mean any elected official of the City of
Nicholasville.



      (3)   Employee shall mean all full and part-time employees of
the City of Nicholasville, including volunteer firefighters and auxiliary
police officers, if any, but shall not include any independent contractor or
any employee, agent, supplier or subcontractor of any independent contractor.



   (b)   Legal defense provided.  Except as provided in § 2-419(e),
the city shall, without cost to the officer or employee, provide for the
legal defense of any officer or employee in any action in tort arising out of
an act or omission occurring within the scope of the officer's or employee's
employment or public duties with the city.



   (c)   Independent representation.  The city may provide for the
defense of any officer or employee through its own legal counsel or by
employing independent legal counsel or by purchasing insurance which requires
the insurer to defend. If the city defends through its own legal counsel and
its legal counsel determines that the interests of the officer or employee
and the city conflict, the city shall obtain written consent of the employee
for such representation or shall provide independent representation.  An
employee may have his own legal counsel to assist in the defense at the
expense of the employee.



   (d)   Notice of claim; request for defense.  Upon receiving service
of a summons and complaint in any action or tort brought against him, an
officer or employee shall, within ten (10) days of his receipt of service,
give written notice of the claim and make a request that the city provide a
defense to the action.  The notice of claim and request for defense shall be
filed with the mayor.



   (e)   Refusal to provide defense; conditions.  The city may refuse
to provide for the defense of any action in tort brought against an officer
or employee of the city if it determines and notifies the employee in writing
that:



      (1)   The act or omission was not within the actual or
apparent scope of the employee's employment;



      (2)   The employee acted or failed to act because of fraud,
malice or corruption; or



      (3)   A timely request to defend was not made in accordance
with § 2-419(d) of this section.



   (f)   Recovery of defense costs upon city's refusal to defend.  If
the city refuses to provide an officer or employee with a defense and the
officer or employee provides his own defense, the officer or employee shall
be entitled to recover all necessary and reasonable costs of said defense
from the city if the act or omission is judicially determined to have arisen
out of the actual or apparent scope of the employee's employment and the
employee is found to have acted without fraud, malice or corruption.



   (g)   Payment of judgment.  Subject to the limitations set forth in
§ 2-419(h) and (i) below and provided that the city shall not pay any award
of punitive or exemplary damages, the city shall pay any judgment rendered
against an officer or employee in any action in tort, or any compromise or
settlement of such action.



   (h)   Refusal to pay judgment, compromise or settlement;
conditions.  The city may refuse to pay any judgment, compromise or
settlement in any action in tort against an officer or employee, or if the
city pays any judgment, compromise or settlement, it may recover from the
officer or employee the amount of such payment and the costs to defend, if:



      (1)   The officer or employee acted or failed to act because
of fraud, malice or corruption.



      (2)   The action was outside the actual or apparent scope of
the employee's employment;



      (3)   The employee willfully failed or refused to assist the
defense of the action; or



      4)   The employee compromised or settled the claim without the
consent of the legislative body of the city.



   (i)   Approval required for compromise or settlement.  An officer
or employee who is being provided a defense in an action in tort by the city
shall not enter into any compromise or settlement of the action without the
approval of the legislative body of the city.



   (j)   Scope of defense.  Nothing in the section shall be construed
as a waiver of any defense which the city may assert in any action in tort
brought against it of any officer or employee of the city.  Defense by the
city of any action shall not be deemed an admission by the city that the acts
or omissions of the officer or employee which gave rise to the action in tort
were within the actual or apparent scope of the officer or employee's
employment or public duties with the city.

NICHOLASVILLE HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION



Sec. 2-621.  DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND PUBLIC POLICY.



   (a)   The city commission finds that buildings and neighborhoods
having historic, architectural or cultural interest and value have been
neglected, altered or destroyed notwithstanding the feasibility and
desirability of preserving and continuing the use of such buildings and
neighborhoods and without adequate consideration of the irreplaceable loss to
the public.



   (b)   The commission finds that the historic character of
Nicholasville is of vital importance in maintaining the economy of the city
and that its historic buildings and neighborhoods can be preserved, improved
and used by means of appropriate changes.

residential and business districts and that the history of the city is shown
today through buildings representing the activities and events during its
growth. The commission finds that the city has buildings and areas that
represent the persons who live and work or have lived and worked in
Nicholasville during a period of more than one hundred years. It is the
finding of the city commission that the distinctive and significant character
of this city can only be maintained by protecting and enhancing its historic,
architectural and cultural heritage and by preventing unnecessary injury or
destruction of its landmarks and historic districts which are civic and
community assets.



   (d)   The commission finds that the Federal and Kentucky governments
have passed laws to protect and preserve landmarks and historic districts,
that some of these laws provide Incentives for historic preservation, and
that the National Historic Preservation Act was amended in 1980 to establish
a Certified Local Government program creating a new federal-state-local
partnership to encourage the efforts by cities to protect and preserve their
landmarks and historic districts.

required in the interest of the health, prosperity, safety, welfare and
economic well being of the people.

Sec. 2-736.  DEFINITIONS.



   Prior to the development of rules and regulations governing access to
public records, it is important that the relevant terminology be clearly
understood by all.  The following terms, when used in this article, shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context
clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   City means the city government of this city.



   Commercial purpose means the direct or indirect use of any public
record or records, in any form, for sale, resale, solicitation, rent, or
lease of a service, or any use by which the user expects a profit either
through commission, salary, or fee.  Commercial purpose shall not include
publication or related use of a public record by a newspaper or periodical;
use of a public record by a radio or television station in its news or other

prosecution or defense of litigation, or claims settlement by the parties to
such action, or the attorneys representing the parties.



   Custodian means the official custodian or any authorized person having
personal custody and control of public records.  The custodian having
personal custody of most of the public records of this city is the city clerk.

transacted on a machine, and which may include, but is not limited to a

Sec. 2-737.  PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PUBLIC RECORDS.



   The following procedures shall be followed by both persons making a
request to inspect public records of this city and by the official custodian
and/or custodians of those public records:



      (1)   Initial request with immediate inspection.  As defined
in § 2-736 and subject to the limitations set forth in § 2-738, any person
desiring to inspect or copy the public records of this city shall make a
request and/or complete a written application for such records at the office
of the city clerk during regular office hours, which are from 8:00 a.m. to
4:00 p.m. Monday through Friday of each week except during legal holidays. 
The application shall be hand delivered, mailed, or sent via facsimile to the
city clerk's office.  (KRS 61.872(2))



         If the custodian determines that a person's request is in
compliance with the open records law and that the requested records are
immediately available, the custodian shall deliver such records for
inspection. Suitable facilities shall be made available in the office of the
city clerk for the inspection and no person shall remove original copies of
public records from the offices of any public agency without the written
permission of the official custodian of the record.



(KRS 61.872 (1))



      An applicant may inspect public records during the regular
business hours of the city, or by receiving copies of the public records from
the city through the mail if the applicant's residence or principal place of
business is outside of the county in which the city is located and he has
precisely described public records which are available within the city.  If
the person requesting the public records requests that the records be mailed,
the official custodian shall mail the copies upon receipt of all fees and the
cost of mailing.  (KRS 61.872(3))



      The applicant shall have the right to make abstracts of the
public records, and to obtain copies of all public records not exempted by
this chapter.  When copies are requested, the custodian may require a
written request and advance payment of the prescribed fee as defined in §
2-736.  (KRS 61.874(1))



   Cross reference-Definitions and rules of construction generally, § 1-2.



      Nonexempt public records used for noncommercial purposes shall be
available for copying in either standard electronic or standard hard copy
format, as designated by the party requesting the records, where the agency
currently maintains the records in electronic format. Nonexempt public
records used for noncommercial purposes shall be copied in standard hard copy
format where agencies currently maintain records in hard copy format. 
Agencies are not required to convert hard copy format records to electronic
formats.



      The minimum standard format in paper form shall be defined as not
less than 8-1/2 inches x 11 inches in at least one (1) color on white paper,
or for electronic format, in a flat file electronic American Standard Code
for Information Interchange (ASCII) format.  If the public agency maintains
electronic public records in a format other than ASCII, and this format
conforms to the requestor's requirements, the public records may be provided
in this alternate electronic format for standard fees as specified by the
public agency.  Any request for a public record in a form other than the
forms described in this section shall be considered a nonstandardized
request. (KRS 61.874(2)(b))



      Unless an enactment of the General Assembly prohibits the
disclosure of public records to persons who intend to use them for commercial
purposes, if copies of nonexempt public records are requested for commercial
purposes, the public agency may establish a reasonable fee. The public agency
from which copies of nonexempt public records are requested for a commercial
purpose may require a certified statement from the requestor stating the
commercial purpose for which they shall be used, and may require the
requestor to enter into a contract with the agency. The contract shall permit
use of the public records for the stated commercial purpose for a specified
fee.  The fee may be based on the cost to the public agency of media,
mechanical processing and staff required to produce a copy of the public
record or records or the cost to the public agency of the creation purchase,
or the acquisition of the public records.  (KRS 61.874(4))



      It shall be unlawful for a person to obtain a copy of any part of
a public record for a:



         a.   Commercial purpose, without stating the commercial
purpose, if a certified statement from the requestor was required by the
public agency pursuant to this section; or



         b.   Commercial purpose, if the person uses or knowingly
allows the use of the public record for a different commercial purpose; or



         c.   Noncommercial purpose, if the person uses or
knowingly allows the use of the public record for a commercial purpose.  A
newspaper, periodical, radio or television station shall not be held to have
used or knowingly allowed the use of the public record for a commercial
purpose merely because of its publication or broadcast, unless it has also
given its express permission for that commercial use.  (KRS 61.874(5))



      Online access to public records in electronic form, as provided
under this section, may be provided and made available at the discretion of
the public agency.  If a party wishes to access public records by electronic
means and the public agency agrees to provide online access, a public agency
may require that the party enter into a contract, license, or other agreement
with the agency, and may charge fees for these agreements.  Fees shall not
exceed:



         a.   The cost of physical connection to the system and
reasonable cost of computer time access charges;



         b.   If the records are requested for a commercial
purpose, a reasonable fee based on the factors set forth in this section. 
(KRS 61.874(6))



      (2)   Referral to proper custodian.  If the city clerk does
not have custody or control of the public record or records requested, the
city clerk shall so notify the applicant and shall furnish the name and
location of the custodian of the public record, if such facts are known to
him.  (KRS 61.872(4))



      (3)   Public records not immediately available.  If the
public record is in active use, in storage or not otherwise available, the
official custodian shall immediately so notify the applicant and shall
designate a place, time and date, for inspection of the public records, not
to exceed three (3) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays)
from receipt of the application, unless a detailed explanation of the cause
is given for further delay and the place, time and earliest date on which the
public record will be available for inspection and/or duplication. (KRS
61.872(5))



      (4)   Refusal of unreasonable request.  If the application
places an unreasonable burden in producing public records or if the custodian
has reason to believe that repeated requests are intended to disrupt other
essential functions of the public agency, the official custodian may refuse
to permit inspection of the public records or mail copies of public
records.  However, refusal under this section must be sustained by clear and
convincing evidence.  (KRS 61.872(6))



      (5)   Time limitation/denial of inspection.  The official
custodian, upon any request for records made under this chapter, shall

and shall notify in writing the person making the request, within the three
(3) day period, of its decision.  An agency response denying, in whole or in
part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific
exception authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation
of how the exception applies to the record withheld.  The response shall be
issued by the official custodian or under his authority and shall constitute
final agency action.  (KRS 61.880)



      If the requesting party wants the Attorney General to review the
denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he shall proceed under
the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882. Upon the Attorney General's request,
the agency will provide additional documentation.



      If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney
General reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole
or in part, the request for inspection, the agency may institute proceedings
within thirty (30) days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the circuit
court.  In addition, if the attorney general disallows the request or if the
city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney General's
opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in circuit
court, the city shall notify the attorney general of such action.  (KRS
61.880, 61.882)



      (6)   Miscellaneous regulations.  No official of the city

the budget as submitted, at which all interested persons shall be given an
opportunity to be heard, for or against the revenue estimates or any proposed
appropriation therein.



   (e)   Further consideration of budget.  After the conclusion of
such public hearing, the city commission may insert new items or any increase
or decrease the items of the budget, except items in proposed expenditures
fixed by law or prescribed by subsections (1), (2) and (3) of subsection (i)
of § 2-864, but where it shall increase the total proposed expenditures, it
shall also increase the total anticipated revenue at least to equal such
total proposed expenditures.



   (f)   Adoption of budget.  The budget shall be adopted by the
favorable votes of at least a majority of all the members of the city
commission.



   (g)   Date of final adoption; failure to adopt.  The budget shall

§ 2-864.  CONTENTS OF BUDGET MESSAGES; SCOPE AND FORM OF BUDGET.



   (a)   Budget message-Current operations.  The budget message
submitted by the budget officer to the city commission shall be explanatory
of the budget, shall contain an outline of the proposed financial policies
for the fiscal year and shall describe in connection therewith the important
features of the budget plan.  It shall set forth the reasons for salient

   (b)   Budget message-Capital improvement.  As part of the budget
message, with relation to the proposed expenditures for the budget year for
capital projects, stated in the proposed budget, the budget officer shall

revenue from all sources, including grants and loans, and shall be classified
in accordance with the chart of accounts of the city.



   (f)   Anticipated revenues, comparisons with other years.  In
parallel columns, opposite the several items of anticipated revenue, there

during the budget year estimated as accurately as may be.



   (g)   Fund balance.  The fund balance available for appropriation
shall be limited to the amount by which cash is estimated to exceed
liabilities at the beginning of the budget year.  This estimate shall be
reviewed by the budget officer as soon as practical after the end of the
current fiscal year when the actual "fund balance" is determined.  At this
time, the estimates of revenue and authorized appropriations shall be revised
if necessary.



   (h)   Anticipated surplus from municipal utility or other public
service enterprise.  The anticipated revenue and proposed expenditures of
each utility or other public service enterprise owned or operated by the city
shall be stated in a separate section of the budget (each bearing the name of
the utility); and as to each such utility, an anticipated surplus, if legally
available for general purposes and to the extent such surplus is to be used
to support budget operations, shall be stated as an item of revenue in the
budget.



   (i)   Proposed expenditures.  The proposed expenditures shall be
itemized as set out in § 2-863(a) and each item numbered in accordance with

      (1)   Interest, amortization and redemption charges on bonds
outstanding:



      (2)   Other statutory expenditures;

   (j)   Proposed expenditures, comparison with other years.  In
parallel columns, opposite the several items of proposed expenditures, there
shall be placed:



      (1)   The amount of each such item actually expended during
the next preceding fiscal year; and



      (2)   The total of the amount actually expended to the time of
preparing the budget plus the expenditures for the remainder of the current
fiscal year estimated as accurately as may be; and



      (3)   The amount of each item to be appropriated for the
budget year.



   (k)   Budget summary.  At the head of the budget there shall appear
a summary of the budget, which need not be itemized further than by principal
sources of anticipated revenue, stating separately the amount to be raised by
property tax, and by departments and kinds of expenditures, in such a manner
as to present to taxpayers a simple and clear summary of the detailed
estimates of the budget.



(Code 1972, § 2-87)



§ 2-865.  ADMINISTRATION OF BUDGET, FINANCIAL CONTROL.



   (a)   Approval of expenditures.  The chief financial officer shall
have charge of the administration of the financial affairs of the city and to
that end shall supervise and be responsible for the disbursement of all
monies and have control over all expenditures to ensure that appropriations
are not exceeded.  The chief financial officer shall exercise financial
budgetary control over each office, department and agency and shall cause
separate accounts to be kept for the items of appropriation contained in the
budget, each of which account shall show the amount of the appropriation, the
amounts paid therefrom, the unpaid obligations against it and the
unencumbered balance.  The same classification and numbering system used in
the budget and required by § 2-864(i) shall be used. Unless the chief
financial officer shall certify that there is a sufficient unencumbered
balance available, no appropriation shall be encumbered and no expenditure
shall be made.



   (b)   Work programs, allotments.  Before the beginning of the
budget year, the head of each office, department or agency shall submit to
the budget officer, at the time required by him, a work program for the year,
which program shall show the requested allotments of the appropriations for
such office, department or agency, by quarterly periods, for the entire
budget year.  The budget officer shall review the requested allotments in
the light of the work program of the office, department or agency concerned
and may revise, alter or change such allotments before approving the same. 
The aggregate of such allotments shall not exceed the total appropriation
available to said office, department or agency for the budget year.  The
budget officer shall certify a copy of the allotments approved to the chief
financial officer who shall authorize all expenditures for the offices,
departments and agencies to be made from the appropriations on the basis of
approved allotments and not otherwise.  The approved allotment may be
revised during the budget year in the same manner as the original allotment
was made.  If, at any time during the budget year the budget officer shall
ascertain that the available income, plus balances, for the year will be less
than the total appropriations, he shall reconsider the work programs and
allotments of the several offices, departments and agencies and shall revise
the allotments so as to forestall the making of expenditures in excess of the
income.



   (c)   Transfers of appropriations.  The budget officer may at any
time transfer any unencumbered appropriation balance or portion thereof
between general classifications of expenditures within an office, department,
or agency.  At the request of the budget officer, the city commission may by
resolution transfer any unencumbered appropriation balance or portion thereof
from one (1) office, department, or agency to another.  No transfer shall be
made from the appropriations required by § 2-864.



   (d)   When contracts and expenditures prohibited.  No office,
department or agency shall, during any budget year, expend or contract to
expend any money or incur any liability, or enter into any contract which by
its terms involves the expenditure of money for any purpose in excess of the
amounts appropriated for that general classification of expenditures pursuant
to this article.  Any contract, verbal or written, made in violation of this
article shall be null and void.



   (e)   Appropriations lapse at end of year.  All appropriations
shall lapse at the end of the budget year to the extent that they shall not
have been expended or lawfully encumbered.



(Code 1972, § 2-88)



§ 2-866.  EMERGENCY APPROPRIATIONS.



   At any time in any budget, the city commission may, pursuant to this
section, make emergency appropriations to meet a pressing need for public
expenditure, for other than a regular or recurring requirement, to protect
the public health, safety or welfare.  Such appropriation shall be by
resolution adopted by the favorable votes of at least a majority of the
members of the city commission and shall be made only upon recommendation of
the budget officer.  The total amount of all emergency appropriations made
in any budget year shall not exceed the amount of unanticipated actual
revenue in excess of the budget estimates, plus transfers from other
appropriations.



(Code 1972, § 2-89)



§ 2-867.  REPORTS.



   The budget officer shall, within fifteen (15) days after the end of
each quarter, report to the city commission on the status of the various
programs authorized.  The report shall include a tabular statement comparing
the receipts to date by source with the revenue estimate and a tabular
statement indicating for each appropriation the amount originally
appropriated, the amount expended or encumbered to date, and the available
balance.  Within forty-five (45) days of the end of the fiscal year,
sufficient copies of the final report shall be made available for the use of
all offices, departments and agencies, and for the use of interested persons
and civic organizations.



(Code 1972, § 2-90)



DIVISION 3.  PROCUREMENT STANDARDS



§ 2-868.  GENERAL PROVISIONS.



   (a)   All procurements made by the City of Nicholasville that
involve the expenditure of Kentucky Community Development Block Grant Funds
will be made in accordance with the following procurement standards.



   (b)   Procurement transactions, regardless of method or dollar
value, will maximize open and free competition.  The City of Nicholasville
shall not engage in procurement practices which may be considered restrictive
in trade.



   (c)   Purchases will be reviewed by the community development
director to prevent duplication and to ensure that costs are reasonable.



(Ord. No. 226-1997, 8-14-97)



§ 2-869.  METHODS FOR PROCUREMENT.



   Procurement shall be made by one of the following methods: (a) small
purchase procedures, (b) competitive sealed bids, (c) competitive
negotiation, and (d) noncompetitive negotiation.



   (a)   Small purchases.



      (1)   Purchases of supplies, equipment and services which cost
between five hundred dollars ($500.00) and ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00)
will require written estimates, however, no legal advertisement is
required.  The city will solicit written responses from at least three (3)
vendors, and if no such responses are available, a statement explaining the
procurement will be prepared and filed.



      (2)   Purchases which cost between fifty dollars ($50.00) and
five hundred dollars ($500.00) require three (3) over-the-telephone
quotations of rate, price, etc.  A memorandum will be prepared setting forth
the date the calls were made, parties contacted and prices obtained.  For
purchases of less than fifty dollars ($50.00), efforts will be made to get
the lowest and best price, but written records of such efforts are not
necessary.



   (b)   Competitive sealed bids.  Bidding will be employed when
detailed specifications for the goods or services to be procured can be
prepared, and the primary basis for award is cost. When the cost of a
contract, lease or other agreement for materials, supplies, equipment or
contractual services other than those personal or professional, exceeds ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00), an invitation for bids (IFB) notice will
generally be prepared.  This notice will be published at least once in at
least one (1) official newspaper of general circulation within the community.
This newspaper notice will appear not less than seven (7) days and not more
than twenty-one (21) days before the due date for bid proposals.  The city
may also solicit sealed bids from responsible prospective suppliers by
sending them a copy of such notice.



      (1)   The IFB will include a general description of the goods
or services to be procured, the bid deposit and bond performance required (if
applicable), the location where bid forms and specifications may be secured,
the time and place for opening bids, and whether the bid award will be made
on the basis of the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated price.  If the
lowest evaluated price is used, the measurable criteria to be used must be
stated in the IFB.  The newspaper notice must also contain language which
calls to the attention of bidders all applicable requirements (for example: 
Section 3 of the 1968 Housing Act, Section 109 of the 1974 Housing and
Community Development Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order
11246 and the Davis-Bacon Act).



      (2)   Sealed bids will be opened in public at the time and
place stated in the IFB.  The bids will be tabulated by the city at the time
of bid opening.  The results of the tabulation and the bid documents will be
examined for accuracy and completeness by the review committee which will
make recommendations to the city council.  In addition, the committee
determines that all firms are responsive and responsible.  The Nicholasville
city commission will make the decision as to whom the contract shall be
awarded.  After the bid award is made by the city, a contract will be
prepared for execution by the successful bidder.  After the contract is
signed, all bid deposits will be returned to all unsuccessful bidders.



      (3)   The City of Nicholasville may cancel an IFB or reject
all bids if it is determined, in writing, that it is in the best interests of
the city.  The city may allow a vendor to withdraw a bid if requested at any
time prior to the bid opening.  Bids received after the time set for bid
opening shall be returned to the vendor unopened.



   (c)   Competitive negotiations.



      (1)   The city will use competitive negotiations, regardless
of contract amount, upon a written determination that:



         a.   Specifications cannot be made specific enough to
permit the award of a bid on the basis of either the lowest bid price or the
lowest evaluated bid price, in other words, bidding is not feasible.



         b.   The services to be procured are professional or
personal in nature.



      (2)   With the exception of procurement of certain
professional services, principally engineering services, competitive
negotiations will proceed as follows:



         a.   Proposals will be solicited through newspaper
advertisement; additionally, a request for proposal (RFP) may be prepared and
mailed to qualified vendors. The newspaper advertisement must be published at
least seven (7) days and not more than twenty-one (21) days before the date
for receipt of the proposals.  The RFP will describe services needed and
identify the factors to be considered in the evaluation of proposals and the
relative weights assigned to each selection factor.  The RFP will also state
where further details regarding the RFP may be obtained.  The RFP will call
attention to the same regulations discussed in the bidding process.  The RFP
will always include cost as a selection factor. 



         b.   Award must be made to the offerer whose proposal is
determined in writing by a review committee to be the most advantageous to
the city.  Evaluations must be based on the factors set forth in the RFP and
a written evaluation of each response prepared.  The review committee may
contact the firms regarding their proposals for the purpose of clarification
and record in writing the nature of the clarification.  If it is determined
that no acceptable proposal has been submitted, all proposals may be
rejected.  New proposals may be solicited on the same or revised terms or
the procurement may be abandoned.



         c.   For the procurement of certain professional
services, an alternative to RFPs may be used.



      (3)   The city may publish a request for qualifications
(RFQ).  RFQs are handled in a similar method to RFPs with the exception that
cost is not a factor in the initial evaluation.  A review committee will
evaluate the responses and rank them by at least three (3) comparative
qualifications.  The highest scoring person or firm will be contacted and
the selection committee will negotiate cost.  If the committee is unable to
negotiate a satisfactory cost arrangement, the second-highest scoring person
or firm will be invited to negotiate.  The committee will maintain a written
record of all such negotiations.



   (d)   Noncompetitive negotiations.



      (1)   Noncompetitive negotiations may be used for procurements
in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) when bidding or competitive
negotiations are not feasible.  The City of Nicholasville may purchase goods
and services through noncompetitive negotiations when it is determined, in
writing by the city, that competitive negotiation or bidding is not feasible
and that:



         a.   An emergency exists that will cause public harm as
a result of the delay caused by following competitive purchasing procedures;



         b.   The product or service can be obtained only from
one source;



         c.   The contract is for the purchase of perishable
items purchased on a weekly or more frequent basis;



         d.   Only one (1) satisfactory proposal is received
through RFP or RFQ; or



         e.   The state has authorized the particular type of
noncompetitive negotiation (for example – the procurement of services by an
Area Development District).



      (2)   Procurement by noncompetitive negotiation requires that
impartiality towards all suppliers be strictly observed.  The DLG office of
community development must approve all procurement by noncompetitive
negotiation when only one supplier is involved or only one bid or response to
an RFP/RFQ is received.



(Ord. No. 226-1997, 8-14-97)



§ 2-870.  CONTRACTS.



   Generally, all procurement in excess of five hundred dollars ($500.00)
will be memorialized and supported by a written contract.  Where it is not
feasible or impractical to prepare a contract, a written finding to this
effect will be prepared, and some form of documentation regarding the
transaction will be prepared.  The contractual provisions required by the
“Common Rule”, 24 CFR Part 85 (Part 84 for Nonprofits) will be included
in all contracts.



(Ord. No. 226-1997, 8-14-97)



§ 2-871.  DOCUMENTATION.



   All source documents supporting any given transaction (receipts,
purchase orders, invoices, RFP/RFQ data, and bid materials) will be retained
and filed in an appropriate manner. Where feasible, source documents
pertinent to each individual procurement shall be filed separately and
maintained.  Where it is not feasible to maintain individual procurement
files, source documents will be filed and maintained in a reasonable manner
(examples include: chronologically, by vendor, by type of procurement,
etc.).  Whatever form of documentation and filing is employed, the purpose
of this section is to ensure that a clear and consistent audit trail is
established.  At a minimum, source document data must be sufficient to
establish the basis for selection, basis for cost (including the issue of
reasonableness of cost) and basis for payment.



(Ord. No. 226-1997, 8-14-97)



§ 2-872.  LOCALLY-OWNED, MINORITY-OWNED, WOMEN-OWNED AND SMALL BUSINESSES.



   Efforts will be made and documented to solicit participation of
locally-owned, women-owned and small businesses.  Where feasible, evaluation
criteria will include a factor with an appropriate weight for these firms. 
A list of locally-owned, minority-owned, women-owned and minority-owned small
businesses located within the trade region shall be maintained and utilized
when issuing IFBs, RFPs and RFQs.  This list shall also be consulted when
making small purchases.



(Ord. No. 226-1997, 8-14-97)



§ 2-873.  CODE OF CONDUCT.



   (a)   Conflict of interest.  No elected official, employee or
designated agent of the city will take part or have an interest in the award
of any procurement transaction if a conflict of interest, real or apparent,
exists.  A conflict of interest occurs when the official, employee or
designated agent of the city, partners of such individuals, immediate family
member, or an organization which employs or intends to employ any of the
above has a financial or other interest in any of the competing firms.



   (b)   Acceptance of gratuities.  No elected official, employee or
designated agent of the city shall solicit or accept gratuities, favors or
anything of monetary value from contractors, potential contractors,
subcontractors or potential subcontractors.



   (c)   Penalties.



      (1)   Any elected official, employee or designated agent of
the city who knowingly and deliberately violates the provisions of this code
will be open to civil suit.  Such a violation of these procurement standards
is grounds for dismissal by the city.



      (2)   Any contractor or potential contractor who knowingly and
deliberately violates the provisions of these procurement standards will be
barred from future transactions with the city.

stone. The glass unit is placed into the channel and wedged into place using
lead.



      (4)   All units must have a protective covering of laminated

      (5)   Each unit must have an endowment equal to 25% of the
value of the artglass unit or $1,500.00 whichever is greater. The income

   (e)   Monuments and markers.



      (1)   Only one (1) central memorial can be placed on any
family lot. The cemetery management determines the location of all memorials.



      (2)   Depending upon the location of the lot in the cemetery
markers shall range from flush markers to a height not to exceed one (1) foot
above the grade of the lot. Any lot of less than six (6) graves in size must
use flush foot markers. Markers shall be of one (1) piece only. The minimum
size of any marker shall be two (2) feet in length and one (1) foot in width.
Double flush markers must be at least four (4) inches in thickness.
Exceptions to these sizes will be made in the instance of existing markers
and of the duplication of such markers on a family lot.



      (3)   Only one (1) marker is permitted per grave space. If
more than one interment is made in a grave space all the inscriptions must be
placed on the one marker.



      (4)   All flush markers must be delivered to the cemetery
service area on or before the 15th of the month in which its setting is to
occur. This permits the setting of the marker as soon as possible after the
marker’s foundation has been poured. This eliminates the possibility of
someone being injured by stepping into a flush marker foundation.



      (5)   The bottom surface of every base and marker shall be
dressed to an even level bed so that it will stand plumb. This allows the
marker or base to rest firmly and level on the foundation. All joints on
memorials shall be sealed against moisture with non-staining material.



      (6)   All open urns incorporated in the design of a memorial
must have a drain that extends down throughout the die and the base and must

surface of the glass, except where matching an existing ledger.

ground must be constructed only on lots approved for that purpose. Mausoleums
must be built of material fulfilling the requirements prescribed for other
memorials. All mausoleums must be designed with air vents and have drains,
which empty into dry wells. The plans, specifications and location of any
mausoleum are subject to approval of the cemetery management.



      (2)   An endowment, created for the future care of all
mausoleums, is required. This must be paid to the Maple Grove Cemetery Trust
before the installation of the mausoleum in the cemetery. This endowment is
to be made in the amount of 10% of the sum price of the mausoleum, foundation
and lot, the minimum being $2,000.00.



   (g)   Miscellaneous.



      (1)   No lot owner shall install, place or cause to be
installed on any lots in the cemetery any memorial, which the cemetery
management disapproves.



      (2)   Except upon written permission of the owner,
photographing, making details measurements and drawings of memorials for the
purpose of duplication is forbidden.



      (3)   While the cemetery and its personnel will exercise all
possible care to protect all monuments, markers and structures, as well as
raised lettering, carving and ornamentation, it disclaims responsibility for
any damage thereto. The cemetery disclaims any responsibility for any damage
caused to memorials by an "act of God" or vandalism. The cemetery may accept
responsibility when it is in management's judgement that a monument was
damaged due to personnel negligence.



      (4)   The board of commissioners reserves the right to exclude
or remove from any lot, any memorial or other structure which is determined
by them to be offensive, improper or injurious to the surrounding lots or
grounds. The cemetery management reserves the right to remove any memorial or
structure that has become dilapidated or unsightly.



      (5)   Cemetery management retains authority to reject any plan
or design for a memorial, which, in the opinion of the cemetery, because of
size, inscriptions, kind of quality of stone or material is unsuited to the
lot, where it is to be placed.



      (6)   Special care may arise in which the literal enforcement
of a rule may impose unnecessary hardship. The cemetery, therefore, reserves
the right, without notice, to make exceptions, suspensions or modifications
in any of these rules and regulations. Any such temporary exception,
suspension or modification shall in no way be construed as affecting the
general application of such rules.



      (7)   The cemetery may, and it hereby expressly reserves the
right at any time or times, to adopt new rules and regulations. It reserves
the right to amend, alter or repeal any rules, regulations, articles,
sections, paragraphs or sentence in these requirements.



      (8)   There shall be no burials in Maple Grove Cemetery on

      (12)   Operation times of Maple Grove Cemetery are 7:30 a.m.

   (h)   Rules and regulations.  The term "memorial", as used in these
rules, regulations and specifications, can include monument, mausoleum,
tombs, and markers in whole or in part. The term cemetery and Maple Grove
Cemetery are used interchangeably.



      (1)   No person shall place ornamental shrubbery or trees
around tombstones that exist on any grave as those plants will eventually
intrude into the gravesites and cause problems.



      (2)   There shall not be any open fires, candles, lanterns or
incendiary devices permitted or used in the Maple Grove Cemetery.

      (1)   Temporary licenses.  A special temporary distilled
spirits and wine license or a special temporary wine license may be issued
only as set out in KRS 243.260.  This license shall authorize the licensee
to exercise the privileges of the license for a specified and limited time,

holding a retail malt beverage license, such organization may be issued a
distilled spirits and wine special temporary license or a special temporary

premises, in conjunction with any public or private event, for a specified
and limited time, not to exceed ten (10) days.  A malt beverage temporary

privileges of the license shall be exercised only on premises where the
general public is excluded.



      (3)   All restrictions and prohibitions applying to regular
retail drink distilled spirits and wine licenses and retail malt beverage
licenses shall apply to the special licenses, unless otherwise provided by
law.



(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)



Sec. 3-13.  Expiration of license; proration of fees.



   (a)   For licenses issued on or before January 1, 2017, all city
licenses, except temporary licenses, shall begin on July 1 of any year and
shall expire on June 30 of the following year.  Any licenses issued after
December 31 of any year shall be assessed a fee which is based on the pro
rata portion of the remainder of the license period; however, the cost of any
license shall not be less than one-half (½) the amount of the full fee for
an annual license of that type.



   (b)   For licenses issued after January 1, 2017:



      (1)   All city licenses, except for those listed in divisions
(b) and (c) of this section shall be valid for a period of no more than a
year and shall be renewable upon the date established by the Kentucky
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control for the expiration of state licenses
issued for the premises located in the city. During the first year following
July 15, 2016, if the new date for renewal for the licenses does not occur on
the date established by the department for the expiration of the licensee’s
state license, the city administrator shall either:



         a.   Prorate the cost of the renewed license by
proportionally reducing the cost of the renewed license if the new date for
the renewal occurs prior to the expiration of the previous license; or



         b.   Provide a prorated provisional local license to
cover any period of time between the expiration of the previous license and
the new date for renewal if the new date for renewal occurs after the
expiration of the licensee’s previous license.



      (2)   Division (1) of this section shall not apply to special
event licenses, temporary licenses or licenses listed in division (3) of this
section.



      (3)   All alcoholic beverage producers, wholesalers, or
distributor s obtain or renew their licenses for licenses for either a one or
a two year term.



      (4)   When any person applies for a new license, he or she
shall be charged, if the license is issued, the full fee for the respective
license if six months or more remain before the license is due to be renewed
and one-half the fee if less than six months remain before the license is due
to be renewed. No abatement of license fees shall be permitted to any person
who held a license of the same kind for the same premises in the preceding
license period and who was actually doing business under the license during
the last month of the preceding license period.



(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13; Ord. No. 967-2016, passed 12-5-16)



Sec. 3-14.  Payment of license fees; delinquency.



   No licensee shall enter into or begin operating any business for which
a license is required by this chapter until the license fee has been paid in
full.  The fee for renewal of any license shall be paid with the renewal
application.  Failure to pay any license fee within ten (10) days after it
becomes due shall result in a penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the
license fee.  Any licensee failing to pay the fees, including penalties,
within ten (10) days after such fees are due may be subject to revocation of
the license and to other penalties as provided in this chapter.



(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)



Sec. 3-15.  Refund of fees.



      (1)   Should any licensee under this chapter be prohibited
from conducting the licensed business for the full period covered by the
license because of any changes that may hereafter be made in the laws of the
state with reference to alcoholic beverages or other cause outside licensee's
control, then the city shall refund to licensee the proportionate part of the
license fee for the period during which licensee is prevented from carrying
on said business if the licensee provides sufficient proof to the city ABC
administrator that such period of inactivity was not the fault of the
licensee or the result of a revocation, suspension or other wrongdoing by
licensee, or an agent or employee of the licensee.



      (2)   In the event a violation of this chapter occurs that
results in the suspension or revocation of the license, the city shall not
refund any portion of the license fee.



(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)



Sec. 3-16.  Regulatory license fee.



      (1)   Pursuant to KRS 243.075, there is hereby imposed a
regulatory license fee on the gross receipts of sale of alcoholic beverages
of each license issued by the city ABC administrator.  As of the time of
adoption of this chapter, the regulatory license fee shall be five percent
(5%) of gross sales of all alcoholic beverages sold by the drink.  In the
case of retail sales of package distilled spirits and wine, the regulatory
license fee shall be five percent (5%) of gross sales.  The regulatory
license fee shall be five percent (5%) on gross retail sales of package malt
beverages.  Thereafter, the city commission may adopt at the budget adoption
for each subsequent fiscal year, such annual rate for the regulatory license
fee as shall be reasonably estimated to ensure full reimbursement to the city
for the cost of any additional policing, regulatory, or administrative
expense related to the sale of alcoholic beverages in the city.  Should the
city fail to address the regulatory license fee in any budget, then the
regulatory license fee shall remain at the level at which it was last fixed
until such time as the city commission shall adjust the fee.



      (2)   Payment of said regulatory fee shall be remitted to the
city ABC administrator, who shall transmit all fees to the city clerk, or his
or her designee, for deposit into the appropriate designated account.  The
city may use said fees as permitted by law, including but not limited to, any
cost of additional policing, regulatory or administrative expenses related to
the sale of alcoholic beverages in the city.  The regulatory license fee
shall be in addition to any other fees or licenses permitted by law, except
that a credit against a regulatory license fee in the city shall be allowed
in an amount equal to any license fee imposed by the city pursuant to the
fees outlined herein.  Payment of the regulatory license fee shall be based
on paperwork required by the local and/or state ABC administrator, which may
include but is not limited to tax returns and financial statements.  Said
paperwork and payment will be due according to the schedule set forth by the
mayor, or his designee.



      (3)   Failure to pay such remittance within ten (10) days of
the due date constitutes a violation and subjects licensee to suspension or
revocation.



      (4)   Penalty for failure to file a return and pay remittance
by the due date is five percent (5%) of the regulatory fee for each ninety
(90) days or fraction thereof.  The total late filing penalty shall not
exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the regulatory fee; provided, however,
that in no case shall the penalty be less than ten dollars ($10.00).



      (5)   Any payment made after the first of the month shall bear
interest at the rate of one-half of one percent (0.5%) for each month or
fraction of a month until paid.

Sec. 3-17.  Disposition of fees and any other type of payment to the city.



   The city ABC administrator shall transmit all fees and any other types
of payment made to the city, upon collection, to the city clerk, or his or
her designee, for deposit into the appropriate designated account.

   Before an application for a license shall be considered, the applicant
must publish a notice of its intent to apply for an alcoholic beverage
license in a newspaper meeting the requirements of KRS Ch. 424, including the
following:



   (a)   The advertisement shall state the name and address of the
applicant.  It shall state the members of the partnership if the applicant
is a partnership and membership of the LLC, if the applicant is an LLC, as
well as the name of the business and its address.  If the applicant is a
corporation, the advertisement shall state the names and addresses of the
principal officers and directors of the corporation, as well as the name and
address of the corporation itself.  All advertisements shall state the
location of the premises for which the license is sought, and the type of
license for which application is made.



   (b)   The applicant shall attach to the application a newspaper
clipping of the advertisement and proof of the publication as provided in KRS
424.170.



(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)



Sec. 3-32.  Form of application.



   (a)   All licenses granted under this chapter shall be approved by
the city ABC administrator.  Applications for the issuance of new licenses
and for renewals of existing licenses shall be in writing and upon the forms
provided by the Kentucky ABC Board and/or the city, both of which may be
amended and supplemented from time to time by each respective agency.



   (b)   The application shall be verified and shall set forth in
detail such information concerning the applicant and the premises for which
the license is sought, as required by the Kentucky Revised Statutes, the
state ABC Board, and the city, including as follows:



      (1)   Name and address;



      (2)   Nature of interest;



      (3)   Whether or not a citizen of the United States;



      (4)   Date of birth;



      (5)   Date residence was established in the state, if a
resident of the state.  If city resident, indicate when residence was
established;



      (6)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any other
license or LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization
holding a license under this chapter;



      (7)   Extent of stock or company ownership;



      (8)   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license
or LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a
license in any other state or province.



   (c)   Each application shall be accompanied by a certified check,
cashier check, or money order for the amount of the license fee, less the
fifty dollars ($50.00) application fee.



   (d)   In addition to the above specified information, the applicant
shall file, with the application, responses to any additional questions as
may be posed or prescribed by the city ABC administrator.  The city
commission has adopted a statement of guidelines and priorities for the
issuance of licenses within this chapter to determine the extent to which
applications may further, or impede, the objectives of those guidelines. 
Therefore, in addition to the information contained in the application, the
city ABC administrator may require such other information as the
administrator may, in his or her discretion, deem desirable, reasonable, or
appropriate to the consideration of the application.



(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)



Sec. 3-33.  Other conditions.



   In addition to any other inquiries, conditions or considerations
required or permitted by law:



   (a)   The city ABC administrator shall not grant any alcoholic
beverage license or approve a renewal of a license until the applicant and
his or her place of business shall have been approved by the city building
inspector, and any and all other inspections required by the Kentucky
Building Code or other applicable law;



   (b)   All applicants shall voluntarily submit to a criminal
background check and shall sign a waiver allowing the release of this
information to the city ABC administrator; and



   (c)   No license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages may be granted
or renewed to any person who is delinquent in the payment of any property
taxes, both real and personal, due to the city, fees of any type, or charges
due to any department of the city at the time of issuing the license, nor may
any license be transferred, granted or renewed to sell upon any premises or
property, owned and occupied by the licensee upon which there are any of the
above delinquent payments due and owing to the city.  Further, if a licensee
becomes delinquent in the payment of any of the above at any time during the
license period, the license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages may be
subject to revocation or suspension.



   (d)   No person, whether an applicant for license, or a licensee,
shall in any manner attempt to bribe, threaten, unduly influence or
intimidate the city ABC administrator, or any member the city's staff, or any
state ABC administrator or staff, in any matter in which an application or
proposed application for license, or procedure for revocation or suspension
is pending before such officer.  This division is not intended to stifle
expressions of opinion; however, it is intended to make clear that the ABC
administrators are public officials charged with the administration and
enforcement of the law, both local and state.  Any person applying for a
license, or contesting the revocation or suspension of a license, who engages
in attempted bribes, threats, attempted undue influence or intimidation of a
city or state ABC administrator or staff shall be disqualified from receiving
or retaining a license, in addition to other penalties as provided by law. 
The procedures for appeals shall apply to disqualifications, revocations or
suspensions under this chapter.  Nothing in this chapter shall be
interpreted to prohibit monetary settlements in lieu of revocation or
suspension of license after a final order or revocation or suspension, where
the chapter and applicable statutes allow for such payments in settlement.



(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13; Ord. No. 967-2016, passed 12-5-16)



Sec. 3-34.  Form of license.



   All city licenses shall be in such form as may be provided by the ABC
administrator, but at the least per state law shall contain:



   (a)   The name and address of the licensee;



   (b)   The number of the license;



   (c)   The type of license;



   (d)   A description by street and number, or otherwise, of the
licensed premises;



   (e)   The name and address of the owner of the building in which the
licensed premises are located;



   (f)   The expiration date of the license;



   (g)   A statement in substance that the license shall not be a
property or vested right and that it may be revoked at any time pursuant to
law.



(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)



Sec. 3-35.  Change of information.



   (a)   If after a license to individuals or to a sole proprietor has
been issued, there is a change in any fact required to be set forth in the
application, a verified amendment in writing giving notice of the change
shall be filed with the city ABC administrator within ten (10) days of the
change.



   (b)   Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name
of corporations or other business organizations, it is necessary that
ownership changes in such organizations be reported to the city ABC
administrator.  The city ABC administrator can, therefore, investigate the
person to whom the ownership or management is transferred in order to
ascertain whether that person is precluded by statute from holding an
interest in an alcoholic beverage license.



      (1)   As used with regard to a partnership, corporation, LLC
or other business organization herein, the word "change" is construed to
include any change in managers, partners or LLC members, directors or
officers of the corporation, or change in ownership or stock whereby any
person secures ten percent (10%) of the outstanding ownership or stock. 
Transfer of more than ten percent (10%) of the total ownership or stock shall
require a new license.



      (2)   The following information shall be required concerning
any new manager, partner or LLC member, new director, officer, or person
securing any interest in alcoholic beverage license:



         a.   Name and address;



         b.   Nature of interest;



         c.   Whether or not a citizen of the United States;



         d.   Date of birth;



         e.   Date residence was established in the state, if a
resident of the state.  If a city resident, indicate when residence was
established;



         f.   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any
other license or in any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business
organization holding a license under this act;



         g.   Extent of stock or company ownership;



         h.   Whether or not he or she has any interest in any
license or in any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business
organization holding a license in any other state or province.



      (3)   This information shall be filed with the city ABC
administrator as a verified amendment of the application pursuant to which
the license was granted.  Filing shall be made within ten (10) days of any
change of required information.



(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)



Sec. 3-36.  Renewal of license.



   (a)   Every year, except in the case of temporary licenses, each
licensee shall renew its license.  All renewal licenses must be on file with
the city ABC administrator no less than thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration of the license for the preceding license period or the same shall
be canceled, except where the licensee is unable to continue in business at
the same premises licensed during the preceding license period as a result of
construction, act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition or threatened
acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental
agency or private organization possessing power of eminent domain, whether
such acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through
failure of landlord to renew existing lease; provided that said licensee
shall file a written verified statement no less than twenty (20) days from
the expiration date of the license, setting forth these facts, and the city
ABC administrator is hereby authorized to extend the time for filing of a
renewal of such license for a reasonable length of time within the sound
discretion of the city ABC administrator; provided, however, such licensee
shall pay a license fee from the expiration date of the former license or
licenses.  Said license fee shall not be payable until application is made
for the transfer of said license to a new location.



   (b)   The renewal by the city ABC administrator of the license shall
not be construed to be a waiver or acceptance of any violation which occurred
prior to such renewal and shall not prevent subsequent proceedings against
the licensee.



(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)



Sec. 3-37.  Lost or destroyed license.



   When a license shall be lost or destroyed without fault on the part of
the licensee or his or her agent or employee, a duplicate in lieu of the
original license shall be issued by the city ABC administrator after the
administrator shall have been satisfied as to the facts; provided, however,
that the applicant for said duplicate license shall pay a fee of ten dollars
($10.00) for the duplicate license.



(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)



Sec. 3-38.  Revocation or suspension.



   (a)   Any license may be revoked or suspended by the city ABC
administrator if the licensee shall have violated any of the provisions of
KRS Ch. 241 through 244, or any rule or regulation of the ABC Board, or of
the Kentucky Department of Revenue, relating to the regulation of the
manufacture, sale, and transportation, or taxation, of alcoholic beverages or
if such licensee shall have violated or shall violate any act of Congress or
any rule or regulation of any federal board, agency or commission, or this
chapter now, heretofore, or hereafter in effect relating to the regulation of
the manufacture, sale, and transportation, or taxation, of intoxicating
liquors, or any rules or regulations of the city heretofore in existence or
authorized by the terms of KRS Ch. 241 through 244 to be created,
irrespective of whether the licensee knew of or permitted the violation or
whether the violation was committed in disobedience of his or her
instructions, or any such license may be revoked or suspended for any cause
which the city ABC administrator in the exercise of his or her sound
discretion deems sufficient.



   (b)   A license may be revoked for any of the reasons for which the
city ABC administrator would have been required to refuse a license if the
facts had been known.



   (c)   In addition to the foregoing stated causes, any license may be
revoked or suspended for the following causes:



      (1)   Conviction of the licensee or his or her agent or
employee for selling any illegal beverages on the premises licensed.



      (2)   Making any false, material statements in an application
for a license.



      (3)   If within a period of two (2) consecutive years, any
licensee or any clerk, servant, agent or employee of the licensee shall have
been convicted of two (2) violations of the terms and provisions of KRS Ch.
241 through 244 or any act heretofore or hereafter in effect relating to the
regulation of the manufacture, sale and transportation of alcoholic beverages
or if within such period, any licensee or any clerk, servant, agent or
employee of the licensee shall have twice been convicted of any felony or of
any misdemeanor directly or indirectly attributable to the use of alcoholic
beverages, or of one (1) such felony and one (1) such misdemeanor.



      (4)   Willful and deliberate failure or default of a licensee
to pay an excise tax or any part thereof, or any penalties imposed by or
under the provisions of any statutes, this chapter, or acts of Congress
relative to taxation, or for a violation of any rules or regulations of the
Kentucky Department of Revenue made in pursuance thereof.



      (5)   Setting up, conducting, operating or keeping, on the
licensed premises, any gambling game, device, machine or contrivance, or
lottery or gift enterprise, or handbook or facility for betting or
transmitting bets on horse races; or permitting to be set up, conducted,
operated, kept, or engaged in, on the licensed premises, any such game,
device, machine, contrivance, lottery, gift enterprise, handbook or facility.



(Ord. No. 860-2013, 4-24-13)



Sec. 3-39.  Proceedings for revocation or suspension of license.



   (a)   Upon the verified complaint of any person, or on the
initiative of any law enforcement officer, or of the city ABC administrator,
the city ABC administrator may institute proceedings to revoke or suspend any
license granted under this chapter.  A license may be revoked or suspended
only after the licensee shall have been given written notice, by certified or
registered mail, of the proposed revocation, including notice of the reasons
for such proposed action.  The licensee shall be given opportunity to be
heard in opposition to the proposed revocation or suspension.  The notice of
proposed action shall advise the licensee of the date, time and place of the
hearing.  Notice shall be sufficient if mailed to the licensee at the
address shown in the last application for a license or in the last statement
supplemental to or in amendment of the application, whether or not the
mailing is receipted for or claimed.



   (b)   The specific procedures to be followed in hearings on actions
for revocation or suspension shall be those set out in the Kentucky
Administrative Procedure Act (KAR Chapter 13B).



   (c)   A decision of the city ABC administrator revoking or
suspending a license may be appealed as provided in KRS 243.550.



   (d)   Within three (3) days after any order of revocation or
suspension of a license becomes final, notice of revocation shall be given to
the licensee and to the owner of the licensed premises.  A notice mailed to
the licensee and to the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown
in the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental
to the application shall be deemed sufficient compliance with this section. 
The licensee shall at once surrender his or her license to the city ABC
administrator.  If the revoked or suspended license is not forthwith

      (1)   Causes for refusal to issue or renew a license and for
suspension or revocation of a city license shall be the same as provided for
state licenses according to KRS 243.450, 243.490 and 243.500, as well as
violation of any city ordinance regarding alcohol beverage licensing, sales
or the administration thereof.



      (2)   If the applicant has done any act for which a revocation
of license would be authorized under local, state, or federal law; or



      (3)   If the applicant has made any false material statement
in his or her application.



   (b)   In the case of any licenses subject to the state ABC Board set
quota, before approving an application, the city ABC administrator is
directed to consider, in addition to the factors set out in KRS 243.450,
243.490 and 243.500, and any other factors the administrator determines in
his or her discretion to be reasonable and pertinent to the license
application, the following criteria:



      (1)   Ownership.  The city places great value on business
owners who are invested in the Nicholasville community.



      (2)   Economic impact.  The city desires businesses which
make the most positive impact on the community, in number of jobs, payroll,
property investment and revenues to the city.

all geographic areas of the city. Therefore, the city does not wish to
cluster all licensed ABC outlets in one area.



      (4)   Aesthetics.  The city is committed to protecting the
character and beauty of our community.



      (5)   Revitalization of downtown.  The city wholeheartedly
supports the revitalization of downtown and the revitalization and reuse of
existing buildings.



      (6)   Capital.  The city values businesses that demonstrate
their ability to financially support and sustain their viability.



      (7)   Public support of licensed business in the area.  The
city intends that public sentiment and safety be considered in deciding upon
the approval of retail liquor sales licenses in any area of the city.



      (8)   Long term growth of the city.  The city intends to
consider the long term growth of the city and ensure that all growth is
consistent with the city's overall growth strategy, the city's comprehensive
plan, and the city's existing and future infrastructure capabilities.



   (c)   An applicant who has been refused a license by the city ABC

   (a)   Applicants to whom a license is issued pursuant to this
chapter shall provide information demonstrating compliance with the
conditions of any license, as requested.  The city may at any time come upon
the premises of any licensee and examine the books and records to determine
whether the licensee is in compliance with all parts of this chapter.  In
the event the conditions of any license requirement are not met, the city ABC
administrator shall have discretion in determining whether revocation is
appropriate or whether the licensee may be allowed a reasonable period of
time to reach compliance.  If a good faith effort is demonstrated by the

least one (1) year in determining whether or not the food sale percentage
requirement has been met.



      (1)   Every licensee under this chapter shall keep and
maintain, upon the licensed premises, adequate books and records of all

Sec. 3-43.  Dormancy.

become null and void after ninety (90) days.  Such is the intent of this

her business interrupted by situations not under his or her control, various
exceptions to the dormancy rule have been included in this section.



   (b)   Any license under which no business is transacted during a
period of ninety (90) days shall be deemed inactive and, unless the
conditions set forth in division (c) below are proved to the satisfaction of
the city ABC administrator, the license shall be surrendered to the city ABC
administrator.  If the license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be
revoked by the city ABC administrator.



   (c)   The provisions of division (b) hereof shall not apply to any
licensee who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a
license is issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the
acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental
agency under power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or
involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing
lease.  Prior to the expiration of ninety (90) days of inactivity, such
licensee shall furnish to the city ABC administrator a verified statement
setting forth the fact that the licensee is unable to continue in business,
for any of the specific reasons set forth herein, and the city ABC
administrator may grant an extension of the dormancy with the license
continuing to remain in effect during the license period or until same is
transferred to another premises, notwithstanding the fact that no business is
transacted during said period; provided, however, no such license shall be
considered valid unless business is conducted thereunder within twelve (12)
months from the date of notice to the city ABC administrator.  Such
extension may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be for such times as
the city ABC administrator deems appropriate in exercise of his or her sound
discretion.

manner that it will not cause injury to the dog or interfere with its vision
or respiration but will prevent the dog from biting any person.

made in a manner that will not cause injury to the dog or interfere with its
vision or respiration but must prevent the dog from biting any person or
animal.

it shall also be required that a conspicuous notice be posted at the place of
confinement of such a nature as to warn the public of the nature of the dog
therein confined.

or wound, or assist in killing or wounding any domestic animal belonging to

assault, bite, or otherwise injure any human being or assist in attacking,
assaulting, biting, or otherwise injuring any human being while out of the
enclosure of the owner, keeper and/or harborer of the dangerous or vicious
dog, or while otherwise off the property of the owner, keeper and/or
harborer, whether or not the dangerous or vicious dog was on a leash and
securely muzzled or whether the dangerous or vicious dog escaped without

Sec. 6-108. Unsafe structures and equipment.



   (a)   General. When a structure or equipment is found by the
Administrative Official to be unsafe, or when a structure is found unfit for
human occupancy, or is found unlawful, such structure shall be condemned
pursuant to the provisions of this code.



      (1)   Unsafe structures. An unsafe structure is one that is
found to be dangerous to the life, health, property or safety of the public
or the occupants of the structure by not providing minimum safeguards to
protect or warn occupants in the event of fire, or because such structure
contains unsafe equipment or is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated,
structurally unsafe, or of such faulty construction or unstable foundation,
that partial or complete collapse is possible.



      (2)   Unsafe equipment. Unsafe equipment includes any boiler,
heating equipment, elevator, moving stairway, electrical wiring or device,
flammable liquid containers or other equipment on the premises or within the
structure which is in such disrepair or condition that such equipment is a
hazard to life, health, property or safety of the public or occupants of the
premises or structure.



      (3)   Structure unfit for human occupancy. A structure is
unfit for human occupancy whenever the Administrative Official finds that
such structure is unsafe, unlawful or, because of the degree to which the
structure is in disrepair or lacks maintenance, is unsanitary, vermin or rat
infested, contains filth and contamination, or lacks ventilation,
illumination, sanitary or heating facilities or other essential equipment
required by these regulations, or because the location of the structure
constitutes a hazard to the occupants of the structure or to the public.



      (4)   Unlawful structure. An unlawful structure is one found
in whole or in part to be occupied by more persons than permitted under these
regulations, or was erected, altered or occupied contrary to law.



   (b)   Closing of vacant structures. If the structure is vacant and
unfit for human habitation and occupancy, and is not in danger of structural
collapse, the Administrative Official is authorized to post a placard of
condemnation on the premises and order the structure closed up so as not to
be an attractive nuisance. Upon failure of the owner to close up the premises
within the time specified in the order, the Administrative Official shall
cause the premises to be closed and secured through any available public
agency or by contract or arrangement by private persons and the cost thereof
shall be charged against the real estate upon which the structure is located
and shall be a lien upon such real estate and may be collected by any other
legal resource.



   (c)   Notice.  Whenever the Administrative Official has condemned a
structure or equipment under the provisions of this section, notice shall be
posted in a conspicuous place in or about the structure affected by such
notice and served on the owner or the person or persons responsible for the
structure or equipment in accordance with Section 6-107(c). If the notice
pertains to equipment, it shall also be placed on the condemned equipment.
The notice shall be in the form prescribed in Section 6-107(c).



   (d)   Placarding. Upon failure of the owner or person responsible to
comply with the notice provisions within the time given, the Administrative
Official shall post on the premises or on defective equipment a placard

Art. II.   Regulations, §§ 6A-100--6A-113



ARTICLE I.  GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 6A-1.  SCOPE; INTENT.



   This chapter governs the regulation of cable television rates for basic
service and equipment for any cable operator providing service in the city
subject to regulations under the Cable Television Consumer Protection Act of
1992.  This chapter is intended to be consistent with FCC regulations, and
the city intends to administer these regulations consistent with those
regulations, all as required by the Act, 47 U.S.C. § 543(b).  Likewise, it
is the city's intention that the cable operator be bound by the FCC
regulations to the extent allowed by law.



(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)



§ 6A-2.  DEFINITIONS.



   For purposes of this chapter, the following words shall have the
meaning ascribed to them as follows:



   Act.  The Cable Television Consumer Protection Act of 1992 and
amendments thereto.



   Basic service or basic cable service.  Shall have the same meaning as
defined by the Act and FCC regulations.



   Cable operator.  Shall have the same meaning as defined by the Act and
FCC regulations.



   Increase.  Any change, lessening the number of channels or other
service available as well as raising the rate for basic service or equipment.



   Proprietary information.  Information which if openly disclosed would
permit an unfair commercial advantage to competitors of the cable operator.



   Operator.  Shall have the same meaning as "cable operator."



(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)



ARTICLE II.  REGULATIONS



§ 6A-100.  NOTICE OF REGULATION REQUIRED.



   Upon adoption of this chapter and the certification of the city by the
FCC, the city shall notify, by certified mail, return receipt requested, all
cable operators subject to the Act who provide service in the city that the
city has commenced to regulate the basic rates of the operator.



(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)



§ 6A-101.  RATE FILINGS BY OPERATOR REQUIRED.



   Within thirty (30) days of receiving notice from the city as set out in
§ 6A-100, the operator shall file with the city a schedule of its current
rates for basic service and equipment and justification for them (the rate
filing).  The operator may, if it so chooses, file a proposal with
appropriate justification for an increase as defined in § 6A-2, in its
current rates.  The operator may at any time thereafter submit a proposal to
increase its rates, consistent with FCC regulations.



(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)



§ 6A-102.  SUPPORT FOR RATE FILINGS; BURDEN OF PROOF.



   The rate filing submitted by the operator, either for its current rates
or for a change in its current rates, must show that the rates the operator
charges or proposes to charge for basic service and equipment are reasonable
and in compliance with all applicable FCC rules and regulations. The burden
of proof is on the operator to show that the rates are reasonable and in
compliance with all applicable FCC rules and regulations.



      (1)   If the operator asserts that its current rates or its
proposed rates are within the "benchmark" or "cap" as defined by the FCC, it
must fully complete applicable FCC forms and otherwise provide material to
support its position.



      (2)   If the operator proposes to increase its rates above
that level permitted by the FCC "benchmark" or "cap", it may seek to make a
"cost-of-service" showing in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by
the FCC.  In seeking to make a "cost-of-service" showing, the operator must
fully complete applicable FCC forms and otherwise provide material to
supplement its position.



      (3)   If the operator proposes to add or delete channels or
service, or to remove certain channels from the basic service to the cable
programming service tier as defined by the FCC or to a non-regulated status,
it must explain in writing the impact of the addition, deletion or removal on
its basic service rates and demonstrate why the addition, deletion or removal
complies with FCC rules and regulations.



      (4)   The operator must show why all rates for all customer
classifications are reasonable.



(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)



§ 6A-103.  APPROVAL OF CITY NECESSARY.



   Once an operator has been notified that the city has commenced
regulation of its rates, the operator may not thereafter increase its rates
for basic service or equipment without the prior approval of the city.  This
requirement applies in all cases, including increases it has announced but
not yet implemented prior to the date it received notice of rate regulation
from the city.



§ 6A-104.  TIMING OF RATE FILING.



   Rate filings proposing and supporting rate increases must be filed for
review at least thirty (30) days in advance of the proposed effective date of
the increase.



(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)



§ 6A-105.  INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED.



   In addition to any information it provides in support of its current
rates or request for increase in rates, the operator shall provide all other
information requested by the city, subject to a request for confidentiality
pursuant to § 6A-111.



(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)



§ 6A-106.  SCHEDULE OF ACTION BY CITY; TOLLING PERIODS.



   After the operator has submitted a rate filing to justify its current
rates or to seek an increase, the current rates shall remain in effect
subject to further action by the city.  If the city takes no action within
thirty (30) days of the submission to approve, disapprove, or toll the period
of reviewing the rates, the current rates or the proposed rates, as the case
may be, shall be deemed approved.  The city may, however, toll the thirty
(30) day period by issuing a brief written municipal order explaining that it
needs additional time to request or review additional information or consider
comments from interested parties.



      (1)   For filings not involving cost-of-serve showings, the
city may toll the rates for an additional ninety (90) days after the
expiration of the initial thirty (30) days.



      (2)   For filings seeking a rate increase based upon a
cost-of-service showing, the city may toll the rates for an additional one
hundred fifty (150) days after the expiration of the initial thirty (30)
days.  If the city commission so desires, within thirty (30) days of receipt
of a cost-of-service showing, it may ask the FCC pursuant to 47 C.F.R. §
76.7 to examine the cable operator's showing.  The city shall issue an order
stating that it is seeking commission assistance and serve a copy of the
order on the cable operator before the thirty (30) day deadline.



      (3)   If the rates are tolled with respect to current rates,
the rates may remain in effect subject to refund as specified in § 6A-107. 
If the rates are tolled with regard to a proposed increase, the increase in
rates shall not go into effect unless the city orders that they shall go into
effect subject to refund.



(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)



§ 6A-107.  RATES SUBJECT TO REFUNDS.



   If the city chooses to toll the period to review current rates, the
current rates will remain in effect subject to refund.  In like manner, if
the city chooses to toll the period to review a proposed rate increase, it
may permit the proposed rate increase to go into effect subject to refund if
ordered by the city commission.  If the city has taken no action at the end
of the additional ninety (90) or one hundred fifty (150) days, the proposed
rate increase shall go into effect subject to refund.  In all cases, the
city shall issue a brief written order, in accordance with 47 C.F.R. §
76.933, requiring the operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts
received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose behalf the amounts were
paid.  Refunds shall be paid to the full extent allowed by law.



(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)



§ 6A-108.  CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE.



   Within ninety (90) days of any order of the city mandating a reduction
in rates, ordering a refund of rates, or prescribing rates at a level less
than the rate increase sought by the operator, the operator shall file with
the city a certification, signed by an authorized representative, that it has
fully complied with the city's order and describing in detail the steps taken
to implement the order and showing how refunds, including interest, were
calculated and distributed.



(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)



§ 6A-109.  PUBLIC COMMENT REQUIRED.



   Prior to taking any action to approve or disapprove rates, the city
shall provide an opportunity for interested parties to express their views
concerning the current or proposed rates either by:



      (1)   holding a public hearing,



      (2)   providing notice to citizens and others that they may
submit written comments or



      (3)   any other convenient method the city may determine.



(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94; Ord. No. 110-1994, 12-22-94)



§ 6A-110.  INFLATION AND EXTERNAL COSTS ADJUSTMENTS AUTHORIZED.



   If the operator requests an increase in whole or in part based upon
inflation adjustments, programming costs increases, or other external factors
permitted by FCC regulations, the operator shall provide a detailed
explanation and documentation in support of the request, including
calculations as to how the specific request was derived and a copy of the
contract for each programming service cost that has increased.  In addition,
the operator shall submit, through its chief financial officer or an
independent certified accountant, a sworn statement that it has examined all
external costs and offset any claimed increase by any decrease that has
occurred and has otherwise complied with the requirements of 47 C.F.R. §
76.922(d)(2).



(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)



§ 6A-111.  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION TO BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL.



      (1)   The operator may request that portions of the filings
and information it supplies to the city in support of its current rates or a
proposed rate increase be kept confidential.  The request may be made solely
as it relates to proprietary information. If possible, the portions of the
filing that are proprietary shall be segregated from the non-proprietary
information.  The request that the information be kept confidential must
state the reason that the information would permit an unfair commercial
advantage to competitors of the cable operator.



      (2)   The mayor, or his designee, shall grant the request that
the information be kept confidential if he determines that the preponderance
of evidence shows disclosure would permit an unfair commercial advantage to
competitors of the cable operator.  If the operator requests confidentiality
and the request is denied, the operator may withdraw its request for a rate
increase and the information it claims to be proprietary will be returned to
it.



      (3)   If the city requires any additional proprietary
information other than that provided by the operator in support of the rate
filing, the city shall state a justification for additional information and,
where related to an FCC Form 393 (and/or FCC Forms 1200/1205) filing, the
city shall indicate the question or section of the form to which the request
specifically relates.



      (4)   If the cable operator makes no request for
confidentiality, the material will be considered public records available for
inspection by any person pursuant to the Kentucky Open Records Act.



(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)



§ 6A-112.  RATE INCREASE APPROVAL, DISAPPROVAL AUTHORIZED.



      (1)   After it completes its review of the rate filing
submitted by the operator, the city shall issue an order approving or
disapproving the current rates sought to be justified or the increased rates
sought.  If the city had previously decided pursuant to § 6A-106 to allow
rates to remain in effect or go into effect subject to refund, and if the
city disapproves the rates in question, it shall issue an appropriate order
directing that refunds be made.  The city may order refunds to the full
extent permitted by the FCC regulations.



      (2)   The city may order a reduction in rates where necessary
to bring rates into compliance with FCC regulations.  If the city determines
that the current rate or a proposed rate is unreasonable, it may prescribe a
reasonable rate.



      (3)   Before disapproving a rate or prescribing a rate, or
ordering a refund, the city shall ensure that the operator has had notice and
opportunity to comment on the rate in question or refund.  The city shall
provide ten (10) days' written notice and give the operator the opportunity
to submit written or oral comments in addition to its rate filing.



      (4)   If the rates are disapproved in whole or in part or if
the city prescribes rates or orders refunds, the order issued by the city
shall specify the reasons for the decision.  The city clerk shall provide
written notice to the operator of the city's decision by providing a copy of
the resolution or order.



      (5)   The city's decision approving or disapproving the rate,
in whole or in part, or prescribing rates, may, by the operator or by any
citizen submitting oral or written comment to the city prior to the order
rendering the decision, be appealed to the FCC or as otherwise allowed by law.



(Ord. No. 084-1994, 5-26-94)



§ 6A-113.  ENFORCEMENT.



   The operator is required to comply with the terms and provisions of
this chapter.  If the operator violates any order of the city with respect
to rates, it shall be subject to a civil penalty of five hundred dollars
($500.00) a day for each day it fails to comply.  Violation of this chapter
or of any order with respect to rates may be considered a violation of the
franchise agreement between the operator and the city.

reimbursed to the city. This shall not exempt or preclude any other
mitigation requirements by any other regulation. If the city cannot establish
the responsibility of the release then the city shall take all measures
required to protect the environment, persons and properties within the city.
Cost incurred by the city associated with this action shall be kept recorded
and upon discovery of the parties responsible for the release all costs above
normal service costs (on-duty staff, apparatus, equipment) shall be
reimbursed to the city. Losses of city owned or leased equipment that result
from contamination and/or exposure to releases identified in § 8-43 shall be
reimbursed to the city on a direct cost of replacement basis.

ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS



Sec. 9-1.  Statutory authorization.



   The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS Ch. 100
delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the City Commission of Nicholasville, Kentucky, hereby
adopts the following floodplain management ordinance, as follows.



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-2.  Findings of fact.



   (a)   The flood hazard areas of Nicholasville are subject to
periodic inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.



   (b)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and
by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage.



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-3.  Statement of purpose.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding
by provisions designed to:



      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity;



      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including
facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the
time of initial construction;



      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood
waters;



      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other
development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and



      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers
which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards
to other areas.



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-4.  Objectives.



   The objectives of this chapter are to:



      (1)   Protect human life and health;



      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects;



      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts
associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the
general public;



      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;



      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such
as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and
bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;



      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the
sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard or other
flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas
caused by flooding; and



      (7)   Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that
property is in a special flood hazard area.



      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area
assume responsibility for their actions.

flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.



   Accessory structure (Appurtenant structure). A structure located on the
same parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is

areas (SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously
accredited flood protection system that is in the process of being restored
to provide a one hundred (100)-year or greater level of flood protection.
After restoration is complete these areas will still experience residual
flooding from other flooding sources.



   A99 zone. That part of the SFHA inundated by the one hundred (100)-year
flood which is to be protected from the one hundred (100)-year flood by a
federal flood protection system under construction. No base flood elevations

   Floodproofing Certificate. A certification by a registered professional
engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of
certification stating that a non-residential structure, together with
attendant utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified
design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage
of water and all structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and
anticipated debris impact forces.



   Flood way. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent

compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard must be
applied not just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level,
but also to the level of protection provided to all components of the
structure, such as building utilities, HVAC components, etc.



   Fraud and victimization. As related in Sec. 9-51 et seq. means that the
variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In
examining this requirement, the City Commission will consider the fact that
every newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and
remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years.
Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood
elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from
floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are
subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those
increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase
the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can
be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

   Hazard potential. The possible adverse incremental consequences that
result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam
or misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential
classification of a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of
a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity,
flood routing capacity).



   Highest adjacent grade.  The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.

management laws or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a
building covered by a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP sustains
a loss and the state or community declares the building to be substantially
or repetitively damaged, ICC will help pay up to thirty thousand dollars
($30,000) for the cost to elevate, floodproof, demolish, or remove the
building.



      (2)   ICC coverage is available on residential and

a river or stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling,
raising, or obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the
channel or in the floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for
such work have been submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit
issued as required in subsection (1) above.



      (3)   Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet
any jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction,
improvement, enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district,
ditch or system established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval
of the same except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is
determined by the cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial
use of water resources in the area, and the person or political subdivision
in control thereof so notified. The Department for Natural Resources through
KRS Chapter 350 shall have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS Chapter 151
concerning the regulation of dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges,
fills, or other obstructions across or along any stream or in the floodway of
any stream which structures are permitted under KRS Chapter 350 for surface
coal mining operations.

not in accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or
complying with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit
and any approved modifications, such development shall constitute a civil
offense.



   (b)   Notice of violation. If, at any time, a duly authorized
employee or agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to
believe that a person has caused development to occur which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or
complying with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit
and any approved modifications thereof, a duly authorized employee of the
Floodplain Administrator shall issue a notice to the person responsible for
the violation and/or the property owner, stating the facts of the offense or
violation, the section of this ordnance and/or of the permit violated, when
it occurred, how the violation is to be remedied to bring the development
into conformity with this chapter or with  the approved permit, and within
what period of time the remedy is to occur, which period of time shall be
reasonable and shall be determined by the nature of the violation and whether
or not it creates a nuisance or hazard. The remedy may include an order to
stop work on the development. The notice shall also state that a citation may
be forthcoming in the event that the requested remedies and corrective
actions are not taken, which citation will request a civil monetary fine and
shall state the maximum fine which could be imposed. See below.



   (c)   Notice of citation. If, at any time, a duly authorized
employee or agent of the Floodplain Administrator has reasonable cause to
believe that a person has caused development to occur which is not in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter including obtaining or
complying with the terms and conditions of a floodplain construction permit
and any approved modifications thereof, a duly authorized employee of the
Floodplain Administrator may issue a citation to the offender stating the
violation, prior notices of violation issued, how the violation is to be
remedied to bring the development into conformity with this chapter or with
the approved permit, and within what period of tune the remedy is to occur,
and what penalty or penalties are recommended. When a citation is issued, the
person to whom (he citation is issued shall respond to the citation within
seven (7) days of the date the citation is issued by either carrying out the
remedies and corrections set forth in the citation, paying the civil fine set
forth in the citation or requesting a hearing before the governing body. If
the person to whom the citation is issued does not respond to the citation
within seven (7) days, that person shall be deemed to have waived the right
to a hearing and the determination that a violation occurred shall be
considered final.



   (d)   Penalties.  Violation of the provisions of this chapter or
failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with granting of a
variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor civil offense.

designee to administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter
by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions,
and is herein referred to as the Floodplain Administrator.



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-22.  Establishment of development permit.



   A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other
development begins within any special flood hazard area established in Sec.
9-7. Application for a Development Permit shall be made on forms furnished by
Floodplain Administrator prior to any development activities, and may
include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to
scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in
question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials,
drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Endorsement of local
administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can
be processed. Specifically, the following information is required.



      (1)   Application stage.



      a.   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (MSL) of
the proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone A
and elevation of highest adjacent grade; or



      b.   Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which
any non-residential structure will be flood-proofed;



      c.   All appropriate certifications from a registered
professional engineer or architect that the non-residential flood-proofed
structure will meet the flood-proofing criteria in Sec. 9-32(2) and Sec.
9-34(2);



      d.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will
be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.



      (2)   Construction stage.



      a.   Upon placement of the lowest floor, and before
construction continues, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it
shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain
Administrator and to the state a certification of the elevation of the lowest
floor or flood-proofed elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. In
AE, Al-30, AH, and A zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base
flood elevation, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and
certified by same.



      b.   When flood proofing is utilized for a particular
structure, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
supervision of a certified professional engineer or architect. Any continued
work undertaken prior to the submission of the certification shall be at the
permit holder's risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest
floor and flood proofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies
detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately
and prior to further progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to
submit the survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall
be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-23.  Duties and responsibilities of the local administrator.



   (a)   The Floodplain Administrator and/or staff is hereby appointed,
authorized and directed to administer, implement and enforce the provisions

         h.   Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations
of this chapter as specified in Sec. 9-13.



      (5)   Map determinations.  Make interpretations where needed,
as to the exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas,
for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary
and actual field conditions.



         a.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example,
where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual
field conditions) the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
Sec. 9-52(c);



         b.   When base flood elevation data or floodway data
have not been provided in accordance with Sec. 9-7, then the Floodplain
Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonable utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source,
in order to administer the provisions of Sec. 9-31 et seq.;



         c.   When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular
structure, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain certification from a
registered professional engineer or architect, in accordance with Sec.
9-32(2) a floodproofing certificate;



         d.   All records pertaining to the provisions of this
chapter shall be maintained in the office of the Floodplain Administrator and
shall be open for public inspection.



      (6)   Right of entry.

any of the provisions of this chapter, or whenever the administrator has
reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any
premises any condition or chapter violation which makes such building,
structure or premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the administrator may
enter such building, structure or premises at all reasonable tunes to inspect
the same or perform any duty imposed upon the administrator by this chapter.



         b    If such structure or premises are occupied, he/she
shall first present proper credentials and request entry. If such building,
structure, or premises are unoccupied, he or she shall first make a
reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or
control of such request entry.



         c.   If entry is refused, the administrator shall have
recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry.



         d.   When the administrator shall have first obtained a
proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no
owner or occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any
building, structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request
is made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the
administrator for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this
chapter.

   In all special flood hazard areas the following provisions are required:



      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall
be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of
the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including
the effects of buoyancy;



      (2)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include,
but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or fame ties to ground anchors.
This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state
requirements for resisting wind forces.



      (3)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall
be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;



      (4)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;



      (5)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
condition equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding; and if



      (6)   Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate
drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and
away from proposed structures.



      (7)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
system;



      (8)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be

systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters;



      (9)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and
constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during
flooding;



      (10)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements
to a structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this
chapter shall meet the requirements of “new construction” as contained in
this chapter; and



      (11)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements
to a structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this
chapter, shall be undertaken only if said non-conformity is not furthered,
extended, or replaced.



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-32.  Specific standards.



   In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have
been provided, as set forth in Sec. 9-7, the following provisions are
required:



      (1)   Residential construction. New construction or
substantial improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home)
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, crawlspace, mechanical
equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower than one (1.0) foot above the base
flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of
floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of division (3).



         a.   In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent
grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on
the FIRM, or elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade
if no depth number is specified.



         b.   In an A zone, where no technical data has been
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated one (1.0) foot
above the base flood elevation, as determined by this community. The
Floodplain Administrator will determine the method by which base flood
elevations are determined. Methods include but are not limited to detailed
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use of existing data available from other
sources, use of historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgement in
the event no data can be produced.



Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation
060, states as a part of the technical requirements for a state floodplain
permit: The applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway
boundaries (and thereby Base Flood Elevations) at any proposed construction
site where FEMA maps arc not available. All cross sections shall be
referenced to mean sea level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no
more than + five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken
at those points which represent significant breaks in slope and at points
where hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross
section shall extend across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the
number and at the locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure
that significant flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require
additional cross sections or specific site elevations which extend beyond
those needed for making routine regulatory floodway boundary calculations.



         c.   In all other zones, elevated one (1.0) foot above
the base flood elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation
of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered
professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building
inspection department to be properly elevated. Such certification and
verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.



      (2)   Non-residential construction. New construction or
substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential
structure (including manufactured homes used for non-residential purposes)
shall be elevated to conform with division (1) or together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities:



         a.   Be floodproofed below an elevation one (1.0) foot
above the level of the base flood elevation so that the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;



         b.   Have structural components capable of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;



         c.   Have the lowest floor, including basement,
crawlspace, mechanical equipment, and ductwork, elevated no lower than one
(1.0) foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or



         d.   A registered professional engineer or architect
shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such
certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in Sec. 9-22(1)
c.



         e.   Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in
division (4)



         f.   All new construction and substantial improvement
with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that
are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and
which are subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant
materials below an elevation one (1.0) foot above the base flood elevation,
and, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening
sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet
or exceed the following minimum criteria:



            (i)   Be certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect; or



            (ii)   Have a minimum of two openings with a total
net area of not less than one (1)  square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no
higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the
automatic entry and exit of floodwater.



      (3)   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial
improvements of elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that
include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls
below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living
space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.



         a.   Opening sizes for complying with this requirement
must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the
following minimum criteria:



            (i)   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having
a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding;



            (ii)   The bottom of all openings shall be no
higher than one (1) foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal
to in elevation or higher than the exterior foundation grade); and

         c.   The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall
not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.



      (4)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational
vehicles.



         a.   All new or substantially improved manufactured
homes placed on sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements
for new construction, including elevation and anchoring.



            (i)   Locations include:



               (A)   On individual lots or parcels;



               (B)   In expansions to existing manufactured
home parks or subdivisions;



               (C)   In new manufactured home parks or
subdivisions;



               (D)   In substantially improved manufactured
home parks or subdivisions;



               (E)   Outside of a manufactured home park or
subdivision;



               (F)   In an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred
“substantial damage” as the result of a flood;



            (ii)   All manufactured homes must be:



               (A)   Elevated on a permanent foundation; and



               (B)   Have its lowest floor elevated no
lower than one (1.0) foot above the level of the base flood elevation, and



               (C)   Be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.



         b.   Except manufactured homes that have incurred
substantial damage as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or
substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
must be elevated so that the manufactured home is securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and
lateral movement, so that either the:



            (i)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is
elevated no lower than one (1.0) foot above the level of the base flood
elevation, or



            (ii)   The manufactured home chassis is supported
by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent
strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent
grade.

within A, AI-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) must either:



            (i)   Be on the site for fewer than one hundred
and eighty (180) consecutive days;



            (ii)    Be fully licensed and ready for highway
use; or



            (iii)   Meet the permit requirements for new
construction of this chapter, including anchoring and elevation requirements

            (iv)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is licensed and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky
motor vehicle regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to
the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and
has no permanently attached additions.



      (5)   Flood ways. Located within areas of special flood hazard
established in Sec. 9-7, are areas designated as floodways. Since the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters
which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the
following provisions shall apply:



         a.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, and other developments unless
certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any
increase in the base flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood
discharge;



         b.   If Sec. 9-32(5) is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sec. 9-31 et seq.



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-33.  Standards for streams without established base flood elevation
(unnumbered “A” zones) and/or floodways.



   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Sec. 9-7,
where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where
base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions
apply:



      (1)   No encroachments, including fill material or structures
shall be located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the
community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical
data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.



      (2)   New construction or substantial improvements of
structures shall be elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in
accordance with Sec. 9-7.



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-34.  Standards for shallow flooding zones.



   Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Sec. 9-7,
are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet, where
a clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:



      (1)   All new construction and substantia! improvements of
residential structures shall.  Have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood
depth specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map above the highest adjacent
grade. In Zone AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor,
including basement, shall be elevated no less than two (2) feet above the
highest adjacent grade.



      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of
non-residential structures shall:



      a.   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above either the base flood elevation or in Zone AO the flood depth specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, above the highest adjacent grade. In Zone
AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement,
shall be elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade.



      b.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities
be completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in
Zone AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one (1) foot
so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in Sec. 9-32(2).



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-35.  Standards for subdivision proposals.



   (a)   All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood
hazard area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damage;



   (b)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;



   (c)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage
provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and



   (d)   In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not
available (Zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway
data tor subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including
manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than fifty (50) lots or
five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall be provided.



   (e)   All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed
structure(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base
flood elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall
be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided
to the Floodplain Administrator.



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-36.  Standards for accessory structures in all zones beginning with
the letter ‘A.’



   For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated
‘A’ the following provisions shall apply:



      (1)   Structure must be non-habitable;



      (2)   Must be anchored to resist floatation forces;



      (3)   Will require flood openings/vents no more than one (1)
foot above grade, total openings are to be one square inch per one square
foot of floor area, at least two (2) openings required on opposite wails;



      (4)   Built of flood resistant materials below a level one
(1.0) foot above the base flood elevation;



      (5)   Must elevate utilities above the base flood elevation;



      (6)   Can only be used for storage or parking;



      (7)   Cannot be modified for a different use after permitting.



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-37.  Critical facilities.



   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent
possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain).
Construction of new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the
floodway; however, they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the
SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the level of
the base flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must
be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released
into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base
flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent
possible.

ARTICLE IV. APPEALS AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES



Sec. 9-51.  Nature of variances.



   (a)   The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter
are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a
piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted
for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that
complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional
hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The
characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent
parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to
the structure, its inhabitants, or the properly owners.



   (b)   It is the duty of the City Commission to help protect its
citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of
the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that
variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood
ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood
loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore,
the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and
contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be
properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in
which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-52.  Designation and Duties of Variance and Appeal Board.



   (a)   The City Commission of Nicholasville shall establish an Appeal
Board consisting of members of the Board of Adjustments.



   (b)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide requests for variances
from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or
determinations made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.



   (c)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or
any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local District Court, as
provided in Kentucky Revised Statutes.



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-53.  Appeals/variance procedures.



   In passing upon such applications, the Appeal Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and the:



      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others;



      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;



      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual
owner and future owners of the property;



      (4)   Importance to the community of the services provided by
the proposed facility;



      (5)   Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront,
in the case of functionally dependent facility;



      (6)   Availability of alternative locations which are not
subject to flooding or erosion damage;



      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;



      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area;



      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;



      (10)   Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and



      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and
bridges.



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-54.  Conditions for Variances.



   (a)   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the
purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
chapter.



      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped
regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.



      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that
the variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the
flood hazard. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum
of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case
of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City Commission need
not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever
elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City
Commission believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of
the local chapter.



      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that
the variance is the “minimum necessary” to afford relief considering the
flood hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination
shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and
not destroy the historic character and design of the structure.



      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:



         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;



         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this
chapter); and



         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance
will not result in increased flood height, additional threats to public
safety, cause extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in
the definition section under “Public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud
or victimization of the public (as defined in the definition section) or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.



      (5)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be
given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood
elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.



      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records
of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon
request.



      (7)   Variances may be issued for new construction,
substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sec.
9-53 (1) through (11) are satisfied and that the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the
base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and
does not create a public nuisance.



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-55.  Variance notification.



   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:



      (1)    The issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty- five dollars ($25.00) for
one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage, and;



      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property, A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the
Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Nicholasville Recorder and
shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the
affected parcel of land.



      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of
all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report
such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-56.  Historic Structures.



   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic
structures” (see definition in Sec. 9-5) upon determination that the
proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.



(Ord. No. 800-2011, 5-2-11)



Sec. 9-57.  No impact certification within the floodway.



   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

aggrieved") may file a compliant with the mayor.  Complaints shall be in
writing and shall contain such information and be in such form as the mayor
requires.  Upon receipt of such a complaint, the mayor shall furnish a copy
of the same to the person or persons who allegedly committed or about to
commit the alleged discriminatory housing practice.  Within thirty (30) days
after receiving a complaint, or within thirty (30) days after the expiration
of any period of reference under subsection (c), the mayor shall investigate
the complaint and give notice in writing to the person aggrieved whether he
intends to resolve it.  If the mayor decides to resolve the complaints, he

housing practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and
persuasion.  Nothing said or done in the course of such informal endeavors
may be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this
article without the written consent of the persons concerned.  Any employee
of the mayor who shall make public any information in violation of this
provision shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof
shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned
not more than one (1) year.

Complaints may be reasonably and fairly amended at any time.  A respondent
may file an answer to the complaint against him and with the leave of the
mayor which shall be granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do
so, may amend his answer at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be
verified.



   (c)   If, within thirty (30) days after a complaint is filed with
the mayor, the mayor has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance with this
ordinance, the person aggrieved may, within thirty (30) days thereafter, file
a complaint with the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.  The mayor will assist in this filing.



   (d)   If the mayor has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance
within thirty (30) days of the complaint, the person aggrieved may, within
thirty (30) days hereafter commence a civil action in any appropriate court,
against the respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted
or protected by this article, insofar as such rights relate to the subject of

Fourth Amendment relating to reasonable searches and seizures.  The mayor
may issue subpoenas to compel his access to or the production of such
materials, or the appearance of such persons, any may issue interrogatories
to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as
would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or served in aid
of a civil action in the United States district court for the district in
which the investigation is taking place.  The mayor may administer oaths.



   (b)   Upon written application to the mayor, a respondent shall be
entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in the
same of the mayor to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as
subpoenas issued by the mayor himself.  Subpoenas issued at the request of a
respondent shall show on their face the name and address of such respondent
and shall state that they were issued at his request.

subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by him.



   (d)   Within five (5) days after service of a subpoena upon any
person, such person may petition the mayor to revoke or modify the
subpoena.  The mayor shall grant the petition if he finds that the subpoena
requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it
requires production of evidence which does not relate to any matter under
investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient particularity the
evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly onerous, or for
other good reason.



   (e)   In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the mayor
or other person at whose request it was issued may petition for its
enforcement in the state court for the district in which the person to whom
the subpoena was addressed resides, was served or transacts business.



   (f)   Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and
testify or to answer any unlawful inquiry or to produce records, documents or
other evidence, if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or
lawful order of the mayor, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) or imprisoned not more than one (1) year, or both.  Any person
who, with intent thereby to mislead the mayor, shall make or cause to be made
any false entry or statement of fact in any report, account, record, or other
document submitted to the mayor pursuant to his subpoena or other order, or
shall willfully neglect or fail to make or cause to be made full, true and
correct entries in such reports, accounts, records, or other documents, or

be enforced by civil actions in state or local courts of general
jurisdiction.  A civil action shall be commenced within one hundred and
eight (108) days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred;
provided, however, that the court shall continue such civil case brought
pursuant to this section or § 10-29(d) from time to time before bringing it
to trial if the court believes that the conciliation efforts of the mayor are
likely to result in satisfactory settlement of the discriminatory housing
practice complained or in the complaint made to the mayor and which practice
forms the basis for the action in court; and provided, however, that any
sale, encumbrance, or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court
order issued under the authority of this article, and involving a bona fide
purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant without actual notice of the existence of
the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this
ordinance shall not be affected.

permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other
order, any may award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than one

   (p)   Immediate action. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the

§ 12-7  ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS.



§ 12-7.1  PURPOSE.



   The intent of the board of commissioners in adopting legislation
regulating adult entertainment establishments within the city is to establish
reasonable and uniform regulations that will reduce the adverse impact that
such adult entertainment has had in the city and to protect the health,
safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of Nicholasville,
Kentucky.



§ 12-7.2  FINDING OF FACT.



   Based upon evidence and testimony presented at public meeting before
the Board of Commission of the city, the past experiences of the city and the
experiences which revoked the business license of two (2) massage parlors,
the desire of other adult entertainment establishments to locate within the
city and the documented experiences of other governmental units within and
without of this state in dealing with the impact of adult entertainment, the
Board of Commission hereby finds as follows:



   (a)   Establishments may attempt to locate within the city limits of
Nicholasville where adult entertainment occurs as a commercial venture.



   (b)   Establishments exist or may exist within the city limits of
Nicholasville where the superficial tissues of one person are manipulated,
rubbed, stroked, kneaded, and/or touched by a second person, accompanied by
the display of, or exposure of, specified anatomical areas; or dancers,
entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for various forms of
commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing
specified anatomical areas.



   (c)   When the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) above
are present in an establishment within the city, other activities which are
illegal, immoral, or unhealthful in nature tend to accompany them, to
concentrate around them, and are exacerbated or aggravated by them. Such
other activities include, but are not limited to, the following: 
Prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious
behavior exposing minors to harmful materials, sale of possession of
controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property.



   (d)   There is a higher incidence of certain types of criminal
behavior among employees of establishments engaged in the activities
described above in subsection (a) and subsection (b) than among employees of
other types of commercial establishments.



   (e)   When the activities described in subsection (a) and subsection
(b) above are present in establishments within the limits of the city they
tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, bring blight to
neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, in various ways
including, but not limited to, driving away customers and causing hours of
operation to be restricted, lower property values of surrounding properties,
promote crimes, particularly those as detailed in subsection (c) above,
impact on the morals and values of the school children who must regularly be
exposed to undesirable elements while walking to and from school as well as
after school hours, and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to
other locations or fail to locate in the city.



   (f)   In order to preserve the public peace in good order and to
safeguard the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the city and its
citizens, it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate
establishments such as those described in subsection (a) and subsection (b)
above.



   (g)   Physical contact within establishments in which the activities
described in subsection (a) and subsection (b) above occurred between persons
exhibiting specified anatomical areas and patrons or spectators poses a
threat to the individual health of both individuals and promotes the spread
of communicable and social diseases.



   (h)   Establishments engaged in the business operations and
activities described in subsections (a) and (b) are commercial ventures,
operated for the purpose of making a profit, and as such are proper subjects
for regulation by the city in the interest of the health, safety, morals, and
general welfare of its citizens and those individuals visiting the city.



   (i)   The adult entertainment described as occurring in the city
does not contain any element of protected communication and is expressly
found by the Board of Commission to be conduct rather than expression.



   (j)   The city would incur significant financial burdens in
regulating and policing the adult entertainment establishments over and above
regulatory fees and in a disproportionate percentage as compared to other
commercial activities.

§ 12-7.10  PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA.



   (a)   Any license issued under this section may, with notice to the
holder thereof and hearing as hereinafter provide for, be revoked, suspended,
placed on probationary status, or some combination thereof, by the Board of
Commission:



      (1)   If, within twelve (12) months prior to the date on which
charges are filed, there has been a conviction of any licensee or his agent,
servants, or employees for any action or activity occurring in, on, or at the
premises covered by the license in violation of any provision of this chapter
or any other ordinance of the city, or of any criminal or penal statute of
the Commonwealth of Kentucky against gambling disorderly conduct, or any
other criminal or penal offense;



      (2)   If any person is disorderly in, on, or at the premises
covered by the license, the licensed premises becomes disorderly, and/or the
licensee or his agents, servants, or employees suffer or permit any
disorderly conduct in, on or at the licensed premises; or



      (3)   If the licensee or their agents, servants, or employees
shall misrepresent any material facts as to the kind of business in his adult
entertainment, payroll and/or business license return, or any other fact for
obtaining or renewing said license or necessary to determine the amount of
license tax to be paid.



   (b)   When the Board of Commission has probable cause to believe
that a license should be revoked for any of the causes enumerated herein, it
shall be its duty to prefer charges against the holder of such license by
filing a statement of such charges against the holder of such license with
the City Clerk.  The charges shall be in writing and each charge shall be
clearly set out.  Within three (3) days after filing of said charges, a
notice of the filing of said charges and of the time of hearing thereof shall
be mailed to the licensee at the address shown on the license and hearing
before the Board of Commission shall be held within ten (10) days after the
mailing of said charges. At the hearing, the evidence shall be recorded, and
the introduction of any judgment of conviction in any court of competent
jurisdiction of the licensee or any agent, servant, or employee thereof,
shall be conclusive evidence that such a violation occurred.  The existence
of any prior judgment of conviction for the same or similar offense, under
the same ownership/management as those being asserted as the basis for the
current licensing hearing, may be considered as actual or constructive
knowledge of the existence of the engagement in such illegal conduct on the
licensed premises. The licensee shall be permitted to present evidence in
defense of the charges and shall be given the opportunity to refute that such
licensee knew or should have known of the existence of such illegal conduct

or employee thereof.  The action and decision of the Board of Commission
on  the charges shall be reduced to writing and recorded in the minute
book.  Upon a finding that the licensee knew or should have known of the
existence of such illegal conduct resulting in a decision by the Board of
Commission to revoke, suspend, place on probationary status, or some
combination thereof, a license issued under this chapter, all business
activity at the location shall cease immediately for the period of suspension
or revocation.

waiver of such charges.



   (b)   No transfer of an existing adult entertainment establishment
shall be permitted so long as charges against same are pending for a hearing
before the Board of Commission.



   (c)   In the event an adult entertainment establishment license is
surrendered by the license holder pending charges against said licensee and
prior to any revocation hearing, or is revoked after hearing, no new license
certificate shall be issued to any person, when in the discretion of the city
the license holder, or the holder of a license surrendered in lieu of
revocation, is to operate a business under a new adult entertainment
establishment license, merely in the name of another person, the same
constituting a "sham" application.

as determined by the supervisor of the electric department.



   The determination will be based on the amount of traffic or hazardous
conditions that may exist and the amount of residential development at that
location.  If a two hundred fifty (250) watt luminaire is required the
developer will be duly notified.



      (3)   Arterial streets.  Streets that are classified as
arterial streets shall use two hundred (250) watt (twenty-seven thousand five
hundred (27,500) lumens) high pressure sodium vapor luminaries or larger as

ARTICLE III.  WRECKER SERVICE VEHICLE STORAGE FACILITY



DIVISION I.  GENERALLY



§ 22-70.  TITLE; PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this article is to provide the city and police
department personnel with safe, efficient and equitable system for the
removal of damaged, disabled, abandoned, illegally parked, or where a vehicle
or its driver is involved in illegal activity from city streets.  All
applications, fees, lists, complaints, or other written information
concerning the administration of this section shall be maintained and
monitored by the chief of police, under the direction and supervision of the
city commission.  All requests by police personnel for wrecker and/or
storage facility services within the city, shall be administered through the
police department as directed herein.



(Ord. No. 810-2011, 8-1-11)



Sec. 22-71.  Removal of wrecked or disabled vehicles.



   (a)   Preference calls.



      (1)    The owner or lawful operator of a damaged or disabled
vehicle shall generally have the right to determine the wrecker service to be
summoned and the destination of said vehicle. The police officer in charge of
the accident or disabled vehicle shall honor the motor owner/operator's
preference and take reasonable steps to carry out the notification of the
appropriate wrecker service,  unless in the opinion of the police officer,
the request is either contrary to accepted police practices or would create a
risk to the general public.



      (2)   If,  in any case,  the police officer believes that an
alternative to the owner or operator's preference is necessary in order to
protect the general public or promote legitimate police matters,  then the
police officer shall act in accordance with his/her training and skill by
selecting an alternative method of removal and/or site for storage.



      (3)   In any event, the police officer must advise the
telecommunicator of all pertinent information necessary for each towed
vehicle.    The telecommunicator will record the relevant information
concerning the wrecker service and storage facility utilized in each incident
in the “wrecker tow log” maintained in the telecommunications office.



      (4)   No owner, employee, or agent for any wrecker service
summoned to the scene of an accident or disabled vehicle shall participate
in,  or influence,  the decision of the owner/operator as set out in
subsection (1) of this section.



   (b)   Non-preference calls.    Where the motor vehicle operator is
injured,  unavailable or otherwise indicates no preference for the
destination of a wrecker service,  then the telecommunicator shall contact a
wrecker service.



(Ord. No. 810-2011, 10-1-11)



DIVISION 2.  WRECKER SERVICE



Sec. 22-73.  Wrecker service list.



   (a)   Wrecker services shall provide twenty-four (24) hour service
seven (7) days per week, and shall respond to all emergency calls within
fifteen (15) minutes or less.  In addition, the wrecker service must have a
local telephone number to handle emergency calls on a twenty-four (24) hour
basis. Wrecker services will limit phone numbers to one (1) primary phone
number.



   (b)   The wrecker must have a minimum weight of one (1) ton, be
equipped with a motor driven winch,  and otherwise meet standard wrecker
specifications as may hereafter be determined by the City Commission from
time to time.  In addition, the wrecker must be equipped with one (1) ABC
fire extinguisher,  safety chains, broom, and shovel.  The wrecker service
is responsible for cleaning all debris from streets and property disposing of
same when called to the scene of an accident.



   (c)   The wrecker service must provide a copy of their
identification card through Kentucky Department of Transportation, Division
of Motor Carriers.  The wrecker service must have lighting appropriately to
be distinguished from other vehicles.  Each wrecker service must be capable
of towing imported vehicles not designed to be towed by conventional methods.



   (d)   The wrecker must impose a reasonable agreed charge for towed
and transported vehicles. (See Appendix A).  Wrecker services are prohibited
from charging more for services rendered pursuant to this article than they
would charge for identical services to private customers. Wrecker services
shall further notify the city of any intended increases in wrecker service
charges at least thirty (30) days prior to and after the City Commission has
granted permission to the implementation of those new charges.



   (e)   The wrecker service shall have personnel available during
reasonable business hours to provide information to the city and vehicles
owners,  owner's agency or representative concerning the transportation of
storage of towed motor vehicles and their release.



   (f)   The wrecker service shall be responsible for all losses,
theft,  or damages to vehicles from the time they are towed until the
vehicle is released to the owner, a dealership, auto repair, or storage
facility.



   (g)   The wrecker service shall provide a secured inside and outside
storage with an alarm system for vehicles that may require holding for
processing,  or other special needs,  and if a vehicle held on the
impoundment lot, no per day cost will be added to the towing bill when it is
being held at the request of the Police Department.



   (h)   The wrecker service shall employ only those operators holding
a valid Kentucky Operator's license without conditions or restrictions that
would impair the driver's ability to operate wrecker equipment  (see
Appendix C),  and shall not sublet any wrecker services to any third parties.



   (i)   Any wrecker service contacted by the police department must
provide the city with certificates of insurance insuring said wrecker service
against theft,  vandalism,  personal injury, damages or other casualty
losses in amounts and on such terms as are prescribed by the Kentucky
Department of transportation. Said insurance shall provide coverage for the
wrecker,  the towed vehicle and storage lot.    The wrecker service must
provide the city with annual renewals of said insurance and the insurance
policy must show the city as an additional insured.



   (j)   The wrecker service must furnish an adequate record system for
all motor vehicles and property towed and stored, and adequate storage for
all personal property if removed from vehicle. 



   (k)   Said record shall contain information including but not
limited to, a log indicating vehicle description (make, model, license, VIN
number,  color,  etc.),  along with the date and time of the wrecker
service on each call for service.    A copy of this record must be turned
into the Chief of Police by the first day of every month.  (See Appendix B).

storage facility must meet the city planning and zoning specifications for
storage of vehicles within a specified area.



   (b)   Inclusion of wrecker service and their storage facilities on
service list shall not be construed as an employment or contractual
relationship between the city and said business or facility, and the city
assumes no liability by virtue of this article for damages claimed by vehicle
owners, or any and all other persons who may present a claim for damages
against the city in connection with the towing, repair and/or storage of a
motor vehicle.

Wrecker Service Requirements and Restrictions




      (1)   If the gross combined weight rating (GCWR) of the tow
truck and its towed vehicle is 26,001 pounds or more, and the towed vehicle
alone exceeds 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR), then the
driver needs a Group A CDL.  If the GVWR of the tow truck alone is 26,001
pounds or more, and the driver either (a) drives the tow truck without a
vehicle in tow, or (b) drives the tow truck with a towed vehicle of 10,000
pounds or less GVWR, then the driver needs a Group B CDL.  A driver of a tow
truck or towing configuration that does not fit either configuration
description above, requires a Group C CDL only if he or she tows a vehicle
required to be placarded for hazardous materials on a "subsequent move,"
i.e., after the initial movement of the disabled vehicle to the nearest
storage or repair facility.



      (2)   All owners and operators must submit to the chief of
police a legible color copy of their valid Kentucky Operator's license prior
to towing for the Police Department.  Furthermore, an operator cannot have a
DUI (Driving under the Influence of intoxicants) conviction within the past
12-month period nor can an operator have had two (2) DUI convictions within
the last 60-month period.  Neither an owner nor operator can have any felony
convictions, nor can they have any serious misdemeanor convictions within the
previous five (5) years that may be detrimental or discredit the reputation
of the Nicholasville Police Department or the City of Nicholasville. 
Determination of what constitutes serious misdemeanor offenses will be
determined by the chief of police.

schedules shall be subject to the power cost adjustment clause charges in
addition to the aforesaid rates. The power cost adjustment (PCA) is expressed
as dollars per kwh and is multiplied by the energy (kwh) sold during each
billing period to each customer.  The PCA is designed to be calculated
monthly based on actual power costs and energy sales for the applicable
month.  The following formula has been designed to calculate the PCA:



      PCA = A/B - Base Rate where,



      PCA = The cost adjustment expressed as dollars per kwh to be
multiplied by the energy (kwh) sold during each billing period to customers
on rates subject to the PCA.



      A = Actual wholesale power cost for the applicable month
(includes all wholesale power costs as billed by Kentucky Utilities).



      B - Actual energy sales from rates subject to the PCA for the
applicable month.



      Base Rate = The base rate is the base wholesale power cost,
exclusive of SEPA power cost, expressed as dollars per kwh, included in the
base rates for all retail customers.



   (c)   Determination of maximum billable load by including power
corrected to ninety  percent (90%).  The city reserves the right to place a
KVA meter on selected customer.  The power factor will be determined by KW
at time of peak demand divided by KVA at time of peak demand.



      (KW,  KVA = Actual power factor)



      KW = P.F.



      KVA



KW billable will be adjusted as follows: KW at maximum demand x ninety
percent (90%) power factor divided by actual power factor equals billable KW.



      (KW x 90,  Actual P.F. = adjusted KW)



      KW x 90 = Billable KW)



      power factor



   The above calculation is used to adjust the billable KW demand only in
the months in which the power factor is below ninety percent (90%).



   The aforementioned formula will provide the city a method to recover
its additional power factor related costs in a manner similar to the method
used by the city's supplier, Kentucky Utilities.

Sec. 23-109.  General discharge prohibitions.



   (a)   It shall be unlawful to discharge or cause to be discharged to
the public sewerage system the following described substances, materials,
water, or wastes if it appears likely, in the opinion of the superintendent,
that such wastes may harm the sewers, wastewater treatment process or
equipment; have an adverse effect on the receiving stream; may otherwise
endanger life, limb, or public property; or constitute a nuisance.  In
forming his opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the
superintendent shall give consideration to such factors as the quantities of
subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewer, materials of
construction of the sewers, nature of the wastewater treatment process,
capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes
in the wastewater treatment plant, and other pertinent factors.  These
general prohibitions apply to all such users of a POTW whether or not the
user is subject to national categorical pretreatment standards or any other
national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 
Discharges prohibited are:



      (1)   Any liquid or vapor having temperatures higher than one
hundred fifty (150) degrees Fahrenheit (sixty-five (65) degrees Celsius).



      (2)   Any water or waste containing fats wax, grease, or oils,
whether emulsified or not, in excess of one hundred (100) mg/l or containing
substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between
thirty-two (32) degrees Fahrenheit and one hundred fifty (150) degrees
Fahrenheit (zero (0) degrees and sixty-five (65) degrees Celsius).



      (3)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded.  The
installation and operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor of
three-fourths (3/4) horsepower or greater shall be subject to the review and
approval of the superintendent.



      (4)   Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their
nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction
with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other
way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW.  At no time shall two (2)
successive readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge
into the system (or at any point in the system) be more than five percent
(5%) nor any single reading over ten percent (10%) of the lower explosive
limit (LEL) of the meter.



      (5)   Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction
to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the
wastewater treatment facilities.



      (6)   Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or greater than
10.5, or any wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of
causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and/or personnel of the
POTW.



      (7)   Any waters or wastes containing toxic substances or
pollutants to such degree that they either singularly or by interaction with
other pollutants constitute a hazard to humans or animals or inhibit or
damage the wastewater treatment processes or tend to concentrate in the
wastewater sludge to such a level that prevents the use of acceptable sludge
disposal methods or pass through the treatment process unremoved and at such
concentration that causes a violation of effluent limitations or water
quality standards which are or may be established by state or federal
agencies having jurisdiction.  A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be
limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act.



      (8)   Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids
which either singularly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to
create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry
into the sewers for their maintenance or repair.



      (9)   Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any
other product of the POTW, such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be
unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation
process where the POTW is pursuing a reuse and reclamation program.  In no
case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in
noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines, or
regulations developed under Section 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines,
or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the
Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control
Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used.



      (10)   Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its
KPDES and/or state disposal system permit or the receiving water quality
standards.



      (11)   Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in
the treatment process.



      (12)   Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit
biological activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference,
but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the
POTW which exceeds forty (40) degrees Celsius (one hundred four (104) degrees
Fahrenheit).



      (13)   Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants
(BOD, etc.), released at a flow and/or pollutant concentration which will
cause interference to the POTW.  In no case shall a discharge have a flow
rate or contain concentration or qualities or pollutants that exceed for any
time period longer than fifteen (15) minutes more than five (5) times the
average twenty-four (24) hour concentration, quantities, or flow during
normal operations.



      (14)   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or
isotopes.



      (15)   Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or
creates a public nuisance.



      (16)   Any waste(s) or wastewater(s) classified as a hazardous
waste by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) without a 60-day
prior notification of such discharge to the wastewater superintendent.  This
notification must include the name of the hazardous waste, the EPA hazardous
waste number, type of discharge, volume/mass of discharge and time of
occurrence(s).  The wastewater superintendent may prohibit or place
conditions on the discharge(s) at any time.



   (b)   When the superintendent determines that a user(s) is
contributing to the POTW any of the above enumerated substances in such
amounts as to interfere with the operation of the POTW, the superintendent
shall:



      (1)   Advise the user(s) of the impact of the contribution on
the POTW; and



      (2)   Require such user to correct the interference with the
POTW.



   (c)   Additional specific user requirements and discharge
limitations are contained in section 23-112.

Sec. 23-110.  Federal categorical pretreatment standards.



   Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards
for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more
stringent than limitations imposed under this division for sources in that
subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this
division. The superintendent shall notify all affected users of the
applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12.

Sec. 23-111.  Modification of federal categorical pretreatment standards.



   Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent
removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may
apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the
federal pretreatment standards. “Consistent removal” shall mean reduction
in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by
the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the
effluent which is achieved by the system in ninety-five percent (95%) of the
samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in Section
403.7(c)(2) of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Part 403
“General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of
Pollution,” promulgated pursuant to the Act. The city may modify pollutant
discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements
contained in 40 CFR, Part 403, Section 403.7, are fulfilled and prior
approval from the approval authority is obtained.

Sec. 23-114.  Grease, oil and sand interceptors.



   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the utility director/superintendent, they are necessary for the
proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease in excessive
amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except
that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or
dwelling units.  All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved
by the utility director/superintendent and shall be located as to be readily
and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.  In the maintaining of
these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal
and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain
records of the dates and means of disposal.  The city may require reporting
of such information for their review.  Any removal and hauling of the
collected materials not performed by the owner(s) personnel must be performed
by currently licensed waste disposal firms.  Interceptors shall also comply
with applicable regulations of the county health department.

Sec. 23-118.  Accidental discharges.



   (a)   Generally.  Each user shall provide protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by
this division.  Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's own cost
and expense.  Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be submitted to the superintendent for review
and shall be approved by the superintendent before construction of the
facility.  All existing users shall complete such a plan within ninety (90)
days after the effective date of this division.  Construction shall be
completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after approval of plans and
notification by the superintendent.  No user who commences contribution to
the POTW after the effective date of this division shall be permitted to
introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures
have been approved by the superintendent.  Review and approval of such plans
and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this division.  In the case of an accidental discharge, it
is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the
POTW of the incident within 24 hours of becoming aware of the accidental
discharge.  The notification shall include location of discharge, type of
waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions taken and to be taken.



   (b)   Written notice.  Within five (5) days following an accidental
discharge, the user shall submit to the superintendent a detailed written
report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the user to prevent similar future occurrences.  Such notifications shall
not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which
may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of
any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this
division or other applicable law.



   (c)   Notice to employees.  A notice shall be permanently posted on
the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to
call in the event of a dangerous discharge.  Employers shall ensure that all
employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.

         The superintendent will evaluate the data furnished by the
user and may require additional information.  After evaluation and
acceptance of the date furnished, the superintendent may issue a wastewater
contribution permit subject to terms and conditions provided herein.



      (3)   Permit issuance.  The wastewater contribution permit
must be issued prior to commencement of discharge.  The utility manager may
withhold or discontinue water service until the discharge permit is issued. 
All new source categorical industries shall be capable of achieving
compliance with this division upon commencement of discharge.  The WWTP
superintendent shall provide notice to each significant industrial user of
the issuance of the user's wastewater contribution permit.  Any person,
including the user, may petition the WWTP superintendent to reconsider the
terms of a permit within fifteen (15) days of notice of its issuance.



         a.   Failure to submit a timely petition for review
shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal.



         b.   In its petition, the appealing party must indicate
the permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection and the
alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the permit.



         c.    The effectiveness of the permit shall not be
stayed during the appeal.



         d.   The WWTP superintendent may forward the appeal to
the utility manager for review.  If the utility manager fails to act within
thirty (30) days of receipt of the appeal, a request for reconsideration
shall be deemed to be denied.  Decisions by the utility manager not to
reconsider a permit, not to issue a permit, or not to modify a permit shall
be considered final administrative actions for purposes of judicial review.



         e.   Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the
final administrative action and/or the permit must do so by filing a
complaint with the Jessamine County Circuit Court in accordance with the
appropriate procedures of that court and any statute of limitations.



      (4)   Permit modifications.  The WWTP superintendent may
modify a wastewater contribution permit for good cause, including, but not
limited to, the following reasons:



         a.   To incorporate any new or revised federal, state or
local pretreatment standards or requirements;



         b.   To address significant alterations or additions to
the user's operation, processes or wastewater volume or character since the

compliance beyond that required by applicable federal, state or local law.



      (6)   Permit duration.  Permits shall be issued for a
specified time period not to exceed five (5) years.  A permit may be issued
for a period less than one (1) year or may be stated to expire on a specific
date.  The user shall apply for permit reissuance at least thirty (30) days
prior to the expiration of the user's existing permit.  The terms and
conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the city during
the term of the permit as limitations or requirements, as identified in
sections 23-109 through 23-118, are modified or other just cause exists. 
The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his permit at least
thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the modification.  Any
modifications or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time
schedule for compliance.



      (7)   Permit transfer.  Wastewater discharge permits are
issued to a specific user for a specific operation.  A wastewater discharge
permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new
user, different premises, or a new or changed operation without the approval
of the utility director/superintendent.  Any succeeding owner or user shall
also comply with the terms and conditions of the existing permit.



   (c)   Reporting requirements for permittee.



      (1)   Compliance date report.  Within ninety (90) days
following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment
standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the
introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to pretreatment
standards and requirements shall submit to the superintendent a report
indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge
from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment standards and
requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units
in the user facility which are limited by such pretreatment standards or
requirements.  The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not,
what additional pretreatment and time schedule is necessary to bring the user
into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. 
This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
industrial user.  Where compliance schedules are required, the following
conditions shall apply:



         a.   The schedule shall contain progress increments in
the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading
to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the
user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but
are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final
plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing
construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation);



         b.   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine
(9) months;



         c.   The user shall submit a progress report to the WWTP
superintendent no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the
schedule and the final date of compliance including, at a minimum, whether or
not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay,
and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the
established schedule.



      (2)   Periodic compliance reports.



         a.   Any user subject to pretreatment standards, after
the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new
source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to
the superintendent during the months of June and December, unless required
more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the superintendent, a
report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent
which are limited by such pretreatment standards.  In addition, this report
shall include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period
exceeded the average daily flow reported in paragraph (b)(4) of this
section.  At the discretion of the superintendent and in consideration of
such factors as local high or low rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the
superintendent may agree to alter the months during which the above reports
are to be submitted.  The report shall also include the chain-of-custody
(COG) forms, field data and any other information required by the WWTP
superintendent.  All periodic compliance reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12 and section 23-000 of this chapter.



         b.   The superintendent may impose mass limitations on
users where their imposition is appropriate.  In such cases, the report
required by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. 
These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the
discharge including the flow and the nature and concentration or production
and mass, where requested by the superintendent, of pollutants contained
therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards.  The
frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment
standard.  Where an effluent from a categorical industrial process(es) is
mixed prior to treatment with wastewater other than that generated by the
regulated process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived for the
discharge permit by the wastewater superintendent.  These alternative limits
shall be applied to the mixed effluent and shall be calculated using the
combined wastestream formula and/or flow-weighted average formula as defined
in 40 CFR 403.  Where the effluent limits in a categorical pretreatment
standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutants per unit of
production (production-based standard), the wastewater superintendent may
convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or of effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent permit limitations applicable to the permittee.  The
permittee shall be subject to all permit limits calculated in this manner
under 40 CFR 403.6(c) and must fully comply with these alternative limits. 
All categorical users subject to production-based standards must report
production rates annually so that alternative permit limits can be calculated
if necessary.  The categorical user must notify the wastewater
superintendent thirty (30) days in advance of any major change in production
levels that will affect the limits for the discharge permit.  All wastewater
samples must be representative of the user's discharge.  Wastewater
monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept
clean and maintained in good working order at all times.  The failure of a
user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be
grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its
discharge.  All analysis shall be performed by a laboratory acceptable to
the city.  Analytical procedures shall be in accordance with procedures
established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
administrator pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR,
Part 136, and amended thereto, or with any other test procedures approved by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency administrator.  Sampling
shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency administrator.  Except as indicated
in items (a) and (b) below in this paragraph, the user must collect
wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the WWTP superintendent.  Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the WWTP superintendent, the
samples must be representative of the discharge.  Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA
guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols and
sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field;
for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in
the laboratory.  Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the WWTP superintendent, as appropriate.  In addition, grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.  (a)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides
and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.  (b) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
90-day compliance reports required in 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of
four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which
historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical
sampling data are available, the WWTP superintendent may authorize a lower
minimum.  For the reports required by 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h), the
industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary
to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements.



         c.   Where 40 CFR, Part 136, as amended, does not
include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures
set forth in the EP publication "Sampling and Analysis Procedures for
Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants," April 1977, and
amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures
approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
administrator.  Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter
shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements
and documentation associated with best management practices as may be
required.  Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of
sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used and the results of such analyses.  These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three (3) years.  This period shall
automatically be extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the
user or the city or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention by the WWTP superintendent.  All sampling analyses done in
accordance with approved federal EPA procedures by the industrial user during
a reporting period, whether required by the city or not, shall be submitted
to the WWTP superintendent.  The industrial user must receive the approval
of the WWTP superintendent before changing the sampling point and/or
monitoring facilities to be used in all required sampling.



      (3)   Baseline monitoring report.



         a.   A baseline monitoring report (BMR) must be
submitted to the WWTP superintendent by all categorical industrial users at
least ninety (90) days prior to initiation of discharge to the sanitary
sewer.  The BMR must contain, at a minimum, the following:



            1.   Production data: a process description, SIC
code number, raw materials used, chemicals used, final product, pretreatment
industrial category (if applicable), and a schematic which indicates points
of discharge to the sewer system.



            2.   Identifying information to include name,
address of facility, owner(s), contact person and any other permits held by
the facility.



            3.   Wastewater characteristics: total plant flow,
types of discharges, average and maximum flows from each process.



            4.   Nature/concentration of pollutants:
analytical results for all pollutants regulated by this division and/or any
applicable federal pretreatment standard and sample type and location.  All
analyses must conform with 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto.



            5.   Information concerning any pretreatment
equipment used to treat the facility's discharge.



            6.   Compliance certification.  A statement,
reviewed by the user's authorized representative as defined in Article
I(B)(4) and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.



            7.   Compliance schedule.  If additional
pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards,
the shortest schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established
for the applicable pretreatment standard.  A compliance schedule pursuant to
this section must meet the requirements set out in § 52.52 of this chapter.



         b.   New sources shall give estimates of the information
requested in subsections (c)(3)a.3. and (c)(3)a.4. above, but at no time
shall a new source commence discharge(s) to the public sewer of substances
that do not meet all provisions of this division.  All new sources must be
in compliance with all provisions of this division and state and federal
pretreatment regulations prior to commencement of discharge to the public
sewer.



      (4)   Compliance schedule progress reports.  The following
conditions shall apply to all compliance schedules required by this division:



         a.   The schedule shall contain progress increments in
the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading
to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the
user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards.



         b.   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine
(9) months.



         c.   The user shall submit a progress report to the WWTP
superintendent no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the
schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or
not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay,
and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the
established schedule; and in no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse
between such progress reports to the WWTP superintendent.



   (d)   Monitoring facilities.  The city shall require significant
users to provide and operate, at the user's expense, monitoring facilities to
allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or
internal drainage systems.  The monitoring facility will ordinarily be
located on the user's premises but the city may, when such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be
constructed in a public right-of-way.  The superintendent shall review and
approve the location, plans, and specifications for such monitoring
facilities and may require the facilities to be constructed to provide for
separate monitoring and sampling of industrial waste and sanitary sewage
flows.  All sampling and monitoring facilities shall be constructed in
accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction
standards and specifications.  Construction shall be completed within ninety
(90) days following approval of the location plans and specifications.



   (e)   Inspection and sampling.  The city shall inspect the
facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this division is
being met and all requirements are being complied with.  Persons or
occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow
the city or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination or in the performance of any of their duties.  The city approval
authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance
monitoring and/or metering operations.  Where a user has security measures
in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry
into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their
security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification,
personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to
enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific
responsibilities.



   (f)   Pretreatment.  Users shall provide necessary wastewater
treatment as required to comply with this division and shall achieve
compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the
time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations.  Any
facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city
shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense.  Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before
construction of the facility.  The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the
city under the provisions of this division.  Any subsequent changes in the
pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be
acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes.



      (1)   The city shall annually publish in a newspaper of
general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the
jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the users which were not in
compliance with any pretreatment requirements or standards at least once
during the twelve (12) previous months.  EPA guidelines will be utilized in
determining those industries that can be classified in "significant
noncompliance" of the division.



      (2)   All records relating to the compliance with pretreatment
standards shall be made available to officials of the EPA or approval
authority upon request.



   (g)   Confidential information.  Information and data on a user
obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits,
monitoring programs, and from inspections shall be available to the public or
other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically
requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods
of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.



      (1)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made
available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to
this division, the KPDES permit, sludge disposal system permit, and/or the
pretreatment programs, provided, however, that such portions of a report
shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial
review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report.  Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized
as confidential information.



      (2)   Information accepted by the city as confidential shall
not be transmitted to other parties unless Nicholasville is ordered to do so
by a court or other authority of competent jurisdiction.



   (h)   Signatory requirements and certification.  All applications,
reports or information submitted to the city shall be signed and certified in
accordance with the following requirements.  Written designation of the
signatory official must be received by the city prior to acceptance of any
application or other required document.



      (1)   All permit applications shall be signed:



         a.   For a corporation: by a principal executive officer
of at least the level of vice-president;



         b.   For a partnership or sole proprietorship: by a
general partner or the proprietor, respectively;



      (2)   All other correspondence, reports and self-monitoring
reports shall be signed by a person described above or by a duly authorized
representative of that person.  A person is a duly authorized representative
only if:



         a.   The authorization is made in writing by a person
described above;



         b.   The authorization specifies either an individual or
a position having facility or activity, such as the position of plant
manager, manager or position of equivalent responsibility.



      (3)   Certification.  Any person signing a document under
this section shall make the following written certification:



         "I certify under penally of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance
with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and
evaluate the information submitted.  Based on my inquiry of the person(s)
who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering
the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge
and belief, true, accurate and complete.  I am aware that there are

Sec. 23-121.  Enforcement.



   (a)   Harmful contributions.  The utility director/superintendent
may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater contribution
permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the utility
director/superintendent, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons or the environment, causes interference to the
POTW, or causes the utility director/superintendent to violate any condition
of its KPDES permit.



      Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately stop or
eliminate the contribution.  In the event of a failure of the person to
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the utility
director/superintendent shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals.  The utility
director/superintendent shall reinstate the wastewater contribution permit
and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the
noncompliant discharge.  A detailed written statement submitted by the user
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the utility
director/superintendent within fifteen (15) days of the date of occurrence.



   (b)   Revocation of permit.  Any user who violates the following
conditions of this division or applicable state and federal regulations is
subject to revocation of its permit.



      (1)   Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of his discharge.



      (2)   Failure of the user to report significant changes in
operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics.



      (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for
the purpose of inspection or monitoring.



      (4)   Violation of conditions of the permit.



   (c)   Notification of violation.



      (1)   Whenever the utility director/superintendent finds that
any user has violated or is violating this division, wastewater contribution
permit, or any prohibition or limitation of requirements contained herein,
the utility director/superintendent may serve upon such person a written
notice stating the nature of the violation.  Within thirty (30) days of the
date of the notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be
submitted to the utility director/superintendent by the user.



      (2)   If sampling performed by an individual user indicates a
violation, the user shall notify the control authority within twenty-four
(24) hours.  The user shall repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results to the control authority within thirty (30) days after becoming aware
of the violation.  Exception to this regulation is only if the control
authority performs sampling within the same time period for the same
pollutant in question.



   (d)   Show cause hearing.



      (1)   The city may order any user who causes or allows an
unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause before the city
commission why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.  A
notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing
to be held by the city council regarding the violation, the reasons why the
action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the
user to show cause before the city commission why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken.  The notice of the hearing shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least ten (10) days before the hearing.  Service may be made on any agent or
officer of a corporation.



      (2)   The city commission of Nicholasville may itself conduct
the hearing or may designate one of its members or an employee of the city to
do so.



      (3)   A user who has requested a hearing shall be given timely
notice of the time and place of such hearing and shall have the right to
present all relevant evidence on behalf of the user by testimony of witnesses
and demonstrative evidence of its choosing.



      (4)   Such hearing shall be conducted as an administrative,
evidentiary hearing with testimony taken under oath and recorded
stenographically.



      (5)   Upon a finding by the city commission of Nicholasville
that a user is in violation, the city commission may issue such orders as may
be necessary to procure compliance by the user or to terminate the
violations, including ordering sewer service suspended until appropriate
corrective action is taken, the imposition of civil penalties as herein below
provided, assessment of the reasonable costs related to the hearing, and such
further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate.



   (e)   Legal action.  If any person discharges sewage, industrial
wastes, or other wastes into the city's wastewater disposal system contrary
to the provisions of this division, federal or state pretreatment
requirements or any order of the city, the city attorney may commence an
action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the (circuit) court
of this county.

Sec. 26-1.  Purpose; intent.



   (a)   The purpose of this article is to provide for the health,
safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Nicholasville through the
regulation of non-storm water discharges to the storm drainage system to the
maximum extent practicable as required by federal and state law. This article
establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the
municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with
requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit process. The objectives of this article are:



      (1)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) by storm water discharges by any
user;



      (2)   To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the
municipal separate storm sewer system; and



      (3)   To establish legal authority to carry out all
inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure
compliance with this article.



   (b)   The requirements of this article should be considered minimum
requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions
different from those imposed by any other applicable ordinance, rule, or
regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more
restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the
environment shall be considered to take precedence.

Sec. 26-6.  Ultimate responsibility.



   The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this article
are minimum standards; therefore this article does not intend nor imply that
compliance by any person, firm, or other entity will ensure that there will
be no contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants and
do not relieve this person, firm, or other entity from complying with any
local, state, or federal regulation that address illicit discharges or any
other pollutant discharges. If these minimum standards prove inadequate, it
is the ultimate responsibility of the person, firm, or other entity to
provide additional measures to prevent illicit discharge or other pollutant
discharges.

   The code enforcement board or other authorized enforcement agency may,
without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment,
or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United
States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an
emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the
Commonwealth, or to minimize danger to persons.

Sec. 26-31.  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge.



   Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have
their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an
illicit discharge. The code enforcement board will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city
for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person
reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section,
without the prior approval of the code enforcement board.

Sec. 26-51.  Access to facilities.



   (a)   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this article.  If a discharger has security
measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before
entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements
to allow access to representatives of the city.



   (b)   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of a NPDES
permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties
as defined by state and federal law.



   (c)   Upon notifying the owner or owner's representative, the city
shall have the right to immediate access to the property to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city
to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge
and/or suspected illicit discharge.



   (d)   The city has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.



   (e)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access
to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by
the operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.



   (f)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city to a permitted
facility, as described in subsection (c) of this section, is a violation of
any applicable storm water discharge permit and of this article.  A person
who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge storm
water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person
denies the city reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose
of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article.



   (g)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which storm water is discharged, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community or environment, then the city may seek issuance of a
search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

Sec. 26-60.  Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce storm water
pollutants by the use of best management practices.



   The city identified best management practices (BMPs) for any activity,
operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or
contamination of storm water, the storm water system, or waters of the
Commonwealth. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the
municipal storm water system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be
deemed in compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs are part
of the city BMP manual that is hereby incorporated by reference as a part of
this article. A copy of the BMP manual is located at city hall, 517 North
Main Street. This document may be viewed or copied at city hall during normal
operating hours.

ARTICLE II.  STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM



DIVISION 1.  GENERAL PROVISIONS



Sec. 26-200.  Findings of fact.



   (a)   It is hereby determined that:



      (1)   Land development projects and associated increases in
impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase storm water runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel
erosion, and sediment transport and deposition;



      (2)   This storm water runoff contributes to increased
quantities of waterborne pollutants;



      (3)   Storm water runoff, soil erosion and non-point source
pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of storm
water runoff from development sites; and



      (4)   Buffers adjacent to stream systems and coastal areas
provide numerous environmental protection and resource management benefits
which can include: restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical and
biological integrity of the water resources; removing pollutants delivered in
urban storm water; reducing erosion and controlling sedimentation;
stabilizing stream banks; providing infiltration of storm water runoff;
maintaining base flow of streams; contributing the organic matter that is a
source of food and energy for the aquatic ecosystem; providing tree canopy to
shade streams and promote desirable aquatic organisms; providing riparian
wildlife habitat; and furnishing scenic value and recreational opportunity.



   (b)   Therefore, the city establishes this set of water quality and
quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable
guidance for the regulation of storm water runoff for the purpose of
protecting local water resources from degradation and to protect and maintain
the native vegetation in riparian and wetland areas. It is determined that
the regulation of storm water runoff discharges from land development
projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize
increases in storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream
channel erosion, and non-point source pollution associated with storm water
runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health
and safety.

Sec. 26-201.  Purpose.



   The purpose of this article is to establish minimum storm water
management and vegetative buffer requirements and controls to protect and
safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in
watersheds within this jurisdiction. This article seeks to meet that purpose
through the following objectives:



   (a)   Minimize increases in storm water runoff from any development
in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and
stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels;



   (b)   Minimize increases in non-point source pollution caused by
storm water runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;



   (c)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which
flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed
the pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable;



   (d)   Reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and
non-point source pollution, wherever possible, through storm water management
controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained
and pose no threat to public safety;



   (e)   Establish minimal acceptable requirements for the design of
buffers to protect the streams, wetlands and floodplains of the city; and



   (f)   Protect the water quality of watercourses, reservoirs, lakes,
riparian and aquatic ecosystems, and other significant water resources within
this jurisdiction.

Sec. 26-202.  Applicability.



   (a)   This article shall be applicable to all subdivision or site
plan applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by
the planning commission under the specifications of Division 3 of this
article. This article also applies to land development activities that are
smaller than one (1) acre if such activities are part of a larger common plan
of development that meets the following applicability criteria, even though
multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at
different times on different schedules. In addition, all plans must also be
reviewed by the planning commission to ensure that established water quality
standards will be maintained during and after development of the site and
that post construction runoff levels are consistent with any local and
regional watershed plans.



   (b)   To prevent the adverse impacts of storm water runoff, the city
has developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new
development sites. These standards apply to any construction activity
disturbing one (1) or more acre(s) of land. The following activities may be
exempt from these storm water performance criteria:



      (1)   Any logging and agricultural activity which is
consistent with an approved soil conservation plan or a timber management
plan prepared or approved by the city as applicable.



      (2)   Additions or modifications to existing single-family and
duplex structures.



      (3)   Developments that do not disturb more than one (1) acre
of land, provided they are not part of a larger common development plan.



      (4)   Repairs to any storm water treatment practice deemed
necessary by the city.



   (c)   When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a
redevelopment project as defined in section 26-206 of this article, decisions
on permitting and on-site storm water requirements shall be governed by
special storm water sizing criteria found in the most current edition of the
best management practices (BMP) manual. These criteria are dependent on the
amount of impervious area created by the redevelopment and its impact on
water quality. Final authorization of all redevelopment projects will be
determined after a review by the city.

information in the form of a BMP manual.



   (b)   This manual will include a list of acceptable storm water
treatment practices, including the specific design criteria and operation and
maintenance requirements for each storm water practice. The manual may be
updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the local review
authority, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and

DIVISION 3.  WAIVERS TO STORM WATER MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS



Sec. 26-230.  Waivers for providing storm water management.



   (a)   Every applicant shall provide for storm water management as
required by this article, unless a written request is filed to waive this
requirement. Requests to waive the storm water management plan requirements
shall be submitted to the planning commission for approval.



   (b)   The minimum requirements for storm water management may be
waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided
that at least one of the following conditions applies:



      (1)   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is
not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this article.



      (2)   Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management
of storm water discharges (such as low impact development, LID) have been
established in a storm water management plan that has been approved by the
City of Nicholasville and the implementation of the plan is required by local
ordinance.



      (3)   Provisions are made to manage storm water by an off-site
facility. The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed
and adequately sized to provide a level of storm water control that is equal
to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and
there is a legally obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and
maintenance of the storm water practice.



      (4)   The planning commission finds that meeting the minimum
on-site management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or
existing physical characteristics of a site.



      (5)   Non-structural practices will be used on-site that
reduce: the generation of storm water from the site, the size and cost of
storm water storage and the pollutants generated at the site. These
non-structural practices (LID or other) are explained in detail in the most
current edition of the BMP manual and the amount of credit available for
using such practices determined by the planning commission.



   (c)   In instances where one of the conditions in subsection (b)
above applies, the City of Nicholasville may grant a waiver from strict
compliance with these storm water management provisions, as long as
acceptable mitigation measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a
variance, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the planning
commission that the variance will not result in the following impacts to
downstream waterways:



      (1)   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and
other structures;



      (2)   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;



      (3)   Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or
siltation; and



      (4)   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life,
or property.



   (d)   Furthermore, where compliance with minimum requirements for
storm water management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the minimum
requirements by meeting one of the mitigation measures selected by the
jurisdictional storm water authority. Mitigation measures may include, but
are not limited to, the following:



      (1)   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or
the grant of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or
reforestation. These lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor
in order to provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and
aquatic habitat;



      (2)   The creation of a storm water management facility or
other drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or
private, that currently lack storm water management facilities designed and
constructed in accordance with the purposes and standards of this article; and



      (3)   Monetary contributions (fee-in-lieu) to fund storm water
management activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland
delineation studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and
macroinvertebrates), stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered
species studies, hydrologic studies), and monitoring of storm water
management practices.

Sec. 26-231.  Fee in lieu of storm water management practices.



   (a)   Where the planning commission waives all or part of the
minimum storm water management requirements, or where the waiver is based on
the provision of adequate storm water facilities provided downstream of the
proposed development, the applicant shall be required to pay a fee in an
amount as determined by the planning commission.



   (b)   When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required storm water
management, the monetary contribution required shall be established by the 
and based on cost estimate for the cubic feet of storage required for storm
water management of the development in question. All of the monetary
contributions shall be credited to an appropriate capital improvements
program project, and shall be made by the developer prior to the issuance of
any building and/or grading permit for the development.

Sec. 26-232.  Dedication of land.



   In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant may obtain a waiver of
the required storm water management by entering into an agreement with the
City of Nicholasville for the granting of an easement or the dedication of
land by the applicant, to be used for the construction of an off-site storm
water management facility. The agreement shall be entered into by the
applicant and the  City of Nicholasville prior to the recording of plats or,
if no record plat is required, prior to the issuance of the building and/or
grading permit.

Sec. 26-240  Storm water criteria.



   Unless judged by the City of Nicholasville to be exempt or granted a
waiver, the following performance criteria shall be addressed for storm water
management at all sites:



   (a)   All site designs shall establish storm water management
practices to control the peak flow rates of storm water discharge associated
with specified design storms and reduce the generation of storm water. These
practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for storm water treatment and
to infiltrate storm water runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking
lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide
treatment for both water quality and quantity.



   (b)   Stormwater management measures shall be required that are
designed, built, and maintained to treat, filter, flocculate, infiltrate,
screen, evapo-transpire. harvest and reuse stormwater runoff in order to
manage stormwater runoff quality and quantity.



   (c)   Structural and non-structural controls may be used to obtain
permanent stormwater management over the life of the property's use.
Structural stormwater controls include, but are not limited to. grass swales,
filter strips, infiltration basins, detention ponds, stormwater wetlands,
natural filtration areas, sand filters, and rain gardens. Non-structural BMPs
include, but are not limited to. open spaces, vegetated conveyances and
buffers, natural infiltration, and low impact development. See the BMP Manual
for additional information.



   (d)   Areas of development and re-development that result in new or
expanded discharge to high quality waters (HQWs) shall follow the "Standards
for Protection of HQWs" in Nicholasville's Stormwater Manual in order to
protect existing in-stream water uses and the level of water quality
necessary to protect existing uses.



   (e)   New development and redevelopment projects shall not discharge
untreated storm water directly into a jurisdictional wetland or local water
body without adequate treatment. Where such discharges are proposed, the
impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a
method acceptable to the planning commission. In no case shall the impact on
functional values be any less than allowed by the army corp of engineers
(ACE) or the  staff responsible for natural resources.



   (f)   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement
a storm water pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent
(NOI) under the provisions of the national pollutant discharge elimination
system (NPDES) general permit. The storm water pollution prevention plan
requirement applies to both existing and new industrial sites.



   (g)   Storm water discharges from land uses or activities with
higher potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots", may require the use
of specific structural and pollution prevention practices.



   (h)   Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the
planning commission to determine if they are subject to additional storm
water design requirements.



   (i)   The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the
BMP manual shall be used for sizing all storm water management practices.



   (l)   All new development and redevelopment plans shall, at a
minimum, maintain the existing forested buffer along all streams on site.

the specific storm frequency storage volumes (e.g., water quality, two (2)
year, ten (10) year, one hundred (100) year) as identified in the current 
BMP manual are met, unless the planning commission grants the applicant a
waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements.



   (b)   In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant
greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the
planning commission reserves the right to impose any and all additional
requirements deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of
runoff.

Sec. 26-253  Pretreatment requirements.



   Every storm water treatment practice shall have an acceptable form of
water quality pretreatment, in accordance with the pretreatment requirements
found in the current BMP manual. Certain storm water treatment practices, as
specified in the BMP manual, are prohibited even with pretreatment in the
following circumstances:



   (a)   Storm water is generated from highly contaminated source areas
known as "hotspots".



   (b)   Storm water is carried in a conveyance system that also
carries contaminated, non-storm water discharges.



   (c)   Storm water is being managed in a designated groundwater
recharge area.



   (d)   Certain geologic conditions exist (e.g., karst) that prohibit
the proper pretreatment of storm water.

   The use of non-structural storm water treatment practices is encouraged
in order to minimize the reliance on structural practices. Credit in the form
of reductions in the amount of storm water that must be managed can be earned
through the use of non-structural practices that reduce the generation of
storm water and/or pollutants from the site. These non-structural practices
are explained in BMP manual and applicants wishing to obtain credit for use
of non-structural practices must ensure that these practices are documented
and remain unaltered by subsequent property owners.

   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, net
profits shall be apportioned as follows:



      (1)   For business entities with both payroll and sales
revenue in more than one (1) tax district, by multiplying the net profits by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in
subsection (b) of this section, plus the sales factor, described in
subsection (c) of this section, and the denominator of which is two (2); and



      (2)   For business entities with sales revenue in more than
one (1) tax district, by multiplying the net profits by the sales factor as
set forth in subsection (3) of this section.



   (b)   The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is
the total amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the
business entity for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total
compensation paid or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax
period. Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the
individual's service is performed within the city.



   (c)   The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
total sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period,
and the denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business
entity everywhere during the tax period.



      (1)   The sales, lease, or rental of tangible personal
property is in the city if:



         a.   The property is delivered or shipped to a
purchaser, other than the United States government, or to the designee of the
purchaser within the city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions
of the sale; or



         b.   The property is shipped from an office, store,
warehouse, factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser
is the United States government.



      (2)   Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease
or rental of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real
property, are apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of
which is the time spent in performing such income-producing activity within
the city and the denominator of which is the total time spent performing that
income- producing activity.



      (3)   Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real
property is allocated to the tax district where the property is located.



   (d)   If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly
represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the city, the
business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to
all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable:



      (1)   Separate accounting;



      (2)   The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors;



      (3)   The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors
which will fairly represent the business entity's business activity in the
city; or



      (4)   The employment of any other method to effectuate an
equitable allocation and apportionment of net profit.



   (e)   When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services
performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the
license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or
payable as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the
city. The license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the
compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to
the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to
verify the accuracy of a taxpayer' s reported percentages under this
subsection, the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records.



   (f)   All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where
income is "passed through" to the owners are subject to this chapter. The
occupational license tax imposed in this chapter is assessed against income
before it is "passed through" these entities to the owners.



   (g)   If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or
withdraws from the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in
any manner surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the
dissolution, cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of
charter shall not defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and
collection of any occupational license tax for the period of that taxable
year during which the business entity had business activity in the city



   (h)   If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal
income tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the
purposes of this chapter on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year
required by the federal government, and shall employ the same methods of
accounting required for federal income tax purposes.

employer is assessed by the city.

the corporate dissolution or withdrawal of the business entity from the city,
nor the cessation of holding any corporate office, shall discharge that
liability; provided that the personal and individual liability shall apply to
each and every person holding the corporate office at the time the tax
becomes or became obligated. No person shall be personally and individually
liable under this subsection unless such person had authority to collect,
truthfully account for, or pay over the tax imposed by this chapter at the
time that the taxes imposed by this chapter become or became due.



   (i)   Not withstanding subsections (g) and (h) of this section,
every employee receiving compensation in the city subject to the tax imposed
under Section 27-3 shall be personally liable for any amount due. In all
cases where the employer does not withhold the tax levied under this chapter
from the employee, such employee or employees shall be responsible for filing

   (j)   Employers not required to deduct and withhold tax under this
section shall annually during the month of January of each year, make a

safeguards as will protect the safety of the occupants and the public.
The Administrative Official shall maintain a record of all certificates of occupancy, and a copy
shall be furnished upon request to any person. Failure to obtain a certificate of occupancy

the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district
under the terms of this ordinance.
423.13 - That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions
of the applicant;
423.14 - That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any

variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this ordinance and
will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.

and safeguards in conformity with this ordinance. Violation of such conditions and
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be

ARTICLE 5
NONCONFORMITIES
500 INTENT - Within the districts established by this ordinance or amendments that may later
be adopted there exist lots, structures and uses of land and structures which were lawful before
this ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted
under the terms of this ordinance or future amendment. It is the intent of this ordinance to
permit these non-conformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival. It is further the intent of this ordinance that non-conformities shall not be enlarged
upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses
prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
501 INCOMPATIBILITY OF NON-CONFORMING USES - Non-conforming uses are
declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in districts in which the
use is located. A non-conforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not be
extended or enlarged after passage of this ordinance by attachment on a building or
premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of
other uses of a nature which would be generally prohibited in the district in which such use
is located.
502 AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP - To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this
ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use
of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this ordinance and upon which actual building construction
has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing
of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where
excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun
preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be
actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently.
510 NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD - In any district in which single-family
dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be
erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
ordinance notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this ordinance. Such lot
must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same
ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for
area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard
dimensions and requirements other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lot
shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard
requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Adjustment.
If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in
single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this ordinance and if all
or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands
involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this ordinance and
no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with
30
lot width and area requirements established by this ordinance nor shall any division or any
parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this
ordinance.
520 NON-CONFORMING USES OF LAND (OR LAND WITH MINOR STRUCTURES
ONLY) - Where at the time of passage of this ordinance lawful use of land exists which would
not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this ordinance and where such use involved no
individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding $2,500, the use may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
521 - No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a
greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this ordinance;
522 - No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the
lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this ordinance;
523 - If any such non-conforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more
than 12 months any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified
by this ordinance for the district in which such land is located;
524 - No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this ordinance shall be
erected in connection with such non-conforming use of land.
530 NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES - Where a lawful structure exists at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this
ordinance by reasons of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot,
or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
531 - No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its non-conformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease
its non-conformity, however, carports, porches and accessory buildings may be altered if
they are in compliance with the following:
a) Carports and porches which do not have the necessary side yard setback may be
enclosed if all three of the following are met:
1. Share a common roof with the principal structure.
2. Were in existence prior to the adoption of these regulations.
3. The owner does not own or cannot purchase adjacent
property as specified by these regulations.
b) Accessory buildings which do not have the necessary side or rear yard setbacks may
have additions made to them if all three of the following are met:
31
1. The addition shall not be positioned any closer to the property line than the
existing accessory building.
2. The value of the existing accessory structure is $2,500 or less before any
additions are made.
3. The accessory building was in existence prior to the regulations.
532 - Should such non-conforming structure or non-conforming portion of structure be
destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty (50%) percent of its replacement
cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of this ordinance.
533 - Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall
thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
540 NON-CONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND
PREMISES IN COMBINATION - If lawful use involving individual structures with
replacement cost of $2,500 or more, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that would not be allowed in the
district under the terms of this ordinance the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
541 - No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in
which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or
structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the
district in which it is located;
542 - Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which
were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of
this ordinance but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building;
543 - If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use of a structure, or
structure and premises, may as a conditional use be changed to another non-conforming use
provided that the Board of Adjustment, either by general rule or by making findings in the
specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to
the district than the existing non-conforming use. In permitting such change the Board of
Adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions
of this ordinance;
544 - Any structure, or structure and land in combination, or on which a non-conforming
use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
district, and the non-conforming use may not thereafter be resumed;
545 - When a non-conforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination,
is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for 18 months during any three32
year period (except when government action impeded access to the premises), the structure,
or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity
with the regulations of the district in which it is located;
546 - Where non-conforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination,
removal or destruction of the structures shall eliminate the non-conforming status of the
land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of
more than 70 percent of the replacement cost at time of destruction.
550 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE - On any non-conforming structure or portion of a
structure containing a non-conforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve (12)
consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls,
fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 10 percent of the current replacement
cost of the non-conforming structure or non-conforming portion of the structure as the case
may be, provided that the cubic content existing when it became non-conforming shall not be
increased.
If a non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-conforming use
becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared
by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it
shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of
the district in which it is located.
Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe
condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with
protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
560 USES UNDER CONDITIONAL USE PROVISIONS NOT NON-CONFORMING USESAny
use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under the terms of this ordinance
shall not be deemed a non-conforming use in such district, but shall without further action be
considered a conforming use.

the Official Zoning Map for the City of Nicholasville, Kentucky, referred to in Section 610 of
the Official Zoning Ordinance for Nicholasville, Kentucky, adopted by the Board of
Commissioners July 1, 1980."
If, in accordance with the provision of this ordinance and Kentucky Revised Statutes, changes

except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this ordinance. Any unauthorized change
of whatever kind by any person or persons shall be considered a violation of this ordinance and
punishable as provided under Section 360.
Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the Official Zoning Map which may from
time to time be made or published, the Official Zoning Map which shall be located in the
office of the Administrative Official shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status
of land and water areas, buildings, and other structures in the City.
611 REPLACEMENT OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP - In the event that the Official
Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature
or number of changes and additions, the City Commission may by resolution adopt a new
Official Zoning Map which shall supersede the prior Official Zoning Map. The new
Official Zoning Map may correct drafting, zoning ordinance or any subsequent amendment
thereof. The new Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor
34
attested by the City Clerk, and bear the seal of the City under the following words: "This is
to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map
adopted (date of adoption of map being replaced) as part of the Official Zoning Ordinance
for Nicholasville, Kentucky."
620 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES - Where uncertainty exists with
respect to the boundaries of any of the Zoning Districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map,
the following rules shall apply:
621 - Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets, highways,
or alleys shall be construed to follow such center lines;

streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such
center lines;
626 - Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in subsections
621 through 625 above shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the
Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the scale of the map;
627 - Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at variance with those
shown on the Official Zoning Map, or in other
circumstances not covered by subsections 621 through 626 above, the Board of Adjustment

628 - Where a district boundary line divides a lot which was in single ownership at the time
of passage of this ordinance the Board of Adjustment may permit, conditionally, the
extension of the regulations for either portion of the lot not to exceed fifty (50') feet beyond
the district line into the remaining portion of the lot.
630 ANNEXATIONS - A property owner requesting annexation to the Board of City
Commissioners shall submit an application for a zone map amendment to the Planning

use between heavy industrial uses and other less intense business and residential uses.
662 HEAVY INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT - The purpose of the I-2 District is to encourage the
development of major manufacturing, processing, warehousing, and major research and
testing operations. These activities require extensive community facilities, and reasonable
access to arterial highways; they may have extensive open storage and service areas,
generate heavy traffic but shall be prohibited if they create nuisances beyond the limitations

within the purview of the Nicholasville Historic Preservation Commission, that is based on
specific design guidelines for exterior work and changes to the property. Properties that are
within the Historic District carry an H-1 overlay zone in addition to the underlying zoning
category. (Adopted 12-29-2012 Ordinance #856-2012)
674 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT - See Article 11. The purpose of the PUD District
is to provide an area of land, in which a variety of housing types and/or related commercial
and industrial facilities are accommodated in a pre-planned environment under more
flexible standards, such as lot sizes and setbacks, than these restrictions that would normally
apply under these regulations. The procedure for approval of such development contains
requirements in addition to those of the standard subdivision, such as building design
principles, and landscaping plans.

SUPPLEMENTARY DISTRICT REGULATIONS
800 GENERAL - The purpose of supplementary district regulations is to set specific
conditions for various uses, classification of uses, or areas where problems are frequently
encountered.
810 Visibility at Intersections and Driveways - A "site triangle" will be observed at all street
intersections or intersections of driveways with streets to insure that fences, walls, hedges, or
other landscape materials do not constitute a driving hazard (see Figures 4 and 5, page 76).
Within this site triangle, nothing shall be erected, placed, planted or allowed to grow in such a
manner as to materially impede vision between a height of two and one-half (2-1/2) and twelve
(12) feet above the street center line grade.
810.1 Fences, Walls, Hedges and Trees - Notwithstanding other provisions of this
ordinance, fences, walls, and hedges may be permitted in any required yard or along the
edge of any yard, provided that no fence, wall or hedge along the sides or front edge of any
front yard shall be over four (4') feet in height. No tree shall be planted on or within six (6')
feet of any right-of-way, utility easement or drainage easement without specific approval of
the Administrative Officer. No barbed wire, electric or other protective devices serving a
similar purpose shall be permitted within residential zones.
810.2 Screening and/or Landscaping - Whenever a commercial, professional or industrial
parking area is located in or adjacent to a residential district it shall be effectively screened
on all sides which adjoin or face any property used for residential purposes, by an
acceptably designated wall, fence or planting screen. Likewise, multi-family residences
with a parking area for six (6) or more vehicles shall meet the same screening requirement
when adjacent to an R-1 or R-2 zone.
Such fence, wall or planting screen shall not be less than four (4') feet nor more than six (6')
feet in height and shall be maintained in good condition. The space between such fence,
wall or plant screen, and the lot line of the adjoining premises in any residential district shall

condition. In the event that terrain or other natural features are such that the required
screening will not serve the intended purpose, the Planning Commission may waive said
requirement.

ARTICLE 11
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
1100 Objectives for Planned Unit Developments - It shall be the policy of the City of
Nicholasville, Kentucky to promote progressive development of land and construction thereon
by encouraging planned unit developments to achieve:
1101 - A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of housing and
building types and permitting an increased density per acre and a reduction in lot
dimensions, yards, building setbacks, and area requirements;
1102 - A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and, if permitted as part of
the project, more convenience in the location of accessory commercial uses and services;
1103 - A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography and geologic
features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation, and prevents the disruption of natural
drainage patterns;
1104 - A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through conventional
development resulting in substantial savings through shorter utilities and streets;
1105 - A development pattern in harmony with land use density, transportation facilities,
and community facilities objectives of the comprehensive plan.
The City is also prepared to accept a greater population density in undeveloped areas than
that reflected by present zoning, provided the developer can demonstrate that any increment
of public cost clearly attributable to increased densities will be compensated for by the
private amenities and public benefits to be achieved by the plan of development.
1110 Provisions Governing Planned Unit Developments - Because of the special
characteristics of planned unit developments, special provisions governing the development of
land for this purpose are required. Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the
provisions of this Article and those of the other Articles of the ordinance, the provisions of this
Article shall prevail for the development of land for planned unit developments. Subjects not
covered by this Article shall be governed by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this
ordinance.
1120 Uses Permitted - Compatible residential, commercial, industrial, public, and quasi-public
uses may be combined in PUD districts provided that the proposed location of the commercial
or industrial uses will not adversely affect adjacent property, and/or the public health, safety,
and general welfare. Lot area and other yard requirements of the residential districts
established in Article 7 shall apply except as modified in Sections 1161 and 1162.
105
1130 Project Ownership - The project land may be owned, leased, or controlled either by a
single person or corporation, or by a group of individuals or corporations. Such ownership
may be a public or private corporation.
1140 Common Open Space and Disposition Thereof - A minimum of twenty (20%) percent of
the land developed in any planned unit development project shall be reserved for common
open space and recreational facilities for the residents or users of the area being developed.
The required amount of common open space land reserved under a planned unit development
shall either be held in corporate ownership by owners of the project area for the use of each
owner who buys property within the development or be dedicated to the City and retained as
common open space for parks, recreation, and related uses. All land dedicated to the City must
meet the Planning Commission's requirements as to size, shape, and location. Public utility
and similar easements and right-of-ways, for water courses and other similar channels are not
acceptable for common open space dedication to the City unless such land or right-of-way is
usable as a trail or other similar purpose and approved by the Planning Commission. The
responsibility for the maintenance of all open spaces shall be specified by the developer before
approval of the final development plan.
1150 Utility Requirements - Underground utilities, including telephone and electrical systems,
may be required within the limits of all planned unit developments. Appurtenances to these
systems which can be effectively screened may be exempted from this requirement if the
Planning Commission finds that such exemption will not violate the intent or character of the
proposed planned unit development.
1160 Minimum Project Area - The gross area of a tract of land to be developed in a planned
unit development district shall be a minimum of twenty (20) acres, provided, however, that
smaller parcels may be considered on the basis of their potential to satisfy the objectives of this
Article as stated in Section 1100.
When the planned unit development proposes a mixture of residential uses with commercial
and/or industrial uses, the Planning Commission may limit the development of not more than
eight (8%) percent of the tract to commercial uses and not more than twelve (12%) percent of
the tract to industrial uses.
1161 Minimum Lot Sizes - Lot area per dwelling unit may be reduced by not more than
forty (40%) percent of the minimum lot area required in the Official Schedule of District
Regulations. A planned unit development need not conform to the density requirements of
Article 7. A diversification of lot sizes is encouraged.
Lot widths may be varied to allow for a variety of structural designs. It is also
recommended that setbacks be varied.
1162 Height Requirements - For each foot of building height over the maximum height
regulations specified in Article 7, the distance between such buildings and the side and rear
106
property lines of the planned unit development project area shall be increased by a one (1')
foot addition to the side and rear yard required in the districts.
1163 Parking - Off-street parking, loading, and service areas shall be provided in
accordance with Article 9 of this ordinance. However, off-street parking and loading areas
shall not be permitted within fifteen (15') feet of any residential use.
1164 Perimeter Yards - Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article, every lot abutting the
perimeter of the planned unit development district shall maintain all yard requirements
specified in Article 7 for the applicable conventional zoning district.
1165 Lots to Abut Upon Common Open Space - Every property developed under the
planned unit development approach should be designed to abut upon common open space or
similar areas. A clustering of dwellings is encouraged. In areas where townhouses are
used, there shall be no more then eight (8) townhouse units in any contiguous group.
1170 Procedure for Application and Approval of Planned Unit Developments - All proposed
planned unit development shall follow the procedure for plat preparation and subdivision
approval as set forth in the City Subdivision Regulations. In addition, the Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing on the preliminary plat of the proposed planned unit
development to aid them in deciding the merits of the proposed project. (Nothing herein
should be construed to mean that the land owner has the inherent right to develop a planned
unit development. The Planning Commission has the power to decide whether or not to allow
the planned unit development based on their experience, knowledge, public hearing and the
standards set forth herein). Accompanying all preliminary plats shall be calculations for
overall density, parking requirements and other material the Commission may reasonably
require. If the Planning Commission approves the preliminary plat the developer may proceed
with activities leading to final plat approval providing that the project shall be developed in
conformance with the approved preliminary plat.
Upon approval by the Planning Commission and the City Commission a planned unit
development district may be applied to any existing residential district. Upon approval of a
final development plan, the Official Zoning Map shall be annotated for the land area involved
so that the district name includes the notation, "PUD."
A building permit and certificate of occupancy shall be required for each building in
accordance with Section 320-330 of this ordinance. Approval of a planned unit development
shall expire if no substantial work on the site has begun within one year of original approval
and if the project is abandoned for more than twenty-four (24) consecutive months.
(Abandonment shall be deemed to have occurred when no improvements have been made
pursuant to the approved planned unit development plat). All approved plan unit development
plats shall be recorded in the County Clerk's Office.
107
ARTICLE 12
MOBILE HOME PARKS
1200 INTENT - It is the intent of this article to regulate the location of, and to encourage,
stabilize, and protect the development of well planned mobile home parks.
1210 APPROVAL PROCEDURES - Mobile home parks shall be developed according to the
general standards and regulations stated and referenced in Article 12.
1220 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR MOBILE HOME PARKS - The Planning Commission
and the City Commission shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each proposed
mobile home park in terms of the following standards and shall find adequate evidence
showing that the mobile home developments (see Mobile Home Park Design FIGURE 6, Page
106.
1221 - will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as to be harmonious and
appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended character of the general vicinity and
that such use will not change the essential character of the same area;
1222 - will not be hazardous or detrimental to existing or future neighboring uses;
1223 - will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services such as
highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage, refuse disposal, and schools; or that
the persons or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed park shall be able
to provide adequately any such services;
1224 - will be consistent with the intent and purpose of this ordinance and the
comprehensive plan;
1225 - will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so designed as not to
create an interference with traffic on surrounding public streets or roads, and;
1226 - will not result in destruction, loss, or damage of natural, scenic, or historic features
of major importance.
1230 MOBILE HOME PARK REQUIREMENTS - Mobile home parks shall meet the
requirements of the Kentucky Mobile Home and Recreational Vehicle Park Law adopted by
the Kentucky State Department of Health under the authority of the Kentucky Revised
Statutes, Chapter 219.310 to 219.410.
1240 MOBILE HOMES PERMITTED - All mobile homes shall be permitted only in mobile
home parks, which shall be permitted only in an R-3 District and in planned unit developments
for residential use only.
108
1250 AREA REQUIREMENTS - No mobile home park shall be permitted on an area of less
than two and one-half (2-1/2) acres in size, although the developer shall be permitted to
develop the park in stages as long as he complies with an overall plan approved by the
Planning Commission for the entire tract.
1260 MINIMUM FLOOR AREA - Individual mobile homes located within the mobile home
district shall have a minimum floor area of seven hundred (700) square feet.
1270 LOT REQUIREMENTS - Individual lots within a mobile home park shall not be less

1280 SETBACK - No mobile home or accessory building or structure shall be located closer to
any street than the minimum front yard setback for permanent residential structures along said
street. Where the mobile home park is not bounded by a dedicated street, the minimum
setback shall be thirty (30') feet.
1290 PROCEDURE - Although mobile home parks are permitted in R-3 districts and planned
unit development projects, the prospective developer, before attempting to obtain a building
permit or beginning any construction, shall prepare a plan showing the lot dimensions and
bearings of the parcel he intends to develop, location with respect to the City, general layout or
design he intends to follow and improvements he expects to install on the land. He shall then
meet with the Planning Commission, the purpose being to inform the developer of any plans
the City may have that would affect his plan to ensure that the developer's plans are not in
conflict with the City's Future Land Use Plan. This meeting would also form a common
ground whereby the Planning Commission and the prospective developer could reach an
understanding of the types of improvements necessary. (See Nicholasville Subdivision
Regulations for project procedures.)
Before approving the development plan, the Planning Commission may make other conditional
requirements pertaining to such things as landscaping and screening. These conditional
requirements shall be considered as a part of the City's Zoning Ordinance, and failure to
comply therewith shall be subject to the penalties contained therein.
109

or (2) there have been major changes of an economic, physical or social nature within the area
involved which were not anticipated in the Comprehensive Plan adopted by the Planning
Commission and which have substantially altered the basic character of such area. The

ARTICLE 14
LANDSCAPE AND LAND USE BUFFERS
1400 GENERAL - The intent of this article is to improve the appearance of vehicular use areas
(VUA) and property abutting public rights-of-way; to require buffering between inconsistent
zones; and to protect, preserve and promote the aesthetic appeal, character and value of the
surrounding neighborhoods to promote public health and safety through the reduction of noise
pollution, air pollution, visual pollution, air temperature, and artificial light glare.
(Adopted: 3-26-2018 Ordinance 1011-2018)
1401 SITES AFFECTED
1401.1 New Site - No new vehicular use area (VUA) shall hereafter be created or used
unless landscaping is provided as required by the provisions of this Article.
1401.2 Existing Site - No building, structure, or vehicular use area (VUA) shall be
expanded, moved, or removed and/or reconstructed unless the minimum landscaping
required by the provision of this article is proved for the property to the extent of its
alteration or expansion, but not for the entire property. Landscaping shall be provided
only for any additional structures, parking or VUA over and above that of an existing
development, except as follows. If the additional parking or VUA requirement is equal
to or greater than the number of parking spaces or VUA area provided by the previous
use, then perimeter landscaping shall be provided for the entire vehicular use area
serving the property. The provisions of this section shall be effective regardless of
whether or not new construction is necessary to meet the parking requirements for the
new uses. (Adopted: 3-26-2018 Ordinance 1011-2018)
1401.3 Change of Use - No use shall be changed to another use for which the Zoning
Ordinance requires additional parking over and above that required for the previous use,
unless vehicular use area perimeter landscaping as required by this Article is provided
for such additional parking. The provisions of this section shall be effective regardless
of whether or not new construction is necessary to meet the parking requirements, such
additional required parking shall be deemed to be on the perimeter for as much as
possible of the existing vehicular use area. Where the previous use had no required
parking, perimeter landscaping shall be provided for the entire vehicular use area
serving the new use. Interior landscaping shall not be required where only the use of the
property is changed and no new construction or reconstruction is proposed.
1401.4 Change of Zone - No use of an existing building, structure, or vehicular use area
shall be commenced subsequent to a change in zoning unless property perimeter
landscaping as required herein has been provided.
(Adopted: 3-26-2018 Ordinance 1011-2018)
1401.5 Authority - The authority to administer these landscape regulations is granted to
the Planning Commission under KRS Chapter 100, Sections 201, 203, and 281.

(Adopted: 3-26-2018 Ordinance 1011-2018)
1401.7 Conflicting Regulations- Should the requirements set forth in this section be
found in conflict with other provisions of these regulations, the more stringent
regulations shall apply. Any regulations adopted as a part of a special landscape or
urban design plan for particular areas (e.g., road corridor, downtown) shall supersede
this ordinance. (Adopted: 3-26-2018 Ordinance 1011-2018)

suitable mulch shall be used, nurse-grass seed shall be sown for immediate
protection until complete coverage otherwise is achieved. Grass sod shall be clean
and fee of weeds and noxious pest or diseases. Ground cover such as organic
material shall be planted not more than fifteen (15) inches on center and in such
manner as to present a finished appearance and have seventy-five (75) percent of
complete coverage after two complete growing seasons. In certain cases, ground
cover also may consist of rocks, pebbles, sand and similar approved materials.
1405.4 Maintenance and Installation - All landscaping materials shall be installed in a
sound, workmanship like manner, and according to accepted, good construction and
planting procedures. The owner of the property shall be responsible for the continued
proper maintenance of all landscaping materials, and shall keep them in a proper, neat,
and orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris, at all times. All unhealthy or dead
plant material shall be replaced within one (1) year, or by the next planting period,
whichever comes first; while other defective landscape material shall be replaced or
repaired within three (3) months. Topping trees or the severe cutting of limbs to stubs
larger than three (3) inches in diameter within the tree crown to such a degree as to
remove the normal canopy shall not be considered proper or permitted for the
maintenance of trees as required by this Article. Violation of these installation and
maintenance provisions shall be grounds for the Planning Commission to refuse a
building occupancy permit, require replacement of landscaping material or institute
legal proceedings to enforce the provisions of this Article.
1406 PLAN SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL - Whenever any property is affected by
these landscape requirements, the property owner or developer shall prepare a landscape
plan for submittal to, and approval by, the Planning Commission. In addition to the hard
copy requirements, a copy of the plans in a digital .pdf format shall be submitted. Standard
transfer media will be accepted on CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, and DVD-RW discs, or USB
Flash Drive. Media will not be returned. The requirements of this Article shall be followed
in approving or disapproving any landscape plan required by this Article. Landscape plans
also may be submitted as part of any development plan required by the Planning
Commission. (Adopted: 10-24-2016 Ordinance 960-2016)
1406.1 Plan Content - The contents of the plan shall include the following: (a) plot plan,
drawn to an easily readable scale, showing and labeling by name and dimensions, all
existing and proposed property lines, easements, buildings, and other structures,
vehicular use areas (including parking stalls, driveways, service areas, square footage,
etc.) water outlets and landscaping material (including botanical name and common

123
for all plants used); (b) existing and proposed contours at two (2) foot intervals; ©
typical elevations and/or cross sections as may be required; (d) title block with the
pertinent names and addresses (property owner, person drawing plan, and person
installing landscape material), scale, date, north arrow (generally orient plan so that
north is to top of plan), and zone.
1406.2 Building Permit and Certificate of Occupancy - Where landscaping is required,
no building permit shall be issued until the required landscaping plan has been
submitted and approved, and no Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued until the
landscaping is completed as certified by an on-site inspection by the Planning
Commission or unless an irrevocable Letter of Credit form a banking institution, has
been posted if the landscaping has not been completed. The amount of the Letter of
Credit shall be based upon the cost of the proper installation of the uninstalled landscape
material shown in the submitted plan with the cost certified by a landscape contractor.
The amount of the Letter of Credit shall also include an inflation factor and/or
administrative contingency cost of twenty-five (25) percent of the base cost as
determined by the Planning Commission to complete the work in the event of the
foreclosure of the Letter of Credit. If the required landscaping has not been completed

Letter of Credit from a banking institution shall be posted at that time.
1406.3 Posting of an Irrevocable Letter of Credit - After a irrevocable letter of credit has
been posted, the landscaping material required in the approved landscaping plan shall be
installed within six (6) months after the date of posting the irrevocable letter of credit.
A one (1) month extension of the planting period may be granted by the Planning
Commission upon a demonstration by the property owner or developer that such an
extension is warranted because of adverse weather conditions or unavailability of
required plant materials. No more than three (3) such one (1) month extensions may be
granted. Foreclosure proceedings shall be brought against the irrevocable letter of credit
if the required landscaping plans have not been complied with by the end of the
approved planting period.
1407 PLANTING MANUAL AND PLANT MATERIALS LIST - Developers shall refer to
the Planting Manual and Plant Materials List which are available at the offices of the
Planning Commission for minimal requirements to use to meet the provisions of this
Article. Any materials which are not on the Plant Materials List shall be considered on an
individual basis to determine the suitability of the specific plant in the proposed location. A
Plant not on the Plant Material List shall be permitted only upon the expressed approval of
the Planning Commission.
1408 VARIANCES - Any landscape plan submitted to, and disapproved by the Planning
Commission because it does not meet the requirements of this Article, may be appealed
within thirty (30) days of such action to the Board of Adjustment.

125
ARTICLE 15
DEVELOPMENT PLANS
1500 INTENT AND PURPOSE - The purpose of this Article is to establish and define
development plans. This Article outlines the content and procedure for submission, review,
and approval of development plans required by the Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision
Regulations unless another procedure or different contents are specified elsewhere in this
Zoning Ordinance.
1510 APPROVAL OF DEVELOPMENT PLAN - For any case where a development plan is
required by this Zoning Ordinance, no building permits shall be issued until a final
development plan is approved by the Planning Commission. The approval of a development
plan shall limit and control the issuance of all building and occupancy permits, and restrict the
construction, location and use of all land and structures to the conditions as set forth in the
plan.
1520 WHERE REQUIRED - Applications for amendment to the Official Zoning Map shall
include a development plan in accordance with this regulation. The development plan is
intended to demonstrate to the Planning Commission the character and objectives of the
proposed development in adequate detail for the Planning Commission to evaluate its
compliance with these regulations and its compatibility with the surrounding area.
1530 DEVELOPMENT PLAN PROCEDURES - The following shall be the procedure for the
Planning Commission's consideration of any development plan.
1530.1 Filing - An application shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for a
development plan. The developer shall file a completed application form, five (5) copies of
the plans, a digital copy of the plans in .pdf format, and filing fee as required by the
Planning Commission's adopted Building Permit and Planning and Zoning Fee Schedule.
The Planning Commission shall make copies of the plan available to all other concerned
parties at the developer's expense.
(Adopted: 10-24-2016 Ordinance 961-2016)
1530.2 Development Plan Form - There is both a conceptual development plan and a final
development plan, defined as follows:
1530.21 Conceptual Development Plan - Potential zone map amendment applicants
have the option of submitting a conceptual development plan prior to the time of the
rezoning application, with a final and more detailed development plan submitted for
Planning Commission consideration at the time of the Zone Map Amendment request.
A conceptual development plan is a site plan by which, at the early stages of
development design, the Planning Commission may view major aspects of the
development without requiring an undue amount of final design work on the part of the
developer. The conceptual development plan is less detailed and specific than a final
development plan in terms of exact arrangement of buildings, parking acres, open
spaces, access points, and nay other site design features. No building permits can be
issued based upon a conceptual development plan.
1530.22 Final Development Plan - A development plan that is submitted with a Zone
126
Map Amendment application and from which a building permit will be sought. A final
development plan is intended to deal with site design issues at a detailed level and to
actually dictate the approved locations of building, parking area, open spaces, access
points, and any other site design features. A public hearing on the zone map amendment
shall not be held until the final development plan has been submitted to the Planning
Commission for action.
1530.23 Commission Action - All conceptual development plans shall be reviewed by
the Planning Commission within ninety(90) days of the date they are formally filed with
the Planning Commission, unless the applicant agrees to a longer time period. There is
no formal action taken by the Planning Commission on Conceptual development plans,
they are for discussion only. However, in the case of a final development plan filed in
conjunction with a zone map amendment request, the Planning Commission shall either
approve or disapprove the development plan in accordance with Section 1350.1
PLANNING COMMISSION and shall make findings of fact to support their decision.
If the final development plan is approved, the Minutes of the Planning Commission shall
specify that the development plan approval is void unless the appropriate legislative
body approves the zoning map amendment. Once approved by the Planning
Commission and the zoning map amendment is subsequently approved by the legislative
body, a final development plan must be resubmitted to the Planning Commission and
approved before construction can begin.
The Planning Commission will act for approval, conditional approval with conditions
noted, postponement, or disapproval. The Planning Commission may modify or
disapprove the final development plan if it finds the plan does not comply with the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, and when applicable, the Subdivision
Regulations or if it finds there are existing or potential substantial flood, drainage,
traffic, topographic or other similar problems relating to the development of the subject
property. Reasons for action of postponement or disapproval shall be fully incorporated
in the Commission's minutes. The following actions by the Planning Commission shall
have the meaning so stated:
1530.231 Approval - Means the final development plan is ready to be certified by
the Commission Chairperson with no further corrections or revisions of the plan
required by the developer.
1530.232 Conditional Approval - Means the final development plan cannot be
certified by the Commission Chairperson until the developer has complied with the
conditions of approval set forth in the Planning Commission's action on the plan.
1530.233 Postponement - Means that the Commission has deferred action until some
future Commission meeting in order that certain clarification can be made in regard
to the final development plan. No completely new re-submittal is required of the
developer as is the case for disapproval.
1530.234 Disapproval - Means disapproval of the plan. To request new review and
action, the developer must file a new application along with a filing fee, and plan
copies as required under Section 1530.1 Filing.
127
1530.3 Certification of Approval - Within ninety (90) days of the Planning
Commission's approval, the following steps shall be completed, or else the Planning
Commission's approval becomes null and void: 1) the developer shall fully comply with
any conditions of approval placed on the final development plan by the Planning
Commission; 2) the development plan shall be certified by the Planning Commission
Chairperson, if it is in conformance with all requirements. Five (5) copies of the
certified development plan shall be submitted to the Planning Commission at the
Developer's expense.
1530.4 Timing Restrictions - The developer shall be required to obtain building permits
for all structures shown on a final development plan (except for detached single family
and duplex zones) within five (5) years of the date of Planning Commission action on
the development plan, otherwise, no further building permits shall be issued unless and
until the plan is reapproved by the Planning Commission. The developer must file a
new application along with a filing fee, and plan copies as required under Section
1530.1 Filing.
1540 CONTENT AND FORMAT OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS - Plans shall be legible and
of a size and scale (generally not smaller than 1' = 100') which will enable clear presentation of
required information. Digital submissions in .pdf format will be accepted on CD-R, CD-RW,
DVD-R, and DVD-RW discs, or USB Flash Drive. Media will not be returned. Required plan
information shall be as follows:
(Adopted: 10-24-2016 Ordinance 962-2016)
1540.1 Contents of Conceptual Development Plan - A conceptual development plan shall
contain the following information in generalized graphic and written representation at a
minimum:
(1) A title block containing the plan name, development plan type, name and address of

in the approved access location not exceeding 25' may be located on an arterial street; (5)
may include a reduction in parking spaces only when an associated reduction in floor area or
number of dwelling units would permit a lesser number of minimum required off-street
parking spaces than required for the original development plan. To qualify as a minor
amendment, this reduction may be equal to but not exceed the difference in minimum
required parking between the original development plan and the proposed minor amended
development plan, that same number of spaces shall be provided in excess of the minimum
requirement for the proposed minor amendment plan.
1550.2 Procedures for Minor Amendments - Shall be as follows:
1550.21 Filing - The developer shall file the following material with the Planning
Commission: Three (3) prints on bond paper; a digital copy of the plans in .pdf format;

all applicable requirements and ordinances and others as appropriate to ensure proper
plan review. Upon determination that all requirements have been met, the Planning
Commission's Chairperson, the developer shall submit fifteen (15) copies to the Planning
130
Commission.
1550.23 Certification - Upon certification of approval by the Planning Commission's
Chairperson, the developer shall submit fifteen (15) copies to the Planning Commission.
1550.3 Content and Format of Minor Amendments - Minor amendments shall have the same
content and format requirements as the original development plan, except that 1) the title
shall indicate the plan is a minor amendment, 2) a note shall be added listing the exact nature
of the requested changes and , 3) the following will be required language for the Planning
Commission's certification: "I do hereby certify that this development plan amendment
complies with the provisions of Section 1550.2 of the Zoning Ordinance."
1560 RELATIONSHIP TO LAND SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS - The relationships
between development plans and the Land Subdivision Regulations are established as follows:
1560.1 Applicability of Land Subdivision Regulations - Although development plans are not
subdivision plans, quite often the development plan does indicate a need or intent to
subdivide property. For any such development plans, the design and improvement standards
contained within the Subdivision Regulations shall be applied to proposals contained on the
development plan.
1560.2 Preliminary Subdivision Plat May be Substituted for Development Plans - It is
recognized that in certain cases, a preliminary subdivision plat would be as appropriate or
more appropriate to be considered in conjunction with the requested zone map amendment
rater than a final development plan only. generally, such situations involve developments
where placements of structures will be tightly controlled by the streets, lot pattern, and the
requirements for placement of structures within the zone, and where the developer decides to
have plans prepared at the required level of detail for a preliminary plat prior to receiving
approval for a zoning map amendment request has not been filed in conjunction with an
annexation request. If the zone map amendment has been filed in conjunction with an
annexation request only a development plan may be filed. If a preliminary plat is submitted
it shall be entitled a Preliminary Plat/Final Development Plan.

ARTICLE 16
SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
1600 FINDINGS OF FACT - The following findings of fact are made:
1600.1 Losses Resulting from Soil Erosion - During the construction process, soil is highly
vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. Within the City of Nicholasville, eroded soil from
construction sites contributes to impairment of the floodplain, increased road maintenance
costs, clogging of storm sewers, degradation of land surfaces and streams, flooding, and
dusty conditions.
1600.2 Causes of Soil Erosion - Significant erosion results from rainfall and runoff over
unprotected soils. Erosion is increased by intense rainfalls, long slopes, steep slopes, and
lack of adequate vegetative cover. These conditions are in part caused or aggravated by
improper clearing, construction, grading, or excavation which results in removal of natural
ground cover when appropriate erosion control steps are not taken.
1610 PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES - The intent of this Article is to:
1610.1 - Safeguard persons, protect property, and prevent damage to the environment in the
City of Nicholasville. This Article will promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating,
and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development or other
activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in the
City of Nicholasville.
1610.2 - Provide procedures for submission, review, and approval of Erosion and Sediment
Control Plans prior to soil disturbance. The requirements of this Article should be
considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this Article imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other applicable ordinance, rule, or
regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes
higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take
precedence.
1620 SCOPE OF COVERAGE - The following are included within the scope of this Article:
1620.1 - All persons submitting to the Nicholasville Planning Commission major subdivision
plats (see Article 3 of the Subdivision Regulations for processing of major subdivision plats)
and/or development plans must include a note on the preliminary plat and/or development
plan stating that no grading, excavating, stripping, filling or other disturbance of the natural
ground cover shall take place prior to approval of an Erosion and Sediment Control Plan.
Where critical conditions exist on the subject property, the Planning Commission may
require the developer to indicate in the preliminary plan the methods which will be used to
comply with the Ordinance. An Erosion and Sediment Control Plan shall be submitted after
a preliminary plan has been approved (or conditionally approved), and shall be considered as
a part of the required improvement plan (construction plan) materials.
132
1620.2 - All persons doing any grading, stripping, excavating, filling or otherwise disturbing
the natural ground cover, must obtain a Grading Permit from the Planning Commission prior
to commencing such work, unless exempted under Section 1640.2 of this Ordinance.
(Adopted: 1-22-2018 Ordinance 1001-2018)
1620.3 - Any person disturbing the natural ground cover in an area for which there is an

without exception. (In a subdivision for which there is an approved Erosion and Sediment
Control Plan, a separate additional Grading Permit will not be required for the construction
of single-family or duplex residential structures or their accessory structures, see Section
1640.2 of this Ordinance.)

and Sediment Control Plan containing the following information and conforming to the City of
Nicholasville BMP Manual must be submitted. This information must be supplied for the entire
tract of land whether or not the property will be developed in stages. If the development occurs
in stages the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan shall be approved as a whole; however after
construction has begun on the initial stage of the development, the Planning Commission Staff
must inspect the site prior to any other stage of construction. Approval for any subsequent
stage of construction will be granted only if the erosion and sediment control measures for the
preceding stage(s) are in conformance with the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan.
1660.1 - The Erosion and Sediment Control Plan shall include and conform to the following
(as applicable to the proposed construction):
1) The plan shall be drawn to a scale no smaller than 1"=100' indicating the site
locations as well as the adjacent properties, and location and identification of any
structure, soils, forest cover, or any natural feature on the land adjacent to the site and
within 250’ which has a significant impact on drainage or siltation controls.
2) Property boundary bearings and distances for the site on which the work is to be
performed.
3) A sequence of construction of the development site, including stripping and clearing,
rough grading, final grading, and landscaping. Sequencing shall identify the expected
date on which clearing will begin, the estimated duration of exposure of cleared
areas, areas of clearing, installation of temporary erosion and sediment control
measures, and establishment of permanent vegetation.
4) Existing and proposed topography at contour intervals not exceeding five (5) feet.
5) Proposed slopes of all embankments.
6) Location and identification of all site features (either man-made or natural) which
have a significant impact on drainage or siltation controls. Location and
identification of any proposed additional structures or development on the site, except
single-family and two-family residential structures and their accessory structures in a
subdivision.
7) Plans and specifications for all drainage provisions, retaining walls, cribbing,
planting, erosion and sediment control devices including seeding mixtures and rates,
types of sod, method of seedbed preparation, expected seeding dates, type and rate of

Planning Commission; or
2) Field modifications of a minor nature.
1670 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS - Upon consideration of the factors listed above and for the
purposes of this Ordinance, conditions may be attached to the approval of Erosion and
Sediment Control Plans. It is intended that these conditions be added to a plan for certain areas
or problems to provide two basic results: (1) that during project construction, off-site and onsite
siltation and erosion be minimized; and (2) that after project completion, the total Erosion
and Sediment Control Plan will be effective so as to preclude all significant on-site erosion.
Among such conditions (by way of example), without limitation because of specific
enumeration, are:
1670.1 - Grading, erosion control practices, sediment control practices, and waterway
crossings shall meet the design criteria set forth in the most recent version of Best
Management Practices (BMP) Manual, and shall be adequate to prevent transportation of
sediment from the site to the satisfaction of the Administrative Officer or his designee. Cut
and fill slopes shall be no greater than 2:1, except as approved by the Administrative Officer
or his designee to meet other community or environmental objectives.
1670.2 - Clearing and grading of natural resources, such as forests and wetlands, shall not be
permitted, except when in compliance with all other chapters of this Ordinance. Clearing
techniques that retain natural vegetation and drainage patterns, as described in the BMP

shall include the following:
1) Soil stabilization shall be completed within five (5) days of clearing or inactivity in
construction.
2) If seeding or another vegetative erosion control method is used, it shall become
established within two (2) weeks or the site may be required to be reseeded or a nonvegetative
option employed.
3) Special techniques that meet the design criteria outlined in the BMP Manual shall be
used to ensure stabilization on steep slopes or in drainage ways.
4) Soil stockpiles must be stabilized or covered at the end of each workday.
5) The entire site must be stabilized, using a heavy mulch layer or another method that
does not require germination to control erosion, at the close of the construction
season.
6) Techniques shall be employed to prevent the blowing of dust or sediment from the
site.
7) Techniques that divert upland runoff past disturbed slopes shall be employed.
1670.6 - Sediment control requirements shall adhere to the criteria in the BMP Manual and
shall include the following:
1) Settling basins, sediment traps, or tanks and perimeter controls.
2) Settling basins that are designed in a manner that allows adaptation to provide long
term storm water management, if required.
3) Protection for adjacent properties by the use of a vegetated buffer strip in
combination with perimeter controls.
4) Rock bags or other devices shall be used to keep sediment from washing into curb
inlets. Do not completely block the curb opening. Silt fence or other devices should
be used to keep sediment out of surface inlets.

CEMETERIES
1700 INTENT - The intent of this section is to establish guidelines for developing land with
cemeteries, and the general upkeep and security of inactive and private family cemeteries.
Nothing in this ordinance shall exempt a property owner, developer or the Planning
Commission from applicable Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) and Kentucky Administrative
Regulations (KAR). A parcel of land on which an inactive and private family cemetery is
located may be used as allowed by the site’s zoning classification and other applicable
regulations provided the grave sites are not disturbed in accordance with these provisions.
Relocation or removal of grave sites shall be allowed only under applicable Kentucky Revised

property. The regulations outlined below apply only to private inactive family cemeteries and
not to active cemeteries where grave sites are clearly identified by Planning Commission Staff.
Any waiver of these regulations must be requested from the Planning Commission. If a private
cemetery exists on a parcel of land and the exact location of grave sites is not able to be
determined, or a cemetery is discovered during construction, the property owner(s) and/or
developer is required to follow the procedures and guidelines stated in Section 1730.
1720.1 - Cemetery boundaries shall be established by the property owner(s) and/or developer
and submitted to the Planning Commission for approval. Request for approval shall include
evidence of location such as fences, walls, gravestones, natural features or recorded
documents. If sufficient evidence for location of cemetery boundary does not exist then the
Planning Commission may require the property owner(s) and/or developer to have a
professional archeologist view the site and make a determination as to the boundaries and
potential number of grave sites.
1720.11 - No new structure or building addition shall be built within 10 feet of an
existing private family cemetery regardless of adjoining property lines or land ownership.
This 10-foot limitation is also required regardless of whether the cemetery is part of a
145
building lot or is conveyed as a separate lot. The 10-foot limitation shall be in the form
of an exclusive cemetery easement.
1720.12 - No grading, excavating, paving or land disturbance shall be allowed within ten
(10) feet of a cemetery.
1720.2 - The property owner(s) and/or developer shall replace any existing cemetery fences
or walls. Stone or masonry fences shall be replaced with the same type material. Existing
cemetery fences or walls shall be repaired or replaced at the time of development and prior to
the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy as specified by Section 330.
1720.3 - The property owner(s) and/or developer shall be required to construct a new fence
if one does not exist at the time of establishment of the cemetery boundary. Fence material
shall fit with the character of the proposed development. The following materials are
acceptable: Stone, Brick, Ornamental Iron, pressure treated wood (picket or plank
constructed) with a quality of workmanship and material the guarantees a life expectancy of
20 years.
1720.4 - At the time of construction of a new fence, dead or decaying trees and heavy
underbrush shall be removed from the cemetery by the property owner(s) and/or developer.
Remaining trees shall be pruned to a height to create a clear vertical view of 8 feet. Ground
cover shall also be established at this time.

cemetery with a minimum twelve (12) foot wide recorded ingress/egress pedestrian
Cemetery Access Easement accessible from an adjoining public or private street. The
recording of the Cemetery Access Easement shall follow the same guidelines specified in
Subsection 1720.6.
1730 Cemetery Preservation, Relocation and Discovery Procedures - In order to assist property
owner(s) and/or developers in their cemetery preservation or relocation work, the following
procedures and guidelines shall be followed. These procedures or guidelines are to be followed
by each property owner(s) and/or developers and shall be enforced by the Administrative
Officer, or his designee. The procedures are based upon either cemetery preservation or
relocation plans.
1730.1 - Preservation of Existing Cemetery: If a property owner desires to preserve an
existing cemetery while developing his or her own property, then the property owner shall
state his or her intent to the Planning Commission in writing and follow the lot and
maintenance requirements as stated in these Regulations.
146
1730.2 - Relocation of an Existing cemetery: If a property owner desires to relocate an
existing cemetery then the property owner shall state his or her intent to the Planning
Commission in writing and follow the requirements for relocation per Kentucky Revised
Statutes (KRS) and Kentucky Administrative Regulations (KAR). Copies of all required
state and local applications and permits during the relocation procedure shall be submitted to
the Planning Commission.
1730.3 - Discovery of an Unknown Cemetery: If a property owner(s) and /or developer
unintentionally discovers a cemetery during construction, which was previously unknown, all
work in the immediate area shall cease immediately. The property owner(s) and/ or
developer shall be responsible to report this disclosure to the Planning Commission. As a
result, the following steps should be taken:
1730.31 - First, the property owner(s) and/or developer has the option of stating in
writing to the Planning Commission whether he or she will preserve the cemetery in
accordance with these and state regulations or relocate the cemetery in accordance with
state law. Either option will result in a submittal to the Planning Commission of a
revised development plan and/or building permit to be reviewed and approved by the
Planning Commission. Planning Commission staff shall be available to advise the
property owner(s) and/or developer of the benefits of cemetery preservation versus
relocation.
1730.32 - Second, if a property owner(s) and/or developer decides not to report the
presence of a cemetery that is previously unknown and attempts to conceal any evidence
that a cemetery ever existed and discovery of this fact is presented to the Planning
Commission, the Planning Commission shall notify the property owner(s) and/or
developer in writing to stop construction work in the area surrounding the cemetery. At
the next regularly scheduled Planning Commission Meeting, the property owner(s)
and/or developer must be present to discuss the matter and offer a solution. This solution
shall include the following:
1730.321 - The boundaries of the cemetery shall be identified by a professional
(Kentucky Registered) archaeologist at the expense of the property owner(s) and/or
developer;
1730.322 - The cemetery fence (if it exists) shall be repaired, replaced or
reconditioned at the property owner(s) and/or developer’s expense. The cemetery’s
condition shall be returned to its natural state and maintained per Section 1720 and
ownership shall be established per Section 1710;
1730.323 - Inspection of the cemetery preservation work shall be done periodically
by the Planning Commission Administrative Officer or his designee to insure that the
work is completed in a reasonable amount of time.

ABSTRACT OF TEXT: These subdivision regulations present a code of
requirements dealing with the development of
land for residential subdivisions. Designed to
provide a coherent approach to development,
these regulations set requirements for
subdivision streets, sidewalks, water, sewer
stormwater drainage construction specifications,
and lots. These regulations are intended to assist
not only the Planning Commission and the
Zoning Enforcement Officer, but also the
developer in providing quality housing
developments for the City of Nicholasville.

ARTICLE 1
ADMINISTRATION
100 TITLE - These regulations shall be known and may be cited and referred to as the
"Subdivision Regulations of the City of Nicholasville, Kentucky" and shall hereinafter be
referred to as "These Regulations."
110 AUTHORIZATION - These subdivision regulations are adopted under the authority
granted by the Kentucky Revised Statutes, Chapter 100, Section 100.273 through 100.291
and 100.334. The Nicholasville Planning Commission, established under the Kentucky
Revised Statutes Chapter 100, Section 100. (117 or 121) has fulfilled the requirements set
forth in KRS 100.273 as a prerequisite to the adoption of these regulations and is thereby
designated as the administering agency.
120 PURPOSE - Once open land has been divided into streets and parcels, a pattern has
been established which may determine how well community needs for residential, public,
commercial and industrial land will be met. It will also affect the community's ability to
handle traffic problems and the economic provision of public utilities. Assuring that this
development is in harmony with community objectives is therefore a matter of serious
public concern.
It is therefore declared to be the policy of the Nicholasville Planning Commission to
consider land subdivision plats as part of a plan for the orderly, efficient, and economical
development of the land within its general welfare. The purpose of the standards and
procedures included is to first provide a guide for the change that occurs when land
becomes urban in character as a result of development for residential, commercial, or
industrial purposes; second, to provide assurances that the purchasers of lots are buying a
commodity suitable for development and use; and third, to assure the proper provision of
public services in an efficiently safe and orderly manner conductive to the minimum outlay
of public and private expenditures. This shall be interpreted to include the following
provisions which shall guide the Planning Commission in formulating its decisions:
121 - Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used safely for
building purposes without danger to health and welfare from flooding, fire
contamination, erosion, or other menace.
122 - Proper provision shall be made for drainage, water and energy supply,
sewerage, and other needed improvements at such a rate as will
accommodate the anticipated rate of development.
123 - Proposed streets shall compose a convenient and efficient traffic circulation
system, properly related to the proposals of the transportation plan. Streets
shall be of such width, grade and location to accommodate prospective
traffic, provide adequate light and air, and to provide access by service and
emergency vehicles.
2
124 - Land of suitable location, size, and character for utility or drainage
easements or public community services shall be shown on the subdivision
plat wherever appropriate.
125 - Subdivision plats shall show such information as required to establish the
exact location and dimension of each parcel of land in order to provide
adequate records for land titles.
130 JURISDICTION - In accordance with Chapter 100, Section 100.131 of the Kentucky
Revised Statutes, these regulations shall govern all subdivision of land within the corporate
limits of the City of Nicholasville, Kentucky as now or hereafter established. Any owner of
land within these areas, or his representative, wishing to subdivide land shall submit to the
Nicholasville Planning Commission a plat of the subdivision according to the requirements
outlined in these regulations.
140 INCONSISTENCY WITH OTHER PROVISIONS - Wherever there is a discrepancy
between minimum standards set forth in these regulations and those of any other lawfully
adopted rules, regulations, ordinance or resolutions, the most restrictive or highest
standards shall apply.
141 - Nothing in these regulations shall prohibit the subdivider from placing selfimposed
restrictions, or imposing higher standards than required by these
regulations, but not in violation of these regulations, on the development.
However, such restrictions shall be indicated or attached to the plat for
processing by the Commission and filing with the County Clerk.
150 SEPARABILITY - The invalidity of any provision of these regulations shall not
invalidate any other part thereof which is not itself invalid.
160 AMENDMENTS - The Planning Commission may recommend to the Nicholasville City
Commission revisions and modifications of these regulations from time to time by holding a
public hearing on the proposed changes after giving notice as required by K.R.S. Chapter
424. It shall then make its recommendation on the proposed changes to the legislative
body. It shall take a majority of the entire legislative body to override the
recommendations of the Planning Commission.
170 PROCEDURES
171 GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES
171.1 SUBDIVIDER OR DEVELOPER - The subdivider or developer shall
prepare plats and plans consistent with the design standards, accomplish
improvements consistent with the improvement requirements, and process
said plats and plans in accordance with these regulations.
3
171.2 PLANNING COMMISSION - The Planning Commission, or its duly
authorized representatives, is charged with the duty of making investigations
and reports on the design and improvements of proposed subdivisions and
developments and requiring conformance of such subdivisions and
developments with the Comprehensive Plan for the City, the Kentucky
Revised Statutes, Section 100.111 to 100.991 and these Regulations. The
Planning Commission shall require such redesign of street patterns, lot
layout, and such other information or plans as the circumstances may
warrant to ensure not only conformance to the aforementioned, but good
traffic patterns, proper design and development of a particular area; and
appropriate consideration of abutting development.
171.3 LEGISLATIVE BODY - No street or other public ground which has
been dedicated shall be accepted, nor shall any performance or maintenance
bond surety be released, nor any change to these regulations be made by the
legislative body until it has received the recommendation from the Planning
Commission. (Approved 6-20-2013 Ordinance #874-2013)
172 PUBLIC HEARING - The Commission, on its own initiative or upon petition by
any citizen or neighboring property owner, may, prior to acting on a preliminary
plat of a subdivision, hold a public hearing thereon at such time and place and upon
such notice as required under KRS 424.
173 APPLICANTS TO APPEAR AT THE SCHEDULED HEARING - It shall be
the responsibility of any person requesting action by the Nicholasville Planning
Commission to appear at the scheduled hearing to request same. Failure of a person
to appear either on behalf of himself or by authorized agent, shall result in the
request being denied and the matter being removed from the Agenda.
The above shall not apply, however, if the applicant requests and receives either of
the following prior to the hearing date:
1) A continuance, for good cause shown, which shall be granted at the
discretion of the Administrative Officer of the Nicholasville Planning
Commission, or--
2) A waiver of these requirements, based upon agreement with the
Administrative Officer of the Nicholasville Planning Commission, that the
applicant's appearance is not necessary.
A denial of any request which is caused by the applicant's violation of this section shall be
treated in the same manner as any other denied request.

DESIGN STANDARDS
200 MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS - The Planning Commission is authorized under
Kentucky Revised Statute 100.281 to specify design requirements for streets, blocks, lots,
utilities, recreation areas, other public facilities, and hazardous areas including land
subject to flooding within the City of Nicholasville. Furthermore, the Commission is
responsible for insuring that such standards are enforced during development as a
condition of subdivision plat approval.
These standards for public improvements shall be utilized to assure the conformance of
subdivision to the Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Ordinance.
The standards set forth in this section are considered to be minimum acceptable
standards of design acceptable for safe, efficient, and economical community
development. Generally, the Developer shall be responsible for providing the land and
constructing those public improvements required to serve his development. Where the
Commission determines that excess capacity facilities are needed, as defined in the
respective sections, the legislative body may be consulted for arrangements to cover the
cost of that capacity required beyond what is needed to serve the immediate development.
201 SELF-IMPOSED REGULATIONS - The Subdivider may provide for final
maintenance of common facilities or place restrictions on development more
restrictive than those provisions, if any, shall be noted in the deed restrictions
which shall be made a part of the Commission's record.
210 LOT DESIGN STANDARDS - The size, proportion, and orientation of individual
parcels of land and the buildings placed on them will vary with intended type of land use
and with the geologic characteristics of the land. Many of these characteristics are
determined through the zoning regulations governing the use of land (i.e. minimum lot
size, yard requirements, building setback and lot coverage.) Other principles of lot use
and layout are more generally applicable and are basic to principles of good subdivision
design. (See FIGURES 7 & 8, pages 73 and 74 of these Regulations)
211 GENERAL LOT LAYOUT GUIDELINES
211.1 CONFORM TO ZONING REQUIREMENTS - The site and
proportions of lots in any subdivision shall conform to the zoning of the
property in effect at the time of final plat submission.
211.2 PUBLIC STREET - The arrangement of lots shall be such that there
will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other
conditions, in locating a building on each lot and in providing access to a
building on such lots from an approved street. All lots shall front on a
6
public street, and without invalidating any of the provisions of the
Nicholasville Zoning Ordinance, such frontage will extend a minimum of
fifty (50) feet for all lots except for R-1F zoned lots which shall extend a
minimum of forty (40) feet, and R-1T nd R-3T zoned lots which shall
extend a minimum of twenty (20) feet. However, lots which front on
turnarounds for cul-de-sacs or on curves of a minimum radius of one
hundred (100) feet, shall be allowed a minimum frontage of forty (40) feet
except for R-1F zoned lots which shall be allowed a minimum of thirty (30)
feet, and R-1T and R-3T zoned lots which shall be allowed a minimum of
fourteen (14) feet. (Adopted: 09-17-98 Ordinance 274-1998)
211.3 ONE BUILDING PER LOT - Each separate principle use building
within an R-1 or R-2 zone shall be situated on a separate and single
subdivided lot of record. In all other zones, principal use buildings should
be located on the lot so that all current zoning ordinances may be met if the
buildings and lot are subdivided in the future.
211.4 LOT LINES - All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight
street lines and radial to curved street lines. All rear lines of lots shall
consist of straight lines with a minimum number of deflections.
211.5 CORNER LOTS - Corner lots shall be laid out so as to provide at
least minimum front yard requirements along both street frontages.
However, in certain circumstances a primary and a secondary street
frontage may be designated in the following residential zoned areas, if
approved by the Planning Commission:
a) R-1, R-1A, R-1B, R-1C, R-1D and R-1E.
b) R-2 zones in existence prior to December 14, 1989, limited to
single family lots only.
When the primary frontage of a corner lot has been designated, the
secondary frontage of the lot may be reduced by not more than ten (10')
feet. The lot adjacent to the corner lot with the designated secondary
frontage may be reduced by five (5') feet. The next adjacent lot shall be
laid out so as to provide the minimum front yard requirement. If a
primary and secondary street frontage is to be utilized, they shall be shown
on the proposed subdivision plat when submitted for review. Access to
corner lots shall be at least fifty (50') feet from the intersection of street
right-of-ways unless otherwise specified by Section 211.12.
211.6 TOPOGRAPHY - All parcels shall be laid out as related to
topography (whenever possible at or above the grades of the streets) to
provide a building site of adequate size and free from drainage problems.
7
An overlot grading and drainage plan shall be provided with the
construction plans, see Section 243.2.
211.7 LOT AREA REQUIREMENTS - Lot dimensions and area shall
conform to the zoning ordinance. No lot shall have a depth in excess of
four (4) times its width at the building line except for R-1T or R-3T lots
which shall not have a depth in excess of eight (8) times its width at the
building line unless it has been determined by the Commission that
exceptional topographic conditions, or some other extraordinary situation
or condition of the site would deprive the owner reasonable capacity to
make use. (Adopted: 09-17-98 Ordinance 275-1998)
211.8 BUILDING SETBACK LINE - The building setback line shall
comply with the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
211.9 MONUMENTS - Permanent monuments in a subdivision shall be
placed in accordance with the MINIMUM STANDARDS OF PRACTICE
FOR LAND SURVEYING IN KENTUCKY and subsequent revisions,
except as modified within these Regulations. These permanent monuments
shall be set at the PI of all street curves unless the PI falls outside of the
street right-of-way, the PC and PT shall be monumented. In addition, a
similar monument shall be set at the intersection of all streets contained
within the subdivision boundary. The permanent monuments shall be
either:
a) A steel bar no less than 1/2 inch in diameter and at least twelve (12")
inches long, installed after construction has been completed and
level with the surface.
b) Marked railroad spikes (full size 80# plus rail size) installed by the
following procedure:
1. Installed after the first bituminous layer of asphalt is completed
prior to the second bituminous layer being started.
2. If installed after construction is completed, a square recess 1/2"
plus deep and 2" x 2" shall be cut under the head to allow for
flush recess.
The top of these monuments shall have the permanent point marked
with a punched point or cut "x". They shall be described on the Final
Subdivision Plat, each in relation to a coordinate system as established
by the City in accordance with the requirements of the authorized
engineer or person (See Section 345.IJ also).
8
211.10 DOUBLE FRONTAGE LOTS - Lots shall not be laid out so that
they have frontage on more than one street except: (a) corner lots, or (b)
when the rear of the lot faces an arterial, freeway or railroad right-of-way
and the front of the lot faces on a minor street.
211.11 LOT NUMBERS - All parcels of land in a subdivision, other than
streets, shall be given a consecutive lot number. This applies also to lots
intended for non-residential use.
211.12 ACCESS TO LOTS - Lots shall have their primary access only from
an approved street in accordance with these regulations. All points of
access from an arterial street shall be approved by the Planning
Commission, which may require that several such lots be served by a
combined marginal access street in order to limit possible traffic hazards
on such street.
Access to a lot shall not be closer than one hundred and twenty-five (125)
feet from an intersection with an arterial street. If access to a lot is from a
collector or a marginal access street, a distance of not less than seventy-five
(75) feet from any intersection shall be free from such access. If access to
lot is from a minor street, a distance of not less than fifty (50) feet shall be
free from such access. In all cases, if a lot abuts an intersection of two
classes of streets, access shall be from the lower class of street. The
Commission may waive these requirements for lots located in Business
zones.
Alleys shall not be deemed as streets to provide primary access for any use.
Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the access
street, provision shall be made for the installation of a culvert or other
structure of a design approved by the city engineer or other authorized
person.
220 SUBDIVISION DESIGN PRINCIPLES - The following sections specify the
interrelationships between characteristics of the land (slope, soil composition, woodlands)
and the components of urban development of land under these regulations be carried out
in harmony with the limitations of the land. Within these limitations, it is intended that
flexibility with regard to innovative design and new technology be encouraged.
221 RELATION TO LAND - The street plan and lot arrangement of a proposed
subdivision shall be so designed to preserve, wherever possible, historical or
natural features such as trees, landmarks, water courses, and the natural lay of
the land and disposition of the topsoil. The Planning Commission may prepare a
list of all such features within its area of jurisdiction which it deems worthy of
preservation.
9
Failure of a subdivider to comply with the decision of the Planning Commission in
preservation of any of the above is punishable under Section 420.
221.1 UNSUITABLE LAND CONDITIONS - If the Commission finds that
land proposed to be subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision development
due to flooding, poor drainage, topography or other such conditions which
may endanger health, life or property; and if investigations conducted by
the public agencies concerned determine that in the best interest of the
public that the land should not be developed for the proposed purpose; the
Commission shall not approve the land for subdivision unless adequate
methods are proposed by the subdivider for solving those problems that
will be created by the development of the land.
221.2 AREAS PREMATURE FOR DEVELOPMENT - The Planning
Commission may refuse to approve what it considers to be scattered or
premature subdivision of land which would involve danger or injury to the
public health, safety, welfare, by reason of a lack of water supply, schools,
proper drainage, adequate roads or transportation facilities or other public
services; or which would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public
funds for supply of such services.
221.3 LAND SUBJECT TO FLOODING - Land subject to flood shall not
be platted for residential use or for any other use which may increase the
danger to health, life or property or aggravate erosion. Such land within
the subdivision shall be set aside on the plat for such uses as will not be
endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or will not result in
conditions contrary to the public welfare.
To ensure that lots will be located only where they will provide flood free
building sites, the Planning Commission shall require the subdivider to
provide elevation and flood profiles sufficient to demonstrate that no part
of a principal building*, including crawlspaces or basements, proposed to
be constructed upon a lot shall be located less than one (1') foot above the
flood plain as defined in Section 500.
Fill may be used in areas subject to flood, if authorized by the Commission,
as part of the Construction plans, and upon being granted the necessary
permits from the State of Kentucky, provided that it does not increase flood
heights to the extent that any existing or proposed principal building*,
including crawlspaces or basements, will be located less than one (1') foot
above the flood plain as defined in Section 500. No streets subject to
inundation or flooding, shall be approved by the Commission.
Sinkholes (either active or inactive) shall not be considered as a viable part
of the storm drainage system and shall not be enlarged or opened (within
proposed developments) so as to allow for the discharge of surface water
10
into the ground at a higher rate than existed prior to development.
Development within sinkhole areas can occur, if authorized by the
Commission, provided that any existing or proposed street or principal
building*, including crawl spaces or basements will not be located less than
one (1') foot above the Floodplain as defined in Section 500. For the
purposes of calculating flood elevations, the areas within sinkhole drainage
boundaries that are (or will be) located at an elevation below the natural or
man-made overflows at the sinkhole boundaries shall not be counted as
available storage volume for surface water runoff (i.e. the Design Engineer
shall assume that the sinkholes are filled to the elevations of the natural or
man-made overflows at the sinkhole boundaries).
* Principal Building - A building in which is conducted the main or
principal use of the lot on which said building is located.
(Adopted: 07-18-02 Ordinance 416-2002)
222 RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT - The subdivision of land for residential
purposes shall adhere to sound planning processes in the relationship of land to
buildings and to movement systems.
222.1 BLOCKS - The width of a residential block should accommodate two
(2) tiers of lots. However, where extraordinary physical conditions exist, or
where lots might otherwise front on an arterial street, the Commission may
approve a single tier of lots of minimum depths.
Block length should be at least 500 feet but shall not exceed 1200 feet, or
fifteen (15) times the minimum lot width, whichever is greater; except when
the Commission deems it impractical or necessary to allow otherwise to
secure efficient use of land under extraordinary physical conditions, in
which case the Commission may require the reservation through the block
of a ten (10) foot wide easement to accommodate utilities or pedestrian
traffic.
222.2 STREET PATTERN - The arrangement, location, character, width,
grade, and construction of all streets shall conform to the City
Transportation Plan and shall be considered in relationship to existing and
planned streets, topography, access to adjacent land, and public
convenience and safety. The street pattern shall discourage through traffic
in the interior of a subdivision. Residential development should not front
on arterial class streets. See also Section 231.2 of these Regulations.
222.3 LAND REMNANTS - If remnants of land exist after subdividing and
have no apparent future use which can be properly controlled, they shall be
incorporated into the lot pattern of the proposed subdivision.
11
223 COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT - The location and
orientation of commercial and industrial land subdivision shall be consistent with
the intent of the Nicholasville Zoning Regulations and in conformance with the
adopted Land Use Plan.
223.1 BLOCKS - Block length should be at least 500 feet but shall not
exceed 1200 feet, or fifteen (15) times the minimum lot width, whichever is
greater; except when the Commission deems it impractical or necessary to
allow otherwise to secure efficient use of land under extraordinary physical
conditions, in which case the Commission may require the reservation
through the block of a ten (10) foot wide easement to accommodate utilities
or pedestrian traffic.
223.2 MINIMIZE IMPACT - Lot layout and building arrangement shall be
so organized as to minimize the adverse effects of normal business
operations and vehicular activities on adjacent land. Streets serving
commercial and industrial activities shall be planned to connect with
arterial or collector streets so as not to generate traffic on minor streets.
223.3 PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS - The Planning Commission shall
require of the Developer public improvements, including streets and
utilities, of capacities adequate to avoid overloading by recommended
development in the immediate area.
224 MOBILE HOME DEVELOPMENT - Development of mobile home sites for
rental, lease, or sale shall conform to the requirements of the appropriate zoning
classification of the Nicholasville Zoning Regulations, or Kentucky Revised Statute
Chapter 219, whichever is more restrictive.
224.1 PERMIT APPLICATION - The Developer of a mobile home park
shall apply to the Kentucky Department of Health to obtain a permit to
construct or alter a mobile home park prior to filing a preliminary or
minor subdivision plat with the Planning Commission.
224.2 MOBILE HOME PARK REQUIREMENTS - Mobile home parks
shall meet the requirements of the Kentucky Mobile Home and
Recreational Vehicle Park Law adopted by the Kentucky State Department
of Health under the authority of the Kentucky Revised Statutes, Chapter
219.310 to 219.410 or the standards of these regulations and the
Nicholasville Zoning Ordinance, the highest standards shall apply.
225 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT - Sections of these Regulations may be
modified by the Planning Commission in the case of plans for complete
neighborhoods or other design innovations which, in the opinion of the
Commission, achieve the basic objectives of these regulations. The Planning
Commission may require additional conditions, such as covenants or specific notes
12
which it feels necessary to assure conformity to and achievement of the proposed
subdivision plan. Such development proposals shall be accompanied by a
compatible zoning plan which complies with the requirements of the Nicholasville
Zoning Ordinance, Article 11.
225.1 VARIANCES TO LOT DESIGN STANDARDS - Lot design
standards may be varied to accommodate innovative building styles and
methods. Minimum lot sizes may be waived when the difference is made up
by available common open space. Frontage on public streets and single
principle use provisions may be waived for cluster developments.
225.2 VARIANCES TO SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS -
Subdivision design standards may be varied to permit private internal
circulation systems, use of physical land features, and mixture of
residential, service, commercial, or industrial land use.
225.3 VARIANCES TO TRANSPORTATION FACILITY STANDARDS -
Variances or waivers may be granted for internal circulation systems,
however, all streets intended for dedication must be built to City standards.
Planned unit developments shall conform to all standards applying to
arterial and freeway streets.
225.4 VARIANCES TO PUBLIC UTILITY STANDARDS - No waivers or
variances shall be granted for planned unit developments which would
result in lower standards or capacities of construction equipment or
service.
226 CEMETERIES - These Regulations shall not apply to the subdivision of
burial lots in cemeteries except for the requirements to file a plat or record with
the Jessamine County Clerk.
230 TRANSPORTATION FACILITY DESIGN STANDARDS - The Planning
Commission is responsible for assuring that street development conforms to the Major
Street Plan with regard to the arrangement, character, location, right-of-way and
pavement widths, and grade. Proposed streets shall be considered in their relationship to
existing and planned streets, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate
relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
Streets shall be related to topography in their design in order to produce the most usable
building sites, whenever possible at or above the grades of the streets; to provide proper
drainage for storm water; and to produce proper grades and curves as required by these
Regulations.
Where it is desirable, consideration will also be given to non-motorized modes of
transportation routes including walkways and bikeways.
13
231 STREETS - Streets, as ways for the movement of vehicular traffic, serve two
principle functions: First, the movement of people and goods and, second, access
to adjoining properties. Unfortunately these two functions are of conflicting
nature because the smooth movement of traffic is interrupted by vehicles entering
or leaving traffic from or to adjacent property.
To satisfy the competing street functions of movement and access, sound traffic
engineering principles require the use of a street classification system of several
levels. Each street classification serves a combination of the two basic functions.
Freeways with access limited to controlled points, are exclusively movement
corridors. Arterial streets are also primarily movement streets but also serve
adjacent properties through controlled access points. Collector streets are major
streets whose function is to collect traffic from local streets and channel it to
arterials. Local streets are the opposite from freeways as locals primarily provide
access to lots which front on the street. Other types of streets which primarily
intend to provide accessibility to adjacent property include cul-de-sac streets,
frontage roads and alleys.
231.1 RESPONSIBILITY FOR STREETS - The developer shall construct
streets including all clearing, grading, laying of sub-base, base, pavements,
curbs, gutters, culverts, bridges, sidewalks, storm sewer mains and
structures in accordance with current City standards. The respective
legislative body is not required to accept any street until it has been
inspected by the City Engineer or other authorized person and has been
determined that such construction is in conformance with the approved
plans and adopted standards. To achieve the purposes of the
Comprehensive Plan, the City may require that certain streets serving a
subdivision be constructed to higher standards than would be necessary to
serve the particular subdivision. When higher standards are required, the
City may assure a proportionate share of the increased cost of construction.
Such cost shall not exceed the difference between that required for
construction of the minimum street capable of adequately serving the
subdivision and the cost of street construction required by the City.
231.11 UPGRADING OF STREETS - When a previously
unincorporated area is annexed to the City of Nicholasville, the City may
require that streets be upgraded, or cause such streets to be upgraded to
conform to City standards. The City may refuse to accept dedication of
substandard streets or to extend city services to areas served by
substandard streets.
231.2 GENERAL STREET DESIGN CRITERIA - The following guidelines
shall be used in the review of subdivision layout.
14
231.21 CONFORMANCE WITH COMPREHENSIVE PLAN - The
width and location of all streets in a proposed subdivision shall conform
in general alignment with the street system as included in the
Comprehensive Plan.
231.211 RIGHT-OF-WAYS AND MINIMUM DESIGN
STANDARDS - Right-of-ways to be dedicated for new streets shall
be in conformity with the Comprehensive Plan and shall meet at
least the minimum standards specified in Section 231.38.
231.22 DEAD-END STREETS - Dead-end streets, other than complete
cul-de-sac streets, shall only be permitted as a part of a continuing street
plan. Streets shall be arranged to provide for the continuation of
principal streets between adjacent properties for convenient movement
of traffic, effective fire protection, efficient provision of utilities, and
particularly where such continuation is in accordance with the
Comprehensive Plan.
Dedicated right-of-way and improvements shall be extended to the tract
boundary and reserve strips which might be used to control access to
adjacent property are prohibited. Temporary dead end streets shall not
exceed seven hundred (700) feet.
231.23 STREET INTERSECTIONS - Street intersections shall not
involve more than (4) street approaches, merging lanes and acceleration
lanes are considered parts of one street approach. Within forty (40) feet
measured for each street from the closest intersection of right-of-way
lines, such streets shall intersect as much as possible at a ninety (90)
degree angle, and in no case shall the angle be less than seventy-five (75)
degrees. No cross intersections of centerlines of other than minor or
marginal access streets shall be closer than eight hundred (800) feet
apart, unless the Commission deems it unrealistic under extraordinary
physical conditions. Offset intersection of centerlines shall not be closer
than one hundred fifty (150) feet. Except in a Central Business District
and unless extraordinary physical conditions necessitate a retaining wall
to be approved by the Commission, within the triangular area formed at
corners by the intersecting street centerlines; for a distance of ninety
(90) feet on each from their point of intersection, and diagonal
connecting the end points of these lines, visibility for traffic safety shall
be provided and by excavating if necessary.
A "site triangle" will be observed at all street intersections or
intersections of driveways with streets to insure that landscape materials
and structures do not constitute a driving hazard (see FIGURES 1 & 2,
page 15.) Within this site triangle nothing shall be erected, placed,
planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to materially impede
15
16
vision between a height of two and one-half (2-1/2) and twelve (12) feet
above the street center line grade.
Grades at street intersections shall be limited to two (2%) percent for a
distance of seventy-five (75) feet from the intersection of the center lines.
All street intersection corners shall be rounded by curves or radii of at
least twenty (20) feet.
231.24 EXISTING STREETS, REALIGNMENT OR WIDENING -
Where a subdivision is proposed along an existing street, a street
indicated for widening or realignment on the official map, half of the
additional width needed to bring the existing right-of-way to the
required right-of-way will be dedicated by the property on each side of
the existing street as it is proposed for subdivision*. Such areas shall be
shown and marked on the Subdivision Plat - "Reserved for Street
Alignment (or Widening) Purposes".
Dedication of new half-streets along tract boundaries shall not be
permitted except to complete the other half where such a street has been
previously platted.
*The Developer shall be required to construct all necessary
improvements.
231.25 INCREASED RIGHT-OF-WAY - If extraordinary physical
conditions render it impractical for a subdivision to provide the
required parking by the zoning ordinance, the Commission may require
the right-of-way to be increased to an adequate width to accommodate
parking on one or both sides of the street.
231.251 MULTI-FAMILY AREAS - Streets serving multi-family
areas shall connect directly to collector or arterial streets so as not to
generate large volumes of traffic on local streets. Such streets
should also be of adequate width to accommodate parking on both
sides of the road.
231.26 STREET NAMES - Street names shall be selected which will not
duplicate nor be confused with names of other existing streets in
Jessamine County. Proposed streets, which are clearly in alignment
with existing streets, shall bear the name of the existing street.
Generally, no street should change direction by more than 90 degrees
without a change in name.
17
231.261 STREET SIGNS - The subdivider shall install, or cause to
have installed, street signs at all street intersections, and stop signs
at locations directed by the Planning Commission. The signs shall
conform to the specifications of the City.
(Adopted: 01-9-97 Ordinance 193-1996)
231.27 HAZARDOUS OR CONFLICTING CONDITIONS - When a
proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to an existing or proposed
arterial or collector street, right-of-ways, or conflicting detrimental or
hazardous land uses, the Commission may require marginal access
streets, reverse frontage lots, lots with rear service alleys, lots with
additional depth, or other measures which may be necessary for
protection of abutting properties and the maintenance or function of
major traffic arteries. (Adopted: 10-01-98 Ordinance 278-1998)
231.28 PRIVATE STREETS AND RESERVE STRIPS - There shall be
no private streets platted within a subdivision. Reserve strips shall not
be accepted except where their control is clearly vested in the City,
under conditions approved by the Commission as authorized in these
regulations.
231.29 STREET TREES - The Commission may request that trees be
planted in the front yard. Trees to be planted shall be of the deciduous
type, and shall be of a type of root growth pattern which minimizes the
potential damage to street and utility facilities. Street trees shall
conform with the specifications in this section and the Nicholasville
Zoning Ordinance, Section 891 STREET TREES.
231.291 LOCATIONAL CRITERIA - Two options shall be
permitted at the developer's discretion. The first option shall be to
place the trees within the front yard no closer than 2-1/2 feet to the
sidewalk. The second option shall be to plant the trees within the
street right-of-way between the street curb and the sidewalk in the
area commonly called the "utility strip".
In this second option, the utilities normally placed in the utility strip
shall instead be placed within an easement adjacent and parallel to
the street right-of-way. The width of this easement shall be at least
equal to the utility strip. A Wider easement may be required in
some cases by the City or utility companies in order that adequate
room for provision and maintenance of services is available. The
physical separation of the trees and utility facilities required under
these options are intended to provide for the protection and
enhancement of both uses.
231.292 PLATTING REQUIREMENT - The cross section to be
utilized shall be determined at the time of Commission action on the
18
preliminary subdivision plat and shall also be reflected on the final
subdivision plat. The final subdivision plat shall also contain a note
stating where the street trees are to be located either within the
right-of-way or designated easement.
231.3 STREET CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM - The following functional
street classification shall be considered in the planning of a subdivision and
the implementation of the Comprehensive Plan. For examples of types of
streets refer to FIGURE 3 page 19.
231.31 EXPRESSWAYS - For the purpose of moving vehicles intercity
or between major parts of a city at high speed. Access is limited to
continuous flow, grade-separated interchanges with Arterial Streets.
Directional flow is served by two or more lanes each direction and is
separated by a grass or barrier median.
231.32 ARTERIAL STREETS - Primarily for the purpose of moving
vehicles intercity (Highways) and connecting sections of a city at
moderate speeds. Directional flow may be separated by mountable, nonmountable
or barrier medians and be served by one to three lanes in
each direction. Additional lanes may be designated for left and right
turns. Parking may be permitted. Access from adjacent properties is
controlled and where Arterial Streets are state highways, require an
Access Permit from the State Road Engineer of the District 7 Office of
the Bureau of Highways.
Access from adjacent residential development should be limited to
intersections with collector streets. Residential development should
back up to arterial streets and have deeper back yards and provisions
for buffering.
19
20
Adjacent apartment or commercial development should not have direct
access to arterial streets, but should be served by parallel frontage roads
with access points to the arterial street separated by at least (1000) feet.
231.33 COLLECTOR STREETS - For the purpose of "collecting"
traffic from local streets for distribution to arterial streets and to
provide access to adjacent property. Directional flow may be served by
one or two lanes in each direction with additional turning lanes as
needed. Parking is permitted. Posted speed limits are low - thirty-five
miles per hour or less.
231.34 LOCAL STREETS - For the purpose of providing vehicular
access to adjacent properties. Directional flow is served by one lane in
each direction. Posted speed limits are low. Parking is permitted and
may require additional roadway width than for movement only. Layout
should discourage through traffic.
231.341 CUL-DE-SAC STREETS - A local street with only one end
open to vehicular traffic and the other end terminated by a
permanent vehicular turn-around. The length of cul-de-sac streets
shall not exceed seven hundred (700) feet with a minimum right-ofway
radius of fifty (50) feet with a pavement radius of forty-one (41)
feet.
Such a dead-end street shall not come closer than one hundred (100)
feet from the boundary of a subdivision if its continuation is not
needed for
access of adjoining property. The Commission may
require the reservation of a twenty (20) foot wide easement between
the end of the proposed dead-end street and an adjacent piece of
property to accommodate pedestrian traffic or utilities.
231.342 LOOP STREETS - A local street where both ends terminate
at an intersection with the same collector or arterial street. The
radius of the loop shall not be more than one thousand (1000) feet
from the intersecting collector or arterial street.
231.35 FRONTAGE ROADS - For the exclusive purpose of providing
access to properties adjacent to arterial streets and expressways,
frontage roads provide for two way traffic at a slow-rate of speed and
parallel the arterial street with access points to it not more than every
four hundred (400) feet. The Commission may require frontage roads as
a condition to approval of development along designated or proposed
arterials or expressways.
21
231.36 ALLEYS - For the purpose of providing secondary vehicular
access to adjacent properties along the rear or side lot lines in
commercial or industrial areas. Alleys shall not be used for residential
subdivisions.
231.37 DEAD END STREETS - A street temporarily having only (1)
outlet for vehicular traffic and intended to be extended or continued in
the future.
231.38 STREET DESIGN STANDARDS - See page 22.
231.39 PAVEMENT SPECIFICATIONS FOR STREETS - All streets,
parking lots and off-street parking shall be "dust free" with no loose
aggregate.
231.391 PLANS REQUIRED - In compliance with Section 333.2F of
these regulations, the subdivider shall submit plans for the proposed
street system with the filing of the preliminary plat (Method #1 or
#2) for Commission approval. Such plans shall be prepared by a
Registered Civil Engineer, drawn to a scale of not less than one
hundred (100) feet to the inch horizontally and ten (10) feet to the
inch vertically, showing existing and proposed elevations along the
centerlines of all proposed streets, and the elevations of existing
streets for a distance of one hundred (100) feet either side of their
intersection with a proposed street. In addition proposed profiles
including lengths of vertical curves and grades shall be shown in
prominent lines.
Such plans shall be designed as a logical extension of the public
street system to serve the development and for future extension of
the system.
231.392 STANDARDS - Streets shall conform with the dimensions
and geometric designs as described in these Regulations and Section
III-3 STREETS, NICHOLASVILLE GENERAL
SPECIFICATIONS.

232 CURBS AND GUTTERS - Curbs and gutters shall be required in all
subdivisions. For specifications refer to Section III-4 CURBS AND GUTTERS,
NICHOLASVILLE GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS.
233 SIDEWALKS - Sidewalks shall be required in all subdivisions, at shopping
centers, playgrounds, schools, and where pedestrian movement is concentrated for
the pedestrian's safety, convenience, and better circulation. In industrial
subdivisions sidewalks may be waived as determined by the Planning Commission.
233.1 STANDARDS - Sidewalks shall be at least four (4) feet wide, and
located no further than one (1) foot inside the street right-of-way line
except at the intersection, where they shall extend to the curb. The curb
shall be removed to allow the sidewalk to gradually slope to the street.
Handicap ramps are required at all street intersections. For specifications
refer to Section III-5. SIDEWALKS and SECTION III-4. CURBS AND
GUTTERS, NICHOLASVILLE GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS.
234 BIKEWAYS - Where conditions of high bicycle utilization exist, the Planning
Commission may require one of the following types of bicycle facilities to be
provided by the Developer to insure the safety of the cyclists and encourage
greater use of the bicycle as an alternate means of transportation.
234.1 BICYCLE PATHS - Shall include only those bicycle facilities
whereby a separate right-of-way is set aside for the exclusive use of cyclists
to the exclusion of motorized vehicles and pedestrians. One-way bike paths
shall be at least four (4) feet wide and paved with concrete or bituminous
paving material. Two-way bike paths shall be at least eight (8) feet wide.
234.2 BICYCLE LANES - Shall include those bicycle facilities where a
portion of a street is designated by a raised curb or painted land strip, for
the exclusive use of cyclists. Bike lanes shall be prominently marked as

of four (4) feet wide.
234.3 BICYCLE ROUTES - Shall include those existing or proposed streets
that are determined by specific analysis to be suitable for the safe operation
of bicycles. Bike routes do not provide for the exclusive use of bicycles but
require sharing the street with other vehicles, and are designated by a map
of public distribution and/or by the official "Bike Route" sign.
235 STREET LIGHTING - The Developer shall install street lights in accordance
with the standards and specifications of the City of Nicholasville in each
subdivision.
24
235.1 STANDARDS - Street lights shall be located at each entrance
(streets and walkways) to the subdivision and at each street intersection
within the subdivision.
Whenever the distance between two (2) adjacent street (walkways) lights
would exceed three hundred (300) feet, then additional lights shall be
installed. The subdivision plat shall indicate whether overhead or
underground electric service is being provided to each individual pole.

CITY OF NICHOLASVILLE.
240 PUBLIC UTILITIES - The administration of these regulations by the Planning
Commission shall take into account the relationships between new development and
the adopted community plans for utility systems. Proposed development shall be
considered in terms of required service by sanitary sewer facilities, water supply,
storm water drainage and energy supply. Where necessary, the Commission shall
require the provision of exclusive utility easements consistent with the needs to serve
the proposed and future development.
Generally utilities should be provided in rear lot easements wherever possible. In
cases where underground utilities must be provided within the right-of-way of streets,
they should not be installed under the pavement. All of the in-street underground
work, including water mains, gas mains, sewer lines, etc., and all service connections
shall be completely installed and approved by the authorized engineer or person
throughout the length and width of the street before covering.
241 WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM - Where a public water supply system is
reasonably accessible to the proposed subdivision, as determined by the Planning
Commission, the Developer shall construct a complete water distribution system
according to the specifications of the agency having jurisdiction and shall provide
a connection for each lot with laterals extended to the lot line. The distribution
system shall be so designed and constructed as to form an integral part of the
City's or Water District's distribution system.
241.1 PLANS REQUIRED - In compliance with Section 333.2G of these
Regulations, the subdivider shall submit plans for the proposed water
distribution system with the filing of the preliminary plat (Method #1 or
25
#2) for Commission approval. Such plans shall be prepared by a
Registered Civil Engineer, drawn to a scale of not less than one hundred
(100) feet to the inch horizontally and ten (10) feet to the inch vertically,
showing pipe sizes, type of pipe, finished grade elevations, valves,
and fire hydrants. Such plans shall be designed as a logical extension of the
public water system including trunk lines as needed to serve the subject
tract and future extensions of the system.
241.2 STANDARDS - For specifications refer to Section I. WATER
FACILITIES, NICHOLASVILLE GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS.
241.3 PUBLIC WATER UNAVAILABLE - In subdivisions where City
water supply is not available and an individual well or cistern will supply
each dwelling, a letter of acceptance and approval from the State Health
Department must be submitted with the preliminary plat. Wells should be
located twenty-five (25) feet from the property lines, one hundred (100) feet
uphill from septic tanks or other sewage systems and forty (40) feet from
lakes or drainage ways.
241.4 OVERSIZED FACILITIES - Whenever the City or rural water
service deems it appropriate and necessary, the Subdivider may be
required to install water main, fire hydrants, and valves in excess of those
required to adequately serve the subdivision. In these cases, the Developer
may apply to the City Commission which may reimburse the Developer for
the difference in cost between the water facilities actually needed in the
subdivision and the cost of the water facilities necessary to provide for
planned future development.
242 SANITARY SEWAGE TREATMENT SERVICE - Where a public sanitary
sewer system is reasonably accessible to the proposed subdivision, as determined
by the Planning Commission, a complete sanitary sewer with lateral connections
for each lot (provided to the lot line) shall be installed by the Developer and
connected to the public system when the authorized engineer or person has
approved said subdivision system.
242.1 PACKAGE TREATMENT PLANS - Where a public sanitary sewer
system is not reasonably accessible or cannot be tapped into, due to
overloading, a neighborhood or "Package" disposal system may be
installed according to standards determined by the County Health Officer
and the Kentucky Department of Natural Resources and Environmental
Protection, if approved by both the Planning and City Commissions.
242.2 INDIVIDUAL DISPOSAL SYSTEMS - Where a public sanitary
sewer system is not reasonably accessible, septic tank or other individual
26
systems may be installed, subject to the approval and conditions of the
County Health Officer and/or Kentucky Department of Health based on
the review of a soils analysis and percolation data or other pertinent data
for each lot in the proposed subdivision.
242.3 FUTURE SERVICE - Where plans exist for extending a public
sanitary sewer system into an area that is being subdivided, and it is
reasonably expected that the area will be served by a public sewer system
within a period of five years, capped sewers shall be installed to adequately
serve all lots in the proposed subdivision.
242.4 PLANS REQUIRED - In compliance with Section 333.2H of these
Regulations, the subdivider shall submit plans for the proposed sanitary
sewer disposal system with the filing of the preliminary plat (Method #1 or
#2) for Commission approval. Such plans shall be prepared by a
Registered Civil Engineer, drawn to a scale of not less than one hundred
(100) feet to the inch horizontally and ten (10) feet to the inch vertically,
showing pipe sizes, gradients, type of pipe, invert and finished grade
elevations, location and type of manholes, the location, type and size of all
lift or pumping stations and treatment facilities, if on site. Such plans shall
be designed as a logical extension of the public sewer system including
trunk lines as needed to serve the subject tract and future extensions of the
system.
Where septic tank systems are used, plans shall show percolation rates, the
capacity of the tank and location and length of the drainage field for each
parcel.
242.5 STANDARDS - For specifications refer to Section II, SEWERAGE
FACILITIES, NICHOLASVILLE GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS.
242.6 OVERSIZED FACILITIES - When it is determined to be necessary,
the Developer may be required to install collection or treatment facilities in
excess of those required to adequately serve the subdivision. In these cases,
the Developer may apply to the City Commission which may reimburse the
Developer for the difference in cost between the facilities actually needed in
the subdivision and the cost of facilities necessary to provide for future
planned development.
243 STORM WATER DRAINAGE SYSTEM - The Developer shall be responsible
for adequate and safe disposal of all surface waters in the subdivision and shall
provide for that purpose a complete drainage system.
27
243.1 DISPOSAL BEYOND SUBDIVISIONS - Where an adequate public
storm sewer is available at the subdivision boundary, the Developer shall
construct the storm sewer system to connect with such storm sewer line. If
such a system is not available, the Developer may be required by the
Commission to provide for the construction of necessary storm drainage
facilities as may be required beyond the immediate boundaries of the
subdivision in order to conduct runoff to an acceptable point of disposal.
243.2 PLANS REQUIRED - In compliance with Section 333.2I of these
Regulations, the subdivider shall submit plans for the proposed storm
water drainage system with the filing of the preliminary plat (Method #1 or
#2) for Commission approval. Such plans shall be prepared by a
Registered Civil Engineer, drawn to a scale of not less than one hundred
(100) feet to the inch horizontally and ten (10) feet to the inch vertically,
showing contours, invert elevations, gradients, lengths of pipe, catch basins,
manholes, junction boxes, inlets, pipe storm drains, ditches, and holding
ponds indicating size and material, culverts, and headwalls, bridges, pump
stations, and discharge points. An overlot grading and drainage plan shall
also be included with these plans. Such plans shall be designed as a logical
extension of the public storm water drainage system to serve the subject
tract and future extensions of the system.
243.3 STANDARDS - For specifications refer to Section IV, STORM
DRAINAGE FACILITIES, NICHOLASVILLE GENERAL
SPECIFICATIONS.
243.4 OVERSIZED FACILITIES - When it is determined to be necessary,
the Developer may be required to install drainage structures in excess of
those required to serve the subdivision. In these cases the Developer may
apply to the City Commission which may reimburse the Developer for the
difference in cost between the facilities actually needed in the subdivision
and the cost of facilities necessary to provide for future planned
development.
243.5 LOTS WITH DETENTION/RETENTION BASIN - Lots that have a
detention/retention basin located on them may be recorded on a Final Plat
but a Building Permit shall not be issued until the detention/retention basin
is constructed to specifications. A note shall be placed on the Construction
Plans, Preliminary Plat and Final Plat to this effect.
244 ELECTRIC, TELEPHONE AND GAS SERVICE - Electric service and
telephone service shall be provided within each subdivision. Gas service may be
required where reasonably accessible.
28
Whenever such facilities are reasonably accessible and available, they may be
required to be installed within the area prior to the approval of the final plat.
Telephone, electric, and street lighting wires, conduits and cables may be
constructed underground by the Developer.
245 PROVISION OF UTILITY EASEMENTS - The Subdivider shall set aside
land easements for the placement and access for maintenance of public and
private utilities in accordance with the requirements of Sections 333.1I and 345.1G
of these Regulations.
245.1 LOCATION OF EASEMENTS - Where topography or other
conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of utilities or
drainage facilities within the street right-of-way, perpetual unobstructed
easements shall be provided along rear lot lines. The Planning Commission
may allow easements along side lot lines if deemed necessary. Easements
will terminate where they meet a street or other easement.
245.2 DIMENSIONS OF EASEMENTS - The minimum width for utility
easements shall be twelve (12) feet, centered along lot lines (six feet
provided on each lot). Dead end easements shall not exceed one hundred
(150) feet in length.
245.3 DRAINAGE EASEMENTS - If a perennial stream flows through or
is adjacent to the proposed subdivision, the plat shall provide an easement
for a floodway in accordance with Section 221.3 of these Regulations. The
floodway easement shall provide for future improvement of the stream
channel as adjacent areas become more developed and runoff rates
increase.
245.4 EASEMENTS FOR PEDESTRIAN ACCESS - The Planning
Commission may require, in order to facilitate pedestrian
access from streets, to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other nearby streets,
a perpetual unobstructed easement at least twenty (20) feet in width.
245.5 RESTRICTIONS - No principle or accessory buildings or other
structures shall be permitted within easements. Any overhanging or
obstructing limbs, shrubbery, or vegetation may be removed within the
limits of the easement at the sole discretion of the appropriate maintenance
personnel.
250 COMMUNITY FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE - The process of land
subdivision and development represents a long term commitment to a particular land
29
use and movement pattern, good or bad. It is therefore the point in time of a
community's development that the planning process is actually implemented with
respect to securing the land needed for public services.
251 RESERVATION OF LAND -
252 OFFICIAL PUBLIC PROPERTIES MAP - If the City has adopted an Official
Properties Map, as provided for in KRS 100.293 - 100.317 which includes such
public use, then, in addition to the provisions for reservation (Section 251), the
Legislative Body may prevent the development of such area by refusing to issue a
construction permit. Unless such permit is granted, no person shall recover any
damages for the taking for public use of any structure or improvement
constructed within the lines shown on the Map. Any such structure or
improvement shall be removed at the expense of the owner when the land is
acquired for public use.
253 UNFORSEEN DEVELOPMENT - Where considered essential by the
Commission in its review of large scale or planned unit development not
anticipated in the adopted plans, the Commission may require the reservation for
purchase of such areas of an extent and location suitable for the needs created by
such development for parks, schools, streets or public use for no more than two
years.
254 DESIRABLE FEATURES - In the subdivision of any land within the area of
jurisdiction, due regard shall be given to all natural features such as tree stands,
water courses, historical spots, or similar conditions which, if preserved, will
contribute to the attractiveness and value of the proposed development. (See
Section 221)
30
ARTICLE 3
SUBDIVISION PROCESSING
300 PURPOSE - One of the tools available to local planning commissions for the
implementation of the adopted comprehensive plan is the administration of land
subdivision regulations. The emphasis of a community's subdivision regulations is to
control the quality of development that has been specified for any given tract of land
by the Planning and Zoning Ordinance. This is achieved through the efficient
utilization of the land in accordance with the standards established in Article 2 of these
Regulations.
301 AUTHORITY - The Commission's authority and responsibilities for these
purposes is stated in the Kentucky Revised Statute, Chapter 100, Section 100.277
as follows:
(1) No person or his agent shall subdivide any land, before securing the approval
of the planning commission of a plat designating the areas to be subdivided, and
no plat of a subdivision of land within the planning unit jurisdiction shall be
recorded by the county clerk until the plat has been approved by the commission
and the approval entered thereon in writing by the chairman, secretary, or other
duly authorized officer of the commission.
(2) No person owning land composing a subdivision, or his agent, shall transfer or
sell or agree to sell any lot or parcel of land located within a subdivision by
reference to, or by exhibition, or by any other use of a plat of such subdivision,
before such plat has received final approval of the planning commission and has
been recorded. Any such instrument of transfer, sale, or contract shall be void
and shall not be subject to be recorded, but all rights of such purchaser to
damages are hereby preserved. The description of such lot or parcel by metes and
bounds in any contract or instrument of transfer or other document used in the
process of selling or transferring same shall not exempt the person attempting to
transfer from penalties provided or deprive the purchaser of any right or remedies
he may otherwise have.
(3) Any street or other public ground which has been dedicated shall not be
accepted by the legislative body until it has received recommendations for the
planning commission.
The subdivider or developer is required to submit certain maps of his proposed
subdivision (plats) to the commission which contain such information as to permit
the evaluation of the proposed project by the commission and other agencies of the
City.
31
302 APPLICABILITY - These Regulations and Standards shall apply to the
subdivision of any tract of land into two (2) or more parcels, counting the original
tract; the consolidation of two or more parcels of land into a fewer number of
parcels; the survey or re-survey of property; and to the amendment of any
subdivision plat previously approved by the commission.
302.1 CLASSES OF SUBDIVISIONS - Proposed subdivisions of land shall
be determined by the Chairman or his designee to be classified as Major or
Minor Subdivisions. Major Subdivisions shall be processed in accordance

320 SKETCH PLAT - The sketch plat review or preapplication conference is intended
to provide the initial contact between the prospective subdivider (property owner or
developer) and the Commission. At this meeting the Commission learns of the
imminent plans for the development of the subject tract of land and can initiate
contacts with other governmental departments to determine the potential need for
acquiring land and providing services. The subdivider is then briefed on the
subdivision regulations and procedures to be followed and reviews the
recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan for the vicinity of the land proposed for
subdivision. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider requesting action to appear
at the scheduled hearing to request same (See Section 173). This conference may be
waived by the Chairman or his designee. In which case the applicant shall proceed to
the preliminary plat.
321 PROCESSING
321.1 NOTIFICATION - The subdivider shall notify the Chairman or his
designee no less than twenty-one (21) days before a regularly scheduled

324 TYPICAL PREAPPLICATION SKETCH (See FIGURE 4, page 34)
330 PRELIMINARY PLAT - The purpose of the preliminary plat is to provide the
Commission with a detailed graphic statement of the proposed improvements to the
subject tract of land. The preliminary plat is "preliminary" only in the sense that the
Commission may make suggestions or request suggestions from other qualified
agencies towards improving the design or improvement standards presented by the
subdivider. Upon Commission approval of the preliminary plat (Method #1 or #2), the
developer is authorized to proceed with the development of the approved plan and
construction of public facilities.
34
35
331 PROCESSING
331.1 SUBMITTAL - Within six months of the pre-application conference,
the subdivider shall file an application for the consideration of a
preliminary subdivision plat (shown in Article 6). Such application shall be
filed with the Planning Commission along with the plat and the
information specified in Section 333 at least twenty-one (21) days prior to a
regularly scheduled meeting date of the commission. Two methods of
application are available. The land developer must select one of the
following methods:
METHOD #1
An application and construction plans* shall be filed prior to any approval
of a preliminary layout and prior to filing an application for approval of a
final subdivision plat.
METHOD #2
(Step 1) - An application shall be filed prior to any approval of a
preliminary layout and prior to filing an application for approval of a final
subdivision plat. Approval of this step shall merely constitute approval of
the subdivision location and general layout. Site preparation is
permissible, but construction of any improvements required by this
ordinance shall not be permitted. (The Planning Commission reserves the
right to require construction plans, if it deems necessary, during this step.)
(Step 2) - After having gained approval of Step 1 and prior to filing an
application for approval of a final subdivision plat, the developer shall
submit, within six (6) months construction plans* for approval. After
having gained approval of Step 2 and compliance with other applicable
requirements of this ordinance, construction of improvements may begin.
Failure to submit construction plans within six (6) months shall require
reapproval of expired preliminary layout, Step 1. The preliminary plat
shall be prepared by a qualified licensed professional engineer or licensed
professional land surveyor, at a scale of not less than one hundred (100)
feet per inch and shall be on one or more sheets 24" x 36" (inches) in size.
*Construction Plans - These drawings which depict the erection,
construction, alteration, repair, renovation, excavation, filling and grading
of subdivision improvements as required by this ordinance and including a
description and list of materials used in said improvements. (See Sections
231.39, 241.1, 242.4 & 243.2.) The construction plans can be submitted in
phases, if proposed construction phases shown on the Preliminary Plat
[Method #1 or Method #2 (Step 1)] are approved by the Planning
36
Commission. The Planning Commission may delegate approval of the
construction plans to the Planning Commission Staff. If the Planning
Commission delegates approval of the construction plans to the Staff, the
following conditions shall apply:
A. The construction plans will not be approved until complete sets of
plans for the construction phase are submitted for all public
improvements (utilities).
B. If variances are requested, the construction plans shall be brought
back to the Planning Commission.
C. Items that cannot be resolved between the Staff and the Developer's
Engineer shall be brought back to the Planning Commission and
resolved prior to the construction plans being approved.
Adopted: 03-26-12 Ordinance 832-2012)
331.2 NUMBER OF COPIES - The subdivider shall submit eight (8) copies
of the preliminary plat and required supplementary information to the
Chairman or his designee for distribution to and review by the commission
members and such other agencies and officials as may be necessary for the
purpose of review and recommendations.
331.3 PLAT REVIEW - The preliminary plat shall be reviewed by the
Commission and other such agencies and officials as necessary. The
findings will be presented and evaluated at a public hearing by the
Commission. The subdivider will be mailed a notice at least five (5) days
prior to the meeting at which the plat is to be considered. Similar notice
shall be mailed to the owners of the land immediately adjoining the acreage
proposed to be subdivided as shown on the proposed plat, in order that
they may be informed of the action. It shall be the responsibility of the
subdivider requesting action to appear at the scheduled hearing to request
same (See Section 173).
331.31 REVIEW BY KENTUCKY BUREAU OF HIGHWAYS - If the
Bureau of Highways has filed corridor maps with the Commission in
accordance with KRS 100.287, the Commission will provide a copy of
any affected plat and defer approval until the comments have been
received within fifteen (15) days after the Bureau's receipt of the plat.
331.32 - In determining whether a preliminary plat shall be granted
approval, the Commission shall consider the following:
A. Conformance with plat specification.
37
B. Conformance with the applicable provisions of the Zoning
Regulations.
C. Coordination with the elements of existing land use and the
Comprehensive Plan.
D. Fair allocations of areas for streets, parks, schools, public and
semi-public buildings, homes, utilities, business, and industry.
E. Distribution of population and traffic in a manner to create
conditions favorable to health, safety, convenience and the
harmonious development of the community.
F. Review comments received from agencies and officials.
G. Comments expressed by the public at the Commission review
hearing.
H. The effects of the proposed development on adjoining lands as
yet undeveloped.
The applicant or his authorized agent, preferably his engineer, shall
be prepared to attend the meeting of the Planning Commission to
discuss the above.
331.33 - The Commission may require the reservation of land for
parks, schools, and other public uses for a period not to exceed two
years.
331.4 COMMISSION ACTION - Within 90 days of the Commission
meeting on the preliminary plat, it shall take one of the following actions:
(1) approve the plat, (2) approve the plat subject to conditions, (3)
disapprove the plat, unless such time is extended by agreement of the
Commission and the subdivider, or (4) postpone taking action for specific
stated reasons for up to 90 days. If the Commission finds that the
preliminary plat does not meet the requirements of these Regulations, it
shall either disapprove the plat, or conditionally approve the plat, subject
to specified revisions, within the said time period. Failure of the
Commission to act on the plat within the specified time shall be considered
as approval of the plat.
Approval of the preliminary plat by the Commission does not constitute
approval of the subdivision but is merely an authorization to proceed with
the preparation of the final plat and construction of public facilities. (As
per application submission method, Section 331.1)
38
In the event of disapproval or conditional approval of the preliminary plat,
a statement in writing by the Commission setting forth the reasons for
disapproval or the conditions of approval, shall be mailed to the subdivider
and entered into the records of the Commission.
331.5 EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF APPROVAL - At such time as a
preliminary plat has been approved by the Commission, the Chairman, or
his designee shall affix his signature to the plat notification for preliminary
approval. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider for compliance
with the final approval requirements. Such approval shall be effective for
a twenty-four (24) month period from the date of approval. During that
time the general terms and conditions under which the preliminary
approval was granted will not be affected by any changes or amendments
to these Regulations.
Approval of the Preliminary Plat shall not constitute acceptance of the
Final Subdivision Plat. The final subdivision plat may comprise only a
portion of the preliminary plat and extensions of time (up to twenty-four
(24) months each) may be granted by the Planning Commission for the
submission of a final subdivision plat for the remainder of the preliminary
plat. If a preliminary plat is granted an extension of time by the Planning
Commission, all current City Zoning Ordinances, Subdivision Regulations,
and General Construction Specifications must be met. Failure to submit an
application for a final subdivision plat (as hereinbefore stated) or an
extension of time within twenty-four (24) months shall require reapproval
of the expired preliminary plat.
331.6 ADJUSTMENT OF PRELIMINARY PLAT REQUIREMENTS -
The Planning Commission may waive the requirements in any individual
case where, in the Commission's judgment such waiver would be in the
public interest and would eliminate undue hardship. No waiver shall be
granted which will have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of
these Regulations. In granting any adjustment, the Commission shall
attach such conditions as are necessary, in its judgment, to secure
substantially the objections of the standards or requirements so adjusted.
A Planned Unit Development comprised of the large scale construction of
housing units together with related uses and necessary ways of access may
be approved by the Commission although the design of the project does not
follow standard street, lot, or subdivision arrangements; provided that the
departure from the standards of these Regulations can be made without
destroying their intent. The Commission may require such covenants or
39
other legal provisions, which it determines are necessary to insure
conformity to the proposed plan and the intent of these Regulations.
Any waiver of these Regulations shall be specifically requested in writing
by the Subdivider with reference to the particular section to be waived.
This request shall be accompanied by the submission of the preliminary
plat and be entered in the minutes of the review meeting.
331.7 AMENDMENT OF PRELIMINARY PLAT - If, after the
Commission has approved a preliminary plat, the Subdivider desires to
make a change in the number of lots, alignment of streets, or use of
previously dedicated property, an "Amended Preliminary Plat" shall be
filed for review according to the procedures previously described.
332 FEES - The Planning Commission shall levy a plat review fee for the
examination and review of every preliminary plat reviewed by the Commission.
The following fees apply to preliminary plats and are payable by the Subdivider at
the time of filing his application for preliminary plat approval.
332.1 FEES FOR PRELIMINARY PLATS -See Building Permit and
Planning and Zoning Fee Schedule.
332.2 METHOD OF PAYMENT - Plat review fees shall be paid in legal
tender, check, or money order made payable to the Nicholasville Planning
Commission.
332.3 LATE FILING FEES - The fee for plats filed later than twenty-one
(21) days prior to the Commission's meeting will be triple the regular fee.
332.4 FEE FOR "AMENDED PRELIMINARY PLAT" - The fee for
review of an Amended Preliminary Plat shall be the same as for the
Preliminary Plat.
332.5 REFUNDS - Fees for reviewed plats are not refundable. Fees for

45
340 FINAL PLAT - The Final Subdivision Plat serves two purposes: It is first of all, a
plat of record containing such information as necessary for the public recording and
transfer of land including lot lines, easements, and restrictions. The final plat may also
include construction details for streets, sidewalks, public utilities and lands. The
Commission's final plat review process serves as a check to assure that subdivision
requirements and specifications have been met and that public utilities and other
improvements have been or will be installed according to minimum standards.
Approval of the final plat authorizes the subdivider to record the subdivision with the
Jessamine County Clerk and offer lots for sale to the public.
341 PROCESSING
341.1 SUBMITTAL - Within the twenty-four (24) month effective period of
the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall file the Final Subdivision Plat for
review and action by the Planning Commission. An application (shown in
Article 6) for processing shall be filed with the Commission at least twentyone
(21) days prior to a regularly scheduled meeting date of the
Commission. Failure to submit the final plat or to gain an extension of time
(Section 331.5) within twenty-four (24) months shall require reapproval of
the expired preliminary plat.
341.2 CONTENT - The final plat shall conform substantially to the
approved preliminary plat and incorporate all modifications and changes
as required by the Commission. The final plat may constitute only that
portion of an approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to
develop and record at the time. The plat shall include those items and
supplementary information specified in Section 345 of these Regulations.
The Planning Commission may waive certain requirements at its discretion
in situations of undue hardship upon written request from the Subdivider
as specified in Section 331.6 of these Regulations. The final plat shall be
prepared at a scale of not less than one hundred (100) feet per inch on
sheets 18" x 24" (inches) in size by a registered engineer whose seal shall
appear on the plat.
341.3 NUMBER OF COPIES - The subdivider shall submit eight (8) copies
of the final plat and required supplementary information to the Chairman
or his designee for distribution and review by the Commission members
and such other agencies and officials as may be necessary for review and
comment.
341.4 PLAT REVIEW - Prior to submission to the Planning Commission,
the subdivider shall submit the final plans for review and certification by
the City Engineer or other qualified representative. Upon application, the
final plat shall be reviewed by the Commission Staff and such other
agencies and officials as necessary. Final Plats may not need to be reviewed
by the Planning Commission if the plat, as submitted, complies with
46
conditions attached to the preliminary plat. The Planning Commission,
however, may review any final plat if it so desires.
The City Engineer or other qualified representative will check the plat in
regard to computation, certification, monuments, and that the required
improvements have been installed to the satisfaction of the City officials
and any other agencies and officials having jurisdiction. Where such
improvements have not been installed, the City Engineer or other qualified
representative, and any other agencies having jurisdiction over the
required improvements shall establish the amount(s) of the surety required
to be posted to cover the costs of such improvements in accordance with
Section 343. (Approved: 6-20-2013 Ordinance #875-2013)
It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider requesting action to appear
at the scheduled hearing to request same (See Section 173).
(Adopted: 07-02-09 Ordinance 751-2009)
341.5 COMMISSION ACTION - Within 90 days of the Commission's
meeting (if required) on the final plat, the Commission shall either approve,
disapprove, or postpone action on the plat. If the plat is disapproved, the
reasons for disapproval shall be provided in writing to the Subdivider and
stated in the records of the Commission. If action on the plat is postponed
for up to 30 days, the specific reason for postponement will be stated in
writing. Failure of the Commission to act within the prescribed time shall
be considered as approval of the plat.
The Commission shall not disapprove the final plat if the Subdivider has
fulfilled all requirements and has proceeded in accordance with the
conditions and standards specified in the approved preliminary plat. If the
final plat is disapproved, the subdivider shall make the necessary
corrections and resubmit the final plat within thirty (30) days from
disapproval.
If a plat is refused by the Commission, the person submitting the plat
which the Commission refused to approve may file a petition within 30
days after such refusal in the Circuit Court of Jessamine County.
Approval of the final plat by the Commission shall not constitute or imply
the acceptance by the City of the dedication of any street, park, or other
public ways or grounds. The Commission may require said plat to be
endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. The Commission may also
require the filing of a written agreement between the applicant and the
City Commission, covering future title, dedication and provision for the
cost of grading, development, equipment, and maintenance of any park or
playground area.
47
341.6 RECORD PLAT - One (1) certified reproducible copy and six (6)
blue line copies of the Final Subdivision Plat shall be filed with the
Commission. When the Final Plat has been approved by the Commission,
the Subdivider has two (2) years to request that the Subdivision Plat be
recorded by the Commission. In turn, the Commission shall within thirty
(30) days from the date of request, file at the developer's expense, (one) 1
copy of the Subdivision Plat with the Jessamine County Clerk as an official
plat of the record. When the Plat has been recorded, one (1) blueline copy
bearing evidence of the County Clerk's recording of same shall be returned
to the Subdivider or his agent.
341.7 REVISIONS OF APPROVED PLAT - No changes, erasures,
modifications or revisions shall be made on any subdivision plat after
approval has been given by the Planning Commission and endorsed in
writing on the plat, unless said plat is first resubmitted to the Commission
as an "Amended Plat", and the Commission approves such modifications.
An explanation shall be placed on such plat stating the purpose for any
changes, erasures, modifications or revisions. In the event that any such
subdivision plat is recorded without complying with this requirement, that
plat shall be considered null and void, and the Commission shall institute
proceedings to have said subdivision plat stricken from the records of the
County Clerk.
341.8 LOTS WITH DETENTION/RETENTION BASIN - Lots that have a
storm water detention basin or retention basin located on them may be
recorded on a Final Plat, but a Building Permit for those lots shall not be
issued until the detention/retention basin has been constructed to City of
Nicholasville specifications. A note shall be placed on the Final Plat to this
effect.
342 FEES - The following schedule shall be used by the Planning Commission to
compute the fee that shall accompany any application for a final plat.

343.1 COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS - Prior to the submission of
the final plat to the Planning Commission for approval, the Developer shall
complete all required improvements to the satisfaction of the Planning
Commission Engineer who will certify their satisfactory completion in
writing to the Planning Commission, or if such improvements have not
been fully constructed at the time of the Planning Commission's
consideration of the Final Plat, a bond to ensure completion of the
improvements may be utilized as provided in Section 343.2.
343.2 SURETY - The Developer may execute and file guarantees of
construction with the City, and with other agencies having jurisdiction, for
the installation or completion of the required improvements when
requesting approval of the final plat. The surety to the City (which may be
in an itemized form listing each individual improvement to be completed)
shall be filed in favor of the City of Nicholasville in an amount not less than
125% of the cost as the Planning Commission shall estimate and determine
to be reasonably necessary to complete all of the improvements required to
be done by the Developer (including measures to control erosion and
sedimentation, when applicable). The surety to the City may be in the form
of cash, certified check, official bank check or irrevocable letter of credit.
The surety to the City shall be executed by the Developer as principal, and
if a surety bond, shall be executed by a corporation authorized to act as a
surety under the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, as surety. The
surety to the City shall guarantee the faithful performance of any and all
work and the construction and installation of all improvements required to
be done by the Developer, together with all engineering and inspection
costs and fees incurred by the City. The surety to the City shall establish a
completion date, after which should the Developer fail to complete all work
and improvements required to be done, the City shall cause all required
work to be done and improvements completed. The parties executing the
surety to the City shall be firmly bound for the payment of all necessary
costs therefor. Whenever the Developer elects to utilize surety, the City
shall be authorized, in the event of any default on the part of the developer
or the performance of any work or construction of any improvements for
which surety has been deposited, to cause the required work to be done and
to withdraw that amount required for payment of all cost therefor. The
surety to the City shall be filed with the Nicholasville Planning
Commission. Additional bonds to other agencies having jurisdiction over
required improvements may be necessary.
49
343.21 - The surety to the City shall be renewed ten (10) working days
prior to the expiration date. In the event that the developer fails to do
so, the City shall be authorized to withdraw the full amount without
further notice to said developer or any other person.
343.22 - Any developer who files surety with the City shall sign a
statement that he has read and understands Section 343 and all
subsections thereunder, and that he will abide by its terms. The
developer must further acknowledge in writing that he is aware of the
expiration date of the surety and that he will not attempt to hold the
Nicholasville Planning Commission or the City of Nicholasville, nor any
employees of either liable for any damages which may result from the
strict enforcement of Section 343 and all subsections thereunder.
(Adopted: 07-02-09 Ordinance 752-2009)
(Adopted: 06-20-2013 Ordinance 876-2013)
343.3 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF IMPROVEMENTS - The
Developer shall be responsible for the maintenance and repair of the
improvements installed. The Developer shall be responsible for any
damage done to the improvements by construction traffic, local traffic, or
by any other means and shall insure the accessibility to all occupied lots
until final acceptance for maintenance by the City. Upon completion of
work and before public acceptance, the Developer shall clean up all ground
occupied or affected in connection with the work. Failure to maintain and
repair improvements may result in withholding approval of subsequent
units of the subdivision or the billing of the developer for such service
performed by the City. Payment shall be guaranteed by surety.
(Adopted: 06-20-2013 Ordinance 877-2013)
343.4 LIABILITY INSURANCE - The Developer shall furnish such
insurance as deemed necessary by the Planning Commission which shall
indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all liability arising
from any conditions which may result from the construction or installation
of improvements. The insurance shall be of such as determined by the
Commission but in no case shall be allowed to expire earlier than one year
from the date that construction of improvements is accepted for
maintenance by the City. A copy of the insurance policy shall be filed with
the Nicholasville Planning Commission.
50
344 ACCEPTANCE AND DEDICATION OF IMPROVEMENTS - The surety, as
hereinbefore required by the City of Nicholasville, may be released by the City
Commission in whole or in part, only with the recommendation of the Planning
Commission that the City of Nicholasville accept the dedication of the streets,
improvements and other public grounds in the Subdivision in question, in accordance
with one of the following methods:
A. A full release may be obtained only after all improvements have been
properly installed in the subdivision; or
B. A partial release may be obtained, as requested by the developer, as the
subdivision improvements are satisfactorily completed. Two reductions
in the amount of the surety will be permitted. However, the surety will
not be reduced to less than 25 percent of its original value. No
reduction will be granted after a completion date has passed, and no
reduction will alter the original completion or termination date of the
surety. A fee may be charged by the Planning Commission for each
reduction to cover inspection and clerical record keeping costs.
The Planning Commission shall make such a recommendation after it has received
a report from the Planning Commission Engineer or other authorized person that
the improvements have been properly installed, that the subdivision plat has been
approved, and that all requirements of these Subdivision Regulations have been
met.

ARTICLE 4
ENFORCEMENT
400 PURPOSE - Chapter 100 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes enables the Planning
Commission to establish community standards for local development as well as to
establish the procedures necessary for implementing these standards within the
context of an adopted Comprehensive Plan. The Statutes also include specific
provisions for the enforcement of these Regulations and penalties for the violation
thereof. These provisions are set forth as follows:
410 PLATS OF RECORD - Much of the authority for regulating land subdivision
comes from the necessity for recording parcels of land with the County Clerk as a
condition for transfer of ownership. These conditions are set forth in KRS 100.277
cited in Section 301 of these Regulations.
411 RECORDING OF PLATS (KRS 100.344) - Recording of Plats, Variances,
Conditional Use Permits. All final plats approved by the Planning Commission
and all variances and conditional use permits approved by the Board of
Adjustments shall be recorded at the expense of the applicant in the Office of the
County Court Clerk. A copy of all Regulations and the Official Map of each
planning unit shall be filed in the Office of the County Court Clerk.
412 LAND SOLD IN VIOLATION (KRS 100.341) - Land sold in violation of acts;
plats filed; effect. When it has been discovered that land has been sold or
transferred, or that a contract has been entered into for the sale or transfer of land
in violation of the provisions of this chapter pertaining to the regulation of
subdivisions, the owner or owners of record shall file plats of the land in
accordance with this chapter, the land shall be governed by the subdivision
regulations both prior to and after the platting of the land by the owner of record
as if a plat had been filed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter
pertaining to subdivision regulations.
413 UTILITY IMPROVEMENTS CONDITIONAL TO A LEGAL PUBLIC
STATUS OF THE STREET - No Board, public officer or authority shall accept,
layout, improve or authorize utilities to be laid in any street within the territory
for which the Planning Commission has adopted these Subdivision Regulations or
unless a street corresponds with a street shown on the Major Thoroughfare Plan
or equivalent; or unless a street on a Subdivision Plat or a Street Plan has been
approved by the Planning Commission.
61
420 PENALTIES - The Kentucky Revised Statutes further specify the powers and
penalties available to the Planning Commission for insuring compliance to these
Regulations.
421 ENFORCEMENT BY COMMISSION (KRS 100.337) - Commission shall
have a cause of action for all appropriate relief including injunctions against any
governmental bodies or any aggrieved person who violates this chapter or
regulations adopted hereunder.
422 WITHHOLDING BUILDING PERMITS & CERTIFICATES OF
OCCUPANCY - The Planning Commission may direct the authorized officer not
to issue building permits in the subdivision in question.
422.1 PENALTIES (KRS 100.991) - (1) Any person or entity who violates
any of the provisions of KRS 100.201 to 100.347 and 100.991 (2) or any of
the regulations adopted pursuant hereunder for which no other penalty is
provided, shall upon conviction be fined not less than ten but no more than
five hundred dollars for each conviction. Each day of violation shall
constitute a separate offense.
430 ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL - Kentucky Statutes place the authority of
enforcement with the Planning Commission. The Commission, however, may delegate
its administrative and enforcement authority to various agents responsible to it. In
other situations, it depends on other municipal or county departments for information
and advice as in the case of public utilities inspection by the City or County Engineer.
431 ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER (KRS 100.271) - Administrator of zoning
regulations, powers. An administrative official shall be designed by the city or
county to administer the zoning regulation, and, if delegated, housing or building
regulations. The Administrative Official may be designated to issue Building
Permits or Certificates of Occupancy, or both, in accordance with the literal
terms of the Regulations, but may not have the power to permit any construction,
or to permit any use or any change of use which does not conform to the literal
terms of the Zoning Regulations.
432 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY - (KRS 100.281) - Contents of Subdivision
Regulations. All Subdivision Regulations shall be based on the Comprehensive
Plan and shall contain; (1) The procedure for the submission and approval of
preliminary and final plat and the recordation of final plats. The Commission
may delegate to its secretary or any other officer or employee the power to
approve plats in accordance with the Commission's adopted requirements, but all
plats, preliminary and final, shall be approved or disapproved within ninety days.
62
433 PLANNING COMMISSION STAFF (KRS 100.173) - Employing planners or
other persons. The Planning Commission may employ a staff or contract with
planners or other persons as it deems necessary to accomplish its assigned duties
under this chapter.
440 APPEALS - State statutes also specify the course of action available to persons or
entities who disagree or claim to be injured or aggrieved by action of the Commission.
441 APPEALS FROM COMMISSION ACTION (KRS 100.347) - Appeals from
Commission or Board of Adjustment. Any Appeal from Commission action may
be taken in the following manner: (1) Any person or entity claiming to be injured
or aggrieved by any final action of the Planning Commission or Board of
Adjustments may appeal from the action to the Circuit Court of the county in
which the land lies. Such Appeal shall be taken within thirty (30) days after the
final action of the Commission or Board. Final action shall not include
Commission's recommendations made to other governmental bodies.
(2) All Appeals shall be taken in the appropriate Circuit Court within thirty (30)
days after the action or decision of the Planning Commission or Board of
Adjustments and all decisions which have not been appealed within thirty (30)
days shall become final. After the Appeal is taken, the procedure shall be
governed by the rules of civil procedure. When an Appeal has been filed, the
Clerk of the Circuit Court shall issue a summons to all parties, including the
Planning Commission in all cases, and shall cause it to be delivered for service as
in any other law action.
